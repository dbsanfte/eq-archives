<br />
62 : Zevfeer's Bite (200 point disease based DD for 200 mana, 1.5 casting time, 6.0 recast) <br />
62 : Spirit Leech (350 point lifetap for 350 mana, 2.5 cast, 30.0 recast) <br />
65 : Voice of Thule (+12% aggro buff)  ... move this to good if they fix our line to stack with the enchie line.. they actually manipulate agro in a very different way, so no reason for them to not stack<br />
<br />
think they need to look at drain soul.  these cast a lot faster, which is very nice... but not nice enough to make up for the fact that drain soul is 338 for 225 with no recast<br />
<br />
the good side:<br />
<br />
61: Festering Darkness (35 hp/tick 60% snare for 20 ticks, 100 mana 2.45 casting)  (woot!  a good snare to use for snaring stuff!  not a huge deal, but nice nonetheless)<br />
62 : Bond of Death (yes!)<br />
63 : Aura of Darkness (disease based Lower ALL of target resists by 10, increase ALL resists by 30 in group, 100 mana, 1.5 casting)  (sounds like a cool spell)<br />
63 : Aura of Hate (200 point disease based DD for 60 mana, 1.5 casting 6.0 recast) + 65 : Aura of Pain (200 point disease based based DD for 75 mana, 1.5 cast, 6.0 recast) &lt;-- worse than the level 63 spell so not done yet heh  .... these 2 obviously aren't done yet... but are basically exactly what I suggested a while back about how they should fix our DPS problem on raids<br />
63: Banish Undead (not a big deal.. but 585 for 225.. cast time of 5.5, but still a nice upgrade for expel undead)<br />
64: Invoke Death (level 49 necro pet) (this pet is badass)<br />
65: Soul Leach (400 point lifetap for 280 mana, 2.5 casting, 120.0 recast) (upgrade to quest spell..  should be useful, although dunno if I'll have the spell slots to mem it)<br />
65 : Conjure Corpse (the mini coffin one) (haha, we can actually carry coffins around!)<br />
<br />
I'm happy with these spells... bond of death and aura of hate/pain especially (just hope they play with the exact numbers on aura of hate/pain... which they almost have to)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Edit:  hehe, was thinking Engulfing's casting cost... nm that, this one's alright  :p<br />
<br />
61 : Improved Invis to Undead <br />
<br />
/yawn, not impressed...<br />
<br />
62 : Zevfeer's Bite (200 point disease based DD for 200 mana, 1.5 casting time, 6.0 recast)<br />
<br />
Not bad... weak for level 62... 200 is way weak for 60... But if they'd drop another .5 off the casting time, I would be a little more impressed... But that's a REALLY crappy mana hit... If they're trying to make us more offensive than paladins, then lower than a bit.  Please don't say we're not more offensively structured than paladins, when we run oom shortly there after.<br />
<br />
62 : Spirit Leech (350 point lifetap for 350 mana, 2.5 cast, 30.0 recast) <br />
<br />
... I think I'd stick with my 60 tap, thanks... I'm already wasting a slot with Voice of Death on raids... Long recast spells don't fit me.<br />
<br />
62 : Bond of Death <br />
<br />
That sure is a lotta mana... Maybe if we had big mana pools like necros, I'd use this more...<br />
<br />
62 : Ignite Blood <br />
<br />
Ahh... not bad.  Lotta mana yet, but still...<br />
<br />
63 : Aura of Darkness (disease based Lower ALL of target resists by 10, increase ALL resists by 30 in group, 100 mana, 1.5 casting) <br />
<br />
/cheer<br />
<br />
63 : Aura of Hate (200 point disease based DD for 60 mana, 1.5 casting 6.0 recast) <br />
<br />
This one doesn't sound too bad.  More what I'm talking about.<br />
<br />
63: Banish Undead <br />
<br />
I suppose someone, somewhere would have whined if we didn't get an upgrade to our undead nukes.... Oh well, still only use them on like 3 fights (raid encounters) ever anyways.  *shrugs*<br />
<br />
64: Lich <br />
<br />
Wow... Now those who had to pay 40k for DT will be pissed that they could get something from a friendly necro... While you're at it, back level a spell about lvl 40s for one of the early SK hp:mana spells  :)<br />
<br />
64: Invoke Death (level 49 necro pet) <br />
<br />
*chants like in Animal house*  Rogue pet! Rogue pet!  Rogue pet!  Thanks for a better pet, but our pets don't tank, they're there for damage.  I'd rather have Minion of Shadow *wink*wink*nudge*<br />
<br />
65: Soul Leach (400 point lifetap for 280 mana, 2.5 casting, 120.0 recast) <br />
<br />
Sorry... Not down with long recast taps.<br />
<br />
65 : Aura of Pain (200 point disease based based DD for 75 mana, 1.5 cast, 6.0 recast) &lt;-- worse than the level 63 spell so not done yet heh <br />
<br />
Maybe they meant 45 mana or less... In that case, I'd be really pleased  :)<br />
<br />
65 : Voice of Thule (+12% aggro buff) <br />
<br />
Make that change to 20%, then we'll talk...<br />
<br />
65 : Conjure Corpse (the mini coffin one) <br />
<br />
Glad to hear!  And about damn time too...<br />
<br />
Just my smartass comments on the above spells.  Tweak as neccessary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Konnar Azaroth</div><div class="date">09-18-2002, 02:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">aura of pain will be an ac tap and aura of hate will be a higher atk tap and nothing other... they are only wrong yet<br />
<br />
but nothing is a real upgrade.. higher levels = higher spells = higher mobs to kill .<br />
<br />
absolutey nothing will change .. who cares about an higher pet  that is needed for higher mobs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Duke Vendric Ravenkrest</div><div class="date">09-18-2002, 02:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">60: Drain Soul = 338 lifetap for 225 mana at 6.1 cast time and 0 second recast delay.<br />
62: Spirit Leach = 350 lifetap for 350 mana at 2.5 second cast time and 30.0 second recast delay.<br />
65: Soul Leach = 400 lifetap for 280 mana at 2.5 second cast time and 120.0 second recast delay.<br />
<br />
After the hybrid casting bonus (30% at level 60), this equates to:<br />
60: Drain Soul = 338 lifetap for 225 mana at 4.3 cast time and 0 second recast delay.<br />
62: Spirit Leach = 350 lifetap for 350 mana at 2.5 second cast time and 30.0 second recast delay.<br />
65: Soul Leach = 400 lifetap for 280 mana at 2.5 second cast time and 120.0 second recast delay.<br />
...since the bonus only applies to spells over 3 seconds in cast time.<br />
<br />
Now, if the casting bonus continues at 3% per level above 60, then that gives 15% more deduction of cast time on Drain Soul, making it this:<br />
60: Drain Soul = 338 lifetap for 225 mana at 3.4 cast time and 0 second recast delay.<br />
...and this doesn't include any focus effects which might speed casting.<br />
<br />
The ratios of the spells are:<br />
60: Drain Soul = 338 / 225 or 1.5 / 1<br />
62: Spirit Leach = 350 / 350 or 1 / 1<br />
65: Soul Leach = 400 / 280 or 1.4 / 1<br />
<br />
So the ratio of Drain Soul is superior. The cast time difference isn't too significant due to the casting time bonus we hybrid's have, but the recast times are extreme by comparison. If they mean Spirit and Soul Leach to be &quot;safety net&quot; spells to get us out of a jam quickly, they need to grant a truck-load more HP. Here's a little wake up call:<br />
<br />
1 - We're not going to keep 3 or 4 lifetaps loaded on top of Death Peace, Harmshield, Voice spell for aggro, Terror spell for aggro, other stat taps, nukes, self buffs...jebus...<br />
2 - 400hp is jack and sh** for safety healing. And 2.5 seconds is too slow to be a safety net. In that time I can Harmshield or Death Peace. Hell, in the time it takes for my spell gems to refresh from casting Soul Leach I could Death Peace, stand up and then Harmshield. Think about that.<br />
3 - The recast time on those spells makes them useless for what we use Drain Soul for. Even if the ratios were extremely upgraded from what they are now, a recast time of 30 or 120 would negate the standard use of these spells. I have my 15 minute refresh safety net. Thanks though.<br />
<br />
On another note:<br />
Voice of Thule (+12% aggro buff)<br />
...seems like a very small upgrade, like almost not worth it. Hope I'm wrong.<br />
<br />
And I'll leave the shite nukes alone for now, since they're obviously far from complete.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Blackeagle Dwimmerlaik</div><div class="date">09-18-2002, 02:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">also, it looks from lucy like aura of pain does something to your AC as well as being a DD... and aura of hate does something to your attack as well as being a DD</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Naraz</div><div class="date">09-18-2002, 03:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i really dont like drain soul that much cuz the cast time to long unless you get a mage ring. 4.3 cast time at 60 is to much dps loss for me hehe. if the cast time goes down by 65 though, it will rock.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
anyways lich+bod is a godly combo for solo hehe. <br />
just wonder what we will have to exp on though, stuff that we currently exp on will Turn light blue and green.<br />
if bob and ignire blood could stack other necro dots then we could be doing alot of dps on high ac mobs. decent dot+ melee+ 49 necro pet is going to be putting us way past wars hehe. im getting pet hold while i can:)...</div></div><hr />

Now I can stop looking for that godforsaken deadly temptation spell to buy for ungodly amounts of pp<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mardark</div><div class="date">09-18-2002, 04:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem is, when lifetaps are really needed, you are usually chain casting them.  Its usually when something goes terribly wrong.  If it doesn't have a fast refresh, good ratio, its not going to be wasting a slot.  <br />
<br />
We have too many spells that should be combined already.  They need to fix the current problems, before they start making more.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Medzgaleer</div><div class="date">09-18-2002, 04:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think in the end when they give the other classes their spells and whatever new &quot;discs&quot; they give the warriors that will obviously cry foul if our dps nears theirs, we will end up in approximately the same spot we are now.<br />
<br />
Also, keep in mind that these spells aren't just freebies...we have to continue to lvl yet again.<br />
<br />
Finally, don't forget that new toys are nice, but some of the fundemental aspects of our class still need repair.  Also none of these spells are a &quot;sure thing&quot; to go live and even if they do...  we all know how VI loves to swing the nerf bat.  (i.e., paladin spell that got nerfed early after the luclin expansion)<br />
<br />
<br />
just some thoughts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lejina Bloodbath</div><div class="date">09-18-2002, 04:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Overall, im impressed. For once we actually get some decent stuff.<br />
However, for the lifetaps, we definitly dont need neither want more taps that &quot;stack&quot; with Drain Soul. We just cant afford a gem for a second direct lifetap, we need a real upgrade to Drain Soul, so we unmem Drain Soul and mem the new spell instead.<br />
<br />
Make Soul Leach 400hp 250mana 6ishsec casting 0 recast and now we talk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Moongarm</div><div class="date">09-18-2002, 04:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Before you guys piss and moan about the leech series of taps look at the cast time and remeber how much easier life leech is to channel.<br />
<br />
Also look at resist adjust on them<br />
<br />
Drain soul -200<br />
Soul Leech -500<br />
<br />
hmm guess whats gonna hit easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darkenesis</div><div class="date">09-18-2002, 04:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lejina couldn't have said it better.<br />
<br />
Only way I ever use long cast spells (with the exception of Harmshield now... but mourning spell gem #7) is if it's on a raid... and even then, it's just for Voice so the warrior thinks he's taunting better  :D  Or give us more spell gems... *shrugs*<br />
<br />
VI says something to make us feel good and confident, even though it does jack shit... SKs just got that ability Sept 4th, 2002.<br />
<br />
Raise Voice of Thule to 20-25% as well.  Overpowered?  No.  Especially considering what you've given us is underpowered anyways.<br />
<br />
(How about giving us a self spell with 6 sec recast that has 30-40% hate?  Voice line sounds good on paper, but performs like a little league hockey team)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Completely agree.<br />
<br />
Also remember that tap spells are still not flagged as tap.  Bug in my opinion.  Maybe by design in Verant's opinion.  However you put it, they can't be used as &quot;quick fix me up&quot; spells.<br />
<br />
This is exactly the reason the lifetaps were unresistable before.  You have to be able to rely on a heal.  With recast times that long, resists will mean spells will probably be never memmed by me.</div></div><hr />

With all the DD, HTouch, taps and some AA points we can do some pretty hefty &quot;drain the mana&quot; damage at the same time that we're swinging our weps... pretty massive DPS counting an initial mana dump</div></div><hr />

Don't forget, this stuff is a long way from going live.  Hopefully they'll tune some of these (or change them altogether) before they go live.  Those long recast mana inefficient lifetaps will only be memmed when they give us an additional 16 spell gems (never).<br />

Necro Rogue pet?  Oh man, that would so own.  We could really solo like mofos then.  Could you imagine?  We couldn't get a group, but our pet could!!</div></div><hr />

I personally won't take those current leech line set-up. Too mana inefficient. How about Deflux lvl 54 necro spell? It has a whoppingt 3.0 sec cast time for 330 hp for just 189 mana. Ratio of 1.75 is far more efficient. 3.0 cast time will qualify for cast time reduction. Let's assume that lvl 65 has 45% reduction. 3.0 will be reduced to 1.65 seconds. That is very acceptable and FAR superior than any crappy leech line. I would be willing to forego any leech lines upgrade and live with Drain Soul all way to lvl 65 just to get deflux as our main lifetap spell. Deflux has INSTANT recast which is a winner.. Gimme Deflux! :)</div></div><hr />

Disease Cloud for aggro, chain castable!  /applaud  Johnny, tell him what he's won!<br />
<br />
Lifetaps for dmg/heals, chain castable!  /applaud  Johnny, tell him what he's won!<br />
<br />
Big lifetaps for good mana costs, that I have to wait 30 seconds to cast... Umm....  /frown<br />
<br />
I believe it's Calefaction (druid nuke) with a big recast time.... I think maybe 1-2% of the druids at that level actually use it...<br />
<br />
Big recast time in situations like Harmshield and Divine Aura are understandable, and fair.  But Harmtouch and lifetaps that aren't absolutely astounding... neh... Johnny, show this kid the door please.</div></div><hr />

<br />
61: Festering Darkness (35 hp/tick 60% snare for 20 ticks, 100 mana 2.45 casting) )I will use this as a snare and when fear kiting.  Seems like a good deal. <br />
<br />
61 : Improved Invis to Undead  Any place worth having a long lasting undead invis the undead see through it anyhow <br />
<br />
62 : Zevfeer's Bite (200 point disease based DD for 200 mana, 1.5 casting time, 6.0 recast)  This thing better have some serious agro and disease counters because it sure is a mana pig <br />
<br />
62 : Spirit Leech (350 point lifetap for 350 mana, 2.5 cast, 30.0 recast)  Useless for the reasons mentioned before.  If a spell has a 30 second recast and a 1/1 mana ratio it better have an instant cast time <br />
<br />
62 : Bond of Death  Good Stuff <br />
<br />
62 : Ignite Blood  I like this one too <br />
<br />
63 : Aura of Darkness (disease based Lower ALL of target resists by 10, increase ALL resists by 30 in group, 100 mana, 1.5 casting)  Unless this stacks with EVERYTHING, its completely useless.  If it does stack, then this is a step in the right direction <br />
<br />
63 : Aura of Hate (200 point disease based DD for 60 mana, 1.5 casting 6.0 recast)  Perfect if it has a high hate component and lowered fizzle rate.  This would become my taut workhorse. <br />
<br />
63: Banish Undead  This line is crap for a hybrid, always has been due to lengthy cast time.  Remake it for Paladins and SKs with lower cast time and higher recast and it may be worth using. <br />
<br />
64: Lich  Handy, especially with BOD. I agree that there should be some weaker spells in the Lich line retroed in for lower level SKs. <br />
<br />
64: Invoke Death (level 49 necro pet)  By the time we get this, the pet is little more than a speedbump for the mob to get you a 1 second head start when you run for the zone. A pet of this level wont even hit mobs you XP off of at this level.<br />
<br />
65: Soul Leach (400 point lifetap for 280 mana, 2.5 casting, 120.0 recast)  2 minute recast on a spell that isn't even powerful enough to restore 10% of even the average level _60_ Sks max hp is ludicrous.  Mana ratio is good for the level if it were chainable like the 60 Tap.  Otherwise keep the ratio and scale it up to tap 1k.  Only then could I see memming this spell with its current recast. <br />
<br />
65 : Aura of Pain (200 point disease based based DD for 75 mana, 1.5 cast, 6.0 recast) &lt;-- worse than the level 63 spell so not done yet heh  If it has less fizzle and more hate than the level 63 spell, then its done and I would use it. <br />
<br />
65 : Voice of Thule (+12% aggro buff)  Craptastic <br />
<br />
65 : Conjure Corpse (the mini coffin one)  Outstanding, but level 65 is kinda high. Not going to argue though. <br />
<br />
Overall, Extensions on existing lines.  The only new spells we seem to get is the Disease DD line which I am hoping is an uber Disease Cloud replacement, and the resist tap spell which fate rests on wether it stacks or not..  Mana rich SKs will use some of these, but I expect most people to stick to the lower level spells.  Those of us with large mana pools not soloing at break neck pace will add a couple of the spells to our lineup.  Unfortunately I am seeing a lot of things that should have existed 50-60 as our 61-65 lineup.  Aura of Darkness, if done right, is the best direction they could take us.  A little more SK only line and for the love of hate balance the mana and recast on those taps for chain cast in mele.<br />
<br />
Some things I would have liked to see:<br />
Deaths Peace upgrade at 65 (Faster cast/Recast or guarenteed memwipe)<br />
Fear Line upgrade<br />
Improved Invisibilty<br />
Combined Mana/HP proc tap buff worth casting<br />
SK only pet not too powerful but able to mele dark blues.<br />
Group Bobbing Corpse<br />
Stackable 5% slow, unstackable 25% slow<br />
Fear Upgrade, Torrent Upgrade<br />
<br />
Its like they upgraded things we dont care about and left our bread and butter untouched.</div></div><hr />

The only suggestion I would say needs to be made is to increase festering to a 4.0 cast and let our natural spell haste make it faster so its to 2.68 at 61 down to 2.2 at 65</div></div><hr />

61 : Improved Invis to Undead <br />
<br />
Agree with the others on festering darkness...lasts just long enough.  90 seconds kept being just short enough to run out when the mob ran.  120 (crosses fingers) should be right....frankly, I'd prefer 150 or 180, but i'll certainly use this as my new mainstay darkness line.<br />
Improved invis to undead:  shrug.  Complaints as to the utility of this spell are level design issues rather than anything important.<br />

Zevfeer's bite: This is a proc buff, right?  That soul abrasion makes turn into 400 damage? right? right?  Sigh....<br />
<br />
spirit leech:  first off, like brael said, if it's not 2.0 or less, bump it up to 4.0....;)  Second, mana inefficiency is fine for a long recast spell.  IT'S THE DAMAGE NUMBER THAT MAKES NO SENSE.  This should be around 500-600 for 500-600 mana.<br />
<br />
Bond of Death:  Soloing spell.<br />
<br />
ignite blood:  Um, When's the last time any of you has used your dots?  for a reason that isn't aggro?

Well, I think most people would tend to take info gathered from Castersrealm with a large grain of salt. Not sure how they came up with the effect on Zevfeer's bite, but its not bad by what they say...though I would -much- prefer that they regen component was a group buff (as Lucy shows).</div></div><hr />

<br />
This looks good if you use Dooming Darkness a lot.  I do sometimes.  I also use Cascading Darkness on raids.  Will still use Cascading on raids, I think.  Wil definitely replace Dooming with this.<br />
<br />
61 : Improved Invis to Undead<br />
<br />
This is completely useless unless they will have a lot of high level content in PoP that cannot see through this.<br />
<br />
62 : Zevfeer's Bite (200 point disease based DD for 200 mana, 1.5 casting time, 6.0 recast)<br />
<br />
According to Lucy, this is a group life tap.  Hard to resist disease based.  Can heal 6 people for 200 mana for 1200 hp combined.  <br />
<br />
Would be far more usefull if it did 400 HP for 400 mana or something close to that.  200 hp every 7.5 seconds will not let your group survive AEs for too long.  AEs are normally 400 HP every 12 seconds.<br />
<br />
This is part of making SK raid friendly I guess.  I'd think needs improvement.<br />
<br />
62 : Spirit Leech (350 point lifetap for 350 mana, 2.5 cast, 30.0 recast)<br />
<br />
Lucy shows a resource attached to this that does not make much sense.  Probably an unfinished spell.  If recourse does something good, this might be a good spell.<br />
<br />
62 : Bond of Death<br />
<br />
Not bad.<br />
<br />
62 : Ignite Blood<br />
<br />
Not bad.  I always have BB memmed and use it on raids all the time. Boil Blood stacks with higher level necro fire DOTs.  If IB also stacks with necro line then this will replace my BB.<br />
<br />
63 : Aura of Darkness (disease based Lower ALL of target resists by 10, increase ALL resists by 30 in group, 100 mana, 1.5 casting)<br />
<br />
This could be a very good spell if implemented right.  Currently has a resist adjust of -50 only.  Needs to be lower.  With current resist changes spells don't easily land and no one ever debuffs disease.<br />
<br />
If resists will be dealt with this will be one thing one SK would be always wanted for.<br />
<br />
This is part of raid usefullness line up.<br />
<br />
63 : Aura of Hate (200 point disease based DD for 60 mana, 1.5 casting 6.0 recast)<br />
<br />
This spell does not seem finished.  If it taps high amount of ATK, this will be usefull.  200 DD is a bonus.<br />
<br />
63: Banish Undead<br />
<br />
Useless.<br />
<br />
64: Lich<br />
<br />
Not bad.<br />
<br />
64: Invoke Death (level 49 necro pet)<br />
<br />
Will have as many uses as our current pet.  Almost none.  Soloing spell.<br />
<br />
65: Soul Leech (400 point lifetap for 280 mana, 2.5 casting, 120.0 recast)<br />

<br />
ignite blood should be very helpful too<br />

overall, these spells rock, they've restored *some* of my faith in VI<br />
<br />
let's hope that our offensive skillcaps go up 1 or 2 points per level<br />
<br />
and improved FD?  death peace will be 5 levels below where it is now... which means FAR fewer fizzles and MUCH easier to channel.  there's your improvement right there<br />
<br />
same applies to some of our other 60 spells, namely drain soul.  I don't see myself ever memming any of the other taps in their current form.  the only SK spell missing from my spellbook is the level 49 quest one... and I could have had it long ago if i thought it was at all useful.  long recast time is perfectly acceptable on quite a few types of spells, but not on a lifetap</div></div><hr />

<br />
If it has a tap feature in it... won't the drain stay on the mob?<br />
<br />
Basically, what should NOT happen is you cast it inbetween a swing... You do 200 damage, mob is tapped 100atk, your group gets 100atk.  Few swings later, you go to cast it again... Doesn't stick, damage doesn't hit.  The drain effect is already on him.<br />
<br />
In that case, the spell won't be near as great as we thought...  Any drains or taps that are on the spell need to be able to over write itself.</div></div><hr />

Since SoV my max hitpoints have nearly doubled.  Youd think our spells would keep up proportionately, but im sorry Soul Leach (Hi make up a new name for your spells) doing 400 is not a meaningful upgrade from drain souls 338.<br />
<br />
     Why the  neg 500 resist check would please anyone is beyond me also.  Till last patch our taps and torrents were unresistable vs all but magic and disease immune mobs, sorry getting a *new* spell that is just like my old spells doesnt thrill me.<br />
<br />
     And what in gods name is with the recast delays?? if Soul leach is gonna have a 2 min refresh it needs to do more like 800 damage yeesh.   I do a ton of damage chain nuking with drain soul in uber mob fights, so you can be sure i wont opt to use spells that have 30 sec and 2 min recast delays<br />

<br />
I think if you cast the same drain tap it will overwrite the previous version, like renewing a DoT, so it will stick. I can't recall casting ToH twice and having the second saying &quot;your spell did not take hold&quot;.<br />
<br />
About BoD and ZB. If it turns out that ZB does indeed heal you and your group for 720dmg in 9 ticks, and for only 200 mana, I can't see a reason to have BoD. BoD costs twice as much mana, takes 3 times as long to cast (unadjusted) and heals for the same amount. If they stacked it might be ok, but I think having them both mem'd to be used would be rare. Would rather BoD be replaced with something else if ZB is a group lifetap DoT.</div></div><hr />

I will never have those new leech spells in my line up.  The recast is absolutely moronic.  They should be the same as our previous life tap line and not like our quest spell at all.  How many people use the old quest spell at level 60.  NONE.  WHY! Because of the recast time.  End of story.  Bye bye now take care. <br />
<br />
If you want to make them viable spells make them the same as the original life tap series.  450 life tap for 300 mana chaincastable spell for level 65 would be a good spell for us.  VI Took our SoP and SV spells and now they need to GIVE GIVE GIVE us something really good because im ticked off.  They totally changed the entire role definition of our class over night with out warning and with out need or reason and now they have alot to answer for.  I was perfectly happy with my sk before and I knew I could get groups because of my hate control.  NOW what to we have! I never used SV and SoP for the stat drains but for the aggro. Was nice to have a bit of extra ac with it but it was the only reason i used those spells.  ALL of those stat buff spells and group stat buff spells are USELESS and dont find their way to my spell lineup.  We have too many other useful spells to have up.  Stop giving us absolutely useless spells and give us some raid viability and bring back our SV and SoP spells.  Tap haste spell is an excellent idea for a spell for us. How about a combination spell that snares, fears and dots.  How about some control over undead. How about an AE aggro spell for us. How about upgrade to diamond skin.  How about some line of Terror spell that mez stuns a mob for say 20 seconds or something.  How about some decent buffs or haste spell.</div></div><hr />

To those that are going to say: &quot;but it saved my ass more times than I can count!&quot; <br />
If I am grouped I have a healer if I am soloing I don't wait until a succesful lifetap means life or death for me. <br />
I am all about mana efficiency so I avoid these mana hogs like the plague.<br />
If you are such in bad shape with only one bub of life left very quicly maybe the mob you are fighting it's not worth the downtime, if it's a adds that are beating on you don't waste your mana, feign.<br />

Feign death is your friend :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ueuelr</div><div class="date">09-23-2002, 10:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In regards to Life Leech you have to remember that at low 50's a 270 lifetap is quite powerfull compared to the other lifetap you get (75HP if I rmember corectly). Sure it takes a while to refresh, but you only need it every now and then, when you get an over pull and need to buy some time before the Crowd Control happens. It means the difference between life and death if you can hold the mobs off a little longer before the CH and mez hit. Casting FD in that situation will either get others in the group killed if successful or get you killed if you fail (FD has long recast as well). It did great for me while exping in Seb and other dungeons. If you're more of a solo type, or don't tank a lot in dungeons then yes, 3k might seem like a lot for a spell. Selling a Lammy for 5k can make it look like a bargain tho!<br />
<br />
However at 60 Life Leech is not as useful. And the difference in Power of the new Leech spells compared to Drain Soul is not big enough to warant a slot. Compare 270 to 75 vs 400 to 338. I think the Soul Leech should be around 700 HP at least, then I would consider it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And wouldn't making those hate spells disease based be kind of pointless since they made disease counters have almost no hate??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Belyle</div><div class="date">09-30-2002, 11:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to say i dont think VI has a developer that acutally plays a sk on end game raids.<br />
<br />
Darkness - nice spell, what id like is a low resist snare to augment FD pulling.  In the end game darkness never lands without tash and malo.<br />
<br />
New pet - If your not a 60 necro or epic mage you get slapped twice for trying to use a pet and dont do it again.  Their dps doesnt justify the lag or the extra pushing around of the mob.<br />
<br />
Lich, Zevfeer's and BoD - nice for soloing, end game raid will never use.  If more buff slots was a aa option would be first thing i go for.<br />
<br />
Ignite Blood - Wont have a permanet spot in a spell gem.  But i like it.<br />
<br />
Aura of darkness - Once again i dont have extra buff slots. dont use grm or circle of seasons not gonna use this.  Id rather have half a malo just strait up neg 30 to targets resists.  When resists are necessary i have no problem getting any of them in the 250 to 300 range without this spell.<br />
<br />
New lifetap DD's - recast time is this a joke ? VI nerfs the resists on current taps. lets take something away and give em something half ass back.  Your gonna have to nerf drain soul alittle more before ill consider using these.<br />
<br />
Aura of Pain and Hate - Nice spells, but for end game i cant see it sticking, just like torrent spells are now after nerf...when we need it most.  Why cant these be unresistable ?<br />
<br />
Honestly, there is no way developers play sks on end game raids.  If ya did you woulda had people screaming at you for putting useless crap in their buff slots (torrent of hate is only one i use for this reason ).  And you certainly wouldnt have been overwriting hp atk buffs with bond of death and zevfeers.</div></div><hr />
