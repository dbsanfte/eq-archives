I've got the key, but I don't feel like being careless and just zoning in to see if anyone else is in there.  Can you get out easily? Or do you require other means, such as the gate hammer, or a gate potion to get out?  I know people say that Dru is camped a lot and the mirror usually rots, so how easy would it be to slip in there, wait for it to drop, and get out?  Another option would be to wait at the zone in for a group to go in, I suppose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jentriken Aspenbark</div><div class="date">05-02-2002, 05:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well, there's a few light blue mobs at the zone in, to 60s anyways. blue or higher if your lower lvl. usually a combination onf undead and sperm, so you can't invis your way in. only rogues can really get in safely alone, most other people usually take a group.<br />
<br />
2. you NEED a way to get out. gate pot, evacer, hammer, whatever. i don't know if there's a zone out, but i've personally never seen it.<br />
<br />
3. Drusella is a 2 day spawn. you may be pretty bored if your waiting for someone to gank her<br />
<br />
i haven't done this part myself, but i've exped in HS, and that's some advice from my experience. hope it helps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarkWyld</div><div class="date">05-03-2002, 06:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are actually 2 points for zone out, but they are in the south and east wings.  You will pass the one in the South, then pass Drusella spawn point to get to the one in the East.  But to even get that far, you either need the key from the West, which in turn needs a key from the North (both no rent), OR take a rogue with you that has Pick Locks 201+.  Best bet, take and person with evac with you.<br />
<br />
As you can see, getting to Drusella is not easy, so you will not be waiting for someone to call you to come get it.  On the other hand, if you know someone who is going there, tell them to grab it because this can be MQ'd.</div></div><hr />

I've must of missed it somewhere...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slarsh_Erifelacs</div><div class="date">05-06-2002, 12:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Now, from what I've gathered from information from others and such is that there are actually 5 zone-outs.  There is one in each of the four wings and one under the zone-in in case you fall in one of the pit traps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarkWyld</div><div class="date">05-06-2002, 06:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Slarsh, you may be correct.  My map has the ones in North and West listed as &quot;return to zone-in&quot; points.  This may be wrong, not sure.<br />
<br />
And also from the information in my guide, the keys WITHIN Charassis are all NO RENT.  So it's best to bring a 51+ Rogue to get through the doors in the south instead of going through collection of the keys in north and west.  I hope I am wrong, Googaba, but you may find your keys no longer exist.<br />
<br />
As far as the key to Drusella, I am guessing you are asking about the key that allows you into the east wing.  My info shows it as ground spawn in the 1st West Room of the South Wing, item know as &quot;Coin Depicting Innoruuk&quot;.  Not sure the exact /loc of the room, but from the pit room, head through the southwest door, and it will be the first door south in this passage.  After you get into the East Wing, no other keys are required (no keys required anyway, if you have Rogue with 201+ lockpick skill).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">googaba da troll</div><div class="date">05-06-2002, 10:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are ways to keep no rent items ..........  :D <br />
<br />
The room to Dru herself is locked.  I dont always have a rogue available, so I was hoping a key was available. Besides it's more fun duo'ing with a shammie :) We've duo'd all of HS except Dru and want to (die) try her</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarkWyld</div><div class="date">05-06-2002, 11:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Having not gone after Drusella as yet, I cannot claim the truth of everything in the guide I have available.  It does not show Drusella door as locked, nor does it mention where the key would be found, though it seems complete with all the spawn points through to the east wing exit mapped out.<br />
<br />
I do know of at least one way to hold onto No Rent items, but seems like a lot of trouble to go to unless you are assured of continuing adventure until Drusella is dead. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">googaba da troll</div><div class="date">05-07-2002, 02:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My Bad...I mean the door that leaves Drusellas room towards the portal.  That one is locked.  Would like to head to the portal instead of fighting back out.  <br />
<br />
Me and a shammie friend like to duo there for AAEXP, so keeping the keys is advantagous to us, and really is not very much trouble to do it, maybe an extra 5 mins.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ueuelr</div><div class="date">05-07-2002, 09:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm, do I smell another nerf comming ;).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Skek</div><div class="date">05-16-2002, 07:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Charasis or Howling stones as it's more commonly called is one of my fave zones.  LOL in fact I spent so much time in here, i was non kos in mistmoore by the time I got to that bit in the greenmist quest.  There's another way to east wing if you can't get a hold of a rogue, and don't have hours available to get all the keys.  It basically revolves round call of hero and grav flux.  <br />
<br />
Pull the 2 golems and wanderer from the east wing door.  lev your mage and get your grav fluxer to duel him.... mage then runs to east door easily since he now has altitude and call of hero's the rest of the group up.  Camp to reset duel, and voila... easy access to east.<br />
<br />
The other downside to HS (apart from needing a porter or gate potion to get out) is that just about every undead mob harm touches.   This can really sting if you're pulling, so be careful.  It's also easy to get lots of mobs at once if you're not careful, so having a very good chanter or a couple of ae happy wizzies will keep you on top of the zone.<br />
<br />
This zone in my opinion is the best xp in the game if you can get in to south or east wings.  Whilst the new cazic thule gives more xp per mob, you can't kill huge quantities in there like you can in HS.  The mobs here have realistic hp, as opposed to the vastly inflated ooo lets give that moss snake 50000 hp cuz this is an expansion type of mentality that the game is rapidly becoming... he heh but thats another rant.<br />
<br />
Good luck with the mirror piece, and avoid the carpets :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tyrrax</div><div class="date">05-22-2002, 02:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What kind of group would you need to take Drusella?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Skek</div><div class="date">05-25-2002, 12:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Usual Sort of Group...<br />
<br />
SK - You... as main tank if you're 55+ with good armor.<br />
Monk (Very tricky pull to get without loads of adds + monk does great damage.)<br />
Cleric<br />
Chanter (handle the adds)<br />
Rogue to get you in there past the doors.<br />
a.n.other... I like dr00ds for their great multitasking abilities, plus being able to get you out at the end of the day.  May need to replace this spot with a warrior if SK not up to tanking.<br />
<br />
Other people will prolly have other ideas, but this is my recommendation.</div></div><hr />
