<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Saibot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Around what level would it be feasible to start soloing the entrance of Hate for drakes?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Neric Ikolis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The drakes are pretty nasty.  Immune to pretty much all our spells and a good amount of dps.  Not tried it but think it would be tough for me at 60, so I'd say you'd have to be above 60.  Depends on gear too, maybe you'd need to be 62+?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Messer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">First drake you fight solo will most likely dispell your crack and hitpoint buffs which pretty much kills a SK's effectiveness.<br />
<br />
As someone who spent nearly a full year in Hate killing 400+ drakes, it would never cross my mind that I would be able to solo.  Probably could survive one fight with one drake, but I'd have 250 hitpoints left and no mana.  Not very efficient.<br />
<br />
When hunting for the most rare item in all of EQ, would you rather kill 60+ mobs an hour in a group or 3-6 per hour solo?  After 400 drakes dead, I know which one I'd pick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Twink</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I bot my shm there for heals, need 1 heal every 10 mobs or so, but it depend on your gear mate, i have 2k ac wich helps alot and all defensive aa's.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Blasphemar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">with elemental and vt gear you can solo entrance rather effectivly at 65 when in mellee range they don't have much in the way of resists. i proably got 60 or so of my drakes that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gargar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Never been to hate, tho i have a Wizzy buddy in the guild thats been plenty. <br />
<br />
What level  *group* would i need to hang at the ent? The wiz is 64 and groups with similar levels in hate, so his perception is a bit skewed towards higher level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Stugein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If the group knows what they are doing I wouldn't worry about it being too terribly high.  My regular (fsvo &quot;regular&quot;) Hate group consists of myself (55 SK), a 51 CLR, 52 PAL and anyone else who tags along (rarely is anyone in our group 60+).  Your 57 - if you can get a similarly averaged level group, you'll be just fine.<br />
<br />
Also, FYI, the exp isn't too shabby in the mid-50's either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gargar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">OUTSTANDING... thats exactly the info i was looking for..  thanks a ton..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ganodoar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Aye that group would do fine Gargar. The reason I prefer a 60+ group is of course having a higher kill rate. When it comes to those drakes you want to have a high kill rate since high kill rate= more chances for drakes= more chances for a hide= One Happy Gargar :p</div></div><hr />
