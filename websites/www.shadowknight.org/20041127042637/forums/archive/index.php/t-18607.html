<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>petras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a druid who is level 58, my question is where should we go hunt? He said PoN, he can charm the tress etc, and all I need to do is get a few good whacks in :P, any other spots?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gaklaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">PoN sounds best to me you could try chardok etc but it is much better to duo with a shammy or something that can slow because kiting isnt the most reliable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Koldariah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">In my experience, PoN is pretty nasty for a 58 druid to start with. They dont have a 'fast' heal and those mobs hit pretty hard, add to that the fact that charm is highly unreliable at that level and just 'charm - soloing' takes alot of mana. Unless you have a whole shitload of hp and he has the mana pool from hell, I can't see charming a mob and healing at the same time... <br />
<br />
Try the lower-levels in PoJ (if you want planes), I believe that the rats can be charmed also - don't quote me on that..but he shouldnt have a challenge healing in there at all (depending on your hp of course) rats stop adding around 55 on first floor and higher as you get lower so keep that in mind when your deciding where to hunt.<br />
<br />
If you have decent hp you could also dou in Velks or Veksar (as long as you dont go too deep). The main thing to keep in mind with a 58 druid is that the best heal he has is 10 second cast and around 2khp and the fastest one is around 5 - 6 seconds (for somewhere around 400hp iirc) depending on focus items - you could have your ass handed to you a few times if his timing is off and you dont have a tap ready.<br />
<br />
Been a while since I played a 58 druid, so my memmory may be a bit foggy :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zzketza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I partner with a 60 druid often, we have done so for many months.  At your level a decent place to consider duoing is Torgiran Mines around the bridge.  You can single pull Bloodguards, both stacking dots on it like mad, then when it hits your camp fire off a short fear (not Invoke Fear), rinse and repeat.  When your Darkness wears off (you did pull with darkness right?), just have your druid handle the resnare.  Play yo-yo fear kiting with the guards and you can make some decent exp for the pair of you.<br />
<br />
The Bloodguards hit for around 150, but as long as you keep that fear cycling up and them snared to avoid friends joining in, you should do just fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>petras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">heh, well all I can say..PoN works amazing..He does everything I just leech exp :(, he kills the trees and ravens...his charm seems to never get resisted...His kiting is working really well, so really..he doens't need a mana pool from hell ;), he's avg'ing 1/2 a blue per cycle when hes soloing them..one cycle is 6 mins I belive.</div></div><hr />
