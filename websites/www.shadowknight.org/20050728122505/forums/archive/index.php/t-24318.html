Frankly, I think it sucks, especially since they never consulted the players about it before making any decisions. &quot;We hope that by merging some of our lower population servers with a higher population server, we will continue to enhance your gameplay experience&quot; indeed. How about asking us first?<br />
<br />
More than anything I'm pissed about them picking an older server and removing our name instead of merging some newer server with us and keeping the older name. Not really something to be way upset about in the long run perhaps, but I'm not happy about it atm.<br />
<br />
Merge us with some other low-pop server if you must, just let us keep our name.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Krassus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sol Ro sucks american wise, we have whiny babies and crappy players for the most part spread VERY thing into 3 guilds. No guilds being anywhere past Msha's in Qvic says a lot ............. (American Wise) I and pretty much all other American players are very much looking forward to this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kelefane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Krass is right -- American guilds on Solusek Ro have a long history of failure and are stuck in content atm that American guilds on other servers find trivial.<br />
<br />
It does say alot that no American guild in the history of Solusek Ro hasnt been much further then Mshas in Qvic and not long ago (2 months maybe?) No American guild even touched Qvic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Silvershadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I can't speak much for the american side of things, being euro, but we're pretty happy with things as they are on Sol Ro. Two sides to every story as always :)<br />
<br />
I don't really mind having more people around, tho I'm interested in seeing what the competition for spawns will be like on BB. Mostly I think I just worry about people becoming fed up and leaving, but we will see. It's going to happen no matter what we think anyway ;P<br />
<br />
Isn't BB the server run by the infamous dead hamster or whatever btw? (ie, constant crashes - Sol Ro has been pretty stable imho, your mileage may vary)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, it was nicknamed BristleBroke server cuz of its history of instablity. Be prepared to strengthen your hatred toward BBroke server! :D But, it is pretty stable for long time now especially after EQ2/WOW were released that reduced BB from overpopulated to underpopulated server. BBroke server usually got unstabled every big expansion cuz lot of ppls came back and try it out that overcrowded BB. DON expansion came, BBroke was still stable. Whew. :) I just hope that the merge of BB+Sol Ro won't make BB server overcrowded all over again.<br />
<br />
BTW, I need to see PST-based guild in existence heh that raids after 9 pm or 10 pm EST til 2 am EST not 6 pm EST, pfft. I know that I live in EST zone but I play late cuz of my wife/kids going to bed and I'm left alone to play heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kelefane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Does BB Average 100+ in PoK during Prime time Nocifer? SolRo average's i'd guess 60ish during prime time and the early mornings its low low low...Like 25 or so in PoK. What about bazaar vendors? We average about 160ish or so.<br />
<br />
Are alot of zones usually vacant? I know nobody XPs in KT anymore on Solro and RSS usually has 6-12 people in it during the late night hours and MPG 15-20ish or so and WoS about that same amount.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I can't say but I know is that bazaar usually close to 400ish people during nights. It used to cap out before EQ2/WOW came out.<br />
<br />
I played EQ1 maybe 15% of the time cuz my guild got downsized severly and became non-raidable after EQ2 came out and I sure wanted to play EQ1 more often (Miss it already) and keep it at maybe 50% split between EQ1/EQ2. Cuz of this, I haven't gone to POK since EQ2's release. But from what I saw is that the feeling is much more roomy in BB than before with probably right amount of people in balance. Not too sparse, not too crowdy. I actually like that. ;) I like BB in its current state. I don't know why BB needed to be merged once again that might prompt it to be BBroke part 2. <br />
<br />
But in other ways, it gets harder to have pick up groups than before. The merge might make pick-up groups easier again and strengthen some existing guilds who survived during the mass exodus.<br />
<br />
Heck, BB split TWICE. Now its going to be merged? Funny, isn't it? Wait a min.. Did BB split occurred when Sol Ro new server came in play? Did Sol Ro branch off BB during the split?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Elkar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">As far as hardware goes, there probably is no telling which portions of which servers will be merged together.  I'd imagine a plan to take the best hardware from both to make the best possible new serverset.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kelefane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have no idea why they chose Bristlebane and Solusek Ro of all servers to merge...Has to be a reason behind that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Amped</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I play on Kane Bayle. I have played on Kane Bayle for almost 2 years. I am not really old school, but I remember when we had high end guilds and people that played when i play. It is a Euro server, but the majority of the population is American. So the hours that people play are largely normal. However, we must rank among the lowest population out there if they are merging us. We have been bitching for a LONG time and they listened. The only problem i see is that I don't see anything about Antonius Bayle... maybe they are in the same boat as us.  I hope they DO have a larger population, and i hope thay DO have a large range of players. It will make finding groups not take 3-4 hours. It will make doing higher end things easier. Guilds will fill up, fun will ensue. If people leave because they wanna be pissy, fuck 'em. More loot for me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Solusek Ro is one of the oldest servers, Bristlebane also afaik - so no, we did not come from a split off BB to the best of my knowledge. Sol Ro has had at least one split of its own in its days, and we've never been considered low-pop until more recently. Bazaar used to be maxed traders not that long ago...<br />
<br />
Kelefane, this is what Brenlo said about it:<br />

<br />
this server is way to empty for the 60+ cround, i mean wos, mpg and rs are empty half the time unless people raiding</div></div><hr />

<br />
Same here noc... I'm PST and typically play after 9PM and there doesn't appear to be any guilds raiding anywhere near that time frame.  AO, which took a BIG hit from WoW/EQ2, raids in the early morning and I think Fu and CoL raid early evening/afternoon.<br />
<br />
Also, I wouldn't say that we are underpopulated by any means... WoS is farmed to death around the clock (was there last night 'till 2AM PST and the east camp, cubby, caves and SW1-3 were all camped to the point of there being no mobs to pull)...I guess more players will = more groups, but we need more zones to hunt in (the XP in WoS is horrible, but is far better then any other zone atm).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Silvershadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">(the XP in WoS is horrible, but is far better then any other zone atm).<br />
<br />
Say what? Go to MPG or RCoD, even RSS if you are so inclined... Plane of Fire is still great... DoN is rumoured to have great exp also, can't say anything on that as I don't have it yet.<br />
<br />
The only thing WoS has on those places is that it's easier. On Sol Ro it's usually very undercamped in favour of better places.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Then your tanks are far better on Sol Ro, 'cause I can't tank MPG or RSS...I can handle RCoD, but no one goes there on BB.  Oh, and I'm not flagged for PoF or any EP zone and probably won't be any time soon and those that are flagged either group within their own guilds or get pick-up groups in WoS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Naraz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">most lower end people on morden stay 65 for best aa from wos and sol ro lol<br />
<br />
can't blame em though at 65, aa is pretty good there and the're hardly any groups for anything past that:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Terrorblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Sad part about Sol Ro, it has been split I think three times in the past.  If they wanted to merge us, at least put us back together first.<br />
<br />
My guild on Sol Ro is completely dead, they went to WoW, and well wow is just too easy, raid content =10 people? that's only 2 groups, where's the challenge?  I don't even want to attempt EQ2, mainly because I still like to have time to go outside an see stuff.<br />
<br />
With that in mind, I am happy that a merger is taking place, although I think a /movelog is going to be my route.  Not that I don't like the idea of bristlebane.  What I need is a vt/ssra teir 1-3 pop level guild who raids activly.  Sounds to me like BB is not that.</div></div><hr />
