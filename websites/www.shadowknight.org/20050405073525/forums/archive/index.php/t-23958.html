I have access to sol ro, I am 5 kills away from EP with the guild being 1 kill away from EP access<br />
<br />
Very little budget, as i refuse to buy plat and and hate farming, most plat ive ever had at one time would be 13k =P<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>DrayMay</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">With a solid group you could farm the mobs in Sol Ro for ornate molds. They are rare but I have seen Legs, Gaunts and Arms drop in there off trash mobs.  While in there you will make ok cash towards buyable upgrades.<br />
<br />
As for some quick upgrades:<br />
Replace those boots... Boots of Slaughter (28AC) <br />
Shoulders... Kylong Darkmail Pauldrons (18AC)<br />
Face... Kylong Darkmail Visor (15AC)<br />
Bracer... sell that bracer of quickness and replace with cultural or Rock-Molded Wristguard (30AC)<br />
<br />
Magentic is somewhat pricy but really nice upgrades for Arms, legs, helm slots.<br />

Oh yeah, you can then just go ahead and sit in PoK and beg the highend raiders for gear they won't use anymore, they love people who do that.</div></div><hr />

hmm someone once told me these are for DPS class... Sell them in the bazaar, for like 2 or 3K and pick these other ones  up for 2K  (Since you are low on cash, it's almost like an even trade. I'm not a gear person, just something to think about that wont cost you much, if anything at all..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Chayde's right.<br />
<br />
Bladed Steelslave is your other option in that price range/ AC range<br />
<br />
Cultural should be better AC/HP but worse stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Magentic is somewhat pricy but really nice upgrades for Arms, legs, helm slots.<br />
<br />
Pricey?  Most pieces are 10-20k... that's beyond dirt cheap, given the stats on the stuff.  Just don't buy boots/bracers/gaunts.<br />
<br />
And seriously, if you can't accumulate more than 13k at 62, you've got to be severely impaired.  You don't have to farm, buy plat, play the market, or anything else to accrue more cash than that.  Just drops from normal XP grinding can make you a healthy profit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">SJ's just pissed because there have been a lot of asshats (who don't know how to argue) targetting him lately.<br />
<br />
<br />
Here's some suggestions.  Most are easily accessible and farmable (with exp at 62) but probably off the beaten path.  I'm going to asume that your hate for &quot;farming&quot; is &quot;farming plat&quot; not camping a named for a specific drop.<br />
<br />
Wrists: cultural or rock molded  (think there is an NToV quest for a nice wrist with 41% haste if you like quests...probably one groupable now too)<br />
<br />
Waist: Kylong Darkmail (if you get other haste), farm Seahorse<br />
<br />
Shoulders: Grand Pauldrons of Study - 1st castle room in PoM (they're in my magelo).  3 person easy. (also you could go to the theatre in PoM for ring and back upgrades, but it's more difficult)<br />
<br />
Back: everyone likes the lodi, but with no HP, no STA, no int with a ton of wis, you could do much better (switch in Lodi for when enduring breath is needed).  Should be able to find something with 15 AC+ and better SK oriented stats - upgrading any one of your other need areas will more than make up for the loss of AC.<br />
<br />
Boots: In addition to the 2 mentioned the &quot;Boots of slaughter&quot; were in the bazaar(on Brell) in the same price range as the other 2 (3-7K) or go to Veksar with your group and farm &quot;Boots of the Kunzar Wanderer&quot;.  You'd still get exp while working towards an upgrade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Wrists: cultural or rock molded (think there is an NToV quest for a nice wrsit with 41% haste if you like quests...probably one groupable now too) <br />
<br />
One groupable yes, but not at 62 with his gear.  Doze isn't hard anymore, but he's not exactly going to roll over either - you're going to need a solid group.</div></div><hr />
