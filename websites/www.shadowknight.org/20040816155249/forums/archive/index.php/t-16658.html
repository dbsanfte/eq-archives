<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have not seen many type 1 augments and this is what I need to upgrade my current gear.  Are there any you can buy and how much are they?  Or are the type 1 all dropped during an adventure?  I have seen two drop so for out of 4 adventures so I would like to buy some.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Drakonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Haven't seen any Type 1's but I'm getting the idea that maybe the &quot;All Types&quot; ones are the nearest to it...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kizzestra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah, it is my guess also that the ones that drop in the dungeons and fit &quot;any slot&quot; are actually type 1. They are also all NODROP so you cannot buy any, you gotta go earn them. Yeah, I know, a shame, you can't just go buy a bunch and twink yourself and all your alts with them. :confused:</div></div><hr />
