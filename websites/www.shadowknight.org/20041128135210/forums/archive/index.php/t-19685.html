<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ok, I am ignoring my work again this morning and hanging on the forum, but I got to thinking again (uh-oh).<br />
<br />
1) Do paladin's get a haste buff?<br />
2) Since we are supposed to be the DPS end of the plate class, shouldn't we get a haste buff?<br />
3) I notice that this request never is seen much.<br />
<br />
Thoughts? Comments?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ganodoar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">&lt;1) Do paladin's get a haste buff?&gt;<br />
Yes they do at lvl 49. The spell is called valor of marr and increases their haste by 25 percent. Costs a lot of mana though.<br />
<br />
&lt;2) Since we are supposed to be the DPS end of the plate class, shouldn't we get a haste buff&gt;<br />
Not really. If you really want a haste buff just get the Eyepatch of Plunder. In fact, some paladins choose to get Eyepatch of Plunder instead of using their spell haste because it saves them mana. Valor of Marr I beleive costs 200 mana and doesn't last that long. Plus even with Valor of Marr we still outdmg paladins big time. They don't have dots, spears or the pet to help increase DPS.<br />
<br />
&lt;3) I notice that this request never is seen much&gt;<br />
If anything I have seen suggestions of sks getting a haste stealing buff but I doubt we will ever get one. But like others have said in the past you can counter the Valor of Marr point by suggesting Eyepatch of Plunder. Though Stormfeather is the real pain of the quest of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Darko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Most are affraid that if we do get a haste buff it will at a cost of something else, and sicne haste doesnt really stack to well when u got a chanter/sham/bst in the group most would rather have another utkility instead.<br />
<br />
IMO if u really wanted a haste buff  we could ask for a call of darkness upgrade with more atk and like 50% haste.. but i dont really see an need for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>runcade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">how about a haste tap?  gives us 10 or 15% haste while it slows the mob by that much?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">actually, I like the haste tap idea...just slightly less then the Beastlord level slow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Stattic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ok ya...Haste tap would be sweet.<br />
We should be able to do a DEX tap as well along with a AGI tap.<br />
<br />
HEHe I think we should even get a 100point heal selfbuff at lvl 52.<br />
<br />
Would help<br />
