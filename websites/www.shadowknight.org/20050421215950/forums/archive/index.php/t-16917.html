<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nazgaull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have tried to research this here a bit, ran a few various Searches and such but I have found little information related to this.<br />
<br />
What difference would Iksar Illusion make is used to do the Greenmist parts with Librarian Zimor?<br />
<br />
What difference would it make when needing to purchase the Quill and Piece of Parchment from Visar Glolith in the Necro Guild?<br />
<br />
Has anyone tried to do this and what Race/diety were you when you did, and did it work?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Peye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have an Erudite sk (CT is the diety) on Tarew Marr. In doing the Greenmist quests, I did do the faction work to get up to non-kos status with the Legion, but I eventually just kept a five dose bottle of Iksar illusion on me.  Made the whole thing so much easier.  I went from the necroes regarding me &quot;Threateningly&quot; to being &quot;Aimiable.&quot;  If you get the illusion, use it. It's a time saver.  You can use the vendors (for the quill and parchment) and Zimor (who's on the Brood faction) won't lay into you.  Hope this helps.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nazgaull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ok I went ahead and tried this tonight.<br />
<br />
Dark Elf worshipping Innoruuk.<br />
<br />
3 bottles of Essence of Iksar should do it.<br />
<br />
I was Amiable to Brood of Kotiz and Librarian Zimor suddenly become my new best friend.  <br />
<br />
In my natural form as Dark Elf I am Threatening to Brood of Kotiz.<br />
<br />
I have a screenshot of myself standing in the middle of the Necro Guild Hall and next to Zimor while in Iksar Form.<br />
<br />

Screen Shot 2 (http://www.legacyguild.com/images/iksar_naz02.jpg) <br />
<br />
I was also able to walk into the Necro Guild Hall and purchase the Quill and Parchment for turning-in to Haggle Baron Dalnir.<br />
<br />
This is quite obviously the route to go if you can afford the potions or have a Shammy friend who can make them for you.<br />
<br />
Doing it this way was certainly so, so much easier then killing 1000+ Outcast Iksar in WW or FoB or where ever.<br />
<br />
I now have my Bottle of Liguid Deklium and am currently making plans to have a few friends assist me with the Glowing Cliff Golem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ashrai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">the Quill and Piece of Parchment from Visar Glolith in the Necro Guild? <br />
<br />
Quill and parchment can also be bought off one of the vendors in PoK library. Erudite in dark pink robe from what I remember.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now that is certainly some interestingly useful information I knew nothing about.<br />
<br />
And same quill/parchment from PoK works?<br />
<br />
&lt;shrugs&gt; oh well.. the Illusion is still useful for doing the Turn-In's to Librarian Zimor... <br />
<br />
Plus it will be useful when doing the Khukri Turn-In's, as two of the Turn-In NPC's for the 7 Khukri quests are in aggro range of Zimor.</div></div><hr />
