<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ok, I know I am always pushing the idea of shield spikes but here is another one...<br />
<br />
I find I rarely use my skins (Diamondskin, shieldskin) since the cost in mana and peridots is not worth a 400 (actually 394) skin that will be wiped out in a matter of a couple of swings.<br />
<br />
However, if we had a AA to increase the amount of damage absorbed maybe I would use it.<br />
<br />
AA Strength of Shadows ....increase skin by 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0 for a cost of 2 / 4 / 6 AA points.<br />
<br />
This would make our diamond skin worth 591, 788, and 1182 respectively. Then maybe it would be worth the cost of a peridot.<br />
<br />
Thoughts? Comments?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kazral Shadowthirst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It makes sense. The costs of it sound about right. They should have made the spells worth it to begin with but owell. I wouldn't be bashful in proposing 1.5 20 and 3.0 times normal sheilding because the spell sux anyway. Good suggestion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hehe, I find it funny that ogre SK strongly supporting the shield upgrade. It sure looks funny on Ogre as 1h/shield knight. :D No pun intended.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On rare occasions I do use a 1hs / shield combo...many times  I play tank for the guild, so I like the extra stats / ac for those occasions. (also, my resistances are better with that lineup)<br />
<br />
We have plenty of rangers to handle the melee dps, so I keep a atremous (spelling) shield and Adjuntant sword (with 50 point lifetap augment) on me for those occasions.<br />
<br />
I realize I give up significant dps (war marshall bladed staff is my 2 hander), so some nice shield spikes to make up for it would be beneficial. Or some extra ac (which is the reason I put on the shield to begin with).<br />
<br />
Of course, the graphics look kinda stupid.</div></div><hr />
