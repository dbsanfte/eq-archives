<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jackkal Darknite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well I finally got around to turning in the coins to get the charm.<br />
<br />
But I noticed that he went into a speil.<br />
He gave me a item to give to Eriod Haerod (to prove I'm working for him) to eventually find Gared Yalronsaw. Aparently Gared is gathering info for a DE/Crushbone invasion on the wood elf town.<br />
<br />
I looked all over crushbone, had a tracker check GFay. I also checked Neriak commons &amp; third gate and most of FQ (till I got tired)<br />
<br />
Coudnt find either one of these dudes anywhere.<br />
<br />
Has anyone done this part? or seen these dang NPCs anywhere?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hatre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Eirod Haerod is a dark elf chick standing right at the zone in of mistmore castle if hailed she asks about correspondance from the indigo brotherhood but then wont speak any further unless you have some symbol to give her.  Just a warning regarding her , while she mite /con as approx lvl 30 she is a quest mob and will wax the floor with anyone 50 and lower she cannot be slowed or snared, and she summons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jackkal Darknite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">found this out after i made that post, just never posted with my finding.<br />
<br />
apparently all the crap he spews is the quest leading up to the charm which you dont need to do. just hand the npc the coins for the charm</div></div><hr />
