<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>LoganHex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello everyone.<br />
<br />
I am currently a level twelve erudite shadowknight. I am playing him in an oldschool purist kind of way (i.e. questing for or using tradeskills to create the armors and weapons that I use). <br />
<br />
I have found a numerous amount of armor quests for my character (Fell Blade, Riddosan, Dark Forge, Darkened Knight, Dark Runed, Malevolent and Blood Lords) but nothing much in the way of weaponry or shields.<br />
<br />
Here is what I have found for weapon quests that I can do. There is the Fell Blade Cutlass, Battle Worn Halberd, Soulfiend Lance (which I discovered while reading through some posts here) and some kind of two handed blunt weapom given in Paineel for the completion of the Titan Sample quest (for some reason people have posted that you get a blunt weapon but never listed what it actually was). That is about it really.<br />
<br />
If anyone knows of any weapon quests that I can do (level is not important as if it is beyond my reach now I would still like to make note of it for later levels) or any quests for shields could you please list them here? You do not even need to provide the quest if you know that I can look the weapon or shield up at Allakhazam to find it. Any help would be much appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>yuggoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The two biggest, of course, are the Greenmist and the Epic, Innoruuk's Curse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jackkal Darknite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">LoY has a questable weapon. search alla's quests in the dulak zone, or for luggald flesh. its actually 2 quests based on your class. the casters get a nice ring (has regen on it if I remember right) while melee's get a crappy (in comparison to the casters item) 1H weapon.<br />
If you like quests then its a good quest. need a solid group of 50+ for the final fight (I did it for a shammy friend and the group ranged from 58 to 63 and we owned it easy). <br />
I've already got better 1H weapons so I never did it. I'll have my Necro do that quest tho for the ring.<br />
<br />
Ghoulbane is another quested weapon you can do (need it for epic) even tho it'll collect dust in the bank.<br />
<br />
cant think of any others atm.</div></div><hr />
