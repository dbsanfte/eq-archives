<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kruggan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guys - just wanted to ask what is the minimum force I could get away with on the 4 SKs.  I know I can solo kite the gnome in Iceclad.  I wasn't sure about the other 3.  My magelo is pretty accurate - I sit around 11k HP raidbuffed, so I'm not sure if I could tank the other 3 or if I should bring a warrior and DPS.  I often 3 box my SK, a shaman and a cleric.  Could I 3 box any of them?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Silvershadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Your magelo may be accurate, but you didn't include a link to it.<br />
<br />
Either way, you say you have 11k raidbuffed so I'd have to assume you have a decent amount of ac also. That being the case, you will have no problem tanking these, just bring slower and cleric and dps. You could probably threebox them but why bother except bragging rights? Bring dps and just slaughter them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Duck_72</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I duo`d all 4 with a fully Time geared cleric.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wyrdlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You could easily three box any of them.  That's not really the issue.  The real issue is getting them dead before your healers run oom.  I wiped to the one in Tim Deep due to being unprepared for his AE.  After that, I added a pair of wizard friends and cleaned them all up inside of an hour.  Unless you've got more time and patience than me, bring a druid or wizard, for porting if nothing else!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Belyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Killed all 4 with qvic geared sk and shammy, think with sham buffs only.  Was close a couple times.  Having the 67 lifetap was quite helpful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kilkulan Darkwarrior</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I trio'd them with shaman/cleric</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mordosskul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Qvic+ geared SK and I duoed this with a well geared druid. The guy in the swamp of no hope was the longest fight. Even with 414MR, a lifetap would at least partially slip through my guard from time to time.</div></div><hr />
