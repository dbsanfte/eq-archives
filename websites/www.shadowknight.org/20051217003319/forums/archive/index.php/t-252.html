<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">velourea</div><div class="date">03-30-2002, 07:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hmm.... interesting idea... this really would help sk's out on raid situations and could be tweaked (as far as mana, components) so that it wouldnt be unbalancing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Syfon</div><div class="date">03-30-2002, 07:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This could be an awesome idea. Something like this (if it was feasable and the damage mitigated was a reasonable amount) could be an excellent reason to have SK's along on a raid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Impending Darkness<br />
Effect: Reverce Rune<br />
Cost: All available mana<br />
1 point of Mana=1 Melee damage absorbed<br />
<br />
Effect is simalr to a rune, where a rune protects the caster, this is a rune that dose not let the effected creature damage others.<br />
<br />
2500mana pool SK, effectivly sheilds the raid force form attacks for 2500hp.  Not much in a flury attack form a Vindi type mobe and even less than something from a AoW.  Little over one round?<br />
<br />
Make SK's a nice alternitive for the few seconds it takes to get get a Heal rotation going.<br />
<br />
OR<br />
<br />
Flip side, Self only Rune 1 dam for every 2 mana.  2500 mana pool SK=1250 point Rune?</div></div><hr />

<br />
your suggestion wouldnt even last 1 round on a mob, just lets us last 2 more seconds in front of it, the point of the spell isnt to make us tank, its to allow us to be something other than a &quot;dot&quot; on a large mob, and make multiple sk's something that would be sought after</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">synnoira</div><div class="date">03-30-2002, 08:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">good idea<br />
as long as i end up helping by hurting something that's ok by me<br />
i particularly like that it makes more than two or three sk's desirable which is the crux of the problem</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">trun</div><div class="date">03-30-2002, 09:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Depending on the amount of dmg that it blocks, it might work. Ie. if we get a reverse of rune v(700 dmg at 60?) for a peri. I'm guessing mana costs/cast time would be high so you can't really chain it. All mana turned into a rune would be too overpowering for a spell, but could be put in as an inflated cost skill in aaxp.<br />
<br />
The spell would be nice for tank transitions for when defensive goes down. Good idea, but by no means a role changer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caithris</div><div class="date">03-30-2002, 11:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like the idea, tho I'm not sure how effective it would be.<br />
<br />
Sure any dmg mitigated is good, but for how much mana would it cost, how much if any does the component cost, and would u really want it a set amount of DMG?<br />
<br />
We're all wanting to become more useful on a Large Scale raid.  And even at most if you had 2 Sk's present thats alot on the bigger raids.  Would we really sit there and chain cast this dmg mitigate spell?  While a) we lose some of our dmg output b) god knows the aggro it should or could draw and c) I think it would be better to miss 'rounds' of dmg rather than a set amount of dmg.<br />
<br />
It just seems to me there's something missing here with its usefulness.<br />
<br />
Here's a suggestion to your mitigate spell; Maybe instead of a Rune per se, U lower the mob's chance to hit people in general by X %.  I.e a reverse combat agility spell.  In doing so, you could improve your own combat agility, or which I think would be great, make it AE like a bard song and effects X amount of people in your radius.</div></div><hr />

I was thinking something similar to Rune V with half the aggro... maybe alittle more<br />

You would cast it, how much I dont know... I cant judge your raids only mine, making it miss rounds makes it vary alot, from double 256 on Queen Bathzid to quad 1156 on AoW... see the problem there?<br />

<br />
Making it affect people in your radius, its not debuffing the mob, its buffing the players (ie. directly helping them), something SK's arent supposed to do</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caithris</div><div class="date">03-31-2002, 12:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe I misspoke, or shoulda been more clear.<br />
<br />
I meant as far as You cast the spell &quot;steal combat agility&quot;, then you steal 10% from Vindicator.  That stolen stuff would then go to the raid party to help them do more dmg or even take less dmg.<br />
<br />
Kinda along the lines of Torrent of Hate, I steal 47atk from the mob and give 47atk to each member of the group, or in my over-powering instance the melee around you.<br />
<br />
As far as the raids I do, Been doing Zlandi, Klandi, Sont, Doze, vindi etc...and mobs of those calibur.  And honestly, I would rather have the misses say, X number of misses.  B/c as you just pointed out, while the AoW hits for quad 1152's, or while the queen hits for single 250's, wouldn't missing rounds be more effective in the higher hitting mob raids, than a spell that prevents the mob from doing dmg for ____ a fixed amount.   <br />
<br />
Realistically, how many hitpoints do you think the spell should prevent  the mob from hitting for; which would then make us more useful for raids?  Even 1500 wouldn't be very effective imo.  The best rune is near 700 and they'd certainly not give us a rune near that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">trun</div><div class="date">03-31-2002, 03:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe a kind of cripple that stacks with cripple would be better for us. It seems more in line to what an sk would be doing to a mob. That's really what our current shrouds/torrents do in a way, but really an all in one that may or may not buff us is what we need. Our issue with using shrouds/torrents on raids is buff space.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Garila</div><div class="date">03-31-2002, 01:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just have the reverse rune drain 4000 HPs (from ourselves) and temporarily add the buff to the tank we are targetting . . .  say the HPs last for  10 seconds . . . it would be a raid only spell for most people since 4000 HPs is more than alot of people have unbuffed . . . and any ways of it being abused could be negated by adjusting the duration.  OR  a buff you throw on the warrior so that the next hit he takes is redirected to us . . . only one SK at a time could do it but you could set up a SK rotation (HAHA CLERICS!) and it would limit the MT by one buff slot, and obviously it wont last too long on AoW type encounters when one hit can be 1000+ dmg</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Moongaden</div><div class="date">03-31-2002, 01:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dont like that.  What help would 700 damage be vs AoW?   How would that 700 damage make you invincible in exp groups?<br />
<br />
Really,  you have to make things raid only,  or versions that scale.   Its an interesting idea,  just it needs work.<br />
<br />
You didnt like the differance between Queen Bathezid and AoW.   Why not?   Why not make it so the spell causes the mob to miss for 2 rounds?   Hell,  you could even pull with this thing.   Overpowering?  No,  not really.   I imagine if you had 7 SK's circling the mob (with appropriate refresh),  you could keep the MT alive all by yourselves for a bit.    So we cant have that.   Lets factor in a 20 second recast and a 250 manacost.  Ohhhh,  now we can only cast it maybe 7 times.   <br />
<br />
Now we're getting somewhere.   Take Sontalak for example.   He quads,  so the SK's can only knock out 2 of the 4 hits.   That doesnt make it overpowering.   We could also make it so it doesnt stop the first two hits,  but the first two swings.   Thats a nice constraint.<br />
<br />
Sontalak struggles at his mystical bounds</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lejina Bloodbath</div><div class="date">04-01-2002, 03:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats basicly turning us into healers casting some sort of Remedy/DivineLight like spell and targeting the mob instead of the player being hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Duke Vendric Ravenkrest</div><div class="date">04-01-2002, 09:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Name: Leeching Aura<br />
Target: Group<br />
Mana Cost: 400<br />
Duration: 20 minutes<br />
Cast Time: 10<br />
Recast Delay: 20 minutes<br />
Save: none<br />
<br />
The spell is a damage shield for 20 damage. It damages the mob for 20 and heals the player for 20 with each hit. This spells does not stack with druid DS line or Mage DS line but would stack with CoE, Cloak of Akheva, bard group DS song and coldain ring, making the total DS value the total heal value. Spell can not be used with target group buff.<br />
<br />
Or make it self only...<br />
<br />
Tell me that wouldn't help us out. I know that for my guild at least I'm usually in MT group on big encounters (3 MT, cleric, me). This would be invaluable for large encounters where mobs hit fast. This basically negates up to what, 32 damage per hit from the mob? Toss in MoK or similar spells and the MT group will love you forever. Give us a group shroud of death and make it even more usefull. Have both up on yourself, mob turns to you, and toss in leechcurse on top of it. I mean, think of the possibilities. Even as a self buff.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for Brael's suggestion. I'd say tweek it a bit to make it more viable in VI's eyes. Make it a debuff, doesn't stack with itself. Drains the mob of 300 attack and adds 100 attack to the caster (not like that would unbalance us) and does 100 damage per tick for 5 ticks (30 seconds) then when it fades the caster drops by 100 attack (in addition to losing the 100 from this spell) for 30 seconds (5 ticks) as a side effect and the mob returns to normal. Recast delay of of 90 seconds (15 ticks). Basically 3 SK could keep this up in a chain, if timed and they don't die, heh. Make it the same resists as Cripple. Something like this VI might actually do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ulthar</div><div class="date">04-01-2002, 11:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is the kind of spell I would really like to see:<br />
<br />
Name: Touch of Quickness (or something, not important really).<br />
<br />
Effect: The next spell you cast will be instant cast, whatever that spell is.Activating Touch of Quickness will take you a buff slot. You CAN'T have 2 &quot;Touch Of Quickness&quot; at the same time.<br />
<br />
Duration: 20 minutes or so.<br />
<br />
Casting time: 10 seconds.<br />
<br />
Mana cost: 200 to 300 mana.<br />
<br />
Recast: Something along the lines of 2 minutes.<br />
<br />
Target: Self only.<br />
<br />
Level 59 or 60.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I think that could be a great spell for us.<br />
<br />
Just a few exemples i have in mind:<br />
<br />
-Your pet just died , you have &quot;Touch of quickness&quot; on, you recast your pet instantly.<br />
-Every snarer including you forgot to snare that damn mob, you have &quot;Touch of quickness&quot; on, you have<br />
 a chance to snare that mob instantly (given it's not resisted).<br />
-Instant Death peace or feign death. Would only work once every 2 minutes anyway, and <br />
 you still have the chance to &quot;fall to the ground&quot;.<br />
-You're in the grey , lost bobbing corpse, you have a train of 15 mobs behind your ass and <br />
 are far away of the zone , you have no enduring breath item (already happened to me, what a shame :P )<br />
 woopy woopa, you insta cast  bobbing corpse.<br />
-1 insta drain soul per fight considering you 'buffed' yourself previously with &quot;touch of quickness&quot;.<br />
 Even if it's not much, it already does help.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Considering we do not have many &quot;very useful with long cast time&quot; spells , this wouldn't be <br />
overpowered for us.</div></div><hr />
