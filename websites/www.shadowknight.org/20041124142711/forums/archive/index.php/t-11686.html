<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Soulstar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">With the advent of the new lizard mounts I think there should be an option to somehow choose whether your holy/unholy steed is a horse or a lizard.  I think this could easily be done by adding a new class AAXP that summons a lizard of equal speed to the holy/unholy steed and refunding the points for anyone who has already purchased their steed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Warmaster Xsavuung Llaahh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I was thinking the same thing. Only makes sense. I have not yet purchased a steed, but it should be an option.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Trysbrina67</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Horses &gt; lizards any day of the week.  I doubt the option for unholy / holy lizard mounts will ever come to fruition.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mazzic D'Vainn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Unholy WarBoar mounts, plz thx.</div></div><hr />

Unholy Lizard would be dumb.<br />
<br />
Sure, Unholy Steed is dumb currently, its not an &quot;unholy steed&quot; ... its a &quot;black horse&quot;.  That could be worked on, better model would be good.<br />
<br />
But lizards are there so that people who dont get an AA for a mount dont have to go around looking the same as a SK or Pally who payed a mere 6aas for the same thing they payed 103000pp for.  Its like buying an expensive car - you want to look different. :)<br />
<br />
Imo - Just make holy / unholy steed look better... like a unicorn for paladins and a nightmare for SKs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Khat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I agree that there should be a discernable difference between a store-bought pony and the Unholy Steed.<br />
<br />
As far as an AA lizard; I personally would take the Steed over it.<br />
(Unless of course the lizzy didn't poof in the water)<br />
