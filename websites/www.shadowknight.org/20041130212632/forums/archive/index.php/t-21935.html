<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">There are currently two tanking gaps between the three tank classes that must be addressed. One gap between Shadowknights and Paladins, and another between Warriors and Knights in general. These issues cannot be treated entirely independently from one another.  Changes should return knights to preference in the offtanking role, establish equal desirability in a group setting, and bring the two knight classes into line with one another.  <br />
<br />
- Link the paladin Force of XXX line of stuns so that only one can be used at a time.  This would give high-level Paladins a single line of stuns progressively upgraded to keep up with level increases.  Upgrades should not increase in power, as the effects of stun spells scale to mob DPS.  <br />
<br />
- Replace the paladin Quellious' Word line (10.0 sec stuns) with a 0.0 sec stun with a high resist mod and low cast/recast time and a moderate mana drain.  Approximate mana drain could range from the level 54 Quellious' Word of Tranquility at 65 mana to the level 69 Quellious' Word of Tranquility at 115 mana, with possible tweaking needed to the numbers depending on the final cast and recast times.  These spells would fill paladin role of interrupting casters.<br />
<br />
- Add a “Recourse Box” – a buff window specifically for recourse effects.  <br />
<br />
- Give Shadowknights a 20% accuracy debuff with high aggro.  18 sec duration, 12 sec recast, 1 sec cast, -55 resist check to magic, equivalent restrictions to paladin stuns. The high aggro is essential to prevent it from becoming a support spell – furthermore, it would be a welcome boost to aggro generation for Shadowknights.  <br />
<br />
This should be a new spell line rather than a single spell.  Its max level should increase progressively along with paladin stuns, but its power should remain constant, as its effect scales with mob damage output.  <br />
<br />
Regarding mobs with hard coded to-hit ratios (I.E. evasive and similar are ineffective):<br />
This debuff would need to be specifically coded to bypass the hard coded to-hit ratio, or its ineffectiveness on these mobs would need to be taken into account when creating immunities for the spell line.  An equivalent portion of the mob population in a given area would need to be effected by the new debuff as is effected by stuns.  The ideal solution would be to simply bypass the hard coded to-hit ratios on these mobs, but if that cannot be achieved, this must be considered to prevent Paladin stuns from having broader applications, creating an imbalance.  <br />
<br />
Note that a Paladin chain casting the remaining line of stuns would avoid 31% of melee damage, barring interrupts, fizzles, and resists.  Shadowknight’s lower percentage of avoidance would be balanced by its greater reliability (duration exceeds recast by 4*cast time) and the spell Aura of Pain.<br />
<br />
- Give knights two disciplines to return them to their offtanking role.  <br />
--- Melee immunity discipline: autoparry, 18-second duration, 40-minute reuse.  <br />
--- DI-mitigation discipline: 30-35% DI-mitigation, decrease melee damage modifier by 20%, 72-second duration, 4.5-minute reuse.  <br />
<br />
They should be on separate reuse timers, but the mitigation discipline may share the reuse timer of the current defensively oriented knight disciplines.<br />
<br />
Note that the mitigation discipline would have a lower total active time than defensive, in addition to mitigating notably less.  If used whenever available, Defensive is active 28.57% of the time; the knight discipline would be active 26.66% of the time.<br />
<br />
- Allow Shadowknights access to the Stonewall AA ability. <br />
<br />
- Provide Shadowknights with an upgrade to Death Peace.  (Specifics as yet undecided.) <br />
<br />
- Change the Malo lines of spells to debuff disease.  It is the one resist that is not debuffed by the spell line and there is no justification for this.  Disease is behind every other resist in the extent to which it is debuffed on raids, and it is the resist on which Shadowknights rely most heavily.  <br />
<br />
- Put Spell Casting Subtlety on a toggle; as it stands, purchasing this AA is currently detrimental to Shadowknights.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Paladin stuns are at the root of a lot of the current class balance problems for the tank classes.  The number of usable stuns varies by mob level and they are extremely powerful against blue trash mobs and the like, are entirely useless against immune mobs, and address only part of the problem with others (incoming DPS vs. being one-rounded).  The above changes would reduce paladin reliance on stuns and make their impact more consistent.  Currently, the impact of stuns varies greatly from mob to mob depending on level, immunity, resistance, etc.   Paladins would be compensated for the lost stun power with the much-needed tanking disciplines.  <br />
<br />
Shadowknights would be brought into line with paladins through the accuracy debuff, which would effectively parallel paladin stuns.  These abilities, together with the rapid-fire mitigation discipline, would cement knights in their traditional offtanking roles while having little impact on the traditional warrior role of raid main tanking.  All three tank classes would be viable for single group content.  <br />
<br />
Note that this would actually be an improvement for warriors in a group setting in terms of power relative to Paladins, as stuns in their current state are potentially very overpowered against common XP mobs.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Primary things that still need to be determined and discussed:<br />
- Discs: Run on Endurance or Mana?  <br />
--- How much should the cost/upkeep be?  (Obviously dependent upon the above question.)<br />
- Specifics of Death Peace upgrade.  <br />
<br />
The next version of this will, at least in theory, be the final version - this is the time to iron out the remaining issues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Klang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">2 thumbs up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Synapticus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">teeheeehee another one =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Belyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Unless there are useful spells added to the spell lineup that would acutally put a dent in my mana bar, haveing new discs run on mana would be more benificial too post time sks.  As it stands right now i never sit and the only encounter that breaks my mana bar is quarm with his debuffs and me chain casting toi and tov.  My unbuffed mana regen is 19, manapool estimate is 6500.<br />
<br />
Having new discs work on endurance, unless they have long reuse times might actually prevent sks from useing the big HT and leechcurse due to lack of available endurance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm aware of that, and that's the problem.  Deciding which situation is more balanced.  From a raid standpoint, I'd say mana is the better option - higher regen rates and generally higher mana pools mean that it'd give the disc more staying power if it operated on mana, and that's in line with the offtanking role.  It's also logical in that mana for hybrids is fairly analagous to endurance for melee's in that our other abilities are generally mana based and melee's other abilities are endurance based.  <br />
<br />
In the group setting, however, mana gives us an advantage.  Our mana regen rates are higher than warrior endurance regen rates, so, hypothetically speaking, with each class using the disciplines in a group setting, we'd have an unfair advantage.  Now we all know that in practice, neither disc would be used on XP trash very often, but the theoretical potential kinda has to be considered.  <br />
<br />
An argument in favor of mana regarding a group setting, however, is that, if it were endurance based, we could throw it around at will, saving only enough endurance for an emergency, because our other abilities are mana-based.  A warrior cannot because running out of endurance limits his other abilities.  As such, making it mana based would tie it to our other tools the way endurance based discs are tied to warrior tools (I.E. Incite line), which would be a positive parallel.  <br />
<br />
The difference in size of endurance pool vs. size of mana pool isn't really a factor so much, because the cost can scale accordingly - it's mostly a question of the balance impact of the regen rates and the fact that other relavant SK &quot;tools&quot; run on mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ghismonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I applaud your effort, SJ.  However, I will never be happy as a shadowknight until I have a horse that looks like the nightmare glooms in PoNightmare.  All the rest of these fixes and balancing and stuff is a bunch of hooey.<br />
<br />
/sarcasm off</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Belyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thought our endurance pool was the same as everyone elses.  Anyway, unless they have been working the code to make discs drain mana instead of endurance, you should drop that idea.  That sounds like a programming challenge and we need something to make us viable tanks yesterday not 6 months or a year from now.  Unholy aura and leechcurse do nothing for tanking high end mobs and dont really dent the endurance bar, make me a viable tank id happily never use either of them again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Wouldn't be hard to code considering discs and spells run on the same engine as I understand it - I suspect it would involve changing one line of code or one field or whatever.  Even if it requires them to put in a bit of extra effort, its worth doing something right if it's worth doing it at all - we've waited this long, I'd rather wait another week and get exactly what is warrented if that is indeed mana-based.  <br />
<br />
Our endurance pull is not the same as everyone elses - look at the gear available to SK's vs. that available to pure melee's.  As for naked endurance pools, I don't honestly know.  <br />
<br />
My current inclination is that mana-based is the better option and, coincidentally, I suspect that would be the more palable option to the warriors, which, while not a primary concern of mine, is a nice added benefit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Paynreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I don't like the idea of mana based discs because it often removes the possibility of using them in a dire situation. I want to be able to use it as a last resort, not early because i know i need that last bubble of mana for the disc.<br />
<br />
But, the primary use is to balance us in tanking - not emergencies, and i'll take what i can get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The mitigation disc is something that'd be getting used rapid-fire in a raid situation, so the same thing could easily occur if it's based on endurance... arguably easier due to the lack of regen.  With our current spell lineup, you don't exactly deplete your mana supply very often in normal play anyway, and it's not like the cost would be obtrusively large (except perhaps in relation to the small mana pools of low-end SK's, but that's reasonable/to be expected).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Belyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">They may have just not gone to the trouble of putting endurance on sk armor because it was pointless.  If making mana draining discs is a problem, changing sk items to include endurance would be a much easier solution.  Screw whatever worries there are about what warriors may think, we are much more a melee class then a caster class.  Besides that analogy implys that warriors have a spell line, and if that was indeed the case they definitly have the most powerful game altering spells in eq next to slow if even that.  Why play a sk if your into tanking when you get spells infinitly more powerful as a warrior, only difference being sk spells start to develope around lvl 30 and warriors are post 50.  We should be better tanks then warriors outside of spells to make up for the significantly more powerful spells that warriors get.  Its not like leaving the mana pool alone is going to open more options for us with the way things are now or the spell line on lucy for 66 to 70.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I said that warrior response would be a beneficial side effect - I didn't say it was my aim.  If you actually read my posts, there are tangable advantages to the disc's being mana based, and I'd be willing to bet it'd be easier to code a mana-based disc than adding bringing SK gear up to speed on endurance... even if it's not though, like I already said (twice) - if something's worth doing, it's worth doing right.  I'll gladly give them an extra week or two to code something if it's going to be for the better.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying I'm set on mana-based disc's either - I'd like to see discussion on the matter, but your reasons for making it endurance based are... flawed to say the very least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Belyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Experince says anything that involves new code takes along time, beurocracy could be to blame who knows.  The problem has been widely known since a few weeks after the release of god, that extra week to get it right has come and gone.  Personally i dont have preference either way, but they need to get something going now.  If that means adding endurance discs and going back later to add endurance to sk armor so be it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">We've waited this long - another week isn't going to kill anyone if it provides a better solution in the end.  I'll wait a week for somthing that could effect me for years to be done right.  As for &quot;adding new code&quot; - from my understanding, that's not necessary, just combining existing code in a new order, because discs and spells are fundamentally the same thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Numzaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I think I'd prefer to have the discs endurance based.<br />
Currently our endurance has little effect on our game, it's a kind of independent factor.<br />
Those new discs will need balancing and tuning.<br />
If they are linked to our mana pool we introduce all kinds of interdependencies with our current way of casting and playing which may make it hard to tune the discs for all situations.<br />
I tend to assume the worst when it comes to balancing, so I'd prefer to keep our casting alone while they mess with the introduction and tuning of the discs. The discs endurance drain can always be tuned to reflect our endurance pools, no need to change much in our equipment probably.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm aware - in fact, I said that already.<br />
<br />
I think I'd prefer to have the discs endurance based. <br />
<br />
Preferable doesn't mean more balanced.  <br />
<br />
Currently our endurance has little effect on our game, it's a kind of independent factor. <br />
<br />
That's potentially an argument in favor of mana, as endurance is tied to other abilities for warriors just as mana is tied to other abilities for knights.  <br />
<br />
I'm not saying anything I havn't already though... bleh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Belyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">My biggest fear of having mana based discs is seeing them appear in the spell book and not the combat abilites window.  Having to mem a spell with a long recast time and keep it up permanently if i want to use it.  Having to channel the defensive type discs when i need them most...getting the crap pounded out of me.  That would work out about as well as deathpeace does when the unexpected happens when pulling, one mistake in the timeing you might as well have not even tried to cast it.<br />
<br />
If they gave us the warrior defensive disc exactly as a spell, put a 2.5 second cast time on it and it would be total crap in comparison to the insta button click always mem'd weather its hotkeyed or not warrior disc.  Not to mention losing a spell gem permanently.</div></div><hr />

A discipline that runs off of mana and a spell are theoretically two different things, at least to the same extent that current disciplines and spells are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">UA has a 900 endurance cost currently, which really doesnt make much of a dent in my Endur. bar. Having more uses for endurance that would force us to monitor our endurance pool level might be an interesting addition to the playing of this class. The one hesitation I have with saying this is that we really don't have terrific information about end. pool and its regeneration as it effects SKs at all gear levels that would be affected. Even Magelo seems to be unsure about this info.</div></div><hr />

If they would do this before the end of the month and it'd shock me. If they came out and said what changes they were plannin on makin for knights within 1-2 weeks I'd have a heart attack.<br />
Hell, at this point, the only thing I think I've heard them really say is that they would look at SK's/Pal's not having a parry/ripposte/etc disc when every other melee/hybrid had one.</div></div><hr />

Can't follow your logic there.<br />
<br />
My argument is not that mana should be tied to casting and endurance to discs for some philosophical reason. <br />
It's just that you have to fiddle with fewer variables when you look at endurance alone when tuning SK discs.<br />
Less complexity should be good and make for more robust designs.<br />
If the discs run from Mana you have to consider mana tapping AoEs, different mana supply in group and raid situations for different tiers of equipment etc.<br />
If you ran it from endurance it's more or less a static baseline, the balancing should be much easier that way.<br />

No, I'm saying it might be more beneficial/more balanced for ours to run off of mana for reasons I've already discussed.  It usually helps to actually read my posts. <br />

There are endurance drains too.  There is a notable difference in the endurance of a low-end player and high-end player just as there is a notable difference in the endurance.  Difference is, there will be cases where a lower end raider will have higher endurance than a higher-end raider due to the availability of endurance on gear (class-specific vs. all plate).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">- Give knights two disciplines to return them to their offtanking role. <br />
--- Melee immunity discipline: autoparry, 18-second duration, 40-minute reuse. <br />
<br />
Although convenient, there are things we need more.<br />
<br />
--- DI-mitigation discipline: 30-35% DI-mitigation, decrease melee damage modifier by 20%, 72-second duration, 4.5-minute reuse. <br />
<br />
Shorten the duration to 12-18 seconds and reuse to 3 mins, add stun immunity, add channeling mod of 75%, increase damage mitigation and make it decrease straight damage and not just DI. Make it a true off-tanking and pull tool.<br />
<br />
Lastly, a nerf of Paladin stuns, regardless of the original source, is a bad idea and not one that should be endorsed by the SK community. The 20% accuracy idea is original, but even combined with AoP will not come close to the effect of stuns, even in the nerfed version. Instead introduce a stun line to SK's (like Fear2) and scrap the Terror line.<br />
<br />
- Allow Shadowknights access to the Stonewall AA ability. <br />
<br />
- Provide Shadowknights with an upgrade to Death Peace. (Specifics as yet undecided.) <br />
<br />
- Change the Malo lines of spells to debuff disease. It is the one resist that is not debuffed by the spell line and there is no justification for this. Disease is behind every other resist in the extent to which it is debuffed on raids, and it is the resist on which Shadowknights rely most heavily. <br />
<br />
- Put Spell Casting Subtlety on a toggle; as it stands, purchasing this AA is currently detrimental to Shadowknights. <br />
<br />
Everyone agrees on these for the most part. Death Peace upgrade via an AA that would not fizzle would be fine.<br />
<br />
<br />
Please don't take this as a slight against you personally, it's not. You certainly have made a positive contribution to the board. However a &quot;Fix for SK's&quot; if it is to be more than opinion needs to be encompassing of all levels of play. It would help to understand your perspective if you listed your magelo, or if that is not comfortable for you, described the current raid content you do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Paladins' reliance upon stuns NEEDS to be reduced - even the paladins themselves have been proposing it (though their means was to have them leave a buff on the mob rather than linking the spell lines).  As it stands, they are hugely overpowered against some content and completely ineffective against other content, which leads to knights not receiving anything because it would further overpower paladins against that content.  Yes it is a &quot;nerf&quot; to stuns, but it is necessary, and it is not a nerf to paladins in general - it is an overall improvement to their class.  SOMETHING needs to be done about the current situation (especially with what's planned for OoW) or the situation will get further out of hand.  <br />
<br />
As for your disc, I fully understand the intent behind it, but if that's to be the planned disc, I'm much more inclined to support Brael's than yours.  3 minutes is too long a reuse for such a disc; Brael had proposed 12sec duration/72second reuse disc with similar effects, but in any case, 3 minutes would likely be excessive when considering the extremely short run time.  I realize that you're trying to make it a pulling fix too, but I simply do not agree that the tanking and pulling fixes should be combined.  I'm not sure if it's possible to code a channeling mod into a spell (like you can with a fizzle mod) but I'd rather see a deathpeace upgrade (spell or AA) that had improved channeling and low/no fizzle ability.  <br />
<br />
If you try to make one upgrade cover both roles you're going to get something not ideal for either, and if you try to make a pulling upgrade similar to what you've proposed, you can't prevent it from being used for tanking.  Our pulling upgrade should come via spell/AA specifically for pulling - not tied to anything else.  Also, I think the vast majority SK's would agree that tanking, not pulling, is our primary role, and tank balance should take precedence over pulling fixes.  <br />
<br />
The accuracy debuff would accomplish much the same thing as your disc in a tanking situation, though to the same extent - improved survivability on trash mobs in the opening of the fight before the debuffs are on and the healer is ready to go.  Note that I've also considered halving the duration or doubling the recast and doubling the percentage (maybe not exactly, but approximately with a bit of tuning) to further concentrate the improved avoidance at the beginning of a fight.  This would address the same issues as your disc to a certain degree.  <br />
<br />
The mitigation disc would help with both single-group named and offtanking in a more overall sense, rather than specifically with the opening of the fight.  Note that the time inactive would hardly exceed the downtime with your disc... I have considered making it 1min/4min instead of 72sec/4.5min, but most knights seem to agree with the current duration, so I decided to leave well enough alone on that regard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How common are mana vs endurance drains, their range of effect, their magnatude, and their possable use by a mini-named/off-tank mob? <br />
This is not simply phrased as a question to make a point, I am not in a positon to know these things, but...<br />
<br />
-If a raid main target has an endurance-drain AoE or proc, but its range is set so that it will only affect those in melee range, were as the mana-drain is more likely to hit the whole raid, or <br />
-If the endurance drain will be 20% but the mana drain will likely be 50-100%,<br />
-Or raid adds (to date) are capable of a mana drain affect, but not an endurance one, <br />
<br />
A mana based disc could put us at a severe disadvantage when it comes to fufilling our rolls as off-tanks, while potentially making us more viable as MT for mobs that have an endurance drain to chalenge warriors, but no mana drain. &lt;- If the last part is a possability, we will see a shitstorm from the warrior camp over this.<br />
<br />
Ofcourse, if I am wrong in my assumptions/guesses, it is a moot point.</div></div><hr />

Slein, I think I have read what you wrote and from your above sentence as well as previous post from you I concluded that you see the link between endurance and discs as &quot;a warrior thing&quot;.<br />

Difference is, there will be cases where a lower end raider will have higher endurance than a higher-end raider due to the availability of endurance on gear (class-specific vs. all plate).<br />
<br />
<br />
Exactly, so it will be a handfull of work to balance and tune the new discs within this one variable &quot;endurance pool&quot; alone.<br />
If you use the mana pool, which is already tuned and balanced to our spell casting, you multiply the interdependencies and make a robust overall balancing so much harder for the devs.<br />
<br />
Our endurance pool is currently of no importance to us, if it gets messed with, tuned with, screwed up or balanced with it will have no effect on our current status quo with respect to spell casting. I see this as a pro argument for using the endurance pool for any new discs.<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
I have no experience with &quot;the high level game&quot; and don't know where you run into problems with endurance drains. But so far I never opened my disc window and thought &quot;shit, my endurance is gone&quot;. <br />

<br />
&quot;Return knights to preference in the offtanking role....&quot;   meaning on raids i assume?  (im assuming since the next part of that sentence refers to equality in group settings)  Has there been some directive or , direction placed upon sks that they should be the prefered offtanks?  Im all for it im just wondering if thats even an idea that the devs are willing to entertain?

<br />
<br />
<br />
- Add a “Recourse Box” – a buff window specifically for recourse effects.<br />
Just through SK and Necro recourse buffs into the bard box.  Most of the time the bard box slots will be enough, but sometimes there might still be some slot issues to force some decision making/coordination, which is a good thing.  Add a slot or two too to the bard box if needed to compensate.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
- Give Shadowknights a 20% accuracy debuff with high aggro.  18 sec duration, 12 sec recast, 1 sec cast, -55 resist check to magic, equivalent restrictions to paladin stuns. The high aggro is essential to prevent it from becoming a support spell – furthermore, it would be a welcome boost to aggro generation for Shadowknights.  <br />
<br />
This should be a new spell line rather than a single spell.  Its max level should increase progressively along with paladin stuns, but its power should remain constant, as its effect scales with mob damage output.<br />
<br />
(snip)<br />
<br />
Note that a Paladin chain casting the remaining line of stuns would avoid 31% of melee damage, barring interrupts, fizzles, and resists.  Shadowknight’s lower percentage of avoidance would be balanced by its greater reliability (duration exceeds recast by 4*cast time) and the spell Aura of Pain. <br />
<br />
I would prefer the Fear2 option, which could mimic the hopefully revamped Paladin stun line.  The idea is actually quite interesting, but I think it's just much easier to balance Pally Stuns versus SK Fear2 stuns than Pally Stuns versus SK Accuracy debuffs.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
- Give knights two disciplines to return them to their offtanking role.  <br />
--- Melee immunity discipline: autoparry, 18-second duration, 40-minute reuse.  <br />
<br />
I'd prefer to leave these autoparry discs to the light tanks/melee.  While certainly useful, it just &quot;feels right&quot; to give both auto-parry/ripose and mitigation to warriors, while knights get one (mitigation) and light tanks/melee get the other (discounting 2 tick mitigation discs like BL Protective Spirit and Mnk Stonestance).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
--- DI-mitigation discipline: 30-35% DI-mitigation, decrease melee damage modifier by 20%, 72-second duration, 4.5-minute reuse.  <br />
<br />
The resuse seems too low.  I know you are trying to address raid offtanking, but it's very hard to address raid offtanking without impacting exp grouping.  As long as the basic tanking differences between knights and warriors is kept at an appropriate level, I think I higher a reuse time (20-30 minutes) is fine for named tanking in trials and other single group content.  One thing that could be done is to make certain mobs immune to &quot;knight defensive&quot; to ensure that traditional warrior raid main-tanking is left alone.  Yes, I know that even if this wasn't the case, the very nature of the warrior's better opening disc (furious), better long term aggro generation that isn't dependant on successful channeling, better innate mitigation, AE taunt, and better and longer lasting mitigation discs, etc. all means that warriors would always be preffered anyways, but I think making Quarm and Co. immune to knight defensive would go a long way to making warriors more willing to accept a knight mitigation disc.  The mechanics of this are already in the game.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
- Put Spell Casting Subtlety on a toggle; as it stands, purchasing this AA is currently detrimental to Shadowknights.  <br />
<br />
Maybe a refund is in order, but I don't like the idea of putting this AA on a toggle.  Buying it is and should be a tradeoff.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Shorten the duration to 12-18 seconds and reuse to 3 mins, add stun immunity, add channeling mod of 75%, increase damage mitigation and make it decrease straight damage and not just DI. Make it a true off-tanking and pull tool.<br />
Which doesn't help [as] much [as needed] with trial named tanking, and it's unlikely we would get both a disc to help with pulling, and one to help with single group nameds.  If you had to pick one, which would it be?<br />

Let me tell you something, with the amount it helps going all out on a time god for 10 minutes you'll need to fd 3 times less, thats 1 second and 360 mana saved... great benefit there!  There is some usefulness to having the AA but that usefulness varys for every class that gets it (yes even casters would benefit from a toggle), it's not something that should be on non stop.</div></div><hr />

Seeing how we can already tank trial named and single group named, something to help us off tank and pull on raids is what we need. This would, as a side benefit, help us tank in groups as well. 18 seconds to get the mob slowed is sufficient.<br />

Slien, it would help to understand your perspective if you listed your magelo, or if that is not comfortable for you, described the current raid content you do. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">The problem alot of you are missing is that simply being able to do something isn't sufficient.  Yes we (well, some of us, and fewer of us than warriors) can already tank trial bosses and/or offtank mobs sufficiently, but that doesn't always cut it.  We need the tools to excell at something - the natural something for us to excell at would be raid offtanking.  <br />
<br />
Jovec, with a 20 minute duration, the disc I proposed would be completely destroyed.  It would be reduced to a tool for single-group bosses (part of the problem) and emergency situations, and be entirely inferior to warriors' tools for all situations.  We don't need something to just &quot;bring us a little closer to warriors&quot; - we need something to put us firmly in our role.  Currently we are used for two reasons 1) our guilds can't recruit enough warriors and pallys to take our place 2) warriors need to be ready to step into the MT rotation.  Sound like a good reason to have a given role to you?  <br />
<br />
At 30-35%, 72sec/4.5min, our disc would not be superior to warrior defensive for XP groups - it would be slightly better for some applications and worse for others.  It would have the advantage of it could fill the role of &quot;use it to open the fight and turn it off once slowed&quot; more frequently.  It would be behind in total runtime and mitigation percentage.  It's not like groups are going to wait 4.5mins for pulls any more than they'd wait 10.</div></div><hr />

We need to get the final decisions made by then if at all possible.  I'd like to have the final version done as quickly as possible once my PC is back in order, and I'd say we're pretty close.  <br />

<br />
I think I like the idea of the discs being endurance based more though only because I have not seen the endurance drains.  I get my mana tapped a lot more than I get my endurance tapped.  Since Endurance is a new thing it's understandable and maybe that will change in the future and mobs that proc mana taps will proc endurance taps as well.  I still think they should go back and change the existing mana taps to tap endurance as well.  Mana proccing mobs never really hurt the casters, they just always screw a knight trying to tank vs. a warrior.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wouldn't be any different than two pallys (or a pally and warrior) using their current stuns (well, less powerful because the overpoweredness of stuns vs certain content would be reduced).  <br />
<br />

<br />
It's still a disc either way - you can't use two discs at once.  <br />
<br />
As for people commenting on endurance vs. mana based, everyone's justification is why they think &quot;[endurance/mana] would be nicer&quot; or whatnot - what we think is &quot;nicer&quot; shouldn't be the aim, what is more balanced should.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not going to work on big mobs for the most part anyway, so it's a moot point for that.  For offtank mobs, you can't really afford to dedicate two tanks to one mob - people can barely afford one tank/mob in alot of instances as it is.  It's got a short duration and recast almost meeting the duration - it's not like we could debuff multiple mobs in sequence.  <br />
<br />
Note that, as it stands, you can have multiple pallys stunning one mob into submission, but that's not really so much of a problem because you generally can't afford multiple pallys being busy with the same mob.  I don't see a problem with the ability of the tanks to work together when you have a surplus anyway, not that it'd have many applications at all.  <br />
<br />
If you look back at the older versions of this, you'll see I originally toyed around with the idea of an avoidance recourse, but implimentation would be a whole lot more work and it would have exploitable loopholes which I just can't come up with a way of coding around.  The fact that it would impact all mobs attacking you while pally stuns impact only one wouldn't be best for balance either.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A lot of the problem of balancing warriors and knights seems to be resulting from the Paladin overpowered ability to stun. Because of this we being treated as knights get burned as well. If we can get a fear spell that just freezes a mob instead of making it run away then at least we will be in the same boat with Paladins by being able to occasionaly completely stop a mob from causing damage.

Instead of a Mitigation disc which reduce mob DI, how about a spell which decreases Mob ATK by X%. Put a nasty check on it, say -200 MR, duration 2 mins re-cast as appropriate. Make all raid-encounter nameds immune to it, so it doesn't stack with defensive. <br />

<br />
Are pallies used for &quot;stun whores&quot; in a similar manner?<br />
If so, then how often does this happen?  <br />
If not, why not?<br />
I don't raid enough to be able to answer these questions well.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>Zraith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">Holy fucking shit, I LOVE this post. I havent been playing other then raiding post oow. OOW has single handedly ruined my taste for this game. All I see is: 1) We cant tank, 2) OOW has made us actually WORSE at tanking (hibird spread), 3) You guys are whining about the wrong stuff, whiny bastards. <br />
<br />
I know I would have reason to play again if this were implemented. Tanking, its what we are supposed to be able to do, It has been THE problem since PoP.<br />
<br />
We get shafted on so many things, for the past 2 years we have had absolutly NO purpose on raids (its questionable if we've ever had purpose), and now we cant even tank single group encounters. Sad..just sad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u74"><b>Elkar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p74">1.  Your an idiot for bumping a month old post.<br />
2.  Which OoW have you been playing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>Zraith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">As to your number 1 Elkar, fuck you! 19 days is not a month. And so what if it was? I haven't read this forum in months (nor will I again) and its the first god damn post that I liked. People like you are the reason I dont read this forum, nothing constructive to say, dont know their ass from their elbow fucktards (yes thats you, Elkar).<br />
<br />
Your number 2 makes me think you should close your cocksucker and read...my second sentence &quot;I haven't been playing other then raiding post oow.&quot; Idiot.<br />
<br />
Next you''ll be telling me we can tank, and ill be asking you what game your playing. Fuck you SOE.</div></div><hr />
