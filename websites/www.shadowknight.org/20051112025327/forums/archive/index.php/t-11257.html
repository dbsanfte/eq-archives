However, the only other major definition of &quot;Bro&quot; is &quot;good friend.&quot; I just met you a half an hour ago because we joined the same exp group, and if you must know, you're the crappiest cleric I've ever known. I don't know you from Adam otherwise, and will probably avoid grouping with you after this group breaks up. Now, if at some future point you grow some talent, and we join the same guild, or for some strange reason start hunting togther, and kill monsters in strange places on a nightly basis, and help each get loot, and trade dirty jokes, and go on 3 hour corpse runs together, THEN you may call me bro. Until then, you just sound like a retarded stoner. <br />
<br />
'nuff said - first of all, NO. If you have to use that asinine term, use &quot;I have said Enough&quot; or &quot;Enough has been said on this subject.&quot; or something. Beyond that, 99 out of 100 times, when someone says &quot;nuff said,&quot; there's a LOT more to be said. &quot;ya but u suk nuff said&quot; is not a great stunning triumph of logic that proves a discussion is over. Nuff said is the last retreat of a loser. If nuff said really is nuff said, why did I just write a post picking apart your idiotic arguments piece by piece?<br />
<br />
Fribbits - WTH is up with this term? I can understand Lizards for Iksar or Kitties for Vah Shir, but FRIBBITS!? WTH is THAT!? Their Frogs and they say Ribbit! LETS SAY FRIBBIT!!! TEH WIN!!!!! ...Yeah, and an apple is a fruit and an apple. Lets say FRAPPLE! WOO! They're Frogloks. Frogs if you must. Fribbit sounds like something a retarded frog, or perhaps a Frog whos just been blown up like a ballon by a massive ogre to impress a princess, might say.</div></div><hr />

<br />
reet - WTF is the meaning of that, i can understand say leet when something is cool or good cause well, it kinda started the whole &quot;leet speak&quot; but REET ?

I rather like the word bro in place of dude. Dude means the hair on an elephants ass in some eastern country or some crap like that. Call me bro anytime :P Call me dude I probably will not talk to you. <br />

<br />
Haha, you know you have seen a shout or ooc for auc or groups and.. people shout or ooc back.. I can kinda see why people say pst. Kinda says, if your smart enough to know you sends tells afterwards disregard this, if you were going to shout back.. then read the pst part again. <br />
<br />
I happen to love the &quot;nuff said&quot; quote, but it cannot be &quot;you suck nuff said&quot;, it has to be supported by a well thought out flame that cannot be disproven.. like my spelling. <br />

Jobril says &quot;Your spelling sucks, nuff said&quot;<br />

<br />
Make an offer - thank god i am not the only one who HATES THIS SHIT! make an offer. ok, how bout go fuck yourself! when i sell shit, which is rare, i look up the item online, see what the prices look like, then think about its usefulness, stats, etc, and make an educated price listing for it. usually ill go lower than what the average is because i want to sell it and get the hell out, and because i hate ripping people off. so when some lazy ass fuckhead asks for an offer, to me, thats just his way of trying to squeeze every last plat out of some uniformed sucker. assholes.</div></div><hr />

Actually, über literally means over.<br />
<br />
So the implication is that you are over (or above, if implied).<br />
<br />
So an über Sword, literally means Over sword (and it is implied to be better, such as Overlord, etc).<br />
<br />

<br />
:edit:  Übermäßig means super, just fyi, and is probably where they get Uber to mean super (or whatever)</div></div><hr />

Me: &quot;So you want me to give you 500p AND h4wt cyb3rz for a silver chitin wristband?  I don't think it's worth that much.  Or did you mean you wanted to give me SCWB and 500p for cyb3rz?  Dude, I'm a guy, my character is a male, and you're a fruity flaming wierdo and I'm going to tell everyone I meet about it unless you give me that SCWB for 50p.&quot;</div></div><hr />

This is to imply a connection to any and all fatties who are likewise adrift in a sea of hairy midgets and petite elven waifers.

I agree with the offer thing, but since I ussually only ask if I truely want something, when they tell me to make an offer I just reply with &quot;Nevermind, let me know when you come up with a price.&quot; This invariably has resulted in me being quoted a price.<br />

<br />
this is ussually from someone who lacks the mental capacity to understand the last thing I said to insult them, how infuriating, what a waste when they are so moronic they don't understand the insults.<br />
<br />
or maybe the occaisional pwned~ which when said by the person doing the &quot;pwning&quot; generally means no one was &quot;pwned&quot; so they had to clarify that they were tryin to &quot;pwn&quot; you.</div></div><hr />

I found that people tended to be more comfortable and less defensive when I call them &quot;bro&quot; than when I call them &quot;sucka&quot; or &quot;bizzitch&quot;.  So I am forced to use &quot;bro&quot;.<br />

I would get an item.  I'd have no idea what it's worth since I don't spend all day sitting in EC or the item is rare/new and not sold often and websites like someone mentioned to use are actually NEVER accurate.  I know the item is worth somewhere above 1k and below 100k.  I also realize that an item's worth is based on what someone will give you for it.  That's right folks, an item in a barter ecomony doesn't have a fixed price omg.  It's worth whatever someone will pay you.  So asking someone interested in the item for an offer is actually a lot more logical than saying &quot;it's worth 5kpp&quot;.  It annoyed me a lot more when someone would send me a tell correcting me on a price.  I don't see a UCP code on that sword so guess it isn't worth that specific price buddy.  No, I'm not going to tell the interested buyer that I have no clue what I can get for the item because they will automatically try to rip me off.  <br />
<br />
Case in point:<br />
It was during the early days of kunark and I managed to kill this named guy in warslik woods and got a bracer of scavenging(good at the time).  This named guy is blue to high 20's.  I went to mainland to sell, and asked for offers.  In oasis I had 2 people offer me like 400pp and then cuss me out when I told them that I thought I could get double that.  They insulted my intelligence and swore etc.  I zoned into EC and sold it within 5 mins for 1.2k with multiple offers of 1k.  Was the price governed by how easy the mob was? No.  It was governed by something called supply and demand.  I had a bracer and a lot of people wanted it.  So I got more than the supposed 400pp price that others had sold it at prior to me.  It would have been soo much more beneficial to listen to the knobs that cussed me out and auctioned it was sale for 400pp because that was its &quot;actual&quot; price.   So to all of you that don't like &quot;make an offer&quot;, you might want to investigate what a barter economy is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you have an item you want to sell, even when you have no idea what kind of market price you could get for it, you know full well what kind of price you're willing to accept for it.  You want to sell your Bracer of Scavenging for 1200pp?  Just ask for 1200pp then.  Don't dick around with someone who thinks 400pp is a fair price by telling them you think it's worth twice that.  If you wanted 800pp, and thought you could get it, why didn't you just ask for 800pp up front?<br />
<br />
More likely you were hoping some fool with money to burn and even less idea about market prices than you would come along and offer 1200pp.  Congrats, you got a sucker.</div></div><hr />

Used to do a lot of trading pre-Bazaar.  When I ask someone how much they're asking for an item, and the response was &quot;make an offer&quot;, I assumed they were trying to rip me off. <br />
I'll say this, though- almost every single time, all you have to do is seriously lowball the price, and they'll tell you exactly what they want for it.  I used to do that all the time in EC, and as long as you didn't quote something outrageously silly like 1cp, they'd tell you their price.<br />
<br />
Seller: WTS SCHW pst<br />
Me: how much for SCHW?<br />
Seller: make an offer<br />
Me: 500pp?<br />
Seller: nah I was hoping for 2500pp<br />
<br />
I can recall very few times that it didn't go exactly like that.  Some would be more vague and just say they were hoping for more, others would not bother responding if you weren't within a certain range of the price they were after.  But for the most part, if you lowballed your offer, even by a ton, they'd tell you what they wanted.  At that point you could negotiate the price downwards, and instead of them getting more than the going rate on an item, you'd get a bargain.  Then you could turn around and offer the item at slightly over the going rate and make some nice change.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) It never fails that when I list my prices zonewide some idiot flames me for a price that is off by 50-100p by their on some 3k item. And is it in tell? No they shout that im ripping people off to the entire zone<br />
<br />
2) 9 times out of 10 all I want to do is sell the item and I am more than happy to sell it cheap. I want someone's best offer for it, not market value? Fine. Close enough? Deal. Way too low? I sure dont respond with &quot;ROFL you newb its worth 5x that&quot;. I tell them what is mv is, or if I don't know it I ask them how come it worth so little to them. Make Offer is about negotiating the price and selling the item, for cheaper than its worth. Not about ripping people off.<br />
<br />
You can't rip an intelligent person off anyway. Look at the stats of the item. Look at the slot. Contrast and compare with prices that you do know. Are you willing to pay X price for it? Then get it.</div></div><hr />

I think that, for a small number of people, that is how 'make an offer' is used.  And that is how it should be used, as a way to start off a negotiation.<br />
<br />
But what I found was that for all but a very few, 'make an offer' was said in the hopes that the offer was more than their intended price.  If you lowball the price, they'll say they want to sell for XXXpp.  Note that they wouldn't tell you to bugger off if you came in really low, nor would they start haggling if you were close.  They'd immediately give you their exact price.  In fact, I always felt that they would rarely 'start high' in the hopes of negotiating towards their intended sell price.  They'd just tell you their intended price up front!  This made it easier to get a good deal, because even if they wouldn't budge a lot on the price, you'd wind up paying less than they had expected to get.<br />
<br />
There was one other particular benefit to the 'make offer' people.  If you ran into one that was really willing to use it as a tool towards negotiating a price, you usually knew you had a smart trader on your hands.  And they were always the most fun to deal with, since you could trade more than just items for pp, you could work out deals involving multiple items.  Which was great for moving 'inventory' that didn't seem to be selling.</div></div><hr />

I don't know the prices of most of the items out there.  I'm a roleplayer, not a trader.  In the off chance that I DO see an item in auction that I would like to have, probably don't know the price.  When I tell them &quot;How much&quot; and they say &quot;Make an offer&quot; I either respond with something super low, or how much I am willing to spend.  Don't like my offer?  Then tell me how much you want for it.  And in most cases, shouting &quot;PC on such and such item&quot; gets ignored completely.</div></div><hr />

Alright, In my opinion, thats just anal and your seeking attn, but lets not go there, thats not the point.<br />
<br />
<br />
My major problem isnt so much with EQ, but a few (recently popular or at least moreso) phrases that have infiltraded the english language.<br />
<br />
&quot;how come&quot;  The fucking word is WHY, not &quot;how come&quot;   how come makes no sense what so ever, think about the words used there, at BEST, the stretch could be &quot;how did that come to be&quot;  and you cannot just eliminate that entire sentance for 2 words...<br />
<br />
secondly, &quot;On accident&quot;  wtf is this...   the phrases are &quot;On purpose&quot;  and &quot;By accident&quot;  you wouldnt say &quot;By purpose&quot;  so why &quot;on accident&quot;.   This one especially just reeks of suburbian soccer mom influence.<br />
<br />
in regards to the other ones mentioned, i was a big time buyer and seller in the pre-bazaar days, often spending 8+ hours a day sitting aroudn in GFay just to get stuff low, and i must say, for anyone who isnt attempting to quickly offload large quantities of cheap gear, &quot;Make an offer&quot; is (or at least should be) heaven.  I have picked up more cheap gear making offers and sold it at slightly above price than anyone ever can without looking for accidents in bazaar pricing (always sad to see fbss or similar items going for 250 by accident =\ )<br />
<br />
Also, im surprised no one else mentioned &quot;gg&quot; no one seems to know what it really stands for other than good game in fps's, so its rather pointless...<br />

<br />
Having grown up in a rather.... rural setting, I can tell you with certainty that there is a certain portion of the US population that have used the phrase &quot;how come&quot; to supplant the proper &quot;why&quot; for a very long time.  It's not new, it's not &quot;l33t&quot;, it's just hillbilly.<br />
<br />
I have a feeling that the phrase &quot;on accident&quot; could be attributed to these people too, so I am beginning to think that EQ has finally found it's way to our undereducated bretheren in the remote hills and farmlands.  Go down South or into the &quot;amber waves of grain&quot; regions and say something to the locals to the effect of &quot;I would like to have you dump a bucket of cow dung on my head.&quot;<br />

<br />
Words that 'shouldn't be'?  Those must be words that go against God.<br />
<br />
I don't know about 'GG' in Everquest, the only time I ever see it is in games like Quake, Unreal Tournament and the like...it doesn't mean 'good going' there, it means 'good game', and they usually type it in the few seconds between a round ending and the next round loading, so often you really don't have enough time to type the whole thing.</div></div><hr />

People who don't spell out words, like:<br />
<br />
Anyone... instead they type &quot;NE1&quot; or &quot;any 1&quot;.<br />
<br />
or Y R U here... instead of why are you here.<br />
<br />
That's just the tip of the iceberg.  I'm sure you have seen other examples of that laziness (imho) /snicker :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

/r Sorry! Your request contained misspelled usages of &quot;you&quot; or &quot;please&quot;. Please spellcheck and try again!<br />

<br />

What gets me is all the wigger_thinking_you_be_black talk that comes from forums and chat channels. You black bitch ? No ? Then STFU and start acting like the hillbilly you truly are. I know you're all computer geeks, and true gangsta_type's are not going to be playing EQ. Maybe a few, not many though. Using wigger talk pisses me off. Yah. Also people who use _ to break up words that shouldn't be (haha). STFU is stupid too. GG means good going. Stupid also. How hard is it to type grats or good going man. <br />
<br />
Slot off Fragface!   (Let's see who remembers that!) <br />
<br />
Personally I think this shows that you are a tiny bit rascist. Who cares what color their skin is? If they want to dress / talk a certian way, who gives a shit? <br />
<br />
Wigger is such a lame ass term.</div></div><hr />

I've been cussed out and laughed at for making an offer out of sheer ignorance as to the &quot;true&quot; price of the item.<br />
<br />
Yeah, I really, really like the Bazaar.<br />
<br />
I have a habit of using *LOL*, LOL, and *laughs* too often but in all honesty, I'm just easily entertained so I do find myself chuckling quite a bit. <br />
<br />
I was totally baffled when people started using &quot;w00t&quot; in EQ... two years ago or so. I still don't understand it entirely but, alas, I have started using it myself.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, I refuse to ever shorten any of my typing to y, r, u, or any of that crap. This game was intended to be a role-playing game and I'm going to be the last one to keep that way if I have to be. Bleach.<br />
<br />
I don't agree with the use of the term &quot;wigger&quot; but the whole hip-hop subculture grates on my nerves about as much as &quot;OMG u suk!!11!!1.&quot; Is it stupidity, ignorance, or laziness that causes people to say &quot;axed&quot; or &quot;axe&quot; instead of &quot;asked&quot; or &quot;ask?&quot; And what the hell is wrong with people that say, &quot;fo sho!&quot; instead of &quot;for sure?&quot; I understand that it might have started out as &quot;for sure&quot; being spoken in a different dialect from my own but when idiot white 17 year-olds in pants to big for them and overpriced sweatshirts sewn by sweatshop workers, it just pisses me off.<br />
