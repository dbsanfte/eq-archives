<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kursedd1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well i got mine, after myself and 2 other tanks died. The casters i assume opened up a gate of nukes. Didnt think any thing of him con'ing red to me at 65. So its safe to assume that he is 66+. been studying this for a while never saw much on his lvl change. But Piffft, I got mine so  now i know and so do u.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Yrgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Grats:P I got mine yesterday too... Were you at my battle?  Wasted me and 2 tanks... then the rangers and casters took him down while the shammy tanked.  Definitely red to 65. I seemed to have missed the level change too. But, then I wasn't actually planning to ever get my epic.</div></div><hr />
