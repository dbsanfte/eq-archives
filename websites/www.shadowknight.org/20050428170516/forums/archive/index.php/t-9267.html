<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Seizaer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does race play a part in dmg/hit mitigation? As a troll, I seem to get beat on more than small races. I noticed the same thing with a friend who's a troll warr. Any legitimacy to this or am I imagining things?<br />
<br />
p.s. - hello sk.org!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gwenix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Don't know if it's just a class thing or a gear thing but it's not a race thing. I play a human sk and even if it's a troll or ogre pulling trying to hold agg when I head at the thing with my twohander it always jumps on me before I even attack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grimiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I play with a 62war that dual wields fleshgrinders and I find my lance of thunder pulling agro off him just from attacking (no taunt or any spells). god forbid i cast a spear or something. im an iksar btw. <br />
<br />
sure, i could hit him with a voice spell, but what fun is that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grimbad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Strength gives you a higher maximum damage.  It's not much, and barely noticeable for 1 handers, I think 5 strength adds 1 damage to your max for your primary weapon, and as far as I know doesn't do anything for offhand.  At least, from what I gleamed from the Glade during my time as a ranger.  There are, of course, caps on this, based mostly on level and on the weapon's base damage.  That'd be the only explanation I can give for it.<br />
<br />
What I DO know is that with a strength buff from a passing druid, I was bashing for 3 damage maximum more than I was before.  Could have just been that I wasn't bashing for my maximum before the strength buff, and I didn't do any parsing or anything like that.  It's something which I'm sure those number crunching Rangers have looked at, you might want to check there.  But make sure to cast Gather Shadows before you go, and before you return, as you might get shot or HTed on the journey  8 ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grakdrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">strength does not increase max dmg.  It just raises your atk so that you will hit that max damage more often.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">And once again, no one read the post... he was asking about mitigation.  IE: How much damage you DON'T TAKE on a hit from a mob...<br />
<br />
As far as I know, only AC and Class effect Damage Mitigation.<br />
<br />
There is, I believe, a separate mitigation table for Plate classes now vs. monks, rangers, etc, so that we take less damage on average successful mob attack than the other classes, as is due to plate wearing classes.  Actually, I think it might just be for Knight/Warrior classes.  I don't know how it works for Clerics and Bards.<br />
<br />
But I do know that this was talked about in the nerf on monks a few months ago.<br />
<br />
AC can be affected by armor, level and to a smaller extent AGI.<br />
<br />
But as far as mitigation differences for race, I have never heard that it makes a difference.   Logically, this would be a pretty hefty advantage to give to a specific race, and would seriously imbalance the races.   Of course, what you may be seeing as a &quot;racial&quot; mitigation penalty may indeed be due to the starting stats of the races.  If you have seriously low starting AGI and do not raise it above the 75 point minimum for max. AC efficiency, then you may be noticing a pointed penalty to your mitigation.  It might seem that it is a racial penalty, especially at lower levels, when gear stat boosts aren't able to overcome starting stat deficiencies, but it's probably not.  If you (as a Troll SK) and your Troll warrior friend are both noticing bigger than expected/normal hits versus a similarly leveled and equipped character of a different race, check your AGI and your AC.  Chances are you are either under 75 AGI or have significantly lower AC than the other character.</div></div><hr />
