<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>DConquest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">1st batch of new spells are out.  Let's get creative with them.  This is a new expansion, not PoP part 2.<br />
<br />
My take on a few spells.<br />
<br />
Rune of Decay - The stats don't matter really.  It'll be like a what, 2 dps increase from our 64 buff?  You want to make spell be a God send, increase the Duration.  We don't have the spell slots or time to be switching this spell in every 17 min to buff our pet.  <br />
<br />
Theft of Hate - Ok, ENOUGH with the short duration BS.  Please play a High lvl Shadowknight in an Exp group.  Make sure to don your handy wrist brace.  We CAST TONS per mob.  Aggro spells, Zev Bites, AC Buffs, Lifetaps, snares, etc.   All these short duration buffs don't help.  Take a look at this..<br />
<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=2577&amp;source=Test<br />
<br />
This is what an SK group buff should be like.  6 min, not 8 ticks.  Please make sure you can click it off and make it STATIC.  You know, it doesn't degrade with time.  Make it 130 atk to your group and KEEP it that way.  The dps difference doesn't warrant the fancy coding.    <br />
<br />
Theft of Pain - Another short Duration buff.  3 min at least please, and do away with the degrading effect.  Also, this should be buffing us over 200 ac ( or 50 Warrior AC... AC works differently for us remember? )  <br />
<br />
Bond of Inruku - Good direction on this spell.  3 sec cast so it can be brought down with focus.  Needs to do more a tick though.  105 a tick for 500 mana.  See this?<br />
<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=1616&amp;source=Test<br />
<br />
Yeah, stop trying to be slick.  This should be even stronger, like 160 - 180 a tick.   Make this unique for Shadowknights.   Add an Atk / AC debuff, along with DoT damage.  We're going to be tanking if we're using this.<br />
<br />
Cloak of Discord - Make it stack with either the Ranger's Strength of Nature OR Call of Rathe Lines.  I'd prefer SoN, but that's the offensive tank in me.  It's total BS the Pallies buff stacks with Call of Rathe and ours stacks with Neither.  <br />
<br />
Spears in general - it can't be stressed enough, please add a Resist Modifier or cut down the recast to 20 secs.  Having your 45 sec recast spell resisted makes dimishes it's overall potential.  Better to chain cast your lifetaps since you know they'll hit for full and not be resisted. Undead Scythes are a great example of how Spears should be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Been awhile since I have bothered to post here. Anyways couple points about our upcoming spells(Yes I realize they are not finished yet)<br />
<br />
SK HP Buff: AC:48  HP:450  DS:25  thanks<br />
<br />
SK-Dot-Snare: Increase the % of the snare to 65% or 70% and leave damage at 50 a tick then.<br />
<br />
SK Buff Proc: Combine Mental Horror recourse with Blackshroud Strike and make resist check -500 MR <br />
<br />
SK Pet Buff: DURATION = 1 HOUR  MINIMUM. Keep the haste % as per Augmentation of Death for all I care.<br />
<br />
SK Pet: Rogue pet. Its not like our pets tank fuck all.<br />
<br />
SK Lich: 22 mana/tick for 40 hps DURATION = 1 HOUR MINIMUM<br />
<br />
SK Attack-Tap: Recourse duration should at least = the recast timer ffs<br />
<br />
Ok and now for my ALL TIME MOST FUCKED UP CODED SPELL: Aura of Darkness<br />
What fucktard coded this spell?<br />
Ensure that if we get this new OOW upgrade you do it right.<br />
<br />
OOW-SK-Tap-Res<br />
Effect: -20 all resists <br />
Resist Check: UNRESISTABLE<br />
Duration: 6 mins<br />
Recourse: +40 to all resists (Self Only or Group)<br />
Recourse Duration: 6 mins<br />
<br />
I wont even get started on the UTTER USELESSNESS of our Terror spell line. You admit its broken, so fix it correctly, and no + more pure hate is not the solution within the current coding.<br />
<br />
More to come.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Pretty much agree with both of the above... I'll add my own comments later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5322&amp;source=Test<br />
<br />
I like this one.  They haven't touched our disease dot line since asystole, and this looks like a nice addition.  Nice damage, not too mana hungry, and some good debuffing.<br />
<br />
Cast time is too long if we're gonna cast it at all while tanking though.  Could be a nifty aggro spell if it was faster.<br />
<br />
Also notice that now the aura of pain upgrade recourse lasts longer than its recast time... and the aura of hate recast time is still longer than the recourse duration, but only by 12 seconds...<br />
<br />
Lifetaps need to be a much bigger heal.  Mob dps has what, doubled or tripled since we got these spells, and they were barely effective as heals then.  These days they'll barely keep up with ripostes, let alone make any difference while tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It's badly in need of a resist mod too.  Without one, it'll suffer the same fate as spears.  <br />
<br />
It's really looking like it'd be a good idea for them to give us a noticable disease debuff... it's the one resist that isn't normally debuffed, and a godaweful amount of our spells are disease-based with no/low resist checks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">/agree.<br />
<br />
Seems they replaced the resist tap with that dot... no huge loss to me if they don't add it back.  But maybe a 30 or 40 point unresistable disease debuffer?  Or... here's a thought, combine the debuff with  this dot.  Give it a mild resist adjust of its own, and lower DR a good bit for the duration.  Not sure spears and this dot are worth enough for us to mem the debuffer + the damage spell just so the damage will land.<br />
<br />
I do think the SK dots in Omens are shaping up nicely though.  We have pretty significant damage potential from dots... and the good thing about dots is you lose less melee casting them (cast once and let it sit, instead of recasting lifetaps non-stop).  They're all pretty fast dots, too.<br />
<br />
Dark Tendrils is a logical upgrade to festering, but doesn't get me terribly excited because we don't often use darkness for damage anyways.  And higher damage when you're pulling could be a detriment if it gets the mob summoning.<br />
<br />
Been playing around with spears a bit more lately... they suck ass in earth, but they really aren't too bad in fire or water.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">They should just give us Malicious Decay (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3386&amp;source=Test) - It's not like the shammys use it anyway.  <br />
<br />
As for loosing the Aura of Darkness upgrade, that one had some potential.  Even aura of darkness gets used occasionally even at the higher-end.  An upgrade would certainly see use as well, and would be a wonderful asset to the lower end crowd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Maybe.  More often than not I don't bother because generally it's used on fights with AE heals... and it's as likely to block an incoming heal due to full buff slots as it is to make the difference in you actually resisting something.  When you consider you've got an SK throwing 1 or 2 recourses on the group and you need room for 1-2 MGB heals... that's a lot of buff slots.<br />
<br />
Maybe it won't matter once the ability to raise buff slots is in play (btw, anyone else think it's stupid that fixes for things like arbitrary buff slot caps actually cost us AA's?  Seems like they're making us pay for their lack of forsight in game design).<br />
<br />
As for getting a debuffer, it'd be handy, but... I'm wondering which other spell I'm not going to use so I can toss that on every mob.  We really, really need a break on spell gems, we're tighter on them than a lot of other classes.  Moving DP to a hotkey would be a nice start.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">DP on a button is an absolute MUST by OoW... it's rumored we may even be getting free AA's before then - if so, make sure DP on a button is included.  <br />
<br />
Uses for AoD are pretty situational, but it has some.  At the lower-end, it is pretty valuable.  It's not a great loss, but its a spell I wouldn't have minded seeing an upgrade too.  Increasing the buffslots would only serve to make it less situational.  <br />
<br />
The disease debuff wouldn't be something you'd necessarily use all the time.  Tanking XP groups you don't really need it; in a DPS role you should have room for it.  On raids, you could even cast it and switch - its got a plenty long duration.  Juggling spells and balancing spell slots will always be a challenge for us, but a resist debuff could be a very useful spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Belyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The rogue pet is not the way to go, it will help only the highest lvl sk operating at the lowest end of the game.  Even being careful and having pet hold, the rogue pet is WAY to fragile and for that fact so is the monk pet.  Most the necros i knew back in the kunark days retired the 53 rogue pet for their 49 pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I highly doubt he means the 53 necro rogue pet.  <br />
<br />
A rogue pet, designed specifically for SK's, however, would be quite welcome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Malicious Decay is a good start, but as I play a shaman and use that for my sk friends, I always wish it had a poison resist decrease on it too to help thier spears.  1 SK debuff with both, would it be too overpowereing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Spears are disease...<br />
<br />
Besides, poison already gets debuffed - disease doesn't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>cames</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">We do have a resist debuff, well okay its a tap.  The issue with it is that it is often resisted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>DConquest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Sounds cool, but we already have too much to cast.  The ac / str debuff sounds good, but is it really going to cripple a mob?   Our spells need to stop being 15 lvl ago Necro Hand me downs.<br />
<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=1615&amp;source=Test<br />
<br />
Look at this...<br />
<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spelllist.html?classes=PAL&amp;source=Test<br />
<br />
How many of those Paladin spells are Cleric hand me downs from 15 lvls ago?<br />
<br />
or this...<br />
<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spelllist.html?classes=RNG&amp;source=Test<br />
<br />
15 lvl ago Druid hand me downs anywhere?<br />
<br />
We use our spells for different reasons, we are a different class.  First of all, neg Str has no parsable effect on mob damage.  It should debuff atk, ac where it is NOTICEABLE.  When a Paladin Stuns a mob, it makes a NOTICEABLE difference to their dmg output.  I don't want to waste mana to get a cool debuff message that does nothing in real time, we got better DoTs for dmg.<br />
<br />
It should be fast casting, low duration, and low enough mana to cast frequently.<br />
<br />
Btw Slein is right, the only Poison line we get is &quot; Bloods &quot;.  Spears, Debuffs are disease.  Undead spears are Magic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Ya, it's clearly a hand me down, I mean... It's not like it's actually better than CoC, oh wait thats right... it is!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Xanathol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Did the numbers on the upcoming heal spells for pallies as listed in lucy today versus sk taps, using today's AAs, no foci:<br />

So the broke parts are the reuse timers across the board, the efficency of self-only lifetaps, HoT, and a couple of cast times. I was surprised how nicely our group tap compares, well, outside of reuse timer.<br />
<br />
Also, never noticed, but Hand of Piety is NOT tied to LoH, while Imp LoH is a req...and why is Leech tied to HT???<br />
<br />
Correct my numbers if wrong...I'm sure you will. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Well if they Unhooked the link between HT/IHT and Leech Touch, placing them on seperate timers. (Similar to LOH and Hand of Piety) <br />
<br />
This would make Leech Touch AA somewhat useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>DConquest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Lvl 56 Necro Spell:  Cessation of Cor<br />

<br />
DC ( Ironic huh? )  decreases str 10 more, AC 3 more, costs 40 mana less, and has 1.1 more cast time.  Nothing much different.  Looks like a slightly modifed hand me down to me.  <br />
<br />
Is this really going to have any  noticable ( parsable ) effect on mobs?  This is essentially another 100 per tick DoT that'll get resisted a lot, that we won't have the spell slots to Mem.<br />
<br />
Please Scrap this spell and add neg 70 ac / 70 atk to Bond of Inruku.  Make it more unique than another Aliased Necro spell.  <br />
<br />
Instead give us a real DEFENSIVE type spell.  Something like the Fear2 spell, or a Melee Immunity Spell, or a mob accuracy reducer, etc... Something we'd actually use thanks.</div></div><hr />

I'm starting to take the opinion of just add disease to the malo lines.  I havn't been able to come up with a reason not to, and it'd go a long way to improving the viability of our disease lines.</div></div><hr />
