<br />
I salute the choice.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chayde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The Community Team would like to take a moment to thank everyone who applied to be a correspondent.  We received many wonderful applications and the decision was very difficult, but the decisions have been made.  Should the need arise in the future for new correspondents we will ask for your applications at that time.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Before announcing who was chosen to be the shadowknights correspondent, I would like to tell you a little bit about what we see as the role of a correspondent.  The role of a correspondent will be to help us gather information; unfortunately we may miss posts on each board so these folks will be our extra eyes and bring posts we may have missed to our attention.  They will float posts that they feel the community should comment on, and we may also rely on them to start posts to gather information, and to bring posts regarding bugs to our attention.  Each correspondent will have access to a correspondent only board to ask questions, have discussions and bring information to our attention.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Now without further ado, please join me in welcoming Brael as the correspondent for the shadowknights.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Ky<br />
<br />
<br />
Good luck Brael.<br />

<br />
Class representatives like they appointed just now are the same as in AO, there are 2 class proffesionals that have the HUGE &quot;responsobility&quot; of making collages of posts and community thoughts and pass them to some pointed SOE spokesman who on his turn gives it to devs. <br />

Anything is better than nothing at this point, and if nothing happens, well, nothing's happened before, but now we can blame Brael for it. <br />

It's a win/win.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A few thoughts after you get multiple PMs and multiple flames about what is or is not happening...<br />
<br />
1) Buy lots of asparin<br />
2) When that fails, try some beer.<br />
3) When that fails, try some mind altering drugs.<br />
4) Tell people to F' off once in a while.<br />
<br />
However,<br />
<br />
1) Keep an open mind<br />
2) Remember SKs play this game at all levels and different lengths of time<br />
3) We all want something different out of our &quot;play&quot; time<br />
4) Honey gets you more flies then vinegar.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Edit: I just checked the Paladin &amp; Warrior boards, and those imbeciles at SoE picked random nobodies who aren't close to the cutting edge content, don't post much, and noone ever heard of. /shudder</div></div><hr />

<br />
I disagree about a &quot;correspondant&quot; being a joke and useless.  Someone has to troll through the endless mountain of bullshit we all come up with and try to find the gems in it all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Heap</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">Well maybe there's hope for SOE afterall.  Honestly, who here expected them to choose someone with a clue for the job?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>Chayde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">You know what sucks here?<br />
<br />
In a few months all these same people who are saying &quot;grats&quot; and &quot;Couldn't pick a better person&quot; and  &quot;it doesn't matter if nothing changes&quot; will be flaming Brael because the SoE team decided to upgrade warriors again, and not knights.<br />
=o( That would suck.<br />
<br />
<br />
Brael was a good choice, because he already has to shuffle through each and every post just to moderate the forums. I know I don't read all the posts. (well maybe in the flame on section, and the arena) But the other threads, I only look for posts that might influence me one way or the other. <br />
<br />
Brael gets the displeasure of figuring out a way to post something to SoE, without being negitive, because it will be censored.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u79"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p79">The paladin rep already seems to have jumped into the job taking a quick poll on the GoD trial changes and I was wondering if Brael was going to start a thread on the sk section?</div></div><hr />

But I hope SKs get also a nice piece from that birthday cake called OoW since I highly doubt that anything will happen before the release.. They will implement the changes into the lvl 66-70 package I'm sure of... :(<br />
Lets hope it will be a nice package and not some fuck like GoD.</div></div><hr />
