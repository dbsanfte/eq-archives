<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ive been trying to get this fuckin guy to spawn all night...<br />
I read the /gaurd trick with pets but he just faces the damn giants at the door to kael.<br />
Is there a better way or better place to stand to get your pet to locate this npc.  All that time with tradeskills i didnt wanna do just to hit this silly timesink =/<br />
btw ive killed the giant gaurds in front of kael also then he just faces every wooly mamoth, giant or other crappy mob in EW.<br />
is there certain Loc's to get tanik or the KDS to spawn</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Koldariah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Try the top of the ramp. Pet /guard works very well. There is an exact spawn location if you look it up on Allah's, can't remember right now and dont have time to look.<br />
<br />
Took me maybe an hour with my BST friend using his warder to guard at the top of the ramp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Stugein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Agreed.  The pet guard trick is the fastest way to do this.  Just park your guard at the top of the ramp.  So long as the giants by the entrance at the bottom of the ramp aren't the closest, it should work.  There really isn't another simple way to do it aside from running around and hoping you trip over him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nincom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Park your pet near the tree on the side of the ramp to Kael, coming from the GD zone line, that is the best place I have found that guy.  Pet guard is the best way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mordraeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">He changes spawn locations. There isn't one specific spot you can find him. I've helped two people do this now, and both were in different spots. Just have your pet guard at the top of the ramp and you should be able to find him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">so its always in the same general area around the kael ramp on the GD side?<br />
I got the KDS to spawn a couple of times last night, but never the stupid dwarf...anyway thanks for the replies folks, gonna have to try this again tonight i guess ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Oagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">There are about 8 spawn points/traps around the Kael entrance, and Tanik can be at any of them.  Pick a spot about 1/3 of the way and up from the entrance to Kael (where the guards are).  The pet should now face away from Kael.<br />
<br />
Walk directly in the path that the pet is facing.  Walk slowly.  Don't run.  If you stay on line with the pet, you'll spawn the KDS or Tanik.<br />
<br />
I've done this about 20 times for people, because my SK is ally giants, so the KDS is no problem when they pop.  Word of mouth has resulted in my getting several tells from strangers asking for help, and if I'm not busy, I'll usually do it.  If you know someone that is a pet class and is on Giant faction, they'll find it quicker, because they don't have to run to Kael every time the KDS pops (I presume you're doing this alone and can't solo the KDS).<br />
<br />
Tanik's there.  Good luck to you.  It will be a little slower, since you're doing the Coldain quests and giants are KoS.  Just move him (the pet) out a bit.<br />
<br />
I usually have my best luck on the GD side, up by the top of the ramp, not the beach side with the trees.  Don't waste a lot of time on the spot given by Alla's.  It's only one of several, and he can be at any of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zakton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">He isn't in the same spot since I have gotten the death squad randomly a few times running from GD to Kael.</div></div><hr />
