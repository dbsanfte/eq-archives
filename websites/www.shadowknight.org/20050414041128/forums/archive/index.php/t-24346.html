<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KlaoofQuell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I thought of something a few minutes ago and see in anyone thinks it would be feasable. Would it be possible for two sk's to ping pong a raid target between them by SK #1 hitting the target with ToD and SK #2 hitting it immediately after that with an arrow and then casting ToD. Would be nice if they could generate a large amount of agro, then drag it back to the raid and have the MT AoE taunt and be way up on the hate list and enabling everyone to go into full burn mode just a few seconds after MT has taken agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">distance agro would override the tiny difference generated by &quot;an arrow&quot;.<br />
anyway, warriors can just hit furious to start with a ton of agro, or AE taunt after a ranger weaponshields and builds agro.</div></div><hr />

The answer is yes. In my old guild I used to do stuff like this with permarooted mobs, I'd spend the 2-4 mins people are preping for the fight chain casting agro spells to the point where the MA walks up, hits taunt, I then FD, and the warrior has so much agro they could afk with attack off and not have to worry. I also kind of do this with the guild I'm currently raiding with because they insist that warriors trash tank. I just fling around agro spells and after they over taunt me I Fd, makes the crapiest warrior look like they generate knight agro. I ussually don't do it ith non-rooted boss fights though, for lots of reasons that involve a horrible death.<br />

You really wouldn't be ping ponging for uber aggro, you're really not gainging a subtatial amount of hate doing that, you're just making 2 seperate sk's have as much as if 1 sk would just chain ToD.<br />

I don't think he ment to pig pong so the warrior gains SKx2 agro, I think it he ment for the SKs to ping it back and forth so they have the time to generate the amount of agro they want to hand off to the warrior, like how some monks pulling Uqua will FD ping pong trap mobs so that they stay with the monks and you don't have to fight the whole trap at once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>BludrainHalovex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Actually... just a small spoiler.  With perma rooted mobs, the main (only) thing you need to do for aggro is stand closer to it than everybody else.  Shouldn't touch anybody else unless it rampages.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Darkmourn D`Estrellas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It was my understanding permarooted mobs aren't actually rooted, they just have a runspeed of zero.  Which is why just being closest won't work.  They still summon and have normal aggro rules, they just can't move other than spinning.<br />
<br />
EDIT:  I suppose in some way they are rooted, since they don't get pushed all over the place, but as far as aggro rules, they are not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>BludrainHalovex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Dunno, I've always just been able to thwack away at them and not even shamans could snag aggro off me.  (last test of this was some elemental for mage epic under lava, dont remember the zone)</div></div><hr />
