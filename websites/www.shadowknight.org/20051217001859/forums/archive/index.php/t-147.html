<br />
I have about 3k to spend on one, im very poor :(.  There seems to be a gap in twohanders between the under 1k(like argent defender ) end and the high end ( like argent protector and dizok thingy ), Im hoping that someone can help me out.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have my SK camped at toiler hill in ME right now, been soloing the toilers on my necro trying to get a SoG to drop, im at the verge of giving up.<br />
<br />
Also I know that generally for onehanders you want low delay, but ive heard that the damage bonuses on two handers are better with high delay, is this true?<br />

<br />
Do they just *want* to get yelled at?<br />
<br />
As for something around 3K, the 30 40 &quot;no other stats&quot; velium two handers are doable.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Byttorr Ebonknight</div><div class="date">03-27-2002, 03:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Damage bonuses are greater for higher delay, yes. However, for newbie use, personally I would recommend a lower delay 2HS for a couple of reasons. The first reason is that newbies miss a lot, so each time you miss or hit for minimum damage you're digging yourself a hole. Using a lower-delay 2HS will increase your reps and allow you more chances to hit. It will also allow you more chances to increase the skill.<br />
<br />
The second reason is that at least until about 30 or so, even &quot;low-end&quot; weapons are still tremendously powerful compared to the sorts of weapons that existed when the game was released. Kunark-era and later weapons have disgustingly-powered ratios compared to what original EQ had. Even a &quot;low-end&quot; 2HS nowadays surpasses the uberest of the uber 2HS &quot;back in the day.&quot; Notice there's just not much concern anymore about good ole Karg's Zweihander, once considered by many to be THE 2HS to have. <br />
<br />
My suggestions for good 2HS that would be more than adequate for low level use and can be bought on the cheap: <br />
<br />
Runic Carver: 18/37. Can be had for under 150pp or effortlessly camped by your mage outside Chardok. Might even look menacing in a gnome's hands.<br />
<br />
Mithril 2-Handed Sword: 21/40(?) Built-in haste effect lowers its delay dramatically, giving this weapon the damage bonus of a &quot;slow&quot; 2HS with the speed of a fast 2HS. 500pp or so, varies by server. Downsides, it &quot;looks gimp.&quot; Looks just like a rusty or FS, so if you want something that looks impressive, this isn't it.<br />
<br />
As for the &quot;dizok thingy&quot; being high end, its a nice weapon, but I tried for almost 3 weeks to sell one and darn near couldn't give it away.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dragon Necropolis two handers:  1-3kish<br />
Velium Battle Axe 2HS 30/40 (perhaps cheapest b/c not alot of people like the axe look)<br />
Velium Claidhmore 2HS 30/40 (standard, most commonly sold on my server)<br />
Velium Brawlstick 2HB 30/40 (more expensive because caster/priest/monk can use)<br />
Velium War Lance 2HP 30/40 (prolly most expensive since alot of people like the war lance look)<br />
<br />
there are lots of variations on these weapons with different ratios (weighted velium brawl stick, aged velium claidhmore, etc.)<br />
<br />
Arbitors Combine Greatsword 30/46 15wis (pally junk 2HS) - 1kish<br />
<br />
Blade of Loathing 30/43 plus stats (great look 2HS) 3kish<br />
<br />
damage bonus on two handers are similar until 40 delay, past that point they get much bigger comparatively scaled<br />

threads like these really should be in the Equipment Discussion board :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

And wtf is with people saying &quot;Oh woe is me I only have 80k in bank, wank, wank, wank&quot; I dunno who the hell died that you guys inherit so much cash, but I've been lucky to have 800pp in my bank at the peak of my times! <br />
It almost always all goes to peridots for raids, or when I can, try to lerch out enough to get some slight armor upgrade.<br />
<br />
AAAaaanyways, phew glad I got that out heh. <br />
Save yer cash, get a Mithril 2 Hander, that's I think the best you can get for the money. Usually on Xegony see em for 200-400pp, sometimes cheaper.<br />
<br />
Save the rest of yer platinum for other things.......or better yet, gimme some so I can sing your same lament!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your odds of missing have absolutely no effect on the efficiency of a slow or fast weapon.  If you miss 50% of the time, you miss 50% of the time, plain and simple.  If you're attack twice as fast because of a lower delay weapon, you're just going to miss twice as many times.  With the new 2H bonus, the important determining factor is weapon ratio.  Slower, higher damage weapons actually come out in front now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Efugia</div><div class="date">03-27-2002, 04:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Be aware of the damage caps below level 20.  I dunno what level your sk is, but before level 20, there's no point using a weapon with more than 14 damage.<br />
<br />
Until level 10, weapon DMG is rounded down to 10.  This means that nice 30/40 db rod really works like a 10/40 weapon.<br />
<br />

<br />
So, if you've gotta have a 2 hander (say you want to work on skill), I'd go with that 20/30 centi spear, use it til 20, and then maybe pick up a DN lance (30 - 32 damage, 36 - 40 delay, worst being 30/40, best being 32/39 or 30/36).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Groobash</div><div class="date">03-27-2002, 04:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">your max damage is capped at 20 until level 20 anyways (I think, it's been a long time LOL)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krazix</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 03:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nah, the pre 20 dmg cap isnt capped at 20<br />
<br />
My lvl 1 pally with a Shissar Knights Sword (10dmg 22 delay) Was hitting for 20 often, one of my other twinks along time ago (when runic carvers were awesome) was hitting for 36 before lvl 20.<br />
I think the cap of dmg, may be 39 (I've never gotten higher, although I should try with a weighted axe, and see what I hit for with my Gnome SK (lvl 9) )<br />
<br />
Anyway m2h is a good choice for low lvls, it carried my Ogre well into his 30's, and I only got rid of it, cause I got a really good deal on a better weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Blackeagle Dwimmerlaik</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 04:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the damage cap caps the damage rating of the weapon, not the actual damage you do when you hit<br />
<br />
give a newbie str buffs up to 255 str, group with and cast torrent of hate, have a shammy cast avatar on em, get a ranger to cop em and they'll be hitting for WAY above the caps that some people think are the caps... that's because the damage rating of the weapon is what is capped.  levels 1-10, weapon damage ratings are lowered to 10 (yields a 'max hit' of 21 in most cases) ... from 11-14 or 11-19, I forget which, the cap is raised to 14, so you can hit for up to 29 (14x2 +1), but stronger chars can hit over that, especially as they approach the level where the cap comes off, because their weapon skills are high enough to get them over the base</div></div><hr />
