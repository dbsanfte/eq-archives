<br />
I ask because I recently read somewhere than a necro cast Call of Bones on himself and thus in skeleton form had enough faction to do the quest.   If that's the case I have hope at some point of getting skeleton form via Shroud of Undeath,  Deathly Temptation or an amulet of necropotance.</div></div><hr />

Indifferent won't do, so illusions are out. I suppose a necro could try Dominate Undead to charm the foreman and then do the quest.<br />
<br />
The only viable solution I've heard that would work for you (and myself as well, having trashed OT faction) is Puppet Strings, from the golems in Fear, an all/all item with charges of a charm spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Attyla</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 06:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">While true, you need amiable faction to do the worker sledgemallet quest, you only need dubious to do the Protect the Shipyard (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=5) quest.  That quest (berzerker braids) will increase your VS faction.  Once your base is at dubious, then you can dispense with the Call of Bones charade.<br />
<br />
Never tried CoB to try and turn in the braids.  Don't know if it'll work.  Don't see why not though.  Should be easy enough to find out.<br />
<br />
Should take 80-100 braids to get from deep KoS to Dubious.  Then about 100-120 more from dubious to Amiable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I thought we were mega-KOS with VS, seeing how he and the outposters are in oppostiton to the rightful (us) inhabitants of Kunark.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I increased my faction to Aimable to get the OT hammer quest done, and have actualy held it at the lvl ever since for some odd reason. I guess it was in fact nice to have somewhere to bank in Kunark... But I am more than likley going to ruin it now. I got my Howling Stones key, and that dungeon is reason enough for me to trash it. Plus, since I am going to be building my Cabalis factions, there is now truley no need at all for me to have it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Once you can turn in the braids, it's just a matter of farming braids until you are amiable to get the hammer.<br />
<br />
Edit here: dang it, Naelael posted while I was posting, so I guess this won't work anymore<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nasiir</div><div class="date">03-29-2002, 01:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is lots of misinformation about on this subject.<br />
<br />
Yes, the quest was previously possible using clay golem potions. The potions boosted your existing faction a bunch, but even so, you could be so KOS that it wouldn't work. For instance, I knew dark elves who got too KoS hunting in HS to regain their faction using the potions (ie, even in ee form, they were still kos). It all depends on what faction hits you have taken. To illustrate the boost of the ct potion, I was able to raise my faction, still was scowling normally, but with the form, I was amaible, so I got my OT hammer when I normally was scowled at.<br />
<br />
Iksar start out only lightly kos, but it takes between 280-300whips to get from scowling to dubious. 280ish if you haven't taken any neg outpost faction hits, while 300, which is around what it took me, seemed to cover a couple times in kaesora (not something like farming spiders though, since they primarily give the hits I believe).  <br />
<br />
I believe that the necro forms won't work. I can't confirm them, other than by 2nd hand info, which I happen to have heard from a number of reliable sources. The only other way to do it would be to charm the captain, or if you have sneak, as is the case with monks, you can do the sneaking while partner hails trick to turn in whips.<br />
<br />
If verant puts the clay golems in feerot and has them drop the earth elemental potions (I heard they no longer reside in CT), or if you can somehow find 4 or 5 of them (if you load your entire bank with whips and your person, maybe only 2 potions or so would be needed. It took me 5 potions, handing in 76~whips per time), then it is doable. If not, then I don't see how nonmonk iksar will ever be able to get faction in the outpost anymore, which also means no hammer. In theory, if all you want is the hammer, and you haven't had any neg faction hits, then 1 potions might be enough to get the hammer if you load up your person and bank to the brim with whips.</div></div><hr />

So killing Faydedar a couple times will raise your faction high enough to do the war braid quest. Thou i didnt test it myself and cant say its 100% sure, but worth a try. Just ask around whenever a druid is going to finish his Epic and get a swing at Faydedar or even help out killing it.</div></div><hr />

Thank you all for your replies.    I'll let you know if I find something that works out.</div></div><hr />

I may just have a use for my puppet strings then :)  Always wanted the hammer, just refused to kill that many berzerkers, plus I really love Howling Stones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Attyla</div><div class="date">03-29-2002, 12:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My advice would be to use the puppet strings if you can get them.  Doing the braid work is a PITA if you are already KoS.<br />
<br />
Remember, the hammer doesn't proc till 50, so there isn't much advantage to farming braids before you are planar eligible.  If you are going to work faction, you might as well work Cabilis or FV faction (nice that goblins raise both).<br />
<br />
Unless you are doing it for the banking/binding that is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Walil</div><div class="date">03-29-2002, 03:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bah I was level 50 when I did the braids. Took me 10 hours to collect the 88 that I needed to get to amiable. I only wish I had hunted in the OT when I was level 30 so that I could have gotten exp from the whole boring mess. My advice, hunt a few levels through your 30's there and just get it out of the way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We're all well aware of that. If an enchanter or bard charmed him and while he was charmed anybody could do the quest, this issue wouldn't keep popping up. :)<br />
<br />
/auc Will donate for enchanter to charm skeletal foreman.<br />
<br />
Ah, if only it were so easy...</div></div><hr />

None of them stuck. I have 4 charges left and will try again once i get someone to tash the foreman first. Has anyone done this with the puppet strings and can confirm that he can be charmed with this item? And if they did, what level was they? Maybe i should wait till i get lvl 60, get my charisma buffed up, get the foreman tashed and maloed, then try the charm.<br />
