The Seru zone, and the Seru encounter, was originally designed, as I recall, by Kendrick, master of l33t overpowering. He actually meant for the Sword of Truth to be a USABLE drop. However, it was decided his vision of Seru sucked, and so the sword was made NONE/NONE. They left the sword on Seru pretty much purely so it could be eyecandy, since they didn't wanna redesign his char model so the sword was part of it. <br />
<br />
In other words, Sword of Truth is probably nothing but a red herring.</div></div><hr />
