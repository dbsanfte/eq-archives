<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kyfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My guild just dropped RZTW a week or two ago and just dropped Sol Ro last night, so I am flagged for all four elemental planes. We also are going DKP in a couple of weeks. I only became a full member a couple of months ago, did not really raid at all before, and have been unlucky on drops, so my gear is still pretty crappy.<br />
<br />
I was wondering if you could give me names and locations of any elemental named mobs which are doable with 1-3 solid groups (with better gear than me :)  ) and drop nice gear. I've done some research on Allakhazam, but the info there is very scarce, usually just idiots arguing about who should get the drops.<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated. I used Search but didn't come up with anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Water named in the chambers surrounding the zone in and Fire named in the first castle (one groupable), the Field of Gibb (one groupable), and the second castle (one to two groups).<br />
<br />
All the minis in Sol Ro are one groupable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shredderr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i'd say fire would be your best bet. there's the spider names that spawn near the zone in if you just stick around and kill some. or there's names in either castle, can spawn em while doin some picnic table grindin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>evilspawndark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What Siilvir said :P<br />
<br />
Woot, first post - so informative.</div></div><hr />

For Knight items first when you zone into fire hug the right wall to the Jopal Village which is easy to clear, decent XP and drops Knights Gleaming Mace.<br />
<br />
In Castle 1 Captain and Vicar of Fire spawn which drop basalt bulwark and charm of defense, both nice knight items.<br />
<br />
In Field 2 which a lot of people don’t clear nameds spawn frequently and drop 85 hp mana haste cloaks.<br />
<br />
In C2 in fire the nameds drop a 90hp/mana ring with regen 2 and a 115hp earring <br />
<br />
All mini named in Eps are one groupable easy, the hard part isn’t killing them its finding them up. Your best bet is to zone in after a patch and track every EP zone.</div></div><hr />
