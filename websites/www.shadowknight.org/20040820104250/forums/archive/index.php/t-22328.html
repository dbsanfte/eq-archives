<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>BluekiKatana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Where can I find these mobs? Been looking for a Siren myrmidon (Sirens Grotto) for the assist Silverwing quest, but I can't seem to find any. Maps here are useless too. Can anyone give me some detailed directions to find a camp with these mobs? I've been aimlessly running around SG looking for this mob. The chances of me finding it are pretty bleak that way, but I haven't heard from any source on where in the zone this mob is exactly. Could a level 65 ele geared SK with 285 AA's solo the camp? Any info on this would be appreciated. <br />
Much Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ShkahlTP</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I beleive the myrmidons hang out at the bottom of the &quot;well&quot; up near the WW zone, same area as the mistress of darkwater, i could single pull most of the ground floor mobs at 63 and im sure my gear is inferior to yours, they didnt seem all that hard (group was a ranger, chanter, cleric, and bst) just dont chain agro the bitch at the top of the ramps and you should be fine.</div></div><hr />
