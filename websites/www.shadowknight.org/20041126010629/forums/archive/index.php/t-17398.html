<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>cames</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I think this needs to be examined.  If we look at three scythe spells:<br />
<br />
Level 49 cost 200 AP<br />
Level 54 cost 410 AP<br />
Level 64 cost 650 AP<br />
<br />
The non-linearity really strikes me.  Now for those level 65s, a mid-50s person receives around 20 AP per successful adventure.  This means the level 49 spell cost 10 adventures, the 54 20 adventures (plus or minus).  For a level 65, it seems to me that 13 adventures is whats required.<br />
<br />
Given that I am not 49, it may be that 13 - 15 adventures is a good number for that level to obtain the level 49 Scythe spell.<br />
<br />
So, my suggestion is that the cost of the level 54 spell be changed to around 300 APs.  I am not clear if there are other inequitites in the system.<br />
<br />
However, this does lead me to another question.  A level 20 char receives about 1AP per adventure.  A level 65 receives 51 point per adventure.  The delta here is 45 levels and 50 points.  In round terms about 1 point per level (1.1 is more accurate but I like round numbers for this example).  So, to me a level 55 should receive about 30 points per adventure which would fix the cost of the level 54 spell.<br />
<br />
Has anybody else noticed this lack of linearity?<br />
