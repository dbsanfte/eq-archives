No drop of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Askeer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Sounds good to me Ganaith !<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Ganaith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Ok, lets make it a bit more in tune for us sk's.<br />
<br />
The quest is given by hailing Phara Dar in VP. Of course, he will only speak to you at max ally, and when you have maxed elder dragon language. He wants the paw of opalla (no drop, no rent one) and 4 ashenbone drake hides, which especially for the enjoyment of it all will be no rent as well. Then, because we want to stay in trend with the current old school drops, we head for another great item of importance! Stormfeather (which everyone loves so badly) has a nice quest on the side for us to fill our enjoyment. Oh, he only speaks to you when you maxed out your hidden animal faction (ha, you didnt realise that when you killed that kodiak, did you!) and desires a few minor items of importance. Of course, they are easily obtainable! only the 10th coldain ring, the coldain shawl and 2 times the scepter of shadows! (of course, it being lore, you would need to deliver, instantly do it again, and head back. did i mention the hidden animal faction?) Then he directs you with this gift package to Zlandicar! Our lovely overcamped soloable friend that has about 2 minutes to live after server up! Oh, max ally of course. And max elder dragon. Fek it, the last part of the quest dialogue he speaks in a form of kobold and fairy. Speaking about fairies, after this its of course time to visit the ever so lovely fairy village! (you didnt kill a fairy, did you?) The quest dialog of course starts at max fairy faction, and is only obtainable by max ally faction. OUr princess gives us a very great important quest! This is an ever so lovely tradeskill quest, which brings us to all the fun pieces in the world! First, a fishbone earring, and the ring from our cyclops friend (only obtainable by hailing him at max hidden cyclops faction, and when speaking a dialect of ogre/troll/clopsis) But that is not enough! We are having way too much fun! We head for inner acrylia and hail our elusive Khati Sha the Twisted, who speaks to you at max ally, and max grimling language. (this is starting a trend, i tell you!) He wants a nice crafted piece of pink clothing to match his exitement. Of course, you need a master needle to craft this, and another scope of 12 drake hides! unfortunatly, the last piece required is from Plane of Sky 7th island, off our mad friend (rare drop of course, only attackable with max lunatic faction and max halfling language) This package needs to be delivered to the ever so cozy and obtainable guards of the sleeper (you knew they had something to do with it, dont you!) who want a snack worthy of their attention. (250+cooking skills, needs holy water, branch off a planar tree, and the cloak from silvermane in SK and 250 sacrificed paladins's soulstones) After we deliver them their snack, they direct us to our friend Vulak`Aerr! He wants (after hailing him at max ally and max elder dragon, oh, and of course doing his event in ToV) a nice armor, crafted from all the bp drops in each plane of the SK class (yay! back to fear!) which is of course only combinable by a master armorcrafter with 250+ skills. (fail rate 25 to 1, naturally) The combine for this armor can only be done in the same forge the greenmist was crafted in (convience of course) and requires you to have at least the greenmist and inny's curse for the combine (he likes the armor nice and warped, spikey etc) Failure means the entire items breaks apart of course.<br />
<br />
After that, we head to corucust and tell him he...<br />

Wait, this might all be too easy.</div></div><hr />
