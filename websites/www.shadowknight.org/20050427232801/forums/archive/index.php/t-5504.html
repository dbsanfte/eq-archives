<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Burzum Durbatuluuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well I've become a bit bored with my main and have a lot of cash to burn so.... I've considered SK to be my new point of focus ( refuse to jump on the monk band wagon)... With the intensions of changing my main if I find my new character to be as enjoyable as I expect. Although unfortunately I've not very familar with the pulling aspects of EQ. What would most dictate my decision is what is more aventagious to pulling? No Frontal Stun or Natural Regen. <br />
<br />
So let me list the factors for each race:<br />
<br />
Ogre:<br />
<br />
1. No frontal stun<br />
2. Can wear new cultural/ Blood Ember (thus have better starting equipment)<br />
3. Better beginning stats. <br />
<br />
Iksar:<br />
<br />
1. Natural Regen and AC<br />
2. Less equiped armor wise due to cultrual sux :)<br />
3. Cooler Looks :)<br />
<br />
PS. the regen is a none factor solo wise, for I can hotbox a 60 Shaman. Although I know I need to put in group time to incorperate the change in rolls I have. Although as with most high lvl characters I already understand the basics of high lvl group dynamics just need to alter my focus now. I'd prob. just hotbox for AA's and to get up to higher lvl's (making me more attractive for grouping :) ).<br />
<br />
So I would love any insight on this subject. <br />
<br />
Thanx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Emwun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hehehe  I just jumped OFF the monk bandwagon.  and I started before it became the flavor of the month.<br />
<br />
if yer hotboxing a shammy then it all comes down to what you think is cooler man.  Play an ogre if you like the idea of thumping the crap outta stuff early and often.  Play an iksar if you are looking for a challenge and delayed gratification.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bulvyne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you were going to be a warrior, I'd recommend ogre right off the bat. Main-tanks in high-end raids benefit greatly from the non-stunnable from the front feature.<br />
<br />
I know as an inkie, I get pretty frustrated when I get stunned. But even so, it wouldn't make me want to play an ogre. <br />
<br />
At higher levels, your stats aren't going to be so important since you can get equipment/buffs to max the important ones, anyway.<br />
<br />
But the game isn't ALL about the high-end raid stuff anyway. It's about what you make of it.<br />
<br />
I would choose the race which YOU think you will find most enjoyable. Think about it from this standpoint: would either race make you want to login and play it a little more than the other? Iksar for looks? Ogre for sheer power? <br />
<br />
Then, go from there, and enjoy! :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Don't forget, either, that Trolls have natural regen AND can wear the Ogre Cultural armor.... Very nice prospect there.  But yes, it all comes down to your preference of play methods... If you want to thump the crap out of something, Ogre, Troll or Iksar wouldn't be a bad choice, because with the lack of mana on each of these, that's about all you're going to be able to do.<br />
<br />
Bah, disregard that, I'm just bitter that Groff only has 70 int and I'm having no love on figuring out what to do on equipment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Pheargore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">From memory, prices I've seen , etc.<br />
<br />
Crystal Spider Eyes: AC8 INT2 MANA35 (plus other crap) - 500-1000pp<br />
Sentient Helm: AC14 INT 7 MANA10 SVM5 - 300-500pp<br />
Sentient Greaves: AC12 INT 9 (other crap) - 300-1000pp<br />
Smithers Belt: AC10 3 to all stats: 300-750 pp<br />
<br />
There is a bunch of other INT gear.. Enable new interface, Go to Bazaar, type /bazaar then select Troll and Shadow Knight, then select INT for by stat. Click FIND. That should give you a fatter list:)<br />
<br />
Hope this helps Brudda<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Soulcarver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I chose a Ogre, mostly because they are unstunable from the front (that and they are just dead sexy).  I like to solo, and if there are several mobs attacking you at the same time, it can add up to alot of time you spend stunned.  If you don't solo alot, then this is a smaller factor for you.  If you do solo it is a fairly significant ability, exspecially at lower levels, when you can just toe-to-toe tank the mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>fendor stonesmith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have a human SK, I would have taken Iksar if thay where around when I started my SK(. <br />
<br />
But Humans are not all that bad I can Toe to Toe most all darkblue mobs with out lifetaping. But I have good gear. The stunning does get anoying some times but it is not hat bad.<br />
<br />
And the fact I dont have to do much fraction work to get in to most citys is a plus. With the exception of iksar need a lot of fraction work there. <br />
<br />
I enjoy him and that is the only reason I did not switch to an Iksar when thay came out. So if you enjoy an Oger then play an Oger........that is what it realy comes down to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Burzum Durbatuluuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Maybe I wasn't as clear as I need to be... One of the main points that I was looking for feedback on was which was more of a factor in End Game/High Lvl pulling? Would the no Frontal stun be more of an advantage than natural regen in terms of pulling? Since pulling is my main modivation for picking SK as my new class of focus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Emwun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">yelinak'd stun ya irregardless I'd imagine.  never seen him, thats just the general impression I get when I talk to people about him or most of the real big high-end mobs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Lizarde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">From around level 36 or 37 I fear kite almost excusively.  Therefore, being stunned isn't a real concern, unless I get adds or am running away, in which case not being stunnable from the front doesn't enter into the equation (Iksar SK here, currently 47).<br />
<br />
Dunno how this changes as you level up, but in groups where I am tanking being stunned isn't a big deal either.  For one, it doesn't happen often.  Second, with a good group there's enough damage being dealt by everyone around me.  All I need to do is keep the mob's focus (which has been made more difficult, but at this level is still very manageable).<br />
<br />
Regen, however, does make a difference.  But it is much more noticeable at lower levels.  I've made an SK from just about every race at some point or other (except gnome I think).  Take a human, untwinked, to your newbie area, and you're bound to have some downtime when you get that level 1 mob that you cannot seem to land a hit on (which can happen a lot at low levels :( ).  Take an iksar or troll to their newbie area, and you'll find that downtime is almost nil for several levels.<br />
<br />
At higher levels it isn't as noticeable because regening for 10 minutes can seem as long as regening for 20 or 30 minutes if you are impatient enough. :) But it does make a difference even then, in that you can get back into action quicker.  But by then you're fear-kiting more, or grouped with a healer, and at those times you're more concerned with mana regen than HP regen.  Except when things go wrong, anyway. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Moongarm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Jack V. Shit<br />
<br />
You've got a level 60 shammy stats don't matter one bit.<br />
<br />
Pulling-Ogres are unstunable from the front not the back there are times you have to babysit mobs by going backwards but 99.9% of the time you're facing away.<br />
<br />
Regen-Who cares you have a 60 shammy throw a cholroblast or tropor When I partner in SF with my friends shammy between slow and his regen I can kill like crazy.<br />
<br />
You can make your SK to 40 in no time with your shammy and then duo him up  you can make real great exp with just the two.<br />
<br />
Its the shammy that will make the difference not the SK. So any race is a viable choice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Bulvyne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hmmm, after reading over your post again, I have to say that with a 60 Shaman babysitting, I don't think it really matters which race you pick! :)<br />
<br />
You are most concerned about the pulling, especially at higher levels. Well, since most pullers I know pull and run, your back is to the enemy anyway, so the frontal-stun immunity won't rightly help much, as far as the pull goes, unless you plan on running backwards on all your pulls. :)  Let's say you're pulling, and you get beat down by the mob you pulled (maybe you were snared or rooted or something). Let's say you're too far away for your Shammy to run up and heal you, so you are lying there FD on the ground with 10 hp left. The Iksar should regen faster than the ogre, even if both have shammy regen. And as someone mentioned, at higher levels the 'regen' really isn't that big a deal, the regen feels very nice at lower levels, mostly.<br />
<br />
If you're an ogre, your shammy can shrink you.<br />
<br />
Your shammy can uber-buff you regardless of race.<br />
<br />
The only other real differences is that the Iksar will be hated everywhere (no big deal), and the ogre will probably have consistently better stats (because I think they start with a bit better stats).<br />
<br />
The Iksar &quot;can't wear Kunark armor&quot; limitation really isn't a limitation. You can't wear Umbral from Fear, but Greenmist armor is arguably better anyway. And all the &quot;high end&quot; armor I've seen on raids can be worn by Iksar, too, so I don't think that Iksar really have any sort of armor &quot;limitation&quot;, other than Blood Ember and Sentient (no big deal here either). The really important armors (TOV and up) are wearable by Iksar.<br />
<br />
Other than that, differences are pretty much cosmetic. Having the Shammy along for the ride really opens the door for you to pick any race you want! :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Grimbad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Iksar/Troll will get rezz'd less often after pulling something that the MA can't get off you in time.  Ogre has higher base stamina, so will die less often due to instantaneous damage (nuking).<br />
<br />
Either way, since you can box a shammie, those 3 are the best.  The racial exp penalty won't factor in on you as noticeably since you don't have downtime.<br />
<br />
Trolls can also wear the Ogre racial stuff (saweeeet, I know  8 )<br />
<br />
Once you get to 30 or so, you can start working on Giant faction, and get some Kael armor MQ'd.  At that point, the iksar's penalties die off.<br />
<br />
Since you really need to plug all your starting stats into stamina with an iksar, the fatties actually have a similar starting int compared.  (my troll has 82 base, Iksar has 85).<br />
<br />
Please though, if you go Ogre, put 5 into dex and agi first, then the other 10 into int.  A dwarven cleric friend of mine loses 41 AC for his agi falling under 75.<br />
<br />
EDIT:  Ogre, with dex and agi upped to 75, has 80 int.  Troll 82, Iksar 85.<br />
<br />
One more thing to consider, Iksar have racial bonuses to save vs fire, whereas trolls have negative 20 to fire saves.  Also, with the new bash rules, keep slam in mind.  It'll allow you to outdamage any paladin, and most rangers and monks until you hit post 50/AA, thereby causing more aggro to tank better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>burzum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Lol come on bro make an Iksar that way there ll be two Burzum playing a SK iksar :p<br />
<br />
Burzum Tal'illiam from Karana ;)<br />
<br />
PS: black metal rules ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Pheargore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">With the introduction of Harmshield to the SK class, this is now less of an issue.<br />
<br />
Ogre's are unstunnable via Bash etc. stuns, Spell stuns will land no matter which god you face in the sky. RooT/Snare etc as well.<br />
<br />
The amount of HP you regen will only matter if you plan on FD'in for more than 2 minutes on the pull. With regen, you regen FD much faster than races without regen (if they even do, not sure)<br />
<br />
But then on a high level encounter, the cleric, druid, shammy, pally can heal you while you are FD once the MOB is out of aggro range. Or you can have some Regen items in Inventory to swap in..<br />
<br />
That all being said, I rarely get stunned from the front on pulls as a Troll when I baby-site pull them backwards.<br />
<br />
From the back I get stunned way more anyway as my chance to riposte, dodge etc. is not there.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Countic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Here is a decent answer to your question if you are talking about high end raids.  Non-frontal stun is completely useless when you are pulling mobs in raids because-as you can guess-you are running away from the mob therefore your back is to it and you will be stunned anyways.  If you want to be a main tank frequently then ogre may be the way to go.  As for pulling, iksars and trolls are the way to go.  The reason is that regen makes a HUGE difference when pulling in many situations.  You get hurt and are away from camp, gotta wait to get up until your health is decent-regen is what is going to cut your time in half.  Unlike the post I saw above-regen is more noticeable and effective at the end game compared to the lower levels.  Grab yourself a fungi as well and get regrowth before pulling to make it even quicker.  My normal fighting/standing regen is 22 per tic and i dont have it maxed out with AA's yet.  With regrowth and a fungi that puts my regen at 52.  If i am feigned its only 16 natural and 46 with regrowth+fungi.  An ogre will sit feigned for 15+ minutes waiting for his health to come back before he can stand up and run for his life again-a troll or iksar will be feigned for no more than 5 minutes-the regen is VERY fast.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Um.... Grimbad, why would an Iksar or Troll get rezz'd less often after pulling something that the MA can't get off of them in time?  You screaming prejudice here or something?  <br />
<br />
&quot;All you Pinkys hate us Greenies, I know it.  You think we're inferior!&quot;<br />
<br />
Seems to me that, when everything is done, anyone who bites it in a group or raid should be able to get a rez, regardless of race, simply because that's part of the cleric's job if he's grouping there....  But that's just me, if you can explain better why that will be, I'll take your word for it and just sit and pout that my big green butt isn't loved.<br />
