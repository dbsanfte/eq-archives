<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Marruk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">While browsing the beastlord forums, I came across this quote in a discussion of the new melee disciplines:<br />
 But now warriors have more than just a broken taunt button and a random combat proc. <br />
<br />
I couldn't resist, and posted asking how, exactly, taunt was broken.<br />
<br />
Here is the response I got:<br />
<br />
Well taunt button was made for this game when 50 was top lvl.. now you try useing this taunting with a lvl 65? SEE the problem? if people can't see this they must be stupid like Sony is......... <br />
<br />
So, its official.  Taunt is broken.  SEE the problem? :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Do beastlords even get the taunt skill?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>morbbidd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">and the point of this was? no,beastlords do not get taunt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Marruk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">No, beasts don't get taunt.  I assumed it was a reply made by someone who just has no f'ing idea how taunt works, but I was curious if there was anything real in that.  I was thinking that maybe the level cap on the skill wasn't raised when the max level was raised from 50, but it looks like they did raise the skill cap.</div></div><hr />
