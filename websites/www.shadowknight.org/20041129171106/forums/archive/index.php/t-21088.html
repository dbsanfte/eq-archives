<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>DConquest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just thinking about this the other day.  Paladins get a Divine Stun AA, and stun is their form of &quot; spell dmg mitigation &quot;.  Ours is lifetaps.  Imagine a 1 sec cast time AA mana free lifetap that refreshes every 2 - 3 minutes and does about 800 - 1100 dmg / heal.   It would be disabled for PvP and stack with ToL / focus items, but not SCF.  <br />
<br />
Mana issues on our already &quot; hetic &quot; casting routines already prevent us from using our lifetaps as much as we'd like.  This would provide a needed &quot; mitigation boost &quot;.<br />
<br />
Personally I feel to truly put SKs in their proper place... combining this with the unlinking of the Leech Touch AA from Super HT, and putting a resist check on spears / lowering the recast time, would be a huge step in the right direction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This wouldn't really do much for us, look at what you are proposing-- a mana free lifetap that can serve as an emergency heal, with a 1 second casting time. Even with a 2620 crit and a 5240 exceptional heal given a 20% dd focus...an unlikely event to begin with...this does very little in the face of the dps that we are facing in the problem areas of the Singular Might trial...you will not be able to anticipate dps spikes in such a way to make this truly useful. Basically, this idea does not aid mitigation or avoidance at all, it simply would be an &quot;Oh Shit&quot; supplementary heal...and on easier content it would be like training wheels...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Lifetaps don't scale with content.  As such, they are the wrong way to go about fixing the SK's problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>DConquest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Unfortunately, it's obvious nothing groudbreaking / that scales with content will be added to our spell / discipline line up.  The freedom to use a sizeable lifetap, mana free, and relatively often would help in mitigation more than you think.  Imagine grabbing a loose, hard hitting add to OT.  Combining those 2 skills ( leech touch ) can buy you enough time to start getting heals.  <br />
<br />
Not to mention the benefits in exp groups and some added DPS.  All in all though, it's just something to think about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Mitigation is unrelated to lifetaps, it refers to the distribution of hits taken across the scale from Min. to Max. from a mob. When you already are dragging along a cleric and a druid, or 2 clerics, this lifetap AA concept becomes redundant healing...not mitigation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>aress</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">not too important to me.  I am focussing on more desperate requests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Androsulach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">For mitigation, an AA that increased our effective AC or allowed our defensive skills to cap higher, like Planar Power extends the max caps on our stats would be nice.  Maybe they could extend our current mitigation and avoidance AAs a level or 2.  No need to reinvent the wheel, just increase what needs to be increased to keep us in line with where we should be compared to warriors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>KLeTuS_KaSaDy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">life taps used to mitigate around 1 round of damage, theres no way in hell they are going to give a tap that is equl to what is the current 1 round of damage, if they did give us this its not gonna scale with what it should, and its power will decrease as new expansions are released</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i like it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Radahsam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">...and its power will decrease as new expansions are released<br />
<br />
New expansions??  Hah!  At the rate people are leaving EQ after GoD's release, will there even be any new expansions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>KLeTuS_KaSaDy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">good point rad !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Vedark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I think this is a great idea, and i was thinking the same thing.  As it stands right now we have alot of aa revolving around 1 timer, our harmtouch timer.  Paladins got a clickable stun, radiant cure, purification, and 2 aa's to improve their hand of piety.  <br />
<br />
I like the concept of purification, others may not see it as I do, but those other aa's are great.  Improving hand of piety is nice, and its not on their lay hands timer to boot.<br />
<br />
I would like more diverse and new abilities in aa instead of many aa going into one of my two harmtouches which are both on 1 timer, or alot of different aa's that go into my green pet.<br />
<br />
I like the two harmtouches, and you can't make leechtouch too good before paladins get upset that it encrouches on lay hands, but i'm getting tired of all these aa's going into one of them when it could be something else. It would be nice if those those touches were on their own separate timer.  <br />
<br />
Some people like their pet and use it.  I rarely use it, and seeing this many aa going into my green pet is getting really disturbing.  I'm not a pet class and I don't want to be branded one.  True its a little helpful tool at times, or dps for those that want to squeeze out the most, but the fact remains its a little green pet and AA to make me kick more ass, and not him would be quite welcome.<br />
<br />
In summary, I'd like to see more diverse aa, or at least break off putting more aa into an ability centered on one timer.  And no more pet aa for me please.  Improved theft of life, maybe a pushbutton ac tap, pushbutton drain or dot.  As for paladins being pure and being able to cure, I don't see the opposite for us out of line.   Anyway, tell me what you think.</div></div><hr />
