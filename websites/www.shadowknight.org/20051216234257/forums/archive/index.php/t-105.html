<br />
Karnors is far from ideal to solo at zone in, so was wondering where else you could use this with out too much worry about pathing/adds/wandering through dangerious zones etc.<br />
<br />
Was thinking about BW at the the Sky zone in - pull to zone snare and let rip.  <br />
<br />
Any other thoughts about where to solo with this at 54th??<br />

Might be fun to chase Sergeant Slate around with too, if you ever spend any time windowshopping in EC.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Evilangel</div><div class="date">03-27-2002, 06:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Droped off the Construct of Sathir - the statue looking thing that spawns where the hands pop. Got him in the hands room, but I think he can also spawn in the basement spot that u can pull through the wall form the RCY. Have been hoping to get BE Gaunts off this guy for some time.<br />

Good hunting<br />

Will try that Skyshrine spot :)</div></div><hr />

Only that damn rile helm. And that was when he bothered to show up at all. Lol i used to love that camp for the exp and i did get my noct blade there in my early 50's but i hated it for never giving me the gloves. Oh well on to bigger and better things..</div></div><hr />
