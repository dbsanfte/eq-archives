<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">With the introduction of DoN came the Bandolier, which allows us to switch weapons with a hotkey.  This came in handy for use for swapping out Primal/Prismatics, switching between 1 and 2 hander configs, etc.<br />
<br />
But... if you are a player without racial slam and without the 2hand bash AA and like to use a 2 hander weapon primarily but would like the ability to bash -- there is a way without using 3 hotkeys.  It can be done with one hotkey, centered around the /bandolier command.<br />
<br />
First, you need to set up your bandolier with at least 2 configurations, one for 1hand and one for 2hand.  I won't go into how to do that, I'm sure everyone has played with the bandolier.<br />
<br />
Secondly, you have to set up the bash hotkey in the Actions menu.  Yes, you can create a Bash hotkey from the skills menu but in order to use bash within a macro you must set it up in the Actions box in either the Abilities tab or the Combat tab.  Find an open slot, right click on it, and choose Bash.  Note which number you just put the bash hotkey into.  I won't go into detail on how to set that up either, but for this example, let's say it's occupying slot #1 in the Abilities bank.<br />
<br />
Syntax: /bandolier activate name<br />
<br />
Let's say by default you use your 2 hand weapon, that you've created a bandolier config named &quot;2hand&quot;.  We'll also assume /attack is already on when you use this macro.  And we'll assume you've created a bandolier config named &quot;1hand&quot;.  Plus as mentioned above, you've set up your Bash ability as #1 on the Abilities tab of the Actions box.<br />
<br />
Okay, now create a new hotkey macro to contain the following lines:<br />
<br />
/bandolier activate 1hand (switches to your 1hand weapon and shield)<br />
/pause 5 (pauses for half a second, might not be necessary. YMMV)<br />
/doability 1 (activates the ability in Actions tab in slot 1, in this case: Bash)<br />
/bandolier activate 2hand (switches back to your 2hand weapon and bags your 1hander and shield)<br />
<br />
Using this macro or any other macro relying on a timed ability means you have to either be aware of the refresh time for Bash, or have the bash key itself visible on your hotkey bank, otherwise bash might not have refreshed when you press the hotkey (same with HT and other activated abilities).<br />
<br />
I did a search for '/bandoleer' (and later '/bandolier') and nothing came up so I'm assuming it hasn't been previously discussed.  I also can't take credit for discovering how to do it, a guildie played around with it (for another reason entirely since he can't bash) and figured out the syntax.<br />
<br />
Hope this might be helpful to some.<br />
<br />
Edit: misspelled bandolier as bandoleer (was at work) :P<br />
Edit2: corrected more bandolier/bandoleer spelling errors</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vaylene</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nice! Going to have to try this next time I get around to playing.<br />
<br />
That is..... if I can get /bandolier to work...... :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Uvaavu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">/bandolier activate ranged<br />
/autofire on<br />
/autofire off<br />
/bandolier activate main/2hand/whatever (switches back to your main weapon setup)<br />
<br />
Ranger in my guild pointed this one out. Handy for those long range pulls I find where you dont have a bow equipped in the ranged slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">No pause neded.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nbakwe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yep, you can kill the pause line. Tried this out last night in Dranik's and it works like a charm. My Pally wife saw me switching back and forth between WMBS and mace/shield like greased lightening - and freaked LOL. Of all the new toys, I think I like the bandolier best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The bow switch is awesome when you are both puller and tank, since I like keeping a higher ac item in range slot for tanking.</div></div><hr />
