<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shredler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Last night i went to COM to kill this Kilidina. He did not activate upon hailing. Am i missing some steps after completing the epic 1.5 ? Is there a step before Kilidina ? Can anyone tell the steps before killing him ? Or is the quest just bugged ?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shredler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ok i figured out what was going on, i will write it here cause it can happen to anyone else as well. When i killed the final mob of epic 1.5 i was too excited for the final turnin, after which i did not continue the conversation which leads to epic 2.0 just got my new sword and jet. Somehow later on i remembered that she had to say something to me about Lhranc, i went back to her and hailed her, but she did not say anything, when i assumed that i was already flagged for Kilidina fight by wielding my epic 1.5 which i was not. And that cost me missing a nice overkill raid force there. Later on i have remembered the last words of her which was about a &quot;vision&quot; so i went back and said what vision, and continued conversation then i became flagged for Kilidina.</div></div><hr />
