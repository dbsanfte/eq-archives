<br />
Anyway, ton of upgrades for you in WoS.  Shoulders, back, ring, earring off the top of my head.  Work your Heartstiller's quests or DoN for visible slots.  Not sure that you could handle tanking WoS yet though, so stick with RCoD/DoN until you can.<br />
<br />
GoD sewers also have some excellent upgrades for you.  Shield and haste belt that I can think of right now, though there are probably more.<br />
<br />
If you can sneak into a MPG group as a puller or snarer, you'll have a shot at several huge upgrades.  You're miles from tanking there, but there are other roles you can fill successfully.  Same with vxed - Umbiki drops a hybrid back slot and Chavoor drops an ear that would be upgrades for you.</div></div><hr />

Not to be disrepectful on a help thread, but that's pretty ass backwards<br />
<br />
RcoD/MPG is where i stay away from lol, WoS i tank well there, it's moving on to RcOD/MPG is where i want to go now, DoN is non-efficiently soloable on my part, to camp those places(RcoD/MPG/Riftseekrs) you need like 9800+/1700ac+ minimum to do RcoD/Riftseekers/MPG without looking like a paper crumbling in someone's grip<br />
<br />
I could get a group of lvl70's to help me camp stuff(i think), i appreciate the replies, and advice, Cudahl the Heartstiller's items you wear are part of some Oow quest ?</div></div><hr />

Yes, it's the tier 1 OoW armor quest...best thing to do is look it up on alla and print out the items you need so you can roll on them when they drop.  BTW, RCoD is quite doable with your gear and if you don't want to tank MPG (you could with good cleric) then get yourself a good map of the zone and learn the camps, because most of the items there are no drop and rot often (the warclasp earring in my magelo is always rotting if someone is at that camp).<br />
<br />
Only problem with RCoD is that it is a harder zone to navigate so it can be much harder to find a group there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was under the impression that RCoD was easier to tank than WoS...but that's based on mostly second-hand info, so it could be wrong.  I do not have much experience in RCoD myself.  I went from WoS - MPG - RS as my gear and levels progressed.<br />
<br />
If you're doing fine in WoS, you're set.  You can level to 70 there and pick up a host of upgrades along the way.  You should also be able to work the Heartstiller's quests.</div></div><hr />

<br />
South WoS -&gt; North WoS -&gt; RCoD -&gt; MPG - &gt; RS<br />
<br />
However, RCoD statue might be a touch easier than North WoS, not sure.  Slayer seems to be more difficult than North WoS.  MPG is similarly split, in that TC/BH are not as difficult as the level 70 mob camps.</div></div><hr />
