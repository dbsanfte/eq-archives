<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mnemenoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">When I started my Gnome SK, I did the newbie armor quests.  I'm playing this character from the ground up, No twinking.  I think it makes it more challenging.  Anyway, can anyone suggest a next set of quests for armor for me?  I'm about to turn lvl 15.  Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Solan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">At level 30ish you can do the darkforge quests, until then i would stick with newbie armor and whatever else you can find to upgrade the occasional piece.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">This game is not set up well to support questing for gear progression.  There are nice quests, but you can't support yourself full time on quested gear.  Newbie quest armor is going to be outliving its usefulness by the time you can quest darkforge, and darkforge will have outlived its usefulness by the time you can do velious armor quests (and velious armor quests aren't the greatest &quot;quests&quot; anyway...) etc.  <br />
<br />
You can try it, but don't expect to be at all competable in terms of gear.  The game just doesn't support it well enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sadyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I believe the twilight sea armor quests are a good middle ground from darkforge to velious.  Pre 30th though I think you're stuck with the newbie stuff, unless you want to work on the gnome cultural.  There are some droped armors out there, I would look for some of those in the meantime.</div></div><hr />
