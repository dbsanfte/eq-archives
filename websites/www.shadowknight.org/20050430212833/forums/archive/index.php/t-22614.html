<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ogresaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all, first time posting here. <br />
<br />
I have a Shadow Knight alternate that I've leveled to 25. What I'm looking for is a place with mobs that would be blue to me so that I can get skillups, but that don't hit very hard, so that I can spend long periods of time on a single mob, for more skillups. (wow, that was a long sentence). <br />
<br />
My main is a caster, so I haven't had to worry about weapon skillups before, so if any of you can help out, I'd really appreciate it!<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ogresaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ahhhh, I hadn't thought about them! I'll try them out. Thanks a lot!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>TrepanT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">No one ever thinks of Nedaria's Landing.  Pull to the little valley on the far side of the zone from the Wayfarer's camp, by the JPF zoneline.  No wanderers there.  You can even bank and sell with the Brellish gnolls in JPF and you'll come away with a metric buttload of hides and skins.  There are also some turnin quests with a few NPCs at the camp for some xp and plat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ogresaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well, after looking around, I think I've found the PERFECT spot. The only thing it lacks is sellable drops. But the mobs drop an average of about 1pp each, with some as high as 3pp. The place I'm talking about is the Forgotten Halls. It's the instanced zone off Nedaria's Landing. You can go in SOLO as your own expedition. Nothing in the zone aggros, and the things you kill for xp (rats and bats) are NOT social (at least not at the level range I am in). At level 28 I get about a percent XP per kill, and fast kills. No shortage of mobs either, as they respawn pretty quickly. <br />
<br />
I love this zone. It is instanced, so it is ALWAYS available when you want it. No trains, no aggro, nothing. Just nice, quiet xp and platinum. Well...back to hunting.</div></div><hr />
