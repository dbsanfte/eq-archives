<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Byttorr Ebonknight</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 02:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is sort of a carryover from the &quot;Booties&quot; thread.<br />
<br />
I don't mind people who hang out in hopes of gaining a no drop item for a low level character so long as they don't make a nuisance of themselves. Depending upon how you look at it, they're still &quot;earning&quot; the gear by waiting around for it, even if not actually working to obtain it. Whether this is truly an efficient means of using your time is another matter open for debate.<br />
<br />
If they do become a nuisance, then I'll tell them politely to stop being a nuisance, or we will destroy the no drop items. Beyond that, there's not much you can do to stop them because whether or not a given zone is out of their league, they have just as much right to be there as anyone else.<br />
<br />
But then there are other situations. The Sword of Pain in Velk's for example, has become a very sore spot for me. I have spent a lot of time camping it recently, and had no luck. Gregendek continues to only want to drop that stupid book when I'm there (5 Gregs, 5 books). One night I had a prospective group member get hysterical that if one dropped he would get an equal roll on it for his twink. Fortunately, the rest of the group told him where he and his twink could go and we sought a different person to fill the group. I've had other groups outright tell me &quot;no, you're a SK, we don't want you for the group, we want the sword for our twinks.&quot; I dropped down there the other day to uh, excercise the first rule of velk's club, to find a group there and a naked level 1 gnome SK standing around. Every time now that I have gone in there, if there's not a twink actively logged in waiting to loot one, someone in the group has a twink camped there and wants one. (Yes, I know, I just need to take in my own group for it, but we usually need 1 or 2 pickups to make 6, and we continue to run into these people who think their level 1 SK's &quot;need&quot; for the sword outweighs mine at 56.)<br />
<br />
So yes the &quot;vulturing&quot; has gone too far. There are few real newbies anymore, and everyone seems to want their alts to be uber right out of the box. I have no problems with twinking, I have a well-twinked mage myself but I would NEVER put obtaining an item for my twink over a person in the group that can and would use the item. It's gotten disgusting, and I just wish VI would do something about it, like start making a lot more gear with level restrictions.<br />
<br />
Where do you draw the line?</div></div><hr />

&lt;-------Sobs as the thought of ever gettin a SoP slowly slips away...</div></div><hr />

<br />
pit's the best exp in velk's if your group is good, I think I've destroyed 1, called 2 friends down to loot them, and called at least 2 random SKs downt o loot, and given one to my pet (bastard wouldn't equip it.. I wanted a pic of my pet standing next to me with a SoP while I stood next to him in skele form with mine equipped...)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ardrick</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 03:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">pets wont equip no drop weapon from my experience</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pajita</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 04:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, if you give a mob a nodrop item it checks to see what it is (for quests) and then immediately poofs.<br />
<br />
Anyway, when I got my Strength of Grodan, I was level 45 (I think).  I brought food, water, and bandages to share with the groups I was hanging around.  I stayed invis and far away from their mobs at all times.<br />
<br />
I solo the Ass/Sup room some times in Lower Guk, trying to get myself a TBB for cash (/rude Supplier, you can stop dropping the bags now, thanks).  I've had a lot of bards and rogues approach me and ask to hand around for a mask.  I'll let them, and as long as they stay hidden in a corner, I don't mind at all.  I'll usually let them loot the bag if it drops too (Yes, all my characters have them.  You can stop dropping them now, Supplier).  Some of the bards even offer to group and regen song me during my downtime.<br />
<br />
Anyway, my point is, if the person was able to make it to the place in question, has something to contribute (be it food, water, or just conversation), and doesn't get me killed, I'm more than happy to let them loot something I have no use for, never will, and can't sell to make a few plat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xarshaaz Dreadbones</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 04:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Totally agree with Pajita, and a few others for that matter also in Booties post...<br />
If the &quot;vulture&quot; as you call it comes to me and says gimme ph4t l3wtz, so I B r0xx0rz....Not a chance, but if someone just asks polite and hangs around some time and helps me with some stuff, like getting food, water and just offers me something like conversation/buffs etc. Why shouldn't I let him loot? A lot better than soloing and starting to talk to yourself that the mob doesnt have to drop that one drop he already dropped 100 times again... j k Paj :P<br />
<br />
All these things about earning stuff...live with it, there is always gonna be twinks that walk around in armor and wielding weapons that will take you to lvl 60 and lots of raids to get better...But when you do have it, you have earned it...The twinks have either spent months in EC, or have a main that is lvl 60 and in some uber NToV guild and uses main to farm twinking items when he isn't raiding, or they do the &quot;vulturing&quot; thing, and going to some pretty dangerous places for their level, with a big chance of dieing and not being able to get corpse etc. Have they not earned it? I hate being in EC for more than 2 or 3 hours, being there a few months deserves a bit of respect...If I was lvl 60 and been all around, nothing to do for exp (got AAXP maxxed out:P), I would farm some for a twink and start an alt, have they not earned it since they have gone to 60 and a lot of raids etc? The vultures obviously have come thru a lot of danger to loot stuff and so they may also be rewarded for that, as long as they are nice...<br />
<br />
I am not advocating &quot;vulturing&quot; in any way, I don't say you SHOULD let &quot;vultures&quot; loot...Do what your heart tells you (hmmm, what movie was that?) And for a last word, sorry for the rant ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fezzika</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 04:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If someone is hanging around to loot no drop items, and the following conditions are met:<br />
<br />
1)  No one in the group needs it.<br />
2)  No one in the group's alt needs it AND are camped right there as to not slow the group down<br />
3)  The person is not annoying, an ass, or getting in the way<br />
<br />
then I have absolutely no problem giving them a hand.  The SoP example above is just sad, and takes it to an extreme.  But I will not intentionally destroy or let rot something someone can use that's there, because at that point you're just bitter or a jerk.  Last time I checked, this game is about having fun, and it's fun to help people out.  It's fun to see how excited someone is to loot something neat.  It's not fun to make people sad or mad because you intentionally destroyed something you had no use for and could have helped them out tremendously.<br />
<br />
Is it more satisfying to work towards something?  Sure.  And there are PLENTY of opportunities in this game to do exactly that.  So having some boots and gloves thrown your way is not going to a) ruin the game or b) turn the people into bad players.  This is a marathon, and I'll take opportunities to help people along the way.<br />
<br />
Just my two cents...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frued</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 05:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just started visiting Velks. Not necessarily because the SOP drops there but my guild needs gems for the kael drops.<br />
<br />
 Do I want a SOP? Hell yes. Then I can give my Noc blade to the guild. Since I acquired the Noc blade  we have added 3 more SKs to the guild.<br />
<br />
 My chances do not look good. SOP is a ShadowKnight only weapon. Its a signature weapon sort of like the MOSS. When I got my MOSS (Hail Malikith) I felt more like an SK. My first SK only weapon. It felt good.<br />
 <br />
 So since the dogs are perma camped I can only hope to get asked to join the group, asked to loot it, or do my time in Velks and move on when its time to move on.<br />
<br />
 Good luck getting your &quot;Sword of Pain&quot;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Syfon</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 07:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have only camped the lower dogs in Velks one time. No named dogs appeared during that camp.<br />
<br />
I have a Sword of Pain.<br />
<br />
I have it because one day when i was in upper dogs someone did a /shout SoP on corpse in lower dogs, First come First serve.<br />
<br />
I told the group i had to get to lower dogs (we were not fighting at the time) and i quickly moved down there and looted the weapon. I was so incredibly grateful to that group for 1) announcing it openly and 2) letting me loot it rather then someone else.<br />
<br />
When things drop that can be used by people in the zone and are no drop items that will only rot / get destroyed i think it is the right thing to do to annouce those loots or do a /w X_Class and send a tell. As long as they dont bring a train or other trouble in their desperate attempt to get to me i have no problems with it.<br />
<br />
It is indeed fun to help out others, even more so when someone isn't expecting it as i wasn't that day. It came out of the blue and was that much sweeter because it wasn't in the back of my mind the whole time like it is when you are actively camping something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nocifer Deathblade</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 07:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The change in death method for lvl 1 to 10 opens up some new type of abuses.  Lvl 1 SK can now have no worries of decaying corpse if he just happen to get SOP and got killed by mob right away. From that patch on, SK just pick up SOP then get killed to go back to their bind point intact and start swinging. In itself, its kinda of abuse which I don't support.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bludge</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 08:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Talliin, you are a revenant.  I think everyone who's not a completely selfish will typically allow someone of the appropriate level to loot no drop stuff that will rot.  It's the beggars that come swarming to whatever the hot new no drop area is.  Back in the day it was Painbringer.  Now it's SOP.  I've never done something like that and I never will.  I'll damn sure let people know I'm looking for something that's in a zone where I'm capable of hunting however.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krazix</div><div class="date">03-29-2002, 12:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am very anti vulturing..<br />
my main is a rogue, and one of my favorite camps happens to be ass/sup.<br />
<br />
And if you can't guess, every 5 min or so, some ass shows up in zone and shouts &quot;ass sup camped?&quot;<br />
<br />
Me Yes<br />
<br />
Them: Can i loot mask plz<br />
<br />
No, I need it.<br />
<br />
Them: Plz i need it (they are like lvl 13 or under usually, I'm 45)<br />
<br />
NO!<br />
<br />
I've had idiots bring a full 6 man group to keep them alive when I said ok, fine come loot mask, they move 6 people up into that camp, don't help at all, just get in the way, and even start killing stuff were fighting &quot;cause they're bored!!1!&quot;<br />
<br />
Since that crap started happening, I promptly destroy my dark elf mask, and loot the new one. Nobody under lvl 30 gets a DE mask while I&quot;m in the camp.<br />
<br />
Same will go with any No drop loot I happen to be camping.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lexar Venomous</div><div class="date">03-29-2002, 12:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If they don't get in my way and are polite about it, I don't mind at all.Doesn't really bother me that people at the lower/med lvls have things easier then the myself, who has been playing for awhile.I'm not worried about some med lvl having a wep thats just as good as mine.They don't effect me personally so I could careless.Only exception is if there a ass or a moron, then well things change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jobrill</div><div class="date">03-29-2002, 01:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That Thing with the Sword of Pain absolutely SUCKS.<br />
<br />
I have a soft spot for asking to loot no drop items, as my first char was a bard, and I went down to Ass/Sup more than once completely nekkid with nothing but a backpack or two of food and water. As it is, I only got it on my 4th try at level 22, and prolly wouldn't have if the wizard camping it was not a GOD and got me a rez when I died once, and ported me out after I got the mask.<br />
<br />
Now this does not mean I do not have my limits:<br />
<br />
1. People who are asses might see me destroy stuff. <br />
<br />
Ex:) Seforithxleet shouts &quot;NE ONE CAMPIN MOB X I NED NO DROP ITEM LEMME LOOT IT PLZ&quot; will turn me off immediately<br />
<br />
Ex:) Dipwad tells the guild, &quot;Hey, Could you help me buy a 10-shot IU Pot and escort my Level 5 Rogue down to Ass/Sup so I can loot the mask?&quot; Burns my bum like no ones business. Everyone who knows me knows never to say something like this in my presence, cuz they'll get a lecture on how I had to walk uphill both ways in the snow to lguk and ask a IU off a soloing Paladin at the zoneline cuz IU pots (or at least multi-shot IU pots) weren't even implemented yet dammit.<br />
<br />
However, If someone slips quietly into the camp, asks &quot;Hey, can I loot XX if it drops please(NOT plz)?&quot; and if they stay out of the way (like hidden in a corner), and no person in the group wants it and/or has a twink camped there already, and if there's no-one of the appropriate level hunting in-zone who has expressed Interest (such as a SK in a Spider Group up top who asked  to loot SoP earlier) I'll say &quot;Sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
It's no skin off my bottom if someone wants to build thier char this way. However, if you're an arrogant little bleeder who thinks he deserves to have uber gear handed to him on a silver platter, AT THE LEAST, I'll tell you to shove off. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Uglugg Bloodsbane</div><div class="date">03-29-2002, 02:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What really irks me about the vultures and no drops is when Im doing a camp solo like the crusaders for Dark Forge (Still working on the last peice for the helm) and some lil SK  vulture stays near by begging to loot the Decayed drops because I have SOME Dark Forge allready. <br />
<br />
Normally over pulling and FDing rids me of the lil buggers, though I get asked to look for a rez for them after.<br />
<br />
The fact that now I got those lil foot stool gnomes standing around vulturing is really annoying! *PUNT!*<br />
<br />
What will get someone kicked from my group and put on ignore is if they want to roll on something for their twink even though some one that is in our group allready that could use the item is there. Ive had that happen way to often for my liking.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not into vulturing or anything. But I don't think I have ever, or would ever destroy a no drop item just so a twink did'nt get it. I think it's kind of a jerky thing to do. <br />
<br />
As far as the n00b gnome sk's go... I havent had any dealings with them yet.  Sufice to say it will add some sk's from lvl 1-45 or so..  But as everyone here knows, once people get their twink sk's to a reasonably advanced lvl, they get sick of being &quot;under powered&quot; and go play another character. So I don't really concern myself with them.  Cmon.. we've all been here before.  ;)</div></div><hr />
