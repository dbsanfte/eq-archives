I have heard two opinions regarding the max damage of luclin weps with additional fire,cold and magic damage (not bane damage)<br />
  1) One is that the +5 cold does a resist check against cold and if not resisted it is added to base damage ie. it becomes a 20/20 wep for that strike.<br />
  2) I have also heard that the +5 cold damage is simply added to the total damage done by the wep ie. 15/20 multiplier then +5 damage added if not resisted.  <br />
<br />
I am currently using an ebon mace and find the maximal damage done by the hammer seems similar to the mace leading me to believe that the max damage is more likely #1.  Several guildmates have argued this point with me and insist that it is #2.  Im looking for anyone who has parsed the numbers and can give a definitive answer on this.<br />

<br />
My understanding is the first example that you used.  And from my own limited testing of these types of weapons (using the summoned cleric hammers) the bane damage or energy damage adds directly to the damage stat of the weapon.<br />
<br />
Your guildies seem to be confusing that with the bonus damage that is listed on the weapons.  That (unless they have changed it) is the amount of extra damage added to each swing....thereby upping you minimum hit and maximum hit.</div></div><hr />

elemental damage is resistable... resist checks on it arent that good either</div></div><hr />
