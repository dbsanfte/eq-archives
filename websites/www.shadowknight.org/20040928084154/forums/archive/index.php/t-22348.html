<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Eggborn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have no set thing that I do more of.  I MT, ST, off-tank, pull, dps, group, solo, sometimes kite(not great at kiting, so avoid usually)-pretty much equally (the MT is the least, but I still do it)<br />
<br />
Since I am never quite sure what I will be doing mosty in the next few months I am not sure what to get next!<br />
<br />
I xp in normal/hard ldons, GoD sewer trials and expeditions, Earth, Fire, Water, and raid in Sol Ro Towers, any mobs up to then, I just pulled a raid in Air for the first time last weekend.  I main tanked in Sol Ro towers the week before.<br />
<br />
I have 3 unspent AAs atm, but will work on getting more.  It can take me as much as a week to get 3 to 6 AA's.  I very much enjoy doing the bigger harm touches, but it would be cool to be able to avoid damage more too.  Fearless is there, just cause, if my class can be fearless, I should be.<br />
<br />
I will take any suggestions but the ones I am considering and tossed up over are:<br />
<br />
Soul Abrasion 2 and 3<br />
Channeling Focus 2 and 3<br />
Swift Journey  1 and 2<br />
Fearless<br />
Spell Casting Fury 3<br />
Unholy Touch 3<br />
<br />
<br />
I have a lot of wasted ones lol, so /shrug  <br />
<br />
see magelo <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would suggest doing them in the following order:<br />
<br />
Channelling Focus 2 and 3<br />
Spell Casting Fury 3<br />
Swift Journey 1 and 2<br />
Soul Abrasion 2 and 3<br />
Unholy Touch 3<br />
Fearless<br />
<br />
You might also consider Spell Casting Expertise 1, just so you can't possibly fizzle on CD and Fear (I hope I remember what that AA does correctly).  Finishing off Theft of Life might also be worthwhile, especially since it's so cheap.  Pet Affinity and Pet Discipline are also useful, if you use your pet with any frequency.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Carter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've got all of those aa's.<br />
<br />
Unholy Touch3<br />
Run5<br />
Channeling Focus3<br />
Spell Casting Fury3<br />
Soul Abrasion3<br />
Fearless<br />
<br />
I would probably have to say that would be my order from the ones you listed.  Though run5 is awesome even if it costs 'a whole 15 points' anything that can make you a better puller is money in my book.  If you tank at all, CF/SCF/SA are going to help, I'm sure you can figure out where / how.  I got fearless a while ago back when I was still killing first brood dragons and the such.  Also great for farming zlandicar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Of the ones that you listed, these in this order are the ones that are not a waste.  Can't see what you've got already.... but if you don't have SCF3, that's a big upgrade.  And if you don't have SA2 &amp; SA3, those are useful in any situation -- tanking, dps, adventures, whatever -- get those. :)<br />
<br />
Spell Casting Fury 3<br />
Soul Abrasion 2 and 3<br />
Unholy Touch 3</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Eggborn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">what I have got already are in my magelo profile, I'd list, but looking there is much easier to see</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">SWIFT JOURNEY 1 &amp; 2<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Soul Abraision 2 &amp; 3<br />
Spell Casting Fury 3<br />
<br />
Channeling Focus 2 &amp; 3<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The rest.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Swift Journey is very, very useful for an SK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Seconding what Siilvir said.  In that exact order.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Haha, I totally agree with Sillver that Swift Journey OWNS.. When GoD came out, I immediately saved up and bought it and saw how usefulness it is. My death rate for pulling had cut down substantly. And I could run to trigger npc in trials or turn in or flag text message with huge train behind me and FD easily and survived cuz train is already too far behind cuz I ran too fast. Sometimes, see-inv mobs didn't even aggro me when I ran past them too fast so go on. <br />
<br />
I promised myself *IF* there is run 6 in OOW (I really hope so!!), I would buy it FIRST thing!! Run 5 is god for SK cuz it GIVES you plenty of head start to FD even against casters. <br />
<br />
Suppose if I'm a newbie when GOD came out,  Run 5 would be one of a must-have AA along with defensive AA, hp AA, etc.<br />
<br />
But I realize that some SKs never wanted to be puller at all and only wanted to tank full time that I met valued run 5 alot less. That I can understand why. Bottom-line, if you pull die-hard,  get run 5 first thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Looks like you missed Innate Regeneration 3.  One aa for one more point of regen = sounds like a bargain to me.<br />
<br />
-Bolas</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I 've gotta agree with Silviir too, though I might be inclined to put SCF3 above SA.</div></div><hr />
