<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zyraxx Shadowleezard</div><div class="date">02-15-2005, 10:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Went to a &quot;jungle&quot; area of Broodlands, it was in West wall. Killed 4? spider drones who hit for 300ish (scattered randomly around). Spawned a giant spider queen North of the entrance to jungle. Hit for 838 max procced some type of snare (sorry can't remember name). Died and dropped no loot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Off one of the Dark Reign Mission NPC's, will edit with name later.<br />
<br />
Go to Thundcrest Isles, the port to which is in the Broodlands. The direction will be marked on your compass when you zone to Broodlands. Head west on the isle.<br />
<br />
Need to find the rose &quot;Dark Lady&quot; and a pot + fertizlier to keep it in. Pot dropped off a mob &quot;GOblin Gardener&quot; right inside the west section.<br />
<br />
Named hit up to 1500, and will summon a pet. No info on pet hits. Nasty bastard.<br />
<br />
Trash hits around MPG level, hits higher more often, but swings less, so about evens out.<br />
<br />
See invis is random. All popped trash seems to have the ability to see invis sometimes, except puma's so far. So con EVERYTHING when moving around, and don't assume becuase you killed a non seeing mob that it won't see invis when it repops.<br />
<br />
Could not find fertilizer, and had to quit when cleric had to go.<br />
<br />
Had: 70 SK X 2, 70 cleric, 70 Chanty, 67 necro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Luthaer</div><div class="date">02-16-2005, 03:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did the same Lady Rose thing, but only with 3 chars (I boxed).<br />
The Gardener was too tough, so I asked a friend to come help with his shaman, then it worked.<br />
After killing a ton of mobs in about 3 hours, an emote came.. something about a loud hissing voice.<br />
Then a little while later, a named Nightmare (horse) thing spawned. Unfortunately it rampaged and I my boxing skills were not up to the task. I'm pretty sure it would have dropped the needed item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sloth</div><div class="date">02-16-2005, 04:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">we did this also, the flower you need to loot is in the middle in the garden bed, we looted it not knowing what it was, about 45 mins later we killed the namer that drops the pot. We spent a fair amount of time looking for last namer when we  noticed the flower died.<br />
<br />
  we noticed nothing summoned in here so we kited everything including the namer, just agro him, when pet spawns FD till it poofs, was 4 of us with no slower and a druid healer.<br />
<br />
  So if i was to do this again, i would clear a few mobs inside by the garden, then pull the namer in and kite or kill, loot pot.  then either kill till last namer spawns and loot fertalizer, then last loot the flower. then head back,  Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nytemyst</div><div class="date">02-17-2005, 08:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Name that spawns the fertlizer is called master courier something like that. It a new horse model. Spawns upstairs the same room you get the flower and pot. I'm not sure exactly whether he's a timed spawn or amount of mobs killed spawned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sloth</div><div class="date">02-17-2005, 09:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">K we beat this last night, but not the right way,  It seems the fertalizer is not no drop.  So someone else in guild started this mission and failed. The flower died on them but they got the named horse to spawn afterwards. So he had fertalizer. So what we did was just have him join our instance and give us the fertalizer, and it only took us 5 mins to finish lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valthar</div><div class="date">02-28-2005, 09:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You supposed to kill the gardener? He was non kos to us so we figured we had to talk to him... never could get him to talk though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vindarius</div><div class="date">03-06-2005, 03:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just tried this one for the first time.  Master Courier spawned on top of the cleric, creamed us. Looks like it Quads for up to 1780 or so. This toon is LDoN/OoW geared lvl 70, most defensive aa's, running tribute he buffs up just around 9k hp, ac spikes up to 1850 or so, thus will have to think twice before trying that one again. Probably have to hide behind a warrior next attempt. Just a tad bitter at the moment, will get over it and try again. Don't go up the ramp from the garden area until you're prepared. Killed only one mob up there then Courier spawned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claver</div><div class="date">03-13-2005, 02:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A Simple Task:<br />
<br />
Kill the Gardern and loot the pot<br />
<br />
Kill 20ish or so mob (maybe less) from inside the Garden building and the Master will spawn, kill him and loot the dirt.<br />
<br />
Pick up the ground spawn ( looks like small shroom) in the garden and combine with the dirt.<br />
<br />
Now to play it safe and assuming you don't have a kick ass group or any form of CC just pull all the mobs outside to you instead of you moving in to them. They are easy to split anyway. Once you think you have hit the 20kill mark move your entire group(wont work unless they are all in there with you) inside to one of the halls and kill a mob. This spawns the Master and usually not on top of your group. Move your grp back outside then pull him to you. Also the doorway isn't considered INSIDE, I know trust me.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rhumba_Kween</div><div class="date">04-11-2005, 12:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Has anyone done any of the DoN 18 person mini-raids? I take part in usually a 3 crew mini-raid once a week and have wanted to reccomend these once everyone gets DoN. But I'm curious if they actually drop loot or is it strictly for points?<br />
<br />
What is the dificulty like? We could probably do easier Elemental gear droppers with this crew, but we also like to be challenged. Are some of these geared toward mostly elementally geared people?<br />
<br />
It would be awesome if some of these were along the same difficulty as the easier MPG Trials, but for 18 people.<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />
