<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Peztilence Forever</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Here are some of mine.<br />
<br />
Pet:-<br />
<br />
lvl 65 spell.  Summons a Greater Ghoul to aid us.<br />
Fights as a lvl 55 warrior ( for HP/AC ) with ghoul touch. Can lifetap and HT. Begins combat with the Ghoul Touch, followed by HT then Melee with random lifetaps of Drainspirit.<br />
HT used only once per summon. Ghoul is immune to Charms and its resists are those the SK that summoned him. It also grants us the power to see through its eyes ( for Sh*tz and Giggles ) Ghouls has RS3.<br />
<br />
<br />
Deathtouch:-<br />
<br />
HT that consumes all our Mana + HP ( Yes killing us ) for the equal dmg. Cric Spell can increase dmg. Theft of life and Leechcurse effects WONT heal us ! :)<br />
<br />
Spell :-<br />
<br />
Rage of Plague lvl 65<br />
AOE Snare,  Aggro increaser.<br />
<br />
I have more if you would like to hear em. <br />
:p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Silence</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">could change Deathtouch to  Betrayal,    sacrifices a random group member (excluding the knight) to enable the shadowknight to increase the dmg of our improved harm touch... lets say 1.5 or 2x,   (15,000 -20,000 range)   <br />
<br />
emote -   (Shadowknight) Betrays (groupmember)  <br />
               (Shadowknight) calls upon the restless soul to devastate his oponent!     <br />
<br />
scores crit blast... ooo... aaaaah..</div></div><hr />

Why am I guessing that rangers get the &quot;Betrayed&quot; duty?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ziglug D</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hmmm...that Betrayal thing would be ok if.....the group member must be/has been in your group for 1 hour. I mean dont get me wrong, its a good idea, but Sony is way too lazy to work on all the rules for using it =/<br />
<br />
EDIT: I very much agree with the original posters idea (sry for name short term lol) Because it would come with less strings attached.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>aress</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">ohhhhhh..........betrayal...................&quot;sure, Paladin, I group with ya!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, nice thoughts.  A death touch in addition to disc'ed HT.  Use HP and mana.<br />
I.e. 8200 HT, 9800 life, 6200 mana = 24 K damage.<br />
<br />
This will never happen :(<br />
<br />
But I wish you would be employed by SOE :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Peztilence Forever</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well if  they change the DEATH TOUCH to include that we cant be rezzed after DEATHTOUCHING. It may limit use and power. But still, in times of need be an awsome Sacrifice.<br />
<br />
 Paladins could have a similar power that does a AOE CH at the loss of his life !</div></div><hr />
