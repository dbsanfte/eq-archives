Time flagged, about 9500 hp buffed.  I have been duoing up a shaman that is now 62. But thats getting tired. Mobs take too long to die, yadda yadda.  <br />
<br />
Looking for maybe 2 other classes that would be more efficient.  Obviously I need a slower, healer , DD<br />
<br />
Was thinking beastlord , cleric  ? or beastlord Druid ?<br />
<br />
Any input is greatly appreciated.<br />

Thanks <br />

Shaman dot damage gets up there at higher levels, and if you're not main healer it's a nice contribution.  They have higher haste and better buffs than BSTs, too.  If you're going to get a BST for your slower, I definately say get a cleric so you can go to the zones with the harder hitting mobs as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dhantes</div><div class="date">09-25-2004, 12:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I do SK, BST, CLE its good but 90% of the time the healing power of the cleric isn't needed and the cleric is FM and every now and then i cant do certain named mobs cuz i cant get them slowed with no malo/tash. If i was honestly to reroll for the most power i would go PAL, ENC, DRU. BST, CLE adds alot more dps over just a shaman but since your also the puller its kinda taxing killing lots of low hp mobs. I actually prefer to look for higher hp mobs that give more exp which is hard not being flagged OR I intetionally pull 2/3 mobs and snare/root park them to cutdown on pull time. <br />
<br />
One of the bad things i've notice with 3boxing (I do it all on one comp so maybe differnt for you) is that initial agro/slow/heal time on hard hittin mobs is usually alot slower. I have guildie paladins and wars who out tank me in harders exp groups like vxed hard ldons simply cuz they can focus on agro/healing and dont have to worry about agroing mob/slowing/and casting heals...<br />
<br />
Oh yah one of the bad things about boxing a bstlord though is that when the bst has no kei he does his job poorly till about FT8. After getting kei with about FT6 the bst then has TOO much mana and you wind up spending too much time casting his nukes and dots to get rid of said mana. Cleric is usually FM on easy/normal content with FT6 no kei unless your using spam heals. With kei and about FT6 you can use spam heals and keep your mana pretty steady. I find its too much work to nuke/melee with the cleric when 3boxing unless I have kei, and/or the zone is outdoor AND unless the mob im killing is undead so i can use his undead dd rather then his easily resisted long cast/long recast nuke. Though the clerics healing power is godly and if you liek that feeling of having the best possible healer (my cleric with 110aa's ft6 and like 4.5k mana pool is a more powerful cleric then im a tank now) you wont want to give up the clerics healing.<br />
<br />
I was just 2boxing for awhile sk+cleric and found it more enjoyable was able to melee/yaulp indoors or mount/nuke outdoors when grouped when 3boxing i tend to be more antisocial because every person i add just adds more work with less payoff it seems. One of the WORSE things about 3boxing the bstlord is that with aa's and extended enhancement 4 your looking at rebuffing every hour (haste every 20mins and fero every 10mins can keep fero on 3 people so casting fero every 3.5mins) and this is only worse pre SCR3 and extended enhancment 4. I honestly dread having to buff/rebuff since it takes like 1-4mins to do so depending on number of people and is very mana draining. This is main reason i wish i just boxed a shaman instead of a bst sometimes.<br />
<br />
Anyways hope that helps at all.</div></div><hr />

I have an SK, shammy, necro, bard, and cleric available to me, and I've found that those three work quite well. Pull with the SK, land 2-3 snares on inc (if possible), switch to shammy to slow / HoT, switch to necro to lay on 3-4 DoTs, FD the necro, switch back to SK, then just switch around as needed. I love playing the bard as well, but trying to keep any semblance of twisting going with 3 boxes on the same computer is a bitch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Voch</div><div class="date">09-26-2004, 04:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I 3 box SK/shaman/mage.  I do have a cleric as well but usually only use him to buff and rez myself when i screw up.  This is the combo i'm most comfortable with but I'm sure several combinations can work.  I 3 boxed probably 50 or so regular ldons with this combo and farmed some loot out of high risk ldons before i started feeling like i could beat them and beat 3 high risk mistmoores in a row before my 3rd box died.  Did Ferubi quite a bit with this combo and various other zones.  And if your hitting 9500hps you got me by quite a step so i'm sure your options are more.<br />

A Wiz is good for dps and not having to pay attention much.  A ranger will do the same thing if you have the leet ranger haxxor :P for auto bowing rangers also have attack buffs and extra snare/strong root etc.  <br />
<br />
personally though i think druids make the best 3rd box to most slower/tank duos.  Druids can pump out the fast nuke dps, along with dots, added buffs along with shammy and high end DS can also help dps.  Another added benefit is if you are a farmer or a dangerous exp'er.  Exodus and evac work wonders.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SweetMeef</div><div class="date">11-14-2004, 10:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Only thing with the /autofire command is that it does NOT auto-face the ranger in the direction of the mob, which means you have to kite in his ~180 degree point of view. the 3rd-party programs (I assume) do auto-face the ranger bot giving you more freedom of movement, as long as you don't run the mob right past the ranger:<br />

Hit by non-melee<br />
Hit by non-melee<br />
Target is too close to use a ranged weapon<br />
Target is too close to use a ranged weapon<br />
Target is too close to use a ranged weapon<br />
(Outside PoV) <br />
Cannot see target<br />
<br />
Basically since the rng isn't firing while the mob is inside bow range, he won't turn and if the mob then leaves his PoV you'll lose dps until you get him back in PoV.<br />
Hope that helps some.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bolas</div><div class="date">11-25-2004, 04:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been using Shd/Shm duo a lot, and occasionally add in a clr for extra heals... but now that you mention druid, that might be even better than clr since then you could have them do decent dps during the times that the heals weren't needed.<br />
<br />
But generally I'm trying to farm mobs that are tough enough that the cleric needs to heal and then after slow, the shaman is free to DOT or rain for extra dps, with just the clr for heals.<br />
<br />
I have 2 comps, the second one is considerably slower than the first, so can't really 4-box on 2 comps.. but 3-box is possible.  Shd is my main, Shm is RL friend's main, so those two are fixed, the question then is what to best add?  Seems a mage/nec for dps if I wanna kill non-stop lowbies for exp, or a clr/dru for heals if I wanna kill tougher mobs for loot or spell drops.<br />

<br />
I can do pretty well with this.  Wife and shaman gear aren't quite up to par (need more FT), but I can xp on the north side of WoS pretty well.  <br />
<br />
Its slow some times, especially on harder hitting mobs where I have the druid using CH.  I think I need to practice using shammy dots more for better DPS.</div></div><hr />
