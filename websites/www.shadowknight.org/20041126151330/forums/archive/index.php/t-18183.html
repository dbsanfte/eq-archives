<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>newtank</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just got back from steelwarriors.org and seems 3 warriors tanked on the order of 43 mobs in plane of fire.  Est 20,000 hp ea mob that is 860,000 damage done in ~8 sec by 3 war for dps of 35,000-40,000 each.  Seems to me Warriors are the hands  down situational DPS leaders. (uses rampage and AE proc which procs ~30 times each war for ~300 due to each mob has chance to proc and AE affects all mobs.)<br />
<br />
Oh yeah and a pally tanked Quarm.<br />
<br />
I play a 55/54 sk and so I can only really speak about what I see but I have choosen to stay 54/55 for a long long long time focusing on AA and have grouped with a lot of warriors during that time<br />
<br />
But from what I have seen the problem with warriors is that they are too easy to play.  With an sk if you suck and don't understand your spells  everyone in your group knows it inside of 5-10 min.  But with a war if you suck you spend your money buying the wrong gear/ questing the wrong stuff or not questing etc.  Its easy for that warrior to blame his lack of success on his lack of equipment.  And the group is never sure if he is an idiot or just new to the game so they blame all warriors.<br />
<br />
Warriors are equipment.  The whole strategy of  a warrior is which equipment to get.  For example if you are a 50+ war and are having problems getting groups start by asking yourself the following:<br />
<br />
Do I have a bow with 2 procs on it?<br />
Do I have the 8th, 9th or 10th coldain ring?<br />
Do I have the chardok ring 25 pts ds?<br />
Do I have 2 procs ea on my 2 1HS weapons?<br />
Do I have a high dex so that they will proc?<br />
Do I have eye patch of plundar and good haste?<br />
do I have one set of gear optomized for soloing?<br />
Do I understand that my role is to tank up not tank down?<br />
<br />
Warriors are designed to tank up  palladins and sk to tank down.  I am a 54 sk with good gear for my level and in ldon lvl 50 dungeons I can tank very well becasue the mobs are below me.  Because I am tanking down I can outperform most warriors in this situation.  However put me in the 55 dungeon and all of a sudden the mobs are beating me down like crazy and the warrior is a much better choice.  This is because warriors are designed to tank up.<br />
<br />
The flip side of that is in every expansion warriors are going to go from being a required tank becuase the content requires tanking up to being one of 3 tanks to eventually being one of many classes that can tank...what 65 wiz can't tank sand giants in OT?<br />
<br />
Quarm is one such mob.  Pally can tank him in a guild that has done him many times.  No real suprise.<br />
<br />
OK to the nerfing Warriors.  Remove the rampage procs on every mob thing and limit it to 15 or so.<br />
<br />
Remove defensive.  Remove the warrior bezerk thing where they attack for more when low on health.  Make it so that warriors always have a defensive ability to mitigate melee damage that scales inversly with their hp.  So if they at 100% they tank no better than sk or pally.  At 90% health they get 10% of their max bonus for atk and defense.  At 50% health they get 50% of attack bonus and 50% of defense bonus.  The bonus would have to be such that it was worse than defensive on average but since it lasts all the time that ok.  The offense component should be quite large so that a war with 10% health does almost monk or rogue like damage. ( cause at that point they have fewer hp to tank than a rogue)  <br />
<br />
Then give warriors an ability that uses mana that blocks heals above a certain level .  That way a well equiped warrior can get groups block 20% of his hp and always have 20+% of this bonus on groups.  This would have the effect of making warriors worse at tanking big mobs but much better at groups.  With the introduction of the new sheild line of spells  this would still allow warriors to tank current content  and would make war and knight raid tanking more similiar in future.  It would also give a very clear picture which warriors are good at what they do and thus the bad ones would be considered gimps and not lower warrior standing.<br />
<br />
This would be a kind of utility that allows war to  scale from being poor agro  poor melee great tank to lesser tank higher melee still poor agro.  <br />
<br />
Give monks spell like chants.  Give rogues more dps and give hybrids more dps ( ya we melee too)<br />
<br />
Ok before you flame ( cause I know some warriors are gonna) I group with war often as they work well in my preferred grouping structure and I often have more than one in a group with me at a time.  I group with warriors that can take agro from me at will and hold it unless I really really really want it back, ie I can nuke at will and they still hold it.  I also group with warriors that can't take agro at all and can't really tank well either its just like any class some people are better at it than others.<br />
<br />
OK Start the flames =)</div></div><hr />
