<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Silvershadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First off, I went to Growth, fully spawned, killed one horse, dropped the hair. I killed tons of the bastards before with no luck, but suddenly after the patch it gave in. Hardly a statistical sample for claiming they upped the drop rates, but it may have been stealth changed (lord knows they love doing those). Just a thought, if anyone else has similar experiences let us know.<br />
<br />
Second, pet pulling two of the gloom nightmares was possible before patch with Invoke Death. Not so after patch, pet got stuck and refused to do much of anything. A beastlord friend of mine tried with a green pet also, same thing. BUT, when he tried with his normal OoW pet, it worked like a charm. So the thought that comes up is if this is a nerf of pet pulling? I would definitely like to wait a bit before proclaiming such a verdict, but has anyone else had something similar happen post-patch?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Saruton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">What has a pet getting stuck in geometry to do with pet pulling beeing nerfed ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Silvershadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Because it was only the green pets that got stuck, not the blue? And I'm not saying it has to be a nerf, I'm saying it's not how it used to be and thus I'm curious as to what they did. I got my hide now, but still curious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Carasak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">got my hair of 1st horse before patch<br />
so dont think anything was changed (possible though)<br />
<br />
pet pulling in pon depends on where u position the pet.<br />
if its to the right of platform pet didnt manage to get on platform. try to position in front of platform.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Silvershadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Read my first post again Carasak... I did this just fine many times before the patch, doing it the same way (and no matter where from) after patch it doesn't work. A highlevel beastlord pet did it fine after patch, whereas a lowlevel beastlord pet did not. This is what I'm curious about, are the lowlevel pets more susceptible to geometry or what?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Carasak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">no saying u are wrong<br />
just was trying to give u an idea what might have been the differnece..gonna try it myself soon i get home from work</div></div><hr />
