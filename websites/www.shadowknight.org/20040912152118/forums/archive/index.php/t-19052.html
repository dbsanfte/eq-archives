<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>BanditTHEDOG</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">found this thread on the eqcleric forums.  I've played a 64 bard and a 62 cleric since the last patch and from my experience so far it seems pretty accurate.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Actually, I like it. It makes the game more challenging. The previous lull upgrade trivialized the game way too much by clerics and bards and rendered monks obselete as puller. The changes set the game back almost to pre-pop changes once again and I actually find the game more enjoyable due to increased unpredictable results and it helps to increase monk and SK's role as puller.<br />
<br />
Heck, clerics weren't even supposed to be cc'er and a puller.. That would strengthen their role in many areas instead of just a healer..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Makkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I agree it's a change that needed to happen. It's not really a &quot;nerf&quot; it's a bugfix imo. Bard lull is still pretty sick you can stand on top of a mob and it wont aggro.<br />
<br />
It'd be nice to get a group again to be main puller with a war MT or something. I enjoy tanking and pulling equally - but I really loathe having to do both at the same time because it's sooo slow<br />
<br />
There have been some &quot;fixes&quot; that I don't care for..for instance bard pulse song being changed after all these years..but on the whole I have zero problems with this one. Pacify still works fine anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shapiro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">LDON adventures were getting to be snore fests, even at high difficulty. Single pulls everytime, with no challenge at all. Now that they fixed the bug, LDON is more challenging and much more fun. Enchanters, bards, monks, and SK's can once again do their thing.<br />
