<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Stryph</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After reading the current Warrior board based knight discussion, I realized that our lifetaps could definantly use a change, and I don't mean just increase the numbers.<br />
<br />
What I mean is change the numbers into percentages. How many SK's would like to see our taps do 10% of your hp as a lifetap and 5-10% of your mana for the cost? I certainly would. I'm also not talking about a series of spells, just a single spell that you get at level 9 and continues to improve up to the max level (65 now, 70 when OoW is released, and so on). Now you have a scaling lifetap, that scales with your hps, and your hps scale with the content. Those with 11k hps would have an 1100 lifetap, 2200-4400 critting lifetap. Frankly I think that would help a lot of the high end SKs while elimating the need for many many lifetap spells.<br />
<br />
Before anyone brings it up, this would also include a change to the necro taps, to be higher percentages then ours for A-Damage, B-Because they have less hp then us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Problem 1: You're better off having LESS mana, because you'll use it at the same rate, but have less to regen back.  <br />
<br />
Problem 2: While a scaling lifetap would be nice, it's not the answer or even an answer to our problems.  For it to be balanced, pally heals would have to scale too, and it'd be rather a mess in that respect.  Healing != mitigation, we'd still need other fixes.</div></div><hr />
