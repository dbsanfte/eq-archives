I believe he was a contractor (http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/04/01/iraq.contractor/index.html).  AKA Mercenary or Soldier of Fortune.  I'm not sure if that's a good thing or not.....</div></div><hr />

There are people who are certainly in the process of rebuilding in Iraq.  When the media refers to an individual as a &quot;contractor&quot; however, they are talking about hired security personnel.  The individual may be making certain that the area where the people doing the reconstruction is secure, but they are not an aid worker.  This type of work is highly dangerous and I'm certain that he knew the risks of his job.  Of course, he did not deserve the end he received but it was invariably a result of a risk he decided to take.</div></div><hr />

Didn't mean to make him out to be a Saint.  And I agree there needs to be the expectation of danger and the understanding that you take responsibility for your own actions.   Just kind of sickening that he had his head hacked off.  Also kind of sickening that people don't blink an eye at it.</div></div><hr />

The body of the self-employed telecommunications businessman from West Chester, Pa., was being flown to Dover, Del., on an Air Force plane, the military said. <br />

<br />
Nicholas Berg, an American businessman seeking telecommunications work in Iraq during the U.S.-led occupation of Iraq, was captured and beheaded by Islamist militants possibly linked to Al-Qaida in May 2004. His capture and killing was said to have been carried out to avenge abuses of Iraqi prisoners by U.S. soldiers at Abu Ghraib prison. <br />

You obciously don't know the meaning of the word &quot;contractor.&quot;<br />
<br />
contractor NOUN: 1. One that agrees to furnish materials or perform services at a specified price, especially for construction work. <br />
 <br />
Blackwater Securities is an independent contractor because they are being hired by the government to perform a service.<br />
<br />
Any person that is not an official government worker, but is hired by the government to perform a service is an independent contractor, no matter what the service they perform.<br />
<br />
Just because that CNN article called Blackwater Securities &quot;independent contractors&quot; doesn't mean mean that the media now uses the term &quot;contractor&quot; to secretly mean &quot;hired security personnel.&quot;<br />
<br />
Get off your conspiracy theories. I doubt the kid lied to his mom.<br />
<br />
edit*: From the above CNN article about contractors;<br />
<br />
There are other contractors who support the U.S. military in Iraq.<br />
<br />
Halliburton, the largest civilian contractor, has a Web site which currently lists more than 450 openings in Iraq. When the company threw a job fair last week in Houston, Texas, hundreds of applicants showed up.<br />
<br />
What does Halliburton have to do with security? Absolutely nothing. See the definition I posted above for further inquiry on why Halliburton is called a contractor despite the fact that they aren't involved with security.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Elkar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">So some people in Iraq called &quot;contractors&quot; are security contractors, and therefore all contractors are secruity contractors.  Ok, got it.</div></div><hr />

I apologize for my misinformation.  I was getting this information from an initial report from CNN about what he was doing in Iraq.  There are a lot of mercenaries working in Iraq who are under the same circumstances as this individual and that must be why I made such a presumptive assumption.  Apparently he voluntarily went to Iraq to see if he could get work for his company.  When he couldn't find anything he decided to come home which is right about when he was arrested by Iraqi police (this is where my questions about his real purpose for being in Iraq arise.)  He was eventually released and then captured by these Al-Qaida chumps.  <br />
<br />
http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/05/12/iraq.berg/index.html<br />
<br />
According to that article, our government was in contact with him when he was under Iraqi detainment.  I wonder why they didn't do anything to get him out of there...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Kebsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">All this 'contractors are soldiers of fortune' stupidity was, I believe, started by one Micheal Moore in this message that he posted to his website about a month ago.<br />
<br />
Friends,<br />
<br />
I have never seen a head so far up a Presidential ass (pardon my Falluja) than the one I saw last night at the &quot;news conference&quot; given by George W. Bush. He's still talking about finding &quot;weapons of mass destruction&quot; -- this time on Saddam's &quot;turkey farm.&quot; Turkey indeed. Clearly the White House believes there are enough idiots in the 17 swing states who will buy this. I think they are in for a rude awakening.<br />
<br />
I've been holed up for weeks in the editing room finishing my film (&quot;Fahrenheit 911&quot;). That's why you haven't heard from me lately. But after last night's Lyndon Johnson impersonation from the East Room -- essentially promising to send even more troops into the Iraq sinkhole -- I had to write you all a note. <br />
<br />
First, can we stop the Orwellian language and start using the proper names for things? Those are not “contractors” in Iraq. They are not there to fix a roof or to pour concrete in a driveway. They are MERCENARIES and SOLDIERS OF FORTUNE. They are there for the money, and the money is very good if you live long enough to spend it.<br />
<br />
Halliburton is not a &quot;company&quot; doing business in Iraq. It is a WAR PROFITEER, bilking millions from the pockets of average Americans. In past wars they would have been arrested -- or worse. <br />
<br />
The Iraqis who have risen up against the occupation are not &quot;insurgents&quot; or &quot;terrorists&quot; or &quot;The Enemy.&quot; They are the REVOLUTION, the Minutemen, and their numbers will grow -- and they will win. Get it, Mr. Bush? You closed down a friggin' weekly newspaper, you great giver of freedom and democracy! Then all hell broke loose. The paper only had 10,000 readers! Why are you smirking?<br />
<br />
One year after we wiped the face of the Saddam statue with our American flag before yanking him down, it is now too dangerous for a single media person to go to that square in Baghdad and file a report on the wonderful one-year anniversary celebration. Of course, there is no celebration, and those brave blow-dried &quot;embeds&quot; can't even leave the safety of the fort in downtown Baghdad. They never actually SEE what is taking place across Iraq (most of the pictures we see on TV are shot by Arab media and some Europeans). When you watch a report &quot;from Iraq&quot; what you are getting is the press release handed out by the U.S. occupation force and repeated to you as &quot;news.&quot;<br />
<br />
I currently have two cameramen/reporters doing work for me in Iraq for my movie (unbeknownst to the Army). They are talking to soldiers and gathering the true sentiment about what is really going on. They Fed Ex the footage back to me each week. That's right, Fed Ex. Who said we haven't brought freedom to Iraq! The funniest story my guys tell me is how when they fly into Baghdad, they don't have to show a passport or go through immigration. Why not? Because they have not traveled from a foreign country -- they're coming from America TO America, a place that is ours, a new American territory called Iraq. <br />
<br />
There is a lot of talk amongst Bush's opponents that we should turn this war over to the United Nations. Why should the other countries of this world, countries who tried to talk us out of this folly, now have to clean up our mess? I oppose the U.N. or anyone else risking the lives of their citizens to extract us from our debacle. I'm sorry, but the majority of Americans supported this war once it began and, sadly, that majority must now sacrifice their children until enough blood has been let that maybe -- just maybe -- God and the Iraqi people will forgive us in the end. <br />
<br />
Until then, enjoy the &quot;pacification&quot; of Falluja, the &quot;containment&quot; of Sadr City, and the next Tet Offensive – oops, I mean, &quot;terrorist attack by a small group of Baathist loyalists&quot; (Hahaha! I love writing those words, Baathist loyalists, it makes me sound so Peter Jennings!) -- followed by a &quot;news conference&quot; where we will be told that we must &quot;stay the course&quot; because we are &quot;winning the hearts and minds of the people.&quot; <br />
<br />
I'll write again soon. Don't despair. Remember, the American people are not that stupid. Sure, we can be frightened into a war, but we always come around sooner or later -- and the one way this is NOT like Vietnam is that it hasn't taken the public four long years to figure out they were lied to. <br />
<br />
Now if Bush would just quit speaking in public and giving me more free material for my movie, I can get back to work and get it done. I've got four weeks left 'til completion.<br />

I still have lingering questions about the prisoner abuse thing.  Who authorized photography in the prison?  Who in the Pentagon was the contact person to receive the pictures?  Who leaked classified information to the press?  Why isn't the Red Cross screaming bloody murder about this?  Why do I have a nagging suspicion that this is just another baby step towards a sinister revocation of our rights and sovereignty as a nation?<br />

We would still buy there oil and fund there terrorist acts. We could turn it over to the U.N witch has proven they are as corupt as Sadam himself. We are screwd. These people have fought wars there entire history. The numbers will grow, more countries around Iraq will jump in.

 <br />
<br />
<br />
Exactly, now, why do we need to help these people?  If they cannot get along and learn to co exist after 3000 years of almost constant war and death, what makes you think that occupancy by American troops is going to make them stop?  All your doing is adding another side to fight the neverending war.  You have to see that these people are religous monsters, if you arent on the same social scale, the same God, the same culture, your basically an enemy to them.  <br />
<br />
You can stand there and throw amillion American troops at these people and still they will fight you to the death, their children will grow up being taught to either strap a bomb to themselves or pick up a gun to continue to the fight.  <br />
<br />
Basically this is gonna end one of three ways:<br />
<br />
1. It goes on forever as we constantly try to police the area, losing more and more american lives and further instilling hatred into future generations.<br />
<br />
2.  We reach some sort of bullshit &quot;calm&quot; state where our troops are pulled out, and 3 to 6 months later the country has either another dictator, or is under the control of several warlords.  <br />
<br />
3.  You pull your troops out now, and allow them to continue the cycle since its pretty evident they dont want to, or cant change.<br />
<br />
First two options are going to cost more American lives, I believe the choice is pretty obvious.</div></div><hr />

Considering that the situation in the middle east is what creates terrorists and that they can get weapons actually capable of hurting other countries other than just themselves now, it's about time that entire area got cleaned up.<br />
<br />
Also, theres been other cultures throughout history that have been like this, and have changed.  Think about all the various wars fought where people killed eachother over Christian based religions.

The Eastern cultures parents hated us, their parents parents hated us. These are the children of the people that hated us. The next generation will hate us even more. What exactly is the point to all this ? Why do we even bother to help ? They fucking hate us and would nuke us if given the chance. And that's just it, they are very close to having that chance. We suspected Iraq was close to having a chance or at least supplying terrorists with a chance, so we invaded them. I think we should have hit them harder. I think we should still be dropping bombs on various cities to put a little fear of the reaper aka USA in their ass. You wanna bomb us ? You fuckin asshats wanna fly planes into our skyscrapers ? Well here, eat this missile and then go ask your God why you're still going to hell even after you fought your Jihad and merely slaughtered thousands of innocent souls. If these people truly believed in God, why would they commit the most henious of acts, murder ? To murder in Gods name is still murder and blasphemy. Why is their God better than our God ? It's the same God. Just interpretted differently. I truly do not understand these people. Maybe they have the Roman Empire syndrome and have had lead pipes for all these centuries supplying them with drinking water ?<br />

When scientists research something and come to a point where they realize they have failed, they wipe the slate clean and start over.
