This has convinced me to rerole as a iksar.  Nothing wrong with gnome but regen sure does help on down time.  I thinkit more than makes up for the exp penalty.  Will let you guys know how it goes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mordeth</div><div class="date">03-27-2002, 12:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I currently Play a Troll and while the regen is nice, if you can get items like Regen BP, don't bother. In the High End game it will matter little, unless you intend to solo ALOT.. Your bigger mana pool should compensate. I was actually debating re rolling an Ogre... hehe<br />
The one benefit you will get however is a nice AC boost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Utterance Unholy</div><div class="date">03-27-2002, 12:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shhh... don't tell anyone but the biggest reason to be an Iksar is the location.<br />
<br />
I save so much energy and time, being perpetually one or two zones from &quot;home&quot;, from trainer, spell vendor, quest vendor, from bank, from amiable merchants, etc.<br />
<br />
Sure, I may want to leave Kunark someday, but LOL, you can stay here your whole career almost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Skurrge</div><div class="date">03-27-2002, 04:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Biggest reason to be an Iksar is not the regen-- it's the chance to go get Greenmist... heh..<br />
<br />
But seriously, Cabilis is a great city and if you are not an Iksar, it is well worth the effort as far as getting the factions up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arbaal</div><div class="date">03-27-2002, 05:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Regen is nice but I wouldn't reroll because of it. Currently regen for iksars and trolls in alternate experience with Improved Regeneration and Natural Healing give 2hp regen per each train. This will be fixed soon though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bludge</div><div class="date">03-27-2002, 05:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Absor said the Troll/Iksar double regen for AA skill was &quot;working as intended&quot;<br />
<br />
:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Attyla</div><div class="date">03-27-2002, 05:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As well it should.  Otherwise, the extra 10% penalty we pay over ogres and 20% over others xp wise is trivialized.  Especially when you consider that unstunnability and extra regen are almost the same value, yet the premium is only borne by regen races.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Muggly</div><div class="date">03-27-2002, 06:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;unstunnability&quot;<br />
<br />
you're thinking of ogres, but that is not correct.  ogres are immune to physical stuns FROM THE FRONT.  all spells and attacks from the back can stun an ogre.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Utterance Unholy</div><div class="date">03-27-2002, 06:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am biased, but I think our AA expenditures wrt regen should get the double points.<br />
<br />
Regen is our &quot;thing&quot;, for every 5 months a non-penalty class plays their char grouped (notice I said grouped, soloing helps to negate the penalty) we have to play ANOTHER MONTH to catch up.<br />
<br />
I think giving us that regen at our normal 2x+ rate is consitent with keeping that penalty fair.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Attyla</div><div class="date">03-27-2002, 07:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Muggly yes you are right.  I erroneously assumed people knew what I meant.  Should have been more clear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tropics</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 01:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is it 26 points per tick at 60 with the 3 advances for a regen class when sitting? I was thinking 18 points per tick at 60 and then the 6 from the AA? Is that the correct result? What is the end result for a non-regen class?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arbaal</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 05:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Rich Waters assured me it was getting retroactively changed to be the same as non iksar/trolls the other night.<br />
<br />
Also iksar/trolls pay 20 percent race penalty, ogres 15 percent for the misinformed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leyrin</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 09:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They cannot do that.<br />
<br />
Troll Iksar are Pain in the a$$ to XP.<br />
<br />
I chosen a Troll for the Regen. And AA XP being 2hp / tic is just completelly logic.<br />
<br />
The percentage cap regen between troll and a normal human would be incredibly reduced. That would be totally ridiculous.<br />
<br />
Regen being 2hp/point for troll/iks is the most logic thing Verant have ever made.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shakeera</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 10:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have no regrets picking an Iksar.  The regen is nice, and I WILL be putting my first AA points into regen, because I like the idea of being the fastest self-healer in the game.  :)  Our mana pool is decent, and our stats are very well balanced.  We might not have the initial starting strength/stamina of an ogre or troll, but by the time you reach your 50s you won't be going too many places without a good shaman around anyway.  :)<br />
<br />
I didn't notice the XP penalty on me until I got to level 54....now I am seeing the penalty BIG time.  I'm three blues away from 57 and it's a PAIN.  :)  BUT, at level 56 I have over 1100 AC with lots of room for improvement.  The secret?  Velious.<br />
<br />
Velious blessed Iksars.  This expansion gave Iksar the ability to wear the best possible SK armor in the game, despite our inability to wear plate.  Velious quest armors are the key to having an uber Iksar Shadow Knight.  I currently have almost a complete set of Thurgadin armor, and am starting to go to ToV HoT to seek out my Skyshrine Armor.  With out natural AC boost (which actually DOES go up as your level increases), we can actually stand toe-to-toe with Warriors on AC.  Now hit points, of course, are a different story.  And then there's the defensive disciplines *sigh*.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the Luclin expansion went back to the &quot;screw Iksars&quot;  mentality LOL.  But still, Iksar Shadow Knights are quite the great choice, if you ask this biased lady.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Utterance Unholy</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 11:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, if they want to give us 1 point of regen instead of 2 per AA, then shey should have:<br />
<br />
Ultravision AA<br />
Hide AA<br />
Sneak AA<br />
Slam AA (which they do, its just level 59, and hard)<br />
Faction Improving AA<br />
Xp Penalty Reducing AA<br />
Shrink AA for Big races to match smaller ones<br />
Wearing things AA, so that we can wear plate, and large races medium armor<br />
Starting City AA<br />
Forage AA<br />
AC Bonus AA (which is mitigation AA, I guess)<br />
No Stun from Front AA<br />
<br />
<br />
If our racial advantage , that we pay a penalty for, is to be trivialized , then its only fair we be able to spend AA to trivialized the penalties and advantages of other races.<br />
<br />
I am sorry if this sounds like whining, but its discomforting to have your xp penalty, something that dominates your whole career,  trivialized.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leyrin</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 01:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hell yes.<br />
<br />
Shrink AA Damnit.<br />
Stun AA too.<br />
Faction AA.<br />
<br />
Its not whining its common sense. If the salary of a company is Cut HALF be sure there will be something Huge hapenning. My Salary for working so hard on XP (Wich i Work Each day BTW when i Die and have to full this level 60 Back..) is my Regen. They better keep their fingers away from it...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jarxle</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 03:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I totally Agree Utterance.  I love being a troll.  It hurt like hell leveling up with the exp penalty, especially before they made it a little bit easier for us.  I love my high end game Troll, regen and all, and everytime I sit and regen faster, some of the previous pain seems to fade away.  <br />
<br />
If you take away my natural ability, then give me other classes ability AA.  <br />
<br />
I love all your examples, <br />
<br />
shrink etc...<br />
<br />
Personally I dont think they will do anything to our regen.</div></div><hr />
