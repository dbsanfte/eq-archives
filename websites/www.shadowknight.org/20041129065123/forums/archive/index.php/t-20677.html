<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xanathol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, since the discussion in the 'melee balancing' topic has been focusing on suggestions, and the dispute over said suggestion has come to the point of detracting from the thread, I've started this one. :D<br />
<br />
From www.merriam-webster.com (http://www.merriam-webster.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&amp;va=balance&amp;x=24&amp;y=16) ...<br />
<br />
<br />
5 a : stability produced by even distribution of weight on each side of the vertical axis b : equipoise between contrasting, opposing, or interacting elements c : equality between the totals of the two sides of an account<br />
<br />
<br />
So here is our situation ( if you can dispute the situation, then there may be an arguement ):<br />
<br />
*Against Common ( XP / Trash ) Mobs<br />
Knights are preferred tanks, due to aggro generation.<br />
Warriors are viable tanks.<br />
<br />
*Against Named Mobs ( at your level of content )<br />
Warriors are the only option for tanking.<br />
<br />
Is there not something missing here?!? How can someone say it would be unbalanced if knights were viable tanks against big mods at their level of content?!?<br />
<br />
Please, someone, explain this logic to me...because I sure don't see any...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Knight's aren't really preferred tanks for XP grinding anymore - warrior's have plenty of aggro generation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">'balance' = getting warriors to stop whining.<br />
<br />
After all, they're the class that's *REQUIRED* to advance in EQ.  I'm not aware of any event that flat out requires a shadowknight.  Some balance.... ok, ok, so we have versatility.  All that means is we play 2nd fiddle to someone in everything we do.<br />
<br />
Now that aggro is completely trivialized, just fucking give us defensive and balance the rest out with itemization.  Warriors will still be the preferred tank because they've got more hp, avoidance, and innate mitigation (both through itemization and damage tables).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>aress</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Originally posted by Xanathol <br />

[I]<br />
Please, someone, explain this logic to me...because I sure don't see any...  <br />
<br />
Aye, in experience groups warriors have NO PROBLEM at all with quick aggroes due to incite plus.  Anger halps terrificly to set it in stone.  The community has quickly noticed this, as well as warriors superior dps to paladins (when using offensive discs etc.) and better mitigation, saving cleric's or druid's mana, which they LOVE to use for nukes :).<br />
<br />
So, the truth nowadays is:<br />
<br />
Warriors = preferred exp group tanks.  Knights = viable exp group tanks.<br />
<br />
Warriors = viable and preferred tanks in single farming groups in GoD, Knights = need at least 2 healers, decreasing group dps, and safety.  Who the hell wants that if warriors are LFG?<br />
<br />
Warriors = only raid main tank in GoD.  Knights = mana sponges and canon fodder.<br />
<br />
So the scale looks like this:<br />
--------------------------[]----------------tiny light knight<br />
--------------------------[]-----------------------------------<br />
--------------------------[]-----------------------------------<br />
HUGE HEAVY warrior []-----------------------------------</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Many many higher end fights have adds now, with number limited content you can make the argument that Knights are needed for tanking these with less healing support (allowing you to get more dps in the raid)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xanathol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ok, so it seems most of us are in agreement on the condition, the worse being displayed in GoD. What I am failing to understand is why over in the 'melee balancing' thread, folks are only in support for changes that concern GoD?<br />
<br />
Yes, pre-GoD encounters, a knight can overgear, and accomplish the task, in most cases. That doesn't make it right though. I would expect a scale of ( where the left is the most any other of the classes should be able to tank and the right is 'preffered tank' ):<br />
<br />
[a]--------------------[c]<br />
<br />
where:<br />
[a] == the start of 'other' class distributions<br />
[b] == knights<br />
[c] == warriors<br />
<br />
And most seem to agree that when it comes to a big mob, at your level of play ( aka not overgeared ), its:<br />
<br />
[a&amp;b]--------------------[c]<br />
<br />
Are there any arguments to why knights pre-GoD [B]shouldn't have the suggested discipline to balance this out for all content?<br />
 <br />
I'm sorry, but &quot;that's the way it always has been&quot; and &quot;we'd infringe on the warrior's lock of that role&quot; just don't cut it for me. &quot;Overgearing&quot; is still not having a role at the time you are encountering the mob, so what's the point? There shouldn't be a 'lock', it should be a scale, and 'always has been' is not logic for it being 'balanced'.<br />
<br />
*EDIT: Brik's post over in the other thread this is parallel to is stating the same thing; thought it should be noted. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kritr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think there is an imbalance. It shows in the fact not many players chose or stick with SK/s. It is so easy to see.<br />
<br />
If other classes got it easier getting loot and advancing, in my opinion there should be an equal way for an SK to achive the same and it is not. Sorry to say this but it is the truth.<br />
Having spells and abilities that become useless as you go into higher level is not what I would say to be encouraging.<br />
<br />
Seeing other classes brag on their higher HP/ac when I am stuck with 7400 and told I would not be able to tank this or that mob due to my low hp is not what I would consider being balanced.<br />
Now consider this I have as I write this 598 AA and need RZ to start the elemental planes. Has played this toon for almost two years and there should be a reasonable way for me to get gear, or abilities that make sense to me. Hey why do they give me this pack rat AA, the breathing AA ... the pet's AA are a joke. Why even a pet that dies in two shots by a big mob.<br />
<br />
I think as expansions move on, we sk's continue to lag behind. <br />
Maybe SOE, just plain does not care for this class.<br />
<br />
Our epic is one of the biggests jokes of this game. I would say it equal to the Staff of Endless adventure. Sure nice to say you have it , actually I do not even like the looks of it, but when it comes to practicality is totally worthless as you progress in lvl and hunting areas there are better weap out there and the epic does not really add any advantage to our class. Sure if you have time to waste, bored or you are a questor go for it. For advancement, not a good move IMO.<br />
<br />
Equality and balance is not monopoly. That is clear and other classes have a monopoly on this melee issue. As I mention before we should be a class that is powerful on its own and not secondary to none.<br />
<br />
At least make it feasible for SK/s to be able to advance if such person has a desire to make a toon of such a character. <br />
<br />

:confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kritr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">sorry this should have been in the above thread :<br />
<br />
We should be able to contribute when other classes, can not make it or are not available. I will  never forget when doing Bert I was the only melee left standing, this also happened in MM. All the warriors were dead. Would have been nice for me to step in and take their place or at least have some reasonable way to help instead of dying like any other caster that was left behind me.<br />
Some other times later in the evening there are no other melee but me or a Paly. Why is it I am not able to tank the mobs in the BOT towers equally as a warrior? Do we have to wait for a warrior to show up?<br />
<br />
Kritr<br />
<br />
<br />
:p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">&gt;&gt;Or epic is one of the biggests jokes of this game. &lt;&lt;<br />
<br />
Go back a couple years to kunark and make that statement again.  Our epic was godly.  It's just the nature of the game that gear progresses, and old content/quests likely isn't going to be worth your time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kritr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Epic... Kunark days?  That is the point! Progression and change. New ideas to to redifine who we are now that we have been playing this game. New additions, new story lines, new mobs, other players and classes.<br />
<br />
Some one said that  the SK is NOT meant to be an MT for the big mob in a raid. Says who?<br />
You mean the game is written in stone? I rather be progressive and write the game again. Give me freedom to be better. Do not tie my hands with hand cuffs. I want to fly!<br />
<br />
Why scratch our heads trying to make new things? Why not upgrade the ones we have? Not that I want to do our  epic. I have a copy of how to do this epic , actually from this board; and to tell you the truth not sure if I want to even try it. It would be a total waste of time. I rather do Ldon for gear, augments  or try to farm ornates. <br />
SSRA, and the soon coming elementals is  another way to spend my time. <br />
<br />
That would be a wiser investement of my efforts.<br />
<br />
<br />
So our Epic....HA HA HA HA ... not in a million years... at least not the way it is.<br />
<br />
Kritr lvl 65 SK <br />
<br />
:p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Radahsam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well, I have to admit....the fact that rangers, monks, rogues, and even BARDS can backup tank better than knights on raids (boss mobs) is pure and total bullshit!  I don't care how you cut it.  Weaponshield, stone stance, deftdance, and duelist should not put those classes above the two other plate tanks in tanking priority on raid bosses.<br />
<br />
At the very least, we need a disc on par with theirs, but I don't think that even cuts it, as we should be able to tank for more than 12, 18, or 24 seconds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kritr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Agree Rad. <br />
<br />
This week end I was doing an Ldon adventure. The monk, a guildie and lvl 65 as me had 7300 hp. Well just till resently my hp was 7213. Wow, that is totally pathetic. I got 610 AA as of this note, finally have one ornate bracer, arms and leggins and my Hp finally hit 7545 raid buffed. Now we are talking balancing here. Why can a monk get all they have and we are still falling behind?<br />
<br />
In another adventure I was with a warrior and I had be be using my aggro spells all the time to be able to keep the aggro on me, as I was supposed to be the main tank. The warrior had just a bit below me in HP, he he , that will not last long  he he, as you can bet this warrior will be in the 8 to 9 k department in no time.<br />
<br />
A Pally friend just got his ND3 and his hp is 6500. He is only level 63.<br />
<br />
If we are going to balance all this issues need to be addressed and we do not have to wait till  we are  elemental or Time flagged to get even. <br />
<br />
Just seems we deserve some consideration in whatever next upgrades to come in the future.<br />
<br />
<br />
Kritr</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Radahsam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well, it sounds like you're comparing yourself to a monk that is better equipped than you.  An equivalently geared monk should have fewer HP and AC than a knight of similar gear.  There is nothing wrong with a monk having more HP/AC than you if his gear is substantially better than yours.<br />
<br />
What I was referring to is the fact that even a naked monk/ranger can act as a better backup tank against boss mobs, thanks to their disciplines that make them immune (but still able to hold aggro) for a short period of time.  This is probably the worst with rangers, since they have fantastic aggro-generation abilities, in addition to a real TAUNT key.  Why they get a taunt key is beyond me, anyway, since they should be right beside rogues in tankability - chain DPS classes.<br />
<br />
And while we're talking about what makes sense, why the hell do rogues even wear chain?  They are supposed to be the sneakiest critters in the game, and yet they can wear metal armor.  They should wear leather, like monks.  They also have the highest sustained melee DPS in the game, and yet they get better mitigation than monks, who have lower DPS.  Something is wrong there.  They shouldn't be able to tank better AND do better DPS.  Maybe it's the whole monk avoidance thingy.  /boggle</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kritr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I do not like to compare myself but when it comes to warriors and other classes flashing their Hp and AC I just wonder how they got it. I could not tell, as I never played a monk myself so I have no idea where should the monk be.<br />
<br />
Not only that but at times when you join a group first thing you are asked is how much Hp and ac. <br />
Ac and Hp are important but is not all when it comes to tanking abilities or how you play/ know your toon.<br />
<br />
Kritr<br />

<br />
:D <br />
<br />
Given similar levels of AAs and effects..........................what else is there?    You tank better with intelligence?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Xanathol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Basically just a 'bump' especially in pushing for a proposal. I constantly see in the 'other' thread where it is still claimed to be gamebreaking for a proposed defensive knight ability pre-GoD, and yet I have still seen no arguments here about 'why' or 'how' to be disputed.<br />
<br />
So I'll rephrase...does anyone really think the only way a knight should be capable of tanking a raid level mob is with gear from beyond that mob's place in the game?<br />
<br />
Heck, I'll use an example.<br />
Bertox in CoD hits for ~1957.<br />
About your average knight at that stage, avg VT geared is what? Just under 8k?<br />
In one round, Bert could, in theory, hit for 7828 in total damage on a knight, a ranger, a shaman, etc.<br />
On a defensive warrior, those hits are for ~3914 in total damage.<br />
A warrior at this stage of the game has ~9k hp, with similiar gear, therefore on this 'one round' they still have over half their HP!<br />
<br />
In the example given, to give a knight even a 'real' fighting chance, they would need ~10k HP, or elemental geared. Grant it, mitigation plays a factor, and getting hit for max damage each hit is unlikely, but its not a totally unrealistic scenario.<br />
<br />
Anyone think its 'right' that knights should have to get gear from that much further in content to *still* not have half the tanking ability of a warrior that is starting this content on this mob?!? If so, why???<br />
<br />
Even a 'half defensive' would mean the knight taking 1467 a hit, or 5871 a round. On an 8k knight, this means a CH chain about twice as tight as on the warrior. With an elemental geared knight, then it would just about equal the warrior's tanking ability on this mob, and yes, the knight may be preferred due to aggro abilities. Ok...so how many elemental equipped warriors are lining up to tank Bert in CoD? Exactly...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Mdiyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">What content do you feel you should have the right to be the MT on and that this proposed disc should be made available to you?<br />
<br />
As Kitir pointed out he is not in the elementals and he has 7500+ HP buffed, and the way he sounds it seems as if he has never seen VT at all, and mostly has LDoN, SSra, and Ornate armor.  Without going through the content, and gearing you your guild/farm crew whatever, you will not be equipped for the events that you want to tank so badly.  Yeah Warriors had about 7500 hp tops in velious when they tanked AoW with the disc, that was before LDoN, VT, Elementals all that.<br />
<br />
Nowadays, an SK can reach 8k buffed without going to VT/Elementals by simply doing LDoN and hanging out in ssra or the bot towers.  There are other methods to doing mobs in old world content i.e. Kunark/Velious/Luclin, you just have to think and be ready to equip people, because if you don't then I would have to laugh at you seriously if you attempted to put a 6k sk up against AoW and expect them to survive without having a plan.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">If you wanna define balance this is how you do it, break the game down into each category.  Tanking, Healing, Dotting, Nuking, Meleeing, etc.  Take the total % you rank in each (with 100% as the baseline class) and your average rank in each category you're in, multiply them, get a number, higher the number more powerful the class, compare numbers and determine balance.</div></div><hr />

 not MT in the sense that a knight is better than a warrior - in any situation a warrior should take damage better than a knight.

I'll answer that with a question - what shouldn't we have it for? As I pointed out about Bert previously, not to mention the nameds along the way during the event. A knight is a tank. Warrior is the best tank. All tanks should take damage better than non-tanks. The spread between knight and non-tanks on all raid lvl mobs is minimal. The distance between warriors and everyone else is huge due to defensive.<br />
<br />
Its out of wack, always has been since defensive. GoD has only acted as a magnifying glass on a problem that has been there for quite some time.</div></div><hr />

I dont quite follow your statistics but the end numbers seem to correlate quite well with desireability on not only raids, but 6 man ikkinz trials.  Of course you would have to split the list up into dps tanking cc healing and combinations of them, but the fact still remains in your uber trial group nothing from a necro down will ever show up.  Btw you left bard out~.<br />
<br />
<br />
stability produced by even distribution of weight on each side of the vertical axis b : equipoise between contrasting, opposing, or interacting elements c : equality between the totals of the two sides of an account<br />
<br />
Balance in the case of a shadowknight has to deal with the ability to take melee damage, give melee damage, heal him or herself, and deal spell damage.  Clouding that fact was the invent of abilities, buffs, or gimmicks to help the lesser desired classes serve a role on raids.  This role is the one and only area that an sk is lacking.  Sks do tank second best in the game/flip flop with paladins, they do heal themselves quite well, although not very efficiently mana per hp.  Their dps exceeds warriors and rangers on short duration fights, which basically all of the important encounters in the game are, save for a handful of control situations ala xegony.  They also have the ability to pull and summon corpses, while not glamorous, does in fact add to an sks utility.  They are also he dominant pvp class in the game, but most of you dont really care about that =p even though touch of innys resist check is overpowered pvp wise.  The thing i dont understand, is that delusional people want all of this, which is quite a bit, and in addition want to be able to tank just as well as warriors.  This is further proven to be an uneducated choice by the crying if you will for a defensive style disc to be the end all for shadowknights.  Im sure other high end warriors will support this, if they do any type of parsing, but defensive is 99% useless in single group scenarios, and that is what this discussion is about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Howlitoezis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Aspit, where are you getting the idea they (we) want to tank &quot;just as good as warriors&quot;?<br />
I'm not catching that implication in the posts. I'm catching the fact that they want to be able to tank GoD encounters at least somewhat effectivley. Somewhere ABOVE rogues and rangers, which they currently cannot, and should be by all logic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">SK's heal themselves quite well?  The only 2 classes that heal themselves worse than SK's are Rogues and Warriors.  The group scenarios where Knights are hurting are the same situations where DI altering discs are EXTREMLY helpful.  A defensive disc is the best fix minus retuning mobs.  I don't want a defensive disc but thats the best solution at the moment so is the best thing for us to go for.  It also puts us above chain classes in tanking by a decent margin, infact the more I think about it the more I think it should be 15 min reuse because of the tanking gap with non Warrior classes.<br />

 I am not so sure how the aggro gap currently sits pre-Time. Some warriors, especially shown in LDoN groups, seem to hold aggro just fine ( hell, they did before the changes ) and some don't. Is it gear? Playstyle? This is a problem of measurement and perception, however.<br />
<br />
If indeed warriors are *way* behind knights in aggro, I support increases in aggro generation for them. IMO, if you are a group looking for a tank, the only things that should differentiate which tank you pick should be (1) group makeup (2) situation encountered ex. vs undead (3) your friend's list. For the basic role of tanking, each should have its pros &amp; cons, and favored by the makeup / enviroment only, not bc the group wants to take out nameds in a hard and the healer won't attempt it without someone who can go defensive...</div></div><hr />

To be fair, taking stuns into account for Warriors while raiding their hate generation would be alittle lower also, most likely around a 15% reduction for 14514.77/min while raiding.  As you can see that gigantic aggro advantage Knights had is eroded as progression goes on.</div></div><hr />

While I commend your willingness to sit down and sort out balancing points in a logical format, I'm concerned that they dont' necessarily tell the entire story.  The problems that I have basically revolve around a number of different areas, such as the giving of equal weight to all tanking circumstances as part of the &quot;Balance&quot; calculation, when even with maximum usage, defensive disciplines can be used in the case of &quot;Defensive&quot;, 30% of the time while tanking.  <br />
<br />
Assuming that it grants equivalent benefit always while being used is I believe is incorrect as well.    <br />
<br />
Also, neglecting special &quot;strength&quot; situations, which while not very common, sometimes the usage of various &quot;special&quot; skills has dramatic contextual value, and which a number cannot necessarily be attached, due to the infrequency of the events, as well as the importance of the impact of those skills within context.  Those skills include, but are not limited to:  Lay Hands, Manaburn, /disced harmtouch, /disc furious, weaponshield, deftdance, etc.    <br />
<br />
I also take issue with the basic premise that melee are counted in the balance equation, and casters are counted in the balance equation only on the parts that they obtain.    It's what I would consider to be a &quot;Specialist class balance penalty&quot;.   For instance, warriors have no magic, and rather than being given a 0%-5%  effectiveness in magic based skills, they're given an assumed 100%.    In other words, no weight whatsoever is given to the strength of breadth/versatility.    I'm concerned that this in essence magnifies the strengths of specialization, and limits the strengths of versatility.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Possibly does, that chart is lacking in a number of areas though, was just something I was messing with one day, you're correct about the additional abilities though, it's hard to define their value in it.  How much is Divine Arb worth?  RC3?  Manaburn?  Evac? etc... all things which are semi difficult to assign a value to, and then you have the other problem of what other categories are there?  Slowing?  Debuffing? CC?  Pulling?  Aggro? Then in the case of debuffing how do you define the value, in it's current form its not really good for anything other than a rough guide or as a distraction while i wait for the camp to kill whatever mobs i just pulled during raids.  I wouldn't say its a specialization penality however, because each class even specialists shows up in the other categories once its finished so you can see the lesser versatility granted to each.  The only classes that might get hit unfairly by it are pure melees because theres far less categories to include them in however with the way tanking stacks I think it's not that bad for Warriors so really just monk/rogue would possibly get treated unfairly by the chart assuming my idea can even be done as it is.</div></div><hr />
