A good friend of mine quit and recently came back as a chanter.  He is 47 now and wants to group again.<br />
<br />
Any ideas where I should take him for xp that he can still work his skills on the mobs?  High xp rate would be nice (ie light PLing), but not necessary.  Just want a place he would be able to have fun and still improve skills while leveling up.  If I could get some aaxp while there thats a bonus of course.<br />
<br />
I'm acting Raid Leader for my guild atm and teaching a small &quot;Family guild&quot; the joys of raiding on old content.  So I'm not to up to date on good xp zones for a lvl 47.<br />
<br />
I was thinking PoN or PoI, maybe an easy part of PoD.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?<br />
<br />
Thanks for the input.  I'll go dig through the hunting areas by level again and see whats available also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sithanator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">For speed of leveling him I would recommend pourchers in jagged pine, the exp off them is insane and are very much under conns. However these are probably green to you at 65. <br />
<br />
For an easy area to take him that you will still get exp. Nadox in LoY is a good exp area, be great for him, but slow for you. At 47 velks is very good exp and you can maintain a high kill rate against spider, most of which will probably be light blue to you.<br />

Should still give your chanter plenty of oppertunity to work his skills also.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jodgrim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Nurga is very nice xp at that level, the mobs are easily soloable by you the ZEM is one of the best in the game, and to top it all off you can get some decent bazaar loot every now and then.</div></div><hr />
