<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>SkTyger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello,<br />
<br />
Wondering if anybody can help me understand what flags I am missing, or who I need to hail to go into Elementals?<br />
<br />
When I say 'unlock my memories' to seer, I get:<br />
[Wed Jan 07 21:36:49 2004] You say, 'unlock my memories'<br />
[Wed Jan 07 21:36:49 2004] You recall meeting with Karana, but the memory is clouded. You sense that the answer you seek may be in Storms.<br />
<br />
(I think this is because I haven't completed the PoS mini's quest yet, just need medallion from Ocean or Desert)<br />
<br />
When I say 'guide my meditation', I get:<br />
[Wed Jan 07 21:36:54 2004] You say, 'guide my meditation'<br />
[Wed Jan 07 21:36:55 2004] The information obtained from Mithaniel is written in a language that you cannot comprehend.<br />
[Wed Jan 07 21:36:55 2004] The Cipher of the Divine Language appears on your arms for a brief moment then fades.<br />
[Wed Jan 07 21:36:55 2004] You have completed all of Honor's Trials.<br />
[Wed Jan 07 21:36:55 2004] You have bested Aerin`Dar and proven yourself honorable enough to pass into Mithaniel's Halls.<br />
[Wed Jan 07 21:36:55 2004] Mavuin is grateful to you for taking his case before the Tribunal. The information provided to you, that Mithaniel Marr and Karana carry information you should seek, could be quite useful.<br />
[Wed Jan 07 21:36:55 2004] Tylis has been removed from his agony.<br />
[Wed Jan 07 21:36:55 2004] Saved from a world of eternal nightmares, Thelin is forever in your debt.<br />
[Wed Jan 07 21:36:55 2004] Saved from certain doom, Milyk and Adler are forever in your debt.<br />
[Wed Jan 07 21:36:55 2004] Now that Grummus has been destroyed, the entrance to the Crypt of Bertoxxulous should open before your might.<br />
[Wed Jan 07 21:36:55 2004] The portal into the Plane of Fire has been altered. Miak needs you to find the correct way to channel the portal.<br />
[Wed Jan 07 21:36:55 2004] Arlyxir's wealth of knowledge flows through your mind.<br />
[Wed Jan 07 21:36:55 2004] Jiva's strength fills your body.<br />
[Wed Jan 07 21:36:55 2004] Xuzl's arcane wisdom pulses in your mind.<br />
[Wed Jan 07 21:36:55 2004] The parchments of Rallos are scribed in a language that you cannot comprehend; they do however have detailed drawings of the manaetic behemoth that you have already destroyed.<br />
<br />
I went through a post on what the Seer says, and I think that the part on the Rallos parchments indicated that I should be able to go into all except PoFire, no?<br />
<br />
I did talk to the librarian:<br />
[Wed Jan 07 21:42:29 2004] You say, 'what information'<br />
[Wed Jan 07 21:42:29 2004] Maelin tells you, 'Now that we have learned what has been planned for Norrath, might I suggest that you try to obtain any lore that you can while traveling the planes? I would like to learn from any history written in the divine language that you might come across.'<br />
[Wed Jan 07 21:42:33 2004] You say, 'what lore'<br />
[Wed Jan 07 21:42:34 2004] Maelin tells you, 'What is this that you have found? It appears to be written in the divine language. Let me see, the writing on the front seems to indicate that it is some sort of journal of things already passed. I cannot make heads or tails of the rest of it though, there must be another piece.'<br />
<br />
This also appears to indicate I can go into the elmentals, does it? (The part about traveling the planes?)<br />
<br />
When I hail the PoFire lizard thing in PoT, and say &quot;Plane of Air&quot;, I get the planes not for idle exploration, come back bit (and no response from the 'What essences')<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />
<br />
/bite</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kugbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Looks like you are missing Karana text.<br />
<br />
You kill Agnarr?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Saruton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I bet you missed to hail the Librarian. Hailing gives a flagg too and especially an essential one. Go hail the librarian and say new lore and new information a couple times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">As you stated, you're missing the BoT access quest.  No EP flag without that.<br />
<br />
Absolute best thing to do, and I say the same thing to people new to my guild who are trying to straighten out their flags, is to go to the flags walk-through on Graffe's and step through it start to finish.  Do every hail and every trigger text in order, even if you know you've done it before.  Do an &quot;unlock my memories&quot; in PoK between every major step.  Much better than trying to locate that one specific missed hail.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ganaith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I dont see a bot flag nor agnarr there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">this list from the safe house is pretty good for getting your flags and backflags in check...its a huge pita to go back and make sure its all right.<br />
