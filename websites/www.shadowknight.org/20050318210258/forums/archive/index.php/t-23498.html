<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sildail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was just wondering if those that have done the four SK fights happen to remember where these guys spawn.  I took a tracker into Iceclad to search around there, and after several passes on the three main islands, no dice.  Is this guy on some obscure island in the middle of nowhere or what? I haven't even attempted trying to find the other ones yet.<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Camby_VZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Silithis Sisnta  - Not very hard ... max hit w/ me tanking about 780 ...<br />
Pretty straight up fight.   Hail, get agro .. eat the HT .. bring him back to your compadres .. get him slowed .. cake walk.<br />
<br />
Completed with 2 shaman ( 1 boxed ) ranger &amp; druid.<br />
<br />
<br />
Gubblegrot Smashfist  -  Hardest of the 4 IMO ... max hit w/ me tanking 830 ... had to burn Leechcurse cuz he didn't take slow very well ( turgur's after malos )  He hits pretty quick ( seems to be a bit more resistant that the other 3 ) so I'd suggest a bit more healing unless your shaman has the GoD slow, just to be on the safe side.<br />
<br />
Completed with 2 shaman ( 1 boxed ) ranger &amp; druid<br />
<br />
<br />
Skurza Slickutt  - Seemingly not very hard ... max hit w/ warrior tanking ( no disc ) 780 ... Not hard to find, paths to an island just south ( on the map ) of the iksar tents in swamp.  The Trak tap is easily resisted with my buffed 410ish MR.  Don't think it landed on anyone in the party cept the gimply equipped boxed chanter.  Warrior that tanked him has roughly 9k unbuffed HP.  Not very resistant to any spells ... wizard had a hay day unloading bombs.<br />
<br />
Completed with Warrior / SK / Druid / Cleric / Wizard / 2 Enchanters ( 1 boxed )<br />
<br />
<br />
Giligattabus Igglebix - Very Easy ... max hit &quot; unknown &quot; he only hit me 2 times for 188 ...  Easily took Dark on first cast from me ( lvl 70 / festering ) and never resisted any other castings.  I then loaded up Blood of Inruku / Blood of Hate / FR DoT / sent pet and just kept him darked and DoT'ed occasionally casting Terror of Discord to maintain high agro while lvl 68 pet and lvl 70 paladin beat away on his back side.  This mob can be easily solo'd if you have the patients and mana pool, I'd estimate 15 minutes w/ pet and DoTs.<br />
<br />
Completed with SK / pet / Paladin ( Dark / DoT up / Agro-kite ... 5 minutes to kill )<br />
<br />
All four have a good deal of HP so I'd suggest bringing dps to the fights to bring them all down quick.  Seem to always be up, quick respawn time and always drop their head on death.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Wyrdlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Can these be done out of order, or are they &quot;hail to kill&quot; mobs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Xulan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hail to kill, so you have to have done the Wailing Sister turn in first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kelefane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">All of em were pretty easy for me. I killed them all w/ me (SK), Druid,Mage and a Chanter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Moardok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Took Iglebits with a necro/ranger/sk ...i hailed him got him snared. ToD,aggro kited him ..necro/ranger had feild day on him..melled him last 15%...hardest he hit was 688 and i had rajnja buff and cloak of lucilin. <br />
<br />
took about 2 1/2 minutes. <br />
<br />
if you dont have tracker just head N.E from wizzy port  then when you get to docks Go south he is on the 4 or 5th big glacier south from the docks.<br />
<br />
He can be soloed im sure, just would take a while.</div></div><hr />
