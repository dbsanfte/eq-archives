NEW melee combat system; changes partially announced <br />
<br />
EverQuest Chat on November 24th at 6:00pm - 7:00pm pacific time. Melee System Enhancements! <br />
You've been asking for them and now we're ready to discuss them. We're taking a big departure from what many of you are used to when it comes to combat. With that in mind, here is a brief summary of these exciting enhancements to better help you target your questions to us during the live chat. Don't worry if you miss the chat, we'll post the logs on EverQuestLive.com <br />
<br />
<br />
Increase the contributions melee classes provide in a group setting <br />
Address the current deficit between the pure melee classes and other classes <br />
Add more depth and potential for skilled play to melee combat <br />
Provide a system that encourages attentiveness and decision-making skills, without focusing heavily on twitch gameplay <br />
<br />
Take advantage of an opponent's weakness. See an opening, strike home for the kill! <br />
<br />
Monks, Rogues and Warriors will gain the ability to recognize certain weaknesses in an opponent's defense. These &quot;Openings&quot; will be a variety of types and can occur based on several different situations during combat. Be quick though, an opening will not present itself for long. Strike quick with a new combat skill once your character recognizes an opening. These new combat skills are being designed just for this combat system revision. Using and maintaining these skills expends the character's Endurance (a new statistic, calculated from the character's basic stats). <br />
<br />
<br />
Here's a combat example: <br />
<br />
A warrior is serving as the tank for his group, standing in front of a goblin. While battling the goblin, the warrior makes an exceptional parry and is presented with an opening. An indicator appears with the &quot;opening icon&quot; and the word &quot;Parry&quot; next to it (this information also appears in the chat window). <br />
<br />
Now is his opportunity to strike back after the exceptional parry! Only certain combat skills can be used to react to a parry opening. Other types of openings will allow the use of other skills. Some skills may be usable in response to more than one type of opening. Also, your position in relation to the target can change the effectiveness of certain skills. <br />
<br />
In this case, our warrior knows that he can use one of three combat skills, each having some merit. One might stun the target, one might increase the hate generated by the warrior for a few rounds, and one might make it easier for everyone to hit the NPC. <br />
<br />
In this case, our warrior elects to try to stun the goblin. He presses the appropriate button and luck smiles upon him as he successfully executes the strike, leaving the goblin standing dumbly for a combat round. <br />
<br />
Increasing Your Endurance and Learning New Skills <br />
<br />
<br />
Increase Endurance by increasing attributes or by acquiring special items that directly increase your Endurance pool <br />
Find tomes or instructions manuals and take them to specific trainers to learn new skills <br />
Choose your skills from skill categories (such as Tactical) containing skills focused to a purpose <br />
Most openings are available only to a single character, but some are available to all nearby characters <br />
Disciplines will be transferred to this new system <br />
Existing Discipline timers will be reviewed, and several will probably be set to their own timer <br />
Disciplines will require an Endurance cost <br />
Hybrids will receive a limited Endurance pool for their disciplines <br />
There will be other changes as well. Keep your eyes on the Test server and our update messages for more details as we move forward. <br />
<br />
This new system is much more flexible than the existing disciplines. It will be relatively easy to add new combat skills, as well as new skills that are not limited to openings. This system creates the possibility for tremendous enhancement in the future, allowing groups a large number of options when it comes to melee combat.<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
IMO, sounds VERY nice, but I am still fearful of a nerf, or in the case, being passed over ( esp. as hybrids were pointed out )...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kugbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have a sinking feeling Knights will end with a Nerf bat being swung at us.<br />
<br />
Crying Warriors make me sick, Throw them a bone, but dont take it from my ribcage...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Umm... of course we're going to get passed over Xanathol, its a melee change not melee/hybrid.  The only thing we will benefit from is the disc system being revamped and we aren't the target of that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xanathol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ohkay...last I looked, hybrids were part melee, part caster. Anyhow, my concern is that I fear whatever it is they add to the 'pure' melee may throw things out of wack - I have no faith in SoE. Only time will tell though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Maniacles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">OK, given a setup like this...discuss....I can't make the 24 chat, so maybe someone who reads here will.....<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
In their descriptions, it seems some skills will focus on opening up mobs to attack types, while other skills will focus on taking advantage of those openings.  I see hybrids merely having fewer choices in it, while melees get a full range.<br />
<br />
What CAN'T (but probably will) happen is another &quot;defensive&quot; debacle.  One of the best possible worlds will be defensive being outright killed in effectiveness in the discipline revamp, to be replaced with a much wider variety of skills.  I.E. everyone feels the nerfbat, but then gets a bunch of new non sucky toys in return.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">We are Xanathol, we aren't pure melee however and this change is meant to fix them.<br />
<br />
Ya Maniacles, be interesting to see what ends up happening to Defensive/Evasive.  I'm betting on it staying up for alot less time and other melees (Monks probally or maybe Warriors) get abilites to lower mob dps to compensate for the no def/evasive</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>synnoira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">At this point it sounds pretty benign for sk's. They're adding new variety to the melee classes without taking away anything from us. If i can tank as well as i can now, cast useful spells as i can now, plus get the use of discs more flexibly (or whatever it is they've got planned) it's a positive all round. <br />
<br />
If pick-up groups are more inclined to take a warrior now rather than &quot;hold out&quot; for an sk or paladin, well, that's how balance works. Your choice of character on the character select screen should not be the ultimate governing factor in getting a group. It's not like the idea of reputation or ability to play your class being a deciding factor should be a new thing to sk's.<br />
<br />
Also I'm a bit bemused anybody would think we'd get the full effect of new melee combat abilities. That's not the case now and it has never been the case in the past.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Guys, <br />
<br />
Stay positive!<br />
<br />
Odds are we arent getting any new &quot;Skills/Styles&quot; thats fine.<br />
<br />
But our exsisting Discs will be moved and cost Endurance now to activate sounds interesting.<br />
<br />
They might seperate our disc timers. Imagine if we could Unholyaura every 36mins to match our IHT timer (with Touch of wicked maxed), and even possibly even toss a Leechcurse disc activation in there as well. Both limited application, but still useful.<br />
<br />
Lets remain upbeat until after the dev chat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Xanathol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ok, guess I should spell out my concerns. What I am fearful off is that the examples given open up the opertunity for higher DPS and high aggro. This is ALL spectulation at this time ( I am a &quot;glass is half empty&quot; person ), but what I am concerned about is if its done incorrectly ( too much or not handing something to knights as well ), knights may fall behind in the DPS curve, and warriors generate as much aggro. IF that becomes the case, there would be no need for us - we'd have less DPS ( and in all rights, being the 'offensive tank', we should be ahead of warriors ), we'd have almost equal aggro, and lack in mitigation, avoidance, and HP. Again, this is spectulation, but its what I fear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jobrill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">This is what, the 5th time this info has been posted?<br />
<br />
They can give pure melees all the dumb combo moves they want. If I wanted to twitch buttons, I'd go out and buy a gamecube and a copy of Soul Caliber 2. I'm GLAD they don't plan to give those dumb moves to Shadowknights, less stuff for me to worry about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If they overdo it they'll tune it down Xanathol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Dantraeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I sense a new king of whining class about to emerge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sithanator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'm right now wondering how the endurence bar will will regenerate and where it will be at after rez effects. I would guess it will completely drained after being rezzed, which make sense. That also means you can't disc until you have regained X amount of endurance back. That has greater impact on warriors then it does other class's. But as it stands, i'm guessing we won't be able to HT shortly after being rezzed back. Granted that not much of a set back.<br />
<br />
It would be really nice having unholyaura and leechcurse on a different timer. <br />
<br />
Other questions<br />
<br />
Will these this new system require us to mem are disc's? <br />
<br />
If it does, will meming these require us to give up a spell slot or will we use a different bar to mem in?<br />
<br />
If we do have to mem these, is the reuse timer going to work the same way as recast timer on spells?<br />
<br />
Will the /disc command still work?<br />
<br />
Those are things I look forward to finding out in the near future. Right now not enough is known about how the system will work to form an opinion on this new system.<br />
Later<br />

I seriously doubt it, unless they are going to give Warriors, Rogues, Monks a spell bar, since it also effects them  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ramgar SK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I see them working more like skills do now, such as slam.  Press a button, it takes off endurance, and takes however long to refresh.<br />
<br />
I would love it if the disciplines were on separate timers.<br />
<br />
Problem is, I'm out of hotkeys! and I don't like switching pages in combat.  May be something I need to get used to doing...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Berren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I have many of the same concerns that have been raised in this thread when I first learned of the new melee system.  Mainly that Sk's would be out of a job if warrior's outdamage us and have higher aggro abilities.  However, I still think that many (not all) warriors are just meatbags.  High Hps tanks not use to having to use skill to hold aggro.  An Sk with our aggro buffs and skill and knowlege of our spells will be able to do as well or better than a warrior even with the new mods.<br />
<br />
        And it would be awesome if Unholyaura and Leechcurse were put on different timers, that's my big hope on the disc revamp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Synapticus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Im hoping that this new system will somehow allow SKs/Pallies/Rangers to unhook their disciplines as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Xanathol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Chat Log (http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=59510) <br />
<br />
So its mentioned that warrirors mitigation will be increased, aggro gaining abilities increased, and DPS due to openings ( not exactly sure on this one ) increased, as well as gear concerns. That is why I am fearful...only time will tell. =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Deadalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I don't get it Xanathos - everyone agreed warriors needed a boost and they're now getting it, everyone agreed knights were fine and they're being left alone. Where are the crocodile tears coming from?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Inquestion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I don't get it Xanathos - everyone agreed warriors needed a boost and they're now getting it, everyone agreed knights were fine and they're being left alone. Where are the crocodile tears coming from? <br />
<br />
Warriors need the boost yeah, but if the boost is too big, it could make us much less useful.<br />
No tears yet, but we'll have to wait and see what happens.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Taelia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I think the concern comes from the fact that up to this point SOE had not been very good at class balance. When they give stuff to classes they tend to way over give stuff. When they fix stuff the tend to not remember more than one class can be affected (the agro on disease spells comes to mind). <br />
I don't think many are upset that SOE was willing to help fix the warrior class. I think the concern is how much they fixed them. If they pushed the fix over the top it will very much affect the Knight classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Androsulach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">It's that tendency that has Brael and some of the older Shadow Knights remembering the situation after Kunark was released.  I started playing just a few months before Kunark came out and was too low a level to notice the difference.  In the time it's taken for me to get to where I am now, we've had several changes in the game.  How balanced we have been since Velious and subsequent expansions/extensions have been released is open to debate.  Obviously, SoE thought the pure melees needed a hand.  I think they forgot that the hybrids are also needing that hand, since we aren't as powerful as either the pure melees or the pure casters.  So now, we (all hybrids) are going to get ignored for however long until they release the next expansion.  Will that fix us?  I doubt it.  It'll take us, the paladins, and the rangers to wait and see, document the log parses, and start making noise if we suddenly become the base of the totem pole.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">The real problem for high end Knights up until the next expansion isn't going to be the power difference between us and Warriors but the fact that encounters only allow a limited number of people now.  72 in Time and 36 in LDoN, we lose our one advantage (atleast you will want to drag one Paladin along for Brells) and why let that class come along when someone more effective does it just as well?<br />
<br />
Oh, given the mitigation differences between Knights/Wars already (and yes, it's there from their seperate mitigation table which is a slight advantage) and higher damage avoidence this change will mean a 9500 hp War tanking as well as a 10200 hp Knight.  To put that in perspective an average geared elemental Warrior has 9500 hp, an above average geared Knight in Time has 10200.  Factor in a rediculous sustained aggro increase and the next expansions starting to look real fun for us, espically if they continue the trend of limited number content.<br />
<br />
We won't be fucked in PoP (some of you non PoP raiding SK's are going to feel it bad though) since content was designed with our abilities in mind, atleast as you get further into it, future content is going to be messed up though if the changes go in as they currently are.  Hopefully I'm just overreacting to some bad information so I'm withholding final judgement on the changes until I see them live, hell could still be getting tuned but it's cause for concern.  I'll leave you with those thoughts.<br />
<br />
PS.  I'm not against any of the upcoming Warrior changes (except the mitigation one, thats rediculous, shielding - sure, better mitigation table - sure, flat reduction on every hit - fuck no), but too much is going in for them at once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Deadalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">hybrids are also needing that hand, since we aren't as powerful as the pure melees <br />
<br />
:D :D :D :D :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Chrissi SL</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">If they screw this up hybrids should should quit eq. I was there for kunark and soloed forever. Hit em where it hurts all theycare about is your 13.95 a month anyway. I will be the 1st to cancel if they fuk up and i also won't buy a sony product ever again 8P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Xanathol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">On Test (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spelllist.html?classes=WAR&amp;source=Test)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Winkles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Those are some cool looking abilities.  That 4 second stun is a doozy of an ability.  Get enough warriors together and you could lock down a mob indefinately if you got lucky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Or you could just get 2 paladins and stun a mob forever guaranteed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Winkles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I thought that spell stuns stopped working on high level mobs.  Could be wrong since I've never played a paladin before and more than likely never will.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">They have stuns that work up to 65</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Synapticus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">and Divine stun works up to 68, i think.</div></div><hr />
