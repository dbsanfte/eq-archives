<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>vilesoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been having this little annoyance happen about once every two weeks.  Either in game or during the char select screen, I would not be able to see textures whatsoever.  None, just the sky background.  Here is a link to my yahoo briefcase to show you the pic of PoK when that happened.  Happens right when the screen loads, and goes away after about 5 mins.  The pic is weird_eq_pic.<br />

<br />
I was wondering what anyone here who has seen this did to fix it?<br />
<br />
I'm running DX9a and WHQL certified drivers for my GeForce4.  OS is Win2000 pro SP4.<br />
<br />
This one has stumped me since it's such a hard-to-repeat event that I am having a hard time debugging it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bradven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Dude,  you got no doors or windows into your room on your room lay-out.  I won't be able to sleep until you fix that.  All I'll be able to do is think of some guy in a box  with a bed.<br />
<br />
Kind of a 'boxing helena' EQ version</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shaedii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have a strange graphics glitch too. Everytime I go to Vex Thall, when we first get into the hallway that has the port to the Aten prep room, in the middle of the crossroads there is this HUGE tree trunk looking thing. As I get closer to the crossroads, it finally vanishes. But if I back up again, it's there again.<br />
<br />
Happens everytime, the exact same way, but only in that hallway. Doesn't happen in the hall that Kelun is in, although the room is exactly same graphicly.<br />
<br />
Who knows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>vilesoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hehe, that was for a hi-fi forum, that weird attempt at a curve in the upper right is supposed to represent the door area.  All those numbers went with a key in my post explaining them, so they could have a better understanding of the worst-case acoustics in my room.  I also omitted windows since it would only copmlicate things, I have one on the left wall and a smaller one on the bottom wall, if that helps you sleep.  :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
It was mostly about dealing with an annoyingly resonant &quot;permanent&quot; closet making my bass sound like crap....well the landlord says it is not to be moved, so it's permanent...doesnt mean I can't do some things to it I can revert later though. :p<br />
<br />
I use that link for posting all my forum junk, someday I might care to make special ones for each board, but i doubt it.</div></div><hr />
