<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi guys just got some questions for ya. <br />
<br />
How hard is the Mummy of Glohnor? 65/70aa SK here just wondering what numbers u guys estimate id need. <br />
<br />
What is the drop rate on jail cell keys from Mimic's? and can the cell be lockpicked? <br />
<br />
any info is appreciated :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ziagwa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hes not hard but the fuckton of adds are, they respawn FAST down there so have a nice crew i had a two grouper and we still had problems with all those adds</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Uggliey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Can do it with one group easy if you do it smart.  The adds suck so pull them first, do turn in and then move and kill him in the basement.  No adds there.<br />
<br />
The &quot;a_chest&quot;(no longer called mimmic) seems to drop them about 50% I think.  It's not too rare,  we got 2 in the first clearing.   And it's not a cell your unlocking, it's a item you hand into an NPC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hemlocc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i soloed the cell key heh actually twice cause i lost 1st because faction wasn't high enough but both times the key dropped about the 2nd spawn. we did glohnor easily with 3 groups of mid 50's. /agree with the others pull the entire base of that tower before you run down there for turn in..we fit entire raid there by coffins. with 2 groups of 60's it shouldn't be a problem but be sure to take a good chanter can get kinda messy down there</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Yaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Had a group when I went down to get Glohnor with no cleric either.  We had a chanter but some things couldn't be mezzed down there.  Glohnor was MR as heck too.  Couldn't land snare no lifetap on him at all and he started running into the ghost's room at low health.  That coulda been messy had we not brought the chanter, the ghosts were mezzable.  The adds do suck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rotaidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The mummy is easy. So if you are up for some fun, you should try to solo it.<br />
It's quite doable. I did all The Hole parts myself some days ago.<br />
<br />
But safe your Harmtouch for the end of the fight. The mummy seems to be immune to darkness and will run with low health.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>mystarwina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">the mimics are easy now.... 3 spawn at a time, and the most I've had to kill to get a key drop, was 8 or 9.... (3 rounds)... est respawn time is 20-30 min.  <br />
<br />
Haven't done Glohner yet, or Lhanc... those are next in line after I kill Kyrenna again to get her blood.<br />
<br />
yeah yeah.. I didn't follow the hide/invis trick to the T.... and they will eat your turn in... so, I'm factioning just to save my guildies some grief of doing it over and over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nyrvel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Did Glohner with 8 people, mixed 50 - 65. Have to admit, would have been nice to have more, can have no mistakes on Pulls or remembering the Pull Cycle. If you take a small group, go with higher levels and be prepared to move fast. Glohnor himself was easy, Pull'ed him from basement to Turn-in Area and Corner'ed him, he didn't move and 'Push' kept him in the corner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>XebarisTP</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Had 2 groups, cleared the tower base, other sk handed in shroud, and within 10 seconds or so the Mummy ran out of the tower to the hand-in spot, where we killed him. No adds whatsoever. After just a few minutes, Ghost of Glohnor repopped (check both left and right side of tower base) and it was my turn to hand in shroud, and the mummy ran out to meet us again, with no adds. Don't know why the basement is mentioned at all.<br />
<br />
Now trying to spawn Marl Kastane AGAIN. This is the stupidest part of the epic. YOU make him despawn, and then you bloody need him again, almost immediately. But noooo, you gotta wait the 3 days or whatever first.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>nnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I did this with one balanced group. Had a couple tanks, a slower, a cleric. Getting to the graveyard was the hardest part, because they kept respawning. at one point when spawns were low, we just rushed the graveyard, killed whatever mobs followed us in and sat in the far corner near the ghost. <br />
<br />
After turn in, we waited. after a few minutes, someone sent out an eye of zomm to check and found the mummy standing just inside the tower, near the door. just as we were going to rush the mummy, he warped through the wall and went for us. so bascially, do the turn in and sit tight. the mummy will find you.<br />
<br />
the fight itself was way easier than the break in. i was even able to get his MR down and the shaman was able to slow him. he died fast. <br />
<br />
the only thing i would have changed would have been to bring a few more DPS folks so that the clearing would have went faster without the repops. otherwise, gravy.</div></div><hr />

I went there with about 9 peeps, Ornate stuff, and we had troubles getting the repops down to move in. IVU doesnt work as well as the golem types and i think4 gargs sitting on the way to him see through....</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Aoninie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">He is not in the castle. He is either on the left or right side of it in one of the graveyards. He may be laying down in a coffin. If he's not on one of those sides he isn't spawned. The only epic mob that got moved (I think) is the shaman mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>phlegyas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I 2 boxed it with a 65 sk/18 aa and 65 cleric with 75aa<br />
<br />
It was very hard getting into the castle. The first time I didnt take the cleric in and lost the solo fight with the SK. When I went back down to try again, I used pacification to get into the left graveyard and I camped the cleric, than I tried to spawn him again on the right graveyard, made a huge train by accident (got harmshield off at 10%) and ran to left graveyard. To my surprise, the mummy was still up from the day before. I Logged the cleric in and was able to kill him.<br />
<br />
Nothing will assist the mummy, good thing too, cause when it started to run, I FDed and let the cleric pet finish it =)<br />
<br />
was a very fun time!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Utanlain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Just soloed Mummy of Glohnor tonight, and it was not too complicated.<br />
<br />
Going there was cake, and I was lucky to find the Ghost in the left graveyard, where the only danger is a roamer or two.<br />
<br />
I started fight at full life, with self-buffs only (like 8700hp, 2100AC) but I had VoQ and Vallon from the previous raid, and stacked for about 33 DS.<br />
<br />
The only issue was that I didn't have my HT up when he started running (yeah, silly me :)) so I had a bit of a hard time keeping track of him running (slowly) around while FDing the adds. He does seem to run in circles from left GY =&gt; first outside the castle, then he turns left and hugs the wall, then back and inside the castle itself (that's where I didn't follow him) but he soon exited and I could finish him with my HT which had just popped up.<br />
<br />
I damaged him mostly with ToI, ToV and ZB and he hit for max 89 I think.<br />
<br />
Voila, only need to find Marl up now, and then here I come Lhranc :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>sluggas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">thankyou so much for the help guys i saw hime on the left side of the castle, never looked there before</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Utanlain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Oh, one more note : his regen is close to 0, so should not be an issue.<br />
<br />
I FDed a roamer and got the 'Your enemies have forgotten you!' message, and he had only regened 1%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>sluggas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">i read around when i went to the hole today, i found the ghost on the left side of the castle, turned it in. about a minute went by and i started to wonder where this mummy dude was, went around FDing and went just to the enterence of the whole castle and fded , i saw him and waited for the other mobs to go away. He hit me for about 250's and i started to fight him at 60% hp because all of the mobs there. it was just me and the mummy , mono e mono, me at 60%, if i had to guess i would say this mummy has around 15 to 20k hp, i hted em for a little under 10k which was helpful. but of corse like the bum i am i somehow got an add which was those anoyying construct things,tryed to kill em but had to fd. i waited and was at around 25% while the mummy was around 25%, i was able to get off any of the spells i used except my snare/dot. And because i didnt load one more nuke, i died and the mummy was at 2%, no lie. i got some coffins and shrinks and by the time i was back there which was around 15 min, the mummy was surprisingly at 41%  so this guy has insainly slow as syurp in janurary regen , i got em solo keeping myself between the 2 constructs and killed him, not to mention he does summon and runs at about 12 % or so hp but the fortunate 2hbash was worth it. got me loots and now 2 npc turn ins and one final fight away from my epic, my gear aint the best but aint the worst, full ele cept for helm legs bp, and i got a timeless greatsword thing from phase 3 in time. so there are the true facts on how to do this mob. thanks sluggas coolbeans from veeshan guild kratos.... www.kratos.org :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>RosefireII</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Solo Glohnor awhile ago.<br />
<br />
Went down to the castle, check right and left graveyard but didn't find him. Went down to the basement and found him in a small room, lying on top of a coffin, roughly on the right graveyard side if you're facing the castle. <br />
<br />
Hand in the quest item using /hide. Mummy pop just the opposite room of the ghost. Pull the mummy into the room, melee it, Dot, lifetap and HT. Start running prolyl around 20%. Was a easy kill. Only got 1 add during the fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Lynya Shaddowfury</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">For those of you who aren't EP/Time geared and running around pwning the world (we do exist)...<br />
<br />
Take 2 solid groups 60+ or more if the peeps are lower level. DPS melee, many of the creatures are high MR and lvl 56+. Once you've worked around to the castle front, paci gargoyles up top and pull the spirits. There's also a pair of wandering constructs, take them out, kill the gargoyles and keep the pulling at a good rate; a necro is invaluable for feeding the cleric(s), if necessary. Have your tracker check which side the ghost is on; left or right. You can actually get just inside the door and not agro the second pair of gargoyles if your raid group is small or smart enough to stick close to the wall (shrink is your friend). Since the mummy will pop on the left side basement, move your raid to the left side GY, paci or kill that gargoyle.  <br />
<br />
 From what I read here that the mummy would run out of the basement, he DID NOT for us, after several minutes of twiddling our thumbs we tried to pull the spirits there and got them all, which was all right, the enc mezzed, no big deal. Everyone pounced on the mummy and was beating him down, but when he started to run (15%) he was too close to the repoped front yard.<br />
<br />
Ouch. <br />
<br />
Somehow he managed to die at the feet of the ghosts outside the front entrance. The necro rezzed the cleric who rezzed the rest of us. We weren't able to clear to it in time and the corpse rotted. Immediately after the depop, ghost of glohnor was up, this time in right side (he had been in left when I turned in). <br />
<br />
Many of the posts above mine hadn't yet been made when we went; but now the lessons are learned: sufficient DPS for quicker pulling; just pull the basement before turn in; move into the basement or handle push better.<br />
<br />
Kyrenna will taste my sword again when Caradon is finally up after all the server downs and patches  :mad: <br />
Then I will make a nice fat raid and have *no* issues for the next time.</div></div><hr />
