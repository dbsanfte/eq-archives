<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ghoule</div><div class="date">07-12-2004, 05:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just wanted a quick reality check and maybe some orientation, for my own sanity if nothing else.<br />
I did some tanking in a LDON normal yesterday. I am level 50 and the average level of the group was level 49. Our puller was a level 47 monk that seemed to have NFC about how to play, he would pull a mob, didnt know how to feign split (which with a SK in the group would have been some easy pulling really, 2 FD pullers make splitting as a team seamless) and when I was doing Feign pulling to split a bad room, he wandered up and drug 3 mobs back to the group /yell ing for help the whole time. On a pull he would walk up to the mob he was &quot;pulling&quot; and attack it, expecting the rest of the group to magically appear at his side. He attacked mezzed mobs while the rest of the group worked on the one I was tanking, on singles he would stand right next to me and attack and got riposted a lot, draining the already struggeling very untwinked cleric.<br />
I just naturally assumed he was playing someone elses toon, maybe a little brother on his big bro's account, something, so I nicely said in group that he needed to let me do the pulling and hang back some (thats when he aggroed 3 mobs and nearly got us killed). Just a total dumb ass.<br />
Now I am pretty patient, but he started getting under my skin, and me and the rest of the group are in /tells about him. Then he starts to bitch at me about my holding aggro. Starts bitching about getting hit (ripostes and only on pulls) and says that I dont know what the fuck I am doing as a tank and to hold aggro. He then claims that he has a 65 beastlord with 600 AA blah blah blah. Pretty fuggin stupid for someone with so much supposed skill under his belt.<br />
The real point of all this is here is what I am doing to get, and hold rather well, aggro...standard line up of Clinging Darkness, Clinging Darkness....and oh yeah Clinging Darkness, with a Clinging Darkness tossed in for good measure.<br />
I had a KEI so I speared whenever they refreshed (kept em both up) and would toss a terror or two at mezzed mobs when the chanter could keep them mezzed (dumb ass monk) and would wait to cast Clinging till I got a successful Taunt message. No one other than the monk took any aggro, but stuff like that gets under my skin. I know I was doing things right, but is there anything else that I could do at my level (Fear isnt generally an option at my level) that would give me a better lock? I have read all the guides, read what came up on search and it seems that the old tried and true CD is all that really gets mentioned....any other ideas?<br />
(Edit: Hope this is the right forum, I hate to wake the beasts here hehe)</div></div><hr />

Dumb people can only learn through harm. Oh and put him on the no group list and ignore, there isnt much else you can do about such morons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Skvan</div><div class="date">07-12-2004, 06:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">At lvl 50 your doing everything right to get and keep aggro. CD rules, 3 of them at the start of each mob and its yours pretty much no matter what anyone else does<br />
<br />
Idiots are idiots and yeah get people like that in the gorup then just have a quiet conversation with the healer and get them to allow them to die. Sometimes you have to be cruel to be kind. Bah ignore that, sometimes its just plain fun to be cruel :)</div></div><hr />

If you cast CD 3 times, he wasn't getting hit unless he was positioning himself in front of the mob with you, which there's a good chance he was.  3 CD's is going to lock down a lot more aggro than any 49 monk is going to be able to pull.  Did you see the mob turning?  <br />
<br />
I'm surprised you guys lasted the whole adventure with the jerk off.  I'd have pulled out my worker sledgemallet and gated the fuck outta there.</div></div><hr />

Dont rez him. Let him die again. He'll get the idea.</div></div><hr />

The only thing you can do for agro at level 50 other than CD is use terrors. At level 50 they still work rather well, I usually used them as a quick agro lock right after my first CD, I would cast it during CD's refresh time. You only really need to do that if you've got stupid casters popping their best nukes on inc, other than that, you're fine.</div></div><hr />
