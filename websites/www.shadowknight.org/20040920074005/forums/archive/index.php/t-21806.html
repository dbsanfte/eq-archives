<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>sluggas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i went to the hole today and finally got that bastard ratman guard after about an hour of camping hehe. i desided to skip on since i was already in the hole and already had the cell key, so i went to caradon followed the epic chat and i gave him my key. he must have ate it or something because he said something along the likes of hating my guts, guessing i didn't have enough faction.<br />
hope i can still do the quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>SuDanger68</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Just go down, get another key and do again....seems he is THE item eater. almost every sk i know had to do this part twice :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aoninie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You must have skipped parts. Try running seals to get your faction up. That's what I did before I even went down into the Hole. I had no intention of ever getting the dusty tome but we got it by accident while we were in the area doing the shaman epic. My guild knocked out the shaman, ranger, and SK epic pieces all on one raid. Takes some coordination cause you have to run back to Marl to do a turn-in before you hit Glohnor. Just need to be grouped with a porter and a mage who can summon you.</div></div><hr />
