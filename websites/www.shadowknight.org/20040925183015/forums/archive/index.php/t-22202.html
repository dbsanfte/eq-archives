<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Going through the posts here and on the other boards, these seem to be the 3 biggest one people are asking for (although necro res was a close 3rd) so unless a bunch of people come up with some good arguments going to go with these 3 for our new list.  Don't worry where they appear in it, the order of the list doesn't matter.<br />
<br />
Damage mitigation through spells, abilities, discs, etc... to compete with Paladin stuns.<br />
<br />
Removal of or toggle added to spell casting subtlety, toggle being preferred<br />
<br />
Revision of Leech Touch, it costs more aa but does less of a hp swing than the cheaper skill using it's same timer and cannot be focused.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Removal of or toggle added to spell casting subtlety, toggle being preferred <br />
<br />
Did that beat out weapon procs firing before our self imbued procs? I am not saying that spell casting subtlety is not important, but how many people really ever purchased spell casting subtlety?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I thought that the proc order was one of those &quot;not going to change it&quot; things, though I might be wrong about that.  The issues that Brael posted to add to the list seem like quality additions to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Are these three derivatives of the the &quot;Top 10&quot; list, or in addition to?  Or are one of these three the 10th on an existing list of 9?<br />
<br />
Sorry, read so many lists lately, I'm starting to get mixed up.  I don't want to comment on something I think is missing if these three are additions to an existing list, nor not comment thinking they are but are really the only three issues.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What these are, are the replacements for two issues labelled as &quot;not going to be changed&quot; or something like that, and the tenth issue to add to our list, since we originally only had nine.  They certainly aren't the only issues on our list, and not even necessarily the most important ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Okie, understood.  I reviewed the top 10 list near the bottom of this page plus the one on the Sony boards just before posting but thought it was still worth clarifying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Elkar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'd venture to guess that the vast, vast majority of SK's didn't buy SCS, and thus its a non-issue to most.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Heh, I would take that WA works on self imbued proc and have it checked FIRST or necro rezz over fix on subtlety anyday cuz subtlety only applies to very few of SK population. Should the majority of SK population being penalized for this by giving up 10th slot for something that largely unaffected to them?<br />
<br />
I think you probably could just try to make a special personal request to SOE to refund or toggle AA that you bought that ended up hurting you later on due to game mechanics change without having it ended up on top 10 for everyone? I, for one, would LOVE to CHANGE subtlety ENTIRELY for any other archtype skill that can serve us more. Heck, If I over aggro, I simply back out or FD and come back up quickly to re-engage but from now on, warriors wouldn't have a problem to taunt anyway. I don't see why SK would ever have a &quot;GUT&quot; to buy anything that will REDUCE their taunt power that they screamed for more taunt. That is rather irony but I understand about the need of it by few uber SKs before the warrior taunt fix. I would kill myself before I buy it, heh. Completely counterproductive to aggro master.<br />
<br />
I just hate hate to GIVE up necro rezz or WA fix just to get subtlety fixed that 95%+ of us never had it all along. WA fix and necro rezz WILL affect 100% of SK community. I see that WA fix or necro rezz is a win. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Chania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">SCS doesn't deserve a spot on that list. It should be fixed, I agree, but not at the cost of denying something like Necro rez a shot. Thats way WAY more important to more SK's that the few who bought SCS when aggro wasn't an issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Rhumba_Kween</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I thought there was more support for asking for a disease deubuff to be added to malo, then for an SCS toggle. <br />
<br />
Must admit for the vast majority that did not buy SCS, it's not really an issue. I don't think I ever saw anyone advocate SCS being a good buy for an SK on these boards. Also at one point, one of the Web Mods saids its best not to ask for something completely new. And a Toggle would seem completely new to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shurlock</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well....<br />
<br />
It would be a GREAT buy if it had a toggle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I thought there was more support for asking for a disease deubuff to be added to malo, then for an SCS toggle. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I dunno cuz I talked to my SHM friend and he said that they do have SPECIAL disease debuff line already and they don't see the need of having disease debuff on malo line. If they get disease debuff on malo then they can cast special disease debuff to stack with it that would surely makes disease debuff so powerful. Damage is already done I think. ;( Would need to discontinue disease debuff line just to add disease debuff on malo which is more headache than simply add -25 to -50 disease MOD to our spear line (SO MUCH EASIER THAT WAY to compensate). Don't care if other hybrid with fire and cold DD line similar to our spear has no modifier. They enjoy it more against malo'ed mob while our spear doesn't so we should get special treatment to be in-line with them by just slapping negative DR modifer to all of our spears.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sithanator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I would it be better to push leech touch to be on it own timer. But beefing it up to competive with IHT for hp swing is good. Due to NPC dsp IHT will still often often be used over LC.  If it forced a crit out of both of SCF and TOL the hp swing would be near(still under) where it should be compared to IHT.<br />

I think maybe that might be a personal desire coming though Brael.  I'd venture to say that 95% of SKs don't give a shit about SCS either way.<br />

<br />
I would also add that SCS is not an issue for me, personally.  Most (I SAID MOST, not ALL) Sks would avoid that AA like the plague.  It should be fixed, like a bug, but not one of our Top 10s.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kyfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Both necro rez and proc order are more important than Leech Touch and far more important than SCS. <br />
<br />
Necro Rez would be very useful in 6 man content to have a second rezzer who can FD, and for raid recovery.<br />
<br />
Proc order helps us ALWAYS once we buy WA, which most would buy.<br />
<br />
Leech Touch is marginally useful in a best case scenario and extremely expensive to &quot;max out&quot; for a crappy heal once every long time. <br />
<br />
SCS most didn't buy and so is a non-issue for most. Even toggleable, it's no big deal because it isn't hard these days for warriors to keep aggro and for us to avoid aggro. <br />
<br />
Soooo, necro rez first, then proc order, then a distant third leech touch, and SCS a very distant fourth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Necro res=entirely new ability that is out of character for sk's<br />
Proc order they've already said no on<br />
Disease resist was already in another point<br />
<br />
Sithanthor, valid point what about rewording it to something like uhh.. Leech Touch is a more expensive AA than IHT, provides less of a hp swing, cannot be focused, cannot be disced, and by using it it blocks us from using our better HT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Daywalka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I'd venture to say that 95% of SKs don't give a shit about SCS either way.<br />
<br />
I'm sure more than you think support a SCS toggle and/or removal, but I would guess it's still not very many. The sheer fact that the description of the AA says it makes mobs notice your magic spells less would tell people to steer the hell away from it. I would prefer about 20 things over anything to do with SCS, that would impact all SKs, not just a few who bought the wrong AA.<br />
<br />
This is list is what the majority of SKs want. If it turns into what a few top-end SKs want, then why bother with a list? Making high GoD items have better focii and removing an AA that few people bought in the first place isn't what's good for the whole Shadow Knight community. Things that universally help us like spells, our mitigation, future AAs, FD Hotkey, damage reducing discs should be the bulk of the list IMO. Getting a few AA fixes and a few items that make your HT do a little more damage every hour is a dumb way to create a list to balance Shadow Knights.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Nazak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I would support fixing the scs aa for the following reasons:<br />
<br />
-It's clearly broken.  It affects melee aggro as well as spell aggro.<br />
<br />
-It should be an easy fix, that can soon be replaced with a new concern.  Half of the problems in this last major patch were due to them revamping the aa infrastructure.  Supposedly, this would make changing and adding aa abilities much easier, so here's a chance for them to put their money where their mouth is.<br />
<br />
-While I don't have any scs now, I would likely get it if it could be toggled.  It's not a giant power upgrade, but it would be worthwhile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Lynxal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Ask your shammy friend how often he casts his Decay line, the disease debuff line.  The problem is no one uses disease spells but SKs on an every mob basis.  Decay only gets cast on boss mobs and only when the boss will live longer than 2 minutes and the necros and shammies can use their longer duration DoTs.<br />
<br />
I don't think we should be tied to a shammie for our spells to work.  Our spells should just all be -200 to disease.  It's pathetic our spells taken into account for balancing purposes hardly ever land.  Add that to the list.  Even our spells like Aura of Darkness with a -75 disease check, that thing never lands on the boss mobs I actually need the resists for.<br />
<br />
They ought to make the shammie disease debuff line just like the sinia line.  It's a bonus to the base resist defbuff of Malo but then harder to land as a result.<br />
<br />
What's worse for everyone now is that in GoD the shammies aren't even casting malo most of the time.  The new shammie slow doesn't require it so even if they do cast malo they cast it second most of the time when the mob is already down to 60% health.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Krudler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Even though I have SCS and would love to see it fixed, it should not be on our top ten list.  As has been said before, it does not affect very many SKs and there are other ideas that would have a greater impact overall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Manslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">It may not affect as many people, but it has a signifcant impact on those that it does affect, while the WA thing has a lesser affect on more people.  And there is actual potential for the change in proc order to be somewhat of a nerf if you have a weapon with a superior proc to the self buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Hehe Manslayer.. You say it cuz you bought SCS as well. :) I know that you regret it for so long and really wished to have it refunded that I can totally understand.  Only SKs who has it will support Brael's obviously.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I don't have SCS, but I support making it a toggle, or just outright getting rid of it.  The reason is that I have a huge problem with any ability that we get that makes us worse at what we do, and I also think that it should be something easy to change so that it can be fixed and then removed from the list.  In terms of following the guidelines as laid out by SOE, I think it should be on the top ten list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Kyfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I hate to tell you Manslayer, but if something affects 5 SKs a lot, that still doesn't make it important enough to get on a top ten list. The top ten list should consist of issues which affect a lot of people by a significant degree. And when you say WA has a lesser affect on more people, I would wager it is ALOT more people. Like 10,000% or more. Very few people got SCS.  Make a poll if you will (no cheating Brael  :) ), and see if SCS gets any decent percentage of votes. It won't. <br />
<br />
And Brael, given we are a necro/warrior hybrid with most of our spells being shared with necros, and paladins get rez from their cleric parents, yes, necro rez is SKish.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Gash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I really want necro rez; just showing my support for that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Xanathol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">The tanking one and the LT work well for me. I don't have SCS, but can see the benefits of it if on a toggle...I just feel the other issues are more important. Personally, would just like to see a seperate thread on SoE's boards to push refunding the AA for SKs.<br />
<br />
Also, Brael, I noticed monks(?) broke down their lists into subtopics and got individual responses to each sub...can we add a few to the list? While I do understand the gains to be had with generalist topics, putting things in like the 'no discipline to handle high damage spikes' as subs, I think, would be a good thing. Also throw freakin suspend minion in somewhere, although I am sure they would view that as a 'wish'. =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Sorry Kyfe can't have it both ways, either we share their spells or we don't.  SK spells are all pretty much selfish.  Our spells got seperated from Necros long ago.<br />
<br />
Xanathol, ours was broken down into sub topics, they gave us a response on the top thing only, when I brought that up to them I got ignored... twice, so I wouldn't hope for much as far as that goes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">What about fixing furious bash again so it works with spells?  That seemed like it worked well but got nerfed.<br />

<br />
Rez I would like to go with my suggestion of emergency aa rez componetless once every RL 24 hours for emergency rez.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I'd support SCS toggles too, even though I don't have it, but not as a Top-10 issue.<br />
<br />
Although we may now have separated from the necros, we still have the roots there.  We started with lifetaps, snares, fear, pets and some utility spells.  Even up to lvl 65 we got necro pets, corpse summoning w/small coffins, pet buff, etc.  And we are going to get another pet (nfc what kind of pet) in OoW.  I don't think getting a necro rez is out of the question or out of line or that we shouldn't because of a separation from the necro class.  That it might be overpowering for us is another matter entirely though.<br />
<br />
One thing that's being discussed on the cleric boards is a transport-to-corpse spell ability for the other priest classes (no xp but allows rez afterwards).  That might be more up our alley.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>DarkNight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I agree with the majority here that SCS should be removed from the top 10 list. <br />
Not sure what to replace it with Splitting up the LT and HT timers would be useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Arikash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">SCS toggle on/off should be toggleable, but it shouldn't be for just SK's alone, they should make that for all the classes that can buy it, therefore, it should be on another list, which isn't on the SK top 10 list, but a general top 10 list.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Samir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">SCS doesn't deserve to make it into the top 10. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>aress</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Again, I feel spell casting sublety is not too important.  Let's not dilute the most important issue paladin stuns</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Rueeliar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Reword it to &quot;look into our aggro generation:  Our spell aggro does not scale properly with those we need to out-aggro using the intended spells, and our melee aggro is improperly affected by external sources (Spell Casting Subtlety) or unaffected where it should be enhanced (Furious Bash).&quot;<br />
<br />
Everyone's happy, then.<br />
<br />
Edit:  The first part is what I want examined, dammit... Terror doesn't work right, we're falling farther and farther behind on melee dps-based aggro, and nukers nuke harder and healers heal better.  The trend will continue in OoW.  My dependancy upon my unreliable Taunt button keeps growing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Kyfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">The fact is, our vaunted &quot;utility&quot; of old has evaporated to near nothing due to the proliferation of worn and clicked effects. There is certainly basis to give us necro rez given we are a necro hybrid and get many necro spells. It gives people an extra reason to bring us along at a time when such reasons are thin. Many want it. Put it on the list. Take a poll if you don't think it is a top ten issue, I guarantee it makes it into the top ten.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Samir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">you get to have 10 things on the list (order doesn't matter) <br />
<br />
This worries me a little. Because at the end of the day when the developers have to report what they have done to their supervisors, they can say &quot;Well we have fixed 3 of the major issues of the sk class and have another 5 that we are currently working on....&quot;  This might mean that they have actually done something or they have fixed the less important 'easy' problems and just avoided all the most important ones. <br />
<br />
What would be good if once we have a Top Ten list, if the sk community could Vote on a poll which of the list they want fixed/adressed first. Then you could include SCS or anything else but if, for example, 90% of sks see having seperate HT timers as the most important issue then that gets  sorted out first, not SCS which might have only 1% of the vote.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Pestulance</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">SCS would be nice if it was Spell Casting Aggression for SK's (suggested before I know), adding a percent to their aggro, and toggled.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Tillesia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">This is my take on the issues raised in brael's recent thread - i'm not sure of how to put up a poll so if someone could please do so, i think we could get some more statistical input as to the relative support each issue gets.<br />
<br />
1.  [Brael] Damage mitigation through spells, abilities, discs, etc... to compete with Paladin stuns.<br />
<br />
I think this is almost universally approved, and gives the devs the point that we need to close the pally/SK gap while giving them adequate discretion as to the many ways this is possible.  :D <br />
<br />
2.  [Brael] Removal of or toggle added to spell casting subtlety, toggle being preferred<br />
<br />
Arguments for: Obviously broken AA.  Might be an easy fix that can be quickly addressed and replaced by another option.<br />
<br />
Arguments against:  Affects only a small number of high-end SKs.  Issue list should address problems of the class as a whole, and the small proportion of SKs that would benefit from this list item does not justify using one of the 10 slots in lieu of a more general request while we have so many competing issues.<br />
<br />
3.  [Brael] Revision of Leech Touch, it costs more aa but does less of a hp swing than the cheaper skill using it's same timer and cannot be focused.<br />
<br />
This is an item where the argument is about relative importance and relevance to the SK community as a whole v. other outstanding issues/requests.<br />
<br />
4.  [others] Addition of rez ability - either as necro rez or an SK line.<br />
<br />
Arguments for:  SK utility is sorely lacking, especially as FD pulling becomes ever more irrelevant.  Rez ability would increase SK desireability and utility in single groups and other non-&quot;traditional group&quot; situations as it would help reduce downtime and corpse recovery times and general group frustration level (not even taking into account xp benefits).  To argue that a rez function is opposed to the SK philosophy is to say that zevfeer's bite and auras should be removed and that summon corpse was a mistake - while our buffs are all self-only, much of our utility (and indeed almost the entirety of our role in EQ) is group-oriented.<br />
<br />
Arguments against:  SK rez is counter to the entire philosophy of playing an SK.  Not only is it counter to the SK philosophy, it is unprecedented and unbalancing to grant a completely new ability to a class that already has enough balancing problems.  Addition of SK rez would not help our desirability in raids and hardly so in groups.  Added utility is just more ammunition for knight-bashers who say &quot;see you have utility, you don't need to tank any better!&quot; without regard to the fact we're beginning to fail in our primary role.  Thus, rez ability is counter productive to our main goal of tanking viability.<br />

In fact, I would even be happy to ignore the mitigation issue, dps, and anything else if we could rezz a smashed cleric.<br />
<br />
Rezz + FD is a raid saver, a something that mitigates the hours spent clearing to a point just to loose the clerics to a random add and be left with a wasted play session.<br />
<br />
However I do understand that it would be nice to have a significant ability to at least off tank adds. What use is a tank if they cant tank. Even rangers do better than us with weapon shield.<br />
<br />
Some form of short term damage mitigation would be good.<br />
Just for long enough to get slow to land. 10 - 20 secs.<br />
<br />
What about soul grip. Hitting the shadowknight incurs severe pain and confusion causing the mob to hessitate between swings. Make is scale. Make it swing delay is halved for 45 secs. Make it incure severe hatred.<br />
<br />
Not as good as defensive, because it is only single target. And it wont mitigate as much damage cause it doesnt reduce the dmg amount.<br />
<br />
Should enable us to offtank, and hold a mob till slowed.<br />
<br />
Those two would make us desirable raid attendee's on par with the other tanks.</div></div><hr />

Sympathize with SKs that did buy it but come on the % of SK that have it must be pretty small compared to the % of SKs that would benifit from having a necro rez and the top 10 is supposed to be what is best for the class not for a small minority of the class</div></div><hr />

in a perfect world, something that allowed us to continue meleeing while casting our spells, so that using our spell DPS didn't have a negative impact on our melee DPS... would be available somewhere at the high end through AAs or item effects, or even granted to all hybrids in general... as we are defined by our abilities to cast while meleeing.  in support of this, beastlords, rangers and SKs could all use some help in the total DPS department... this would be a nice fix</div></div><hr />

Does it deserve to be on the top 10?   I dunno.   Would it help bring some utility in line with pallies?   yep.   I've lost count on the number of times a pally had to rez in the cleric from an error, and saved us 20+ min on a CR run.   Having SK's be able to do something close to this would be of great help, and not as much of a limiting factor.   I know I hesitate picking SK's for my tipt pharming groups I make with my wiz for guildies.   Having the pally there as a 2nd rezer is a very nice addition, that I've had to use many times.</div></div><hr />

I would guess 1 in 6 trials ends in us having to quit, simply because the cleric died and I'm a SK and not a Pally. Although I'm not sure that SK's should get rezz. More than 3 classes in the game should be able to rezz, if the Devs are going to put in harder and harder to recover from single group content. Honestly, behind our mitigation issues, I would rank needing more rezzers in game right there, although I would not consider it an SK issue specifically.</div></div><hr />

Actually, SK with rezz will do better than paladin with rezz in those trials. Know why? If your group only have ONE cleric,  once cleric got smashed, group is guaranteed to be wiped out or evac'ed. If cleric is already dead way deep and your group is already evac'ed, You need to quit trial to boot cleric corpse out and have cleric come here to rezz that wastes CR time AND you HAVE to start trial ALL over again which sucks.. If your group didn't get evac'ed then paladin is more than likely already dead and can't rezz cleric at that spot then you have to re-start trial and rezz all corpses instead of 1 corpse. <br />
<br />
Now, replace SK with rezz in place of paladin.  If group wiped out very deep for example against boss, and cleric got smashed,  SK simply FDed and ENJOY watching entire group being slaughtered completely. Wait 2 minutes for full FD mem wipe then get up and you simply laugh and rezz cleric corpse. Cleric comes and cleric can rezz rest of the group and we start again RIGHT deep in that trial and re-try. Wastes maybe 5 min of time, NO CR, etc. Nothing. Who is better? SK &gt; Pal as emergency rezzer in xp trial groups. :) FD+necro rezz+summon corpse package is very powerful combo and basically a complete package for any emergency needs. <br />
<br />
We had very hard time to have necros in groups cuz they seem to LOVE getting busy soloing all the time. Franky over years, I hardly had necros in my groups even pick-up xp groups. Only thing I can often see them in groups is in RAID forces. Necros seems to enjoy soloing over xp groups. That's why I *REALLY* want necro rezz so xp groups can enjoy it very much cuz SK is more group friendly and need groups over necros in general.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Tukka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">Sorry, going to have to jump on the bandwagon here.  Getting Sacrifice/Convergance is a more relavent, important and desired change for the majority of knights than is fixing SCS.<br />
<br />
The precadent for a non-selfish, even self-sacrificing SK spell is there: Dark Empathy.<br />
<br />
Summon Corpse and Conjure Corpse are beneficial/utility spells along the same lines of a sacrificial rezz.<br />
<br />
Our spell line is obviously not totally divorced from the necromancer line... we see this even with upcoming expansion.  If they're going to give us a shitty Heart Flutter upgrade, they might as well give us one a necromancer spell that will actually be useful for us.<br />
<br />
It's not as if all the knights here asking for this spell are totally ignorant of what it means to be a shadow knight, and what is &quot;in character&quot; for a shadow knight.  It's largely a matter of opinion, and not everybody's opinion of what an SK is or should be is going to be the same.  Though perhaps in making suggestions for our class, we should go with the majority view of what is &quot;in character&quot; for a SK.<br />
<br />
Also: I'm pretty sure I can recall at least one SK from EQ lore (some heretic erudite) who sacrificed himself for Paineel in some manner in the Hole.  While we may be shadow knights, we are still knights, and I think that confers a degree of nobility.  I think it means we're at least as likely as necromancers (probably more likely) to do the honorable thing and sacrifice ourselves for our party (what the hell is tanking anyway?  shedding blood so your comrades don't have to), and though we may be more willing to endure pain, suffering and loss than necromancers, I don't think you could say we are any less willing to inflict same upon others (so it's not out of line for us to be willing to sacrifice others for our cause either).<br />
<br />
So for me the only question seems to be, is this something SKs are smart/powerful enough to do?  Well, I think so.  It's getting into more arcane terrain that might not be the SK specialty, but a truly powerful, knowledgable and dedicated knight might be able to pull it off.  Getting these spells 17 or so levels after necromancers while at the level cap doesn't seem too unreasonable to me. Edit: our pet summoning spells are somewhat akin to rezzing, if you think about the kind of magic it is... we take the remains of some person/creature, and reanimate them into a pet to do our bidding... eventually it doesn't seem too farfetched to me that we could take the next step from reanimating to reviving.<br />
<br />
So I say toss it out there and let the devs decide.<br />
<br />
SCS is an archetype ability that must at least somewhat affect other classes.  It affects only a tiny, tiny, tiny minority of SKs, and even those affected, I'm sure, have found ways to cope, even if it does suck.  Also, and I'm sorry if this sounds insensitive, but knights who purchased this skill should have known what they were getting into and should've known that it might come back to bite them in the future.  I agree that the state of this AA is ridiculous, but it can't really even be called a SK concern--it's a concern of a handful of SKs.  I am in agreement that if this is listed as one of our 10 chief concerns, it should be listed as part of a general outline regarding regarding problems with our aggro generation capabilities, not as a special point in and of itself.  Better to fix aggro for all SKs than pay so much atention to a single facet of the aggro problems a minority of SKs are experiencing.<br />
<br />
Here's something else I want: a pet haste spell that I don't have to keep constantly memorized for it to be practical.  We're not a pet class, our pets don't do a lot of damage, and we can't increase their damage as much as a true pet class with our pet buff, and of all the classes with pets, we have to go to the most trouble to maintain our pets (buffing it, keeping it alive, ect.)  We do the most work to yield the smallest benefit from our pets.  I don't think it would be uncalled for if knights got their own special pet haste spell, perhaps one that didn't include AC or STR buffs, but had a short recast time and a long duration.  I don't like asking enchanters and shamans to haste my pet, as it seems almost silly, but really it makes a lot more sense for me to do that than to buff it myself. :\</div></div><hr />

Just because few people have it, isnt a good reason to overlook something so detrimental to the class.  There was a time when it seemed benificial to have this.</div></div><hr />

It's also not a good idea to overlook ideas and concerns that a majority of knights have (or at least, a significantly larger portion of knights, if necro rezz or other things mentioned does not have majority support) in favor of something that almost nobody cares that much about.  I'd say 10% is an extremely generous estimation of the total percentage of knights (even level 55+ knights) who have this AA.  I would be surprised if it was as much as 0.5%.  And I'd bet enough among the extreme minority of knights who have SCS, a few of them would rather see something else on the list (could be wrong there, but I really wouldn't be surprised) or would rather see our overall aggro reevaluated and addressed (i.e., as a package, raise our taunt cap, fix/improve the Terror line, remove or toggle SCS, give us a hate adding AA,  ect.)<br />
<br />
Edit note: If they brought our aggro power back up to the level (relative to other classes) it was at in the Luclin era, SCS would be useful once again, even if they didn't fix it, no?  Granted, this would be a sloppy approach, but it should at least placate the tiny minority of knights with SCS, and would make most every other knight in the game quite happy.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">While necro rez would certainly be a very nice ability to have, it's questionable in terms of balance.  The justification for giving us necro rez would be to parallel paladins' rez spell, which is potentially an important asset to a group.  The problem is that giving us a rez spell would then swing the pendulum too far the other direction - we would be superior to paladins, as we have the tools to survive a wipe and they do not.  For it to be balanced, they'd then need something like Escape or the like, and then you start a chain-reaction balance nightmare.  <br />
<br />
It's really a sticky situation, and something should be done, as paladins' rez ability gives them an advantage over us (aside from that granted by stuns and such).  The problem is that balancing it is far from cut and dry.  Giving us necro rez would be equivilant to the warrior upgrades from the melee balancing - taking something from too weak to too powerful.  I havn't really decided what my opinion on the necro rez situation is yet, but it's definately not as cut-and-dry as alot of you are trying to make it out to be.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As for SCS (NOTE: I do not have SCS), putting it on a toggle wouldn't just benefit the few who have bought it, it would benefit everyone, and not just SK's.  For SK's, it would go from detrimental to useful, and for other classes it would go from useful to more useful.  <br />
<br />
Also keep in mind that the top 10 list is an evolving list - it's not just 10 items and then it's over, it's 10 items, replace them as they're fixed.  Putting SCS on a toggle probably wouldn't be very hard, and a bandaid fix for SK's with the ability could probably be done in an hour - putting it on the list, having it fixed, and moving on wouldn't be a bad thing.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Regarding Weapon Affinity:  Aside from the fact that you can be fairly confidant it won't be changed, it probably shouldn't anyway.  It's not broken.  It's just not as useful as it potentially could be.  Purchasing WA is still beneficial to you if you have an even halfway decent weapon proc - the reduction in self-imbue procs isn't especially large, especially with faster weapons.  Changing the order of proc checks also stands to be a nerf to some SK's, as some have better procs than our self-imbues.</div></div><hr />

 .<br />
<br />
This is why my idea for a very limited rez would be best.  Making it an aa means that we would not have to be in high level zones to aquire it.<br />
<br />
Making it used once every 24 RL hours would keep it from being used for exp rez and make sure it is pretty much limited to emergency uses such as rezing a cleric on a raid wipe or single group trial where there is no alternative but to start over.  An aa ability devine rez already exists using the 24 RL principal and it is mostly used in emergency situations on a raid where a cleric needs to have mana instantly upon rez and not for the xp benefits.<br />
<br />
Making the rez have 93 percent xp gain was so that clerics would not have to suffer losing xp since they would be the ones who would suffer if it did not regain xp.  However I could live with a call to corpse also where the cleric could still rez themselves.<br />
<br />
Making it componetless the idea there was to ensure that you could use it even if you don't have the component since it will be an emergency.<br />
<br />
This would balance us getting a rez imho and its limited use would not make it so that we unablance paladins rez which has no time limit restrictions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">It's less fucked up than straight necro rez, but it's still not balanced.  <br />

It keeps it from being used in XP group situations, but that's really irrelivant - currently paladins have an advantage over us because they have rez and we do not; with your ability, that would be reversed based around FD for trial situations and the like.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u79"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p79">Call to corpse is identical to a rez in terms of balance vs. paladin rez - the fact that it's in some ways better makes it all the more unrealistic to ask for ATM.  <br />
<br />
We need an answer to the added desirability paladins gain from rez, but rez or a rez substitute isn't it, at least in the form they're being asked for.  We need a more well-planned and inventive/creative/whatever solution to the problem.  <br />
<br />
Perhaps, for example, we could get a 4hr reuse rez/call to corpse (really doesn't matter - balance wise they're pretty much equivilant), and paladins could get rez on a button that's usable while DA is up.  That doesn't meet the well thought out criteria - I just thought of it while writing that last paragraph and figured it'd make a good example, but you get the idea.  <br />
<br />
We need parity with paladins' rez, not superiority, and just giving us rez or a rez-substitute gives us superiority by nature of having FD.  We don't have to gain our parity from something equivilant to rez either - something similarly useful but different could prove the best answer also, though I don't know what that would be at this point.</div></div><hr />

What if we got a HT rez?  Uses the harmtouch timer so we can use it only as often as (and instead of) HT.  Call it something like &quot;Touch of Undeath&quot; and have it raise the person from the dead with 1hp and 1mana and 90% exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u81"><b>Kyfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p81">I see no parity problem with giving us the straight necro rez. Pallies have a number of abilities which they receive from clerics which are far more useful than what we receive from necros. There's no big problem if we get something that works out slightly better.<br />
<br />
We get crappy necro dots that make us lose dps by casting them and a green pet. They get fairly solid buffs which do in a pinch with a druid healer &amp; stuns. If we do slightly better on one exchange, they'll live. Also, remember, we'd have to go buy EE's for each rez.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That sounds like a good idea on the surface, but do we really want an ability so potentially important that it prevents us from using IHT?  Depending on the fight, IHT can be very important to our success, though by no means a guarantee of victory.  It's not a bad thought, but I don't think this is the way we want to go.</div></div><hr />

You're right, I hadn't thought of that.  I can see guilds banning IHT during raids because they want sks to be able to rez if needed  :( <br />
<br />
Here's another idea, what if it were a spell that consumed our entire mana bar to cast and had a reuse timer of 90 minutes?<br />

<br />
AA ability - A buff, sorta like DI, that FD's the player when they get aggro.  Player gets aggro, buff drops, player FD's - would probably have to survive the first round of melee or first spell.  Moderate recast - a few minutes, but not ungodly long, nor short enough that you just chain cast it on everybody not tanking.  Probably consumes a regeant.  <br />
<br />
Whatever - I didn't give it much thought, it's just something that popped into my head while brushing my teeth.  It may prove to suck with more thought - I'll think about it more while I'm out, but I'm leaving now, so bleh.

You would also have to find a way to limit the number of people it could be cast on.  If the entire raid was buffed with this, a normal &quot;wipe&quot; would result in the entire raid just feigning.  That's pretty overpowering.  I'm not necessarily saying it couldn't work, just that it would need tweaking.<br />
<br />
Here's another idea.  How about a rez that brings the person back at 100% exp and full mana/hp but the rez effects were an uncurable dot of like 1k/tic?  The idea is that we could raise the person temporarily so that a cleric might have enough time to cast rez once before he dies again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That definitly wouldnt work. Person would be dead before they even finished looting their entire corpse.Plus if the cleric has enough time to rez the person the 2nd time you wouldnt have needed to rez him the 1st time. Just making it have the same duration and reuse time as DI would make it so the entire raid doesnt get it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't see how people are saying rez for Sk's is out of line and overpowering.<br />
People against it seem to think that we will take over the role of clerics and Necro's.  Last time i checked an EE cost anywhere from FREE to 300pp Depending on who the Necro has lined up to Sacrifice (non XP rezable Death to imbue the Emerald with life essence).<br />
<br />
For examples Pre Riwwi patch.  Agro kite team would play in Riwwi for drops.  For what ever reason (resists on snare, add from other guild/players Crosspulling) we wiped.  Approx Deaths that day about 1-3 per member. about 7 EE's used since no cleric was in zone and we wanted to keep farming.  The point is, thats was about 2kish in EE's.  I know to some people that's just pocket change but not for me or for most people that i know.<br />
<br />
Sure pallys can't FD but their rez cost them Zero PP/reagents.  Unless you Have a toon that is lvl 46+ that is willing to be sacrificed for free and a Necro that wont charge you for sitting there sacing over and over.  Its gona cost you a pretty penny to play rezer in group.  And if we got necro rez demand for EE's would go up (somewhat) so prices for EE's would go up.<br />
<br />
Necro rez for Sk's will only be situational (due to expense).  And if spell follows the same line as other Necro to Sk spells it will use Alot more mana and will rez for less (90pct?).  It wouldn't make us sought after due to rez but it would give us more appeal in XP,LDON,RAIDS to rez if NECRO or Pally are not present to rez cleric.</div></div><hr />

Don't get me wrong though having rez would be extremely useful, hell any class getting rez would be useful but it doesn't seem like a very realistic change when SoE is actually trying to *balance* classes.

I am of the opinion however, that a new line that does not rez, only brings you to your corpse, once per day or whatever, is more in line for GAME BALANCE issues.</div></div><hr />

What if it caused whoever you cast it on to fein when you do, but only once then the buff drops, and you can add a regent for it, single target.  The only thing better than having a hybrid being able to rez is having a hybrid that prevents death althogether AND saves raid/group recovery time.  Probably incredibly hard to code but you get the idea.</div></div><hr />

Raid wipes, instead of the cleric trying to camp and going smish because he/she/shim had to wait 30 seconds to camp, they are now feined along with you, mobs reset, aggro clears, you both pop up and they start rezzing.  Not being able to fein whenever you want would be a drawback on an incredibly useful ability, therefore giving it balance.</div></div><hr />

Rez boils down to being one big piece of desirable &quot;utility&quot; for the group, and any number of other things could likely accomplish the same thing - added desirability resulting from utility, something we have very little of in the modern game.  <br />
<br />
If you did want to make my idea work, making the person buffed feign along with the SK would be the exact wrong way to go about it though.  You feigning to save someone else would be highly impractical... your cleric gets aggro so the tank, rather than trying to pull the mob off, FD's?  Yeah, that's a good plan.  Basically, make it like DI, but fire at 99% and feign instead of heal.  The specifics of it would need a lot of work, but if you wanted to try to make it work, it may well be possible.  <br />
<br />
As for whoever said &quot;if we get rez, pallys will want FD&quot; - if we get rez, pally's will need something to help them survive a wipe for balance sake, but they'd be more likely to get something like escape than FD.</div></div><hr />

Pallies currently have significantly more raid utility than we do (Buff, Emergency heals, group heals, cure curses, better offtanking with stuns), and they therefore would not be able to ask for anything. We are playing catchup, not moving ahead.</div></div><hr />

It would be less &quot;buff bitch&quot; than voice and it certainly wouldn't impact our tanking role - rangers and beastlords contribute a number of useful buffs, and have to focus *a lot* more heavily on buffing than this ability would force us to focus, yet they still perform their raid role.<br />

<br />
Most of what you described isn't utility.  Healing/curing is a role in and of itself, and it's pallys' secondary role, as pulling is ours.  Offtanking/stuns is part of their tanking role.  Buffing is debatably part of the healing/curing role, or utility - probably a little of both... for the most part though, what you listed isn't utility anymore than spears or blood of hate is utility.  <br />
<br />
You're mistaking usefulness/desirability as utility - utility can contribute to the former, but they aren't one and the same.  Pallys are currently ahead of us in more ways than one, and utility (because of rez) is one of them, but that doesn't mean it's the only one.  We need something to compete with stuns for tanking; we arguably need pulling improvements, which would indirectly be a counter to their healing ability; and we need a utility option to compete with rez, which may not ultimately have anything at all to do with rezzing.</div></div><hr />
