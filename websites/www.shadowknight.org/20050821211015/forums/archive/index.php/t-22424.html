<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Silku</div><div class="date">08-17-2004, 10:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm sitting about 9k buffed anymore, with about 1600 ac.   I do fine on normal Vxed mobs, cept for the occasional brain fart from my cleric friend.  My wife is a shaman, well equipped (pre - elemental).  Our typical group consists of this - <br />
<br />
Sk-Tank/Puller<br />
Shaman-Slower/Backup Healer<br />
Cleric-Main Healer<br />
DPS-typically a rogue<br />
DPS-typically a mage<br />
DPS-typically a necro<br />
<br />
With that particular group I have beaten Vxed several times, and have come very close to beating Tipt.  I've been talking to other tanks in the guild and typically their groups consist of.<br />
<br />
Warrior/Sk/Paladin<br />
Enchanter -slower/puller/charmer(tipt/vxed)<br />
Cleric<br />
Cleric<br />
DPS<br />
DPS<br />
<br />
Is this a must?   Do you have to have a cleric holy light rot to manage these mobs?   If so that's cutting your dps greatly, especially since the charming in this zones isn't gonna happen.  Or is it possible to do this with one cleric, with backup heals in a high dps group?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">window</div><div class="date">08-17-2004, 10:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">if you've done it successfully a bunch of times with one cleric... why would you think 2 clerics is &quot;a must&quot;?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Silku</div><div class="date">08-18-2004, 06:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've done vxed successfully with one cleric, never attempted KT though I&quot;m flagged.  Just looking at the future.   KT is a new level of adventure.  From my understanding the mobs hit like the named in Vxed.   The named in Vxed are kinda rough at this point.  We usually us harm touch to burn them down, and chain the fast heals from both the shaman and cleric just to barely keep me up.</div></div><hr />

This doesn't add up really...</div></div><hr />

1) Yes, you can charm in both Tipt and Vxed.<br />
2) If you can tank Vxed, you sure as fuck can tank KT. Look at my magelo; am I anywhere near the level of gear you are? I can tank KT for hours with no deaths, and 1 Cleric (nothing but CHs too, usually).<br />
3) KT named might give you some trouble, as I understand they hit like trucks. I've only killed 4 as of now; two were tanked by a warrior, one a pally (guildies who were xp'ing in the zone, and came over to help) and one we killed with a combination of HT + Lifeburn + Chain wizzy/chanter nukes and good ol' ping pong agro and the cleric HL'ing whoever got hit.<br />
4) Since you CAN charm, a tank, enchanter, snarer and 3 clerics will probably be more DPS than the group you have with you (sad, I know, but with pets that hit for 1k, fast, and you can haste..... ya know).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Silku</div><div class="date">08-18-2004, 04:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Interesting, I've been told that Koda Taz was a bit higher than Vxed in dps.  Not just a small bit, but a huge amount higher.  Soon as I get my cleric friend flagged we'll be trying it.<br />
<br />
I was also told that there were no charmable mobs in there considering most mobs were in the yellow white range.  Like I said I've not been there to fight yet, but am looking for intel before I go.  I also know that you can charm in Tipt/Vxed already.  The zones I am inquiring about are KT, Qvic, etc.  Not Tipt/Vxed since I regularly exp grind here.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Naelyan</div><div class="date">08-19-2004, 02:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah, ok, yeah...... I think there are random dark blue mobs in KT, though I can't say I've ever seen anyone charming there. I've never tanked Vxed, so I have no idea what kind of damage output mobs have there to compare; I might have to go back with a reflagging group to check, heh. KT is bitch easy to kill in (save named mobs, I've been hella lucky with the named I've killed), and Qvic you won't be seeing any time soon if you're still inquiring about KT. From how mobs hit in Ikkinz and Uqua though, I expect Qvic will hit hard as hell too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Silku</div><div class="date">08-19-2004, 10:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll update my AAs when magelo gets off their ass and fixes the patcher.  I didn't pay to have to do it manually.  I have 200 all defensives/hp etc.  They need to get a move on that crap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eclipsia</div><div class="date">08-22-2004, 05:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">AC really is &gt; all in Vxed. I have needed only one cleric in the group to keep me out of the purple club. Those that I've grouped with have commented that I tank better (in terms of aggro management and healing required) than Warriors with similar AA but 200 or so less AC. As Brael has said festering darkness is your friend. Aura of pain too is invaluable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bolas</div><div class="date">08-22-2004, 09:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kod'taz NAMED are tougher than Vxed NAMED.  Kod'taz yard trash is EASIER than Vxed yard trash.  At least that's what I've seen.  Generally Kod'taz is better exp/reward than Vxed.<br />
<br />
I have trouble with Vxed named, but then I have trouble with Kod'Taz named too sometimes.  9650 hp 2250 ac fully buffed here (with tribute going).<br />

<br />
Ok I am weak in AC, weak in overall stuff as well, but I was dreaming I could be usefull in this zone. Considering my guildies are actually sub-par to me in equipment, this zone is a huge challenge for us. I have to snare kite mobs until they are slow before engaging or even let the Ench's pet do the job. Kinda frustrating =/</div></div><hr />

Welcome to GoD for the non-time, tanking SK.   <br />
<br />
Keeps it interesting though  :D <br />

You can tank pretty much anything that doesn't require a raid if you have an attentive healer.</div></div><hr />
