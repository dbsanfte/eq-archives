<br />
I keep hearing resistances resistances resistances.... For a 50 SK what should my resists be (first-char, non-twinkage) to handle druids that are within PK range on VZ?  Seems like everytime I meet a druid in PvP, I am dead before I can really get anything going....<br />
<br />
Any general strategies that might help?<br />

At 51 I beat a 55 druid (Was pretty damn funny when I landed Darkness on him but kept resisting his snares), but granted it was in a duel, not a random encounter on a PVP server.<br />
<br />
I would say that unbuffed fire and magic resists of 35+ will help and can be easily worked into your standard equiment package without sacrificing AC. Then carry around a few high resist items and be ready to put them on if you come under attack by a druid.<br />
<br />
Some resist gear basics that are fairly common: runed bone fork in range slot (10 f/c/m), DF helm (5 to all), Sarnak battle shield or runebranded buckler.<br />

Best of luck on whupping treehugger butt.</div></div><hr />

I had trouble with a friend who is a lvl 51 pally, I got him killed, but only 90hps left on me...I know I killed him twice with his crappy LoH, but still, I shouldn't have had such a bad time...what is really necesary for dueling (or PKing for those reds server players)</div></div><hr />

Do they act the same on a PvP server? Meaning Drood_01 tries to snare you, pet agroes and starts to beat on it, hopefully interupting its next series of casts while you are able to locate it and DOT/Tap it to death?<br />
<br />
Just a thought.  FD help you at all?  They may get bored waiting for you to stand up. Hehe.<br />

Even weak MR/FR (70-90ish) will give you adequate root and nuke protection, leaving the unresitable DoT line as your only problem.<br />
<br />
-Go in unbuffed for easy dispelling of any DoTs or roots that land. You want to dispell big DoTs asap but don't stand there and eat nuke while doing so. If you give chase for a bit then stop and dispell you'll probably get it off before he realizes that you're not chasing/casting offense. 1 or 2 ticks of a 50's DoT's will add up to less than than a solid nuke.<br />
-Dispel his buffs ASAP.<br />
-Try to work in close and melee but don't blindly chase.<br />
-Play with spell ranging. Stay just out of casting range and spam on clinging/englufing until he gets in range.<br />
-Flutter him if you can since he probably won't be prepared to cure or resist it.<br />
-If you get inside and tries to cast at point blank slash, bash then go for word if you think his MR is low enough. Not many people know that word has a 1ft knockback.<br />
-Go for big base damage. You won't be in range to lang often so you want it matter when you are.<br />
-Bash is your interrupt use it wisely, don't count on a fast 1h to do the job.<br />
-If you're really confident you might try stand and see if he's willing to exchange nukes for taps/dispells...dispell, leech, tap, rush, ht.  In my experience most don't realize or want to accept how much their nukes are being resisted down by until it's too late.<br />
<br />
Don't expect too many wins though. EQ doesn't force you too commit to combat...So you can expect a losing caster to gate the instant he has 5 seconds of freedom or just flat out run and let latency do the work.</div></div><hr />

I think the key is dispelling...a druids thorns are what will kill you.<br />
A good idea if you know you're going to be dueling some druids in advance is to go to stonebrunt and farm some of the stun idols that drop off kobalds there...<br />
Also remember that most druids are going to have a fire debuff thats -75 FR in PvP, then some other DoTs and DDs that can further lower your FR...I wouldnt focus on FR too much, you'd be setting yourself up for dissapointment.  Go MR all the way.<br />
Also remember that your snare dispells sow.</div></div><hr />

where can you get pumice stones?  and do they only work against PCs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nasiir</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 01:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Druids get extremely easy to live against when you get dispel magic. Dispel &gt; druid. When I see a druid casting, I click off my first buff (usually jboots) and start in casting dispel on myself. They can't land a damn thing for long because you can easily dispel it. Their fire based dd's do a fair amount, but since you can dispel their fr debuff, you really shouldn't get nuked to death. They are tedious to kill since they all run so damn fast,, have regen, damage shields, and healing, but I never really die to druids (less 60th ones) anymore as soon as I figured out the equasion above.</div></div><hr />

It is instant right click pumice and has 5 charges. It will wipe away their buffs soo quick they wont know what hit them. Then if they are a dumb ass (most are) they prob have SoW high on their stacked buffs. Therefore with no Sow and of course your Jboots you can joust or hell....Just plain hack on them and keep interupting thier spells as you watch them try to get a gate off. I have 6 pumices soo I never run out. I find druids the easiest to take and their dots no where near as scary as a necro's. If all else fails....Shadowstep and click your circlet since they probobly lost that buff as well..<br />
Then again im comming from a PvP server and get caught off guard quite regurlarly soo I am always prepared as best I can.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Soulle</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 06:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, heres the deal... from a Sullon Zekkers point of view.<br />
<br />
1.  Get ALL the FR and MR gear you can get your hands on.  You can kind of stop at 100ish MR, but if theres a chanter with that druid, tash is gonna lower it enough that youll get snared... I'll be happy when my mr is 160ish.  You're FR can NEVER be high enough, I have 121 FR atm... wont be happy till its 180ish.  The only other gear you need besides FR, and MR gear is hps stuff.  AC is useless in a fight against a druid, just carry bags of resist gear around to swap out when you think one has entered the zone.<br />
<br />
2.  Spell lineup:  Shadowstep, every time you get Winged Death on you, or that cruddy FR reducing dot, Shadowstep... hopefully out of casting range, and dispell yourself either with cancel magic or pumices untill its off.  Click off ALL of your other buffs first, trust me.  No matter how many slots I usually have free, dispell seems to always go after anything else besides the dot I want it to get, no matter how far back in the lineup my buffs are... heh.  <br />
<br />
Feign Death- I never unmem it, but pretty useless in pvp.  The druid can still nuke you, and any mobs standing over you that hes charmed will start hitting you again.<br />
<br />
Cancel Magic- I'm cheap, dont like using pumices... lol.<br />
<br />
Clinging Darkness- Ya just never know.  Its fast casting time, and if it sticks, it usually lasts long enuff for you to do major dmg. It will never stick on anybody with good resists, but once again, I've had it end fights in seconds when somebody didn't have their resist gear on for some reason.<br />
<br />
Abduction of Strength- 5 mana, 25 pts of str.  Sometimes that druid is carrying all kinds of cash and/or lewtz.  25 pts makes them encumbered slowing them down.  Works a LOT better on pallys, but ive noticed slower movement on casters also, just depends what they happen to be carrying.<br />
<br />
Invoke Fear- Charmed pets are annoying... fearing them away is a priority.  Once again, shadowstep away and fear it, then go after the druid again.  <br />
<br />
Biggest lifetap you have- you'll almost never use this, but cant hurt... its saved my ass once or twice.  Especially lifeleech.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DaClifster</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 06:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First off, those links to dueling.. disregard them if your 51 and over. The presence of AA points in the game now changes many things and our style of fighting. If your going to fight someone you better take a good look at that title next to their name.  The average SK (no title) fighting say a Wizard that has their 3rd title is a big mismatch. So before you fight, study the other classes AA points. If you fight a wizard that is faster, can cast faster, can nuke for crits, and do instant damage you better make sure you got the tools yourself to fight.  You take 2 SKs both lvl 60 and both with the same gear but one SK is a Baron and the other is a Duke. You can believe that the Duke is going to win. The skills the Duke SK has gained to get that title are going to give them the edge everytime.<br />
<br />
Any dueling casters before lvl 51 is all about resists. When you hit 51 the whole thing changes.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Soulle</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 06:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Strategy:  Because of track, they'll always get the drop on you.  Expect the fight to start with Winged Death landing on you.  Shadowstep away immediately and dispell it and then its time to fight.  If you are a big race and can bash with a 2 hander like I can, yer in business, just stay on his tail no matter what.  Golem wands are great, but I dont have any, so I just run after the like a lunatic... lol.  <br />
<br />
Whenever he stops to cast, Nail Him!!  Make a macro with /attack on... /doability (whatever number bash is)  /attack off.  Whenever he stops to cast, run up right next to him and hit it.  <br />
<br />
If you're not a big race and cant bash with your 2hander, then equip the biggest slowest 1 hander you can find and work with it.  Wurmslayer is serviceable.  Its not as much dmg, but the inability to bash him out of casts = you are probably dead meat... lol.<br />
<br />
After each time you stop and attack, cast a quick spell if you think you have time.  Clinging dark is reeeeeally fast casting and if it lands the fight is over.  Most of the time however, they jet off really fast as soon as you hit them, I just stay on their tail.  Its never worth losing them just to get a spell of when the advantage is yours and they're rattled.<br />
<br />
Save Harmtouch if its up, and Lifeleech for the end.  If a Druids life is low, hell try to run around for a second and lose ya, then start casting gate...  Run up, swing, HT, lifeleech.  Usually makes them a corpse... fun fun.<br />
<br />
If you're a big race post again and I'll tell ya a mean trick you can do to add a LOT of dmg to yer 2hs swings.<br />
<br />
I've only had a Druid who was within 5 lvls of me beat me twice... and both times were just REALLY bad luck... lol.  I practically impaled myself on my own weapon I missed so much, and resisted nothing.</div></div><hr />

If you can land both in 4 secs he will be so shocked that a second lifetap will do him in if he is still standing.<br />
<br />
My other favorite tatic is use pre nerfed CoS, removes you from target, not sure if hide does this as well. Also a nice placed fear will stop him from casting and if he stays in range long enough you can hit him with a few dots then send in pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darko</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 08:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">At  lvl 50 druids are pretty tough, best you can do gear wise is load up on MR, BD/Diamond jewlery helps quite a bit, DarkForge armor has decetn MR as well.<br />
<br />
Reason you want MR is:<br />
1. If you stay snared for a long period of time you loose.<br />
2. Most druid DOTs are magic based.<br />
<br />
Druids will always try to kite you, this means you have to be able to keep up with them.  Always keep ur jboots buff in 1st slot, and utilize cancel magic spell alot.  Keep the druid on the run as much as pssiblle.  Rememeber that if you run as fast as the druid, he cant kite u very well since, if he stops to cast you will catch up to him, use that to your advantage, this is why not being snared is so important.  Only cast spells when the druid start to cast , IE druid is out running you due to sow, he gets ahead and start to cast, 1st thing to do is cancel magic him, if he continues casting after ur spells goes through cancel magic him again, or if u have been snared cancel magic ur self to strip the snare.  A unbuffed druid will fall fast.  So the key is to stay unsnared and keep the druid buffless especially sowless.  Finally as always leave HT for finishing blow..  The rest really depends on ur MR if the druid can snare u every time he attempts you will loose, however the more often u resist the snare the better are ur chances. <br />
Finally i sujjest you do not use darkness, since its mana heavy and  has a long casting cost, in fact a smart druid will run OOR as soon as he sees u starting to cast it.  Also darkness has  2 MR checks that need to pass in order for it to stick which means decent MR will almost always stop it from sticking. Use your mana to tap, yes i know at lvl 50 taps are weak but, taps are unrestable by players which means it will do full damage every time in pvp, making them by far the best DDs, also  the added healing never hurts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Couple problems here,  spells do 60% damag in pvp which means that 1838 damage is actually 1102.8, further more if you uce CoS it will kill ur pet, and a druid will be smart enough to has see invis on which will cancell the effect of removing u from target =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vachir</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 09:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The short answer: you can't.<br />
<br />
Unless you're dealing with someone totally clueless there is no way a SK will kill a druid solo until 55+.<br />
<br />
Worst case scenario a druid gets the drop on you.  Obviously they cast WD and you have to dispell it but unfortunately all those wonderful magic based stat taps can't be clicked off (/rude VI) so 3 charges of pumice later you have WD dispelled and quickly switch to PvP gear and start fighting back.  Unfortunately at this point you have taken 429 damage from WD and 1362 damage from scoriae (x3) so being level 50, you're dead. <br />
<br />
So lets look at best case instead.  You have all your gear up, all your spells optimized and get the drop on a druid.  You snare him with clinging darkness, he dispells your snare and takes off running with SoC, switches gear and puts up a couple buffs.  He comes back into spell range and starts hitting you with drifting death and starfire, hilbugging any time you are able to get in any melee hits and lifetap damage to get to a safe place to heal back up.  Unfortunately he can run faster than you so you can't catch him if he's losing and decides to run, but he can definately catch you if you are losing, which you probably are as he's nuking you for 200-300s and you have to keep stopping to dispell DOTs.  So even if you do run him out of mana, you're not going to be able to run him down and kill him because he can outrun you (pumice won't work because of buffing order and right click buffs and even with golem wands he still has at least run3 or jboots and can always hilbug to recast wolf form or sow or even gate or evac).<br />
<br />
So even in the best case you won't be able to kill them and they still have a good to excelent chance of killing you at anywhere between the ideal and the worst case fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Soulle</div><div class="date">04-04-2002, 07:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Poor Malig member... whered you get ideas like that... lol.  If Ran heard ya talkin now, I think he'd be dissapointed.  Sk's are grossly overpowered in pvp, I know, I am one.  The ONLY time you ever have trouble with a druid is at lvl 20ish and below when your resist gear sux and snare lands every time.<br />
<br />
I've got 35 insignias of Tunare and Karana in my bank.  Almost every single one of them are from druids.  My first was at lvl 22ish, my last was 2 nights ago at 53.  Once you get your resists up high, and if you fight smart, a druid might just gate, but they will almost never beat you.  <br />
<br />
Here's a SUREFIRE way to win if you just absolutely are feeling like you cant win a fight against a druid.  Move to a zoneline after you're attacked.  Zone over, equip your biggest 2 hander and wait.  When he comes thru, Nail him and immediately zone as he starts to cast.  Rinse, Repeat.  I've driven off druids when I started the fight at 1 bubble by using this tactic.  <br />
<br />
Trick to killing druids is have ruthless resists, a good amount of hps, and DONT stop to cast spells.  I've never used more than 1/3 of my mana in a fight against a druid and I dont buy pumices.  Just have run3, or jboots, follow him as he runs about like a goose.  When he stops to cast, nail him... then keep following and do again.  When he gets to below half life, and you see the bubbles when he stops to cast, HT him.... yay, dead druid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KrukhanGarabash</div><div class="date">04-04-2002, 11:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;Cancel Magic- I'm cheap, dont like using pumices... lol. &quot;<br />
<br />
Nullify cast by way of Crystallized Pumice cancels 2x the buffs and casts in 3.0 vs 4.5 seconds. Better deal by far.<br />
<br />
&quot;Druids get extremely easy to live against when you get dispel magic. Dispel &gt; druid. When I see a druid casting, I click off my first buff (usually jboots) and start in casting dispel on myself. They can't land a damn thing for long because you can easily dispel it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Is this something new? Last I checked on RZ (Not recent.), a dispell cast on yourself would dispell from the bottom of the stack based on the order effects were cast not the slot order while AE mob dispells etc worked the opposite dispelling by slot rather than cast order.<br />
<br />
Please clarify.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just thought I'd say that iksars arent the only one who can use stone of morid now.They changed that a bit ago, useable by large races, and Iksar.&quot;<br />
<br />
I've been out of the loop and had no idea. That's great news.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do yourself a favor and invest some cash in &quot;Egg-shaped pumices&quot; they are recharchable for an okay fee.&quot;<br />
<br />
I have a lot of classic &quot;Egg-Shaped&quot; pumice from the old days. Is there an in-game facility (ie. &quot;Hello traveler, I will recharge thy pumice for 10pp!&quot;) to recharge now or just the same old bug?</div></div><hr />

2.  I always click off all buffs if I'm going to attempt to dispell something... always.  Its too annoying when I dont and my dispell hits some random buff 5 times in a row.  Hell, I mostly pvp solo anyways, its not like I have any buffs worth a damn anyway... lol.  &quot;OH NO.. GRIM AURA!!  NOOOOOO!!!!&quot;<br />

Is there an in-game facility (ie. &quot;Hello traveler, I will recharge thy pumice for 10pp!&quot;) to recharge now or just the same old bug? <br />
<br />
Actually its just the classic bug that has been around since the nerf. You have to have one fully charged pumice always in the bank (I.E. 5charges=fully charged) then you go to a vendor that pretty much doesnt have a whole lot to sell. One perfect place that is convenient is in Thurgaden because of the bank soo close and then there is a vendor nearby the Library area. He has like 5 items in his window and the rest are empty. Then you sell him the fully charged one and then the empty one and then you buy them both back thus recharging the empty one. And as far as the &quot;okay&quot; fee is concerned... I fibbed ~ its like 249pp each time! Soo the question is....is it worth it to you? For me , it is because i dont mind the investment and convenience of being able to hand someone their arse on a silver platter when they least expect it.<br />

Good luck :)<br />

I see. 250pp is worth it since I'd only be using egg in a situation where 3 seconds is too long to save my ass from being looted or I want to drop someone's buffs fast enough to ensure that they can't bag everything =)</div></div><hr />

Good theory, but using Jboots against wolf form just doesn't work because you will never get close enough to get a hit in.<br />

Both of these spells have fairly quick casting times for the amount of damage they deal and with wolf form a druid can get to a point just far enough to cast a spell before you get to him, but not quite far enough that the spell won't land if you try to run out of range at jboot speed.<br />
<br />
As I said at the beginning of my last post 'unless you're dealing with someone totally clueless' which is the case about half the time since the majority of the random PK druids wandering around are completely confused when you're not dead after 2 casts of WD.  Still as a general rule playing a melee you can't kill what you can't catch so unless a druid really screws up you won't be able to kill him.</div></div><hr />

I fought 3 white druids yesterday.  <br />
<br />
Yaebo- ran up with a charmed snow thingy in EW.  I ran from him for a while to get some room on the pet, turned and feared it.  He WD'd me as I did this.  I stopped and dispelled WD as he nuked me for 200 pts of dmg.  My first clinging dark landed on him, and after that it was just a chopfest...   He gated to beside the CC zone, and I ran in after him and chopped delivered the final hit as he tried to heal himself, no HT necessary.  tks dead drood.<br />
<br />
Athanney- she was in wolf form, but it was a 2 on 2, me and gandof the chanter against her and Athann, another even druid.  Gandof mezzed Athann right off the bat while I chased Atheney.  She landed a WD on me and I chopped with my weighted for 210,160.  I knew she couldnt just run and run because she had to try to save her friend so I didnt stop to dispell, I kept chasing.  She stopped and nuked me 3 times while Gandof ToT'd and debuffed Athan.  Each time she stopped, I nailed her with my SoG for a good hit, and lifetapped, as she backed up to nuke again.  At almost no life she suddenly dissapeared from my targeting... I can only assume a hack or bug allowed her to escape. I was still buffed with see invis, so she wasnt hiding.  /sigh, no dead drood.<br />
<br />
Athann- was sitting back at the original spot still mezzed, and now debuffed and lom from Gandof stealing it.  I returned, bandaged while Gandof was preparing another theft of thought, and noticed that hed /q.  The LD mssg was beside his name.  I tell ya what, that LD drood almost ended me... haahhhahha.  He conned yellow as an npc, and nukes that usually land for 200 or 100 were hitting for 440ish.  Luckily, he started running at low life and I chopped him to peices.  /tks dead drood.<br />
<br />
Use the situation to your advantage.  If hes that much faster than you, back up out of spell range and start chaincasting clinging dark.  As soon as he steps into range, youll start casting, hell see this and start casting himself.  Clinging dark goes off, gets resisted 9 times out of 10, and you step back out of range before his spell goes off.  It almost never actually kills them, but it makes them frustrated and sloppy.  If you're low life and they take off to go med... run to a zone.  If they come after you, they're dogmeat.<br />
<br />
And last but not least, get a bard freind to pk with.  OMFG its sooo much fun being faster than them.  Running over them and nailing them as they try to kite you is just too much fun, never seen druids panic so fast in my life.. hhahahahaa.  Not so fun when the tables are turned and suddenly you have track and are faster than them.<br />

I use mainly the same tactics although I usually never have fear memmed PvP (no druid has ever charmed anything on me) and haven't tried to snare an even Druid in ages.  Also, I am not quite as cheap and use pumice!!<br />
<br />
With my Spirit Tap spell at lvl 55 and lifeleech I almost to the  point where I can reverse kite these bastards.  Bobbing Corpse is nice too since most Dr00ds are leved.  You can see my alternate pvp profile in my magelo account, my FR is getting better which is a big plus against a dr00d.<br />
<br />
So, a couple rounds with my AP, a well timed tap or 2 and a /disc unholyaura + HT = dead dr00d.<br />
<br />
I will try the clinging darkness a bit more now, never know when you'll get lucky.  I don't have near the number of sigs Soulle does but I am learning ;)<br />

<br />
Let me clarify, if snare lands on your target, ever, they are a moron, nobody at 50+ should ever be snared unless you have a bard with Jstick/tash orb and OOS.  CT gate potions do still exist and are very useful still for gate capable classes (or anyone else for that matter with shaman gate potions).  Also the original post was about 1 on 1 SK vs druid, but even so, anyone who knows they're fighting an enchanter and allows themself to be mezzed is also a moron, managing to kill that person after they are completely debuffed and stripped of mana does not really count (although that LD thing really does suck, I've had clerics nearly kill me that way as well).<br />
<br />
&quot;If hes that much faster than you, back up out of spell range and start chaincasting clinging dark&quot; - this should not work because it will never land on someone with 200+ mr<br />
<br />
&quot;As soon as he steps into range, youll start casting, hell see this and start casting himself. Clinging dark goes off, gets resisted 9 times out of 10, and you step back out of range before his spell goes off.&quot; - if he's smart he got about a third to half way inside spell casting range so you can't do this in the 4 seconds you have before his spell lands, and yet he can still land his spell and take off running if you decide to chase him<br />
<br />
&quot;And last but not least, get a bard freind to pk with&quot; - while true this is totally outside the conversation, easier still is get to level 59-60 and get your AA horse, it is as fast as most bards with selo, is instant cast and is impossible to dispell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Timing is everything.<br />
<br />
Usually the fight will start with the Druid landing WD on you since he is out of sight and out of casting range(read: can't see their name begin to cast a spell)<br />
<br />
I let WD on, follow them when they lev out from a hill to cast and I try to interrupt/get a few good slashes in.<br />
<br />
wand/wand/lifeleech/disc/ht/loot<br />
<br />
Most of my fights against druids are over before WD is finished doing damage.  It is almost impossible for a well equipped SK to ever lose to a solo druid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Soulle</div><div class="date">04-08-2002, 01:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You make several assumptions Vachir.  I dont do that cut and paste of other peoples words, so I'll just try to address your statements as they come to mind.<br />
<br />
It seems from everything that you are saying, that you assume every druid you fight has insane resist gear and is actively gunning for you.  In that case, such as when I fight Spleefa say, youd have to swap up your tactics some.  Spleefa is red to me, and kills me every time, but I hurt him every time also.  You could say that hes allowing me to hurt him because im so far below his notice, but then again, who allows an SK to hurt them.  You never know when that HT is gonna drop.<br />
<br />
Against a mad uber druid, I usually dont bother casting at all.  If hes smart, he has his buffs stacked, and since I dont have any wands, I'm not gonna get anything good when I dispell.  WD hurts, but uh, I just dispell it.  The fire nukes hurt, scoriae and such hit for about 200, but I have 2200 hps in my pvp gear, I can laugh off several of those.  Also, my FR is climbing as I acquire new items, I see a lot of 50 pt nukes already, soon those will be full resists.<br />
<br />
If I've missed any kind of druid spells that are worthwhile in pvp please inform me, but im pretty sure thats all they have, and neither of those attack venues works particularly well on me.  <br />
<br />
The 2nd part of your assumption ties in with the first... that the druid is gunning for you.  I like to go to East Wastes and run from camp to camp, checking whos there.  When I attack someone at one of these spots where they normally feel secure, they're usually wearing their pve gear.  When somebody is wearing their pve gear, snare lands almost every time.  Once they are snared, I make them die.  <br />
<br />
My personal favorite fight starter is running up behind them and landing a 220,180ish double with my weighted to start the fight.  It only takes a 2 or 3 hits like this to end the fight.  I've got strength of Grodan as my main, and weighted axe I swap to whenever they run for a long time, or between fights.  ANY time a druid nukes me, I have time to nail him.  Often times I will, when reverse kiting, start casting the spell as they run into range.  If they try to get deeper in range before they start casting, I just run at them while I finish casting clinging dark.  <br />
<br />
Druids are desperate to get a spell off, always remember this.  They dont really want to run away for a year and a day, especially against a troll.  I heal pretty fast.  Just stick to them like glue, and when you see that hill bug animation running down the hill in the wrong direction, just keep going the way you were going, angle uphill a little bit.  Theyll usually be up there, and if yer fast, you can nail em as the nuke goes off.<br />
<br />
Once I get 80% of the resist gear on my list, druids will be something that I will laugh at, and possibly ignore.  WD will be the only slightly annoying thing to deal with, but I'll dispell that 1000 times in a row if I have to... doesnt use very much mana at all... heh.<br />
<br />
101 mr<br />
116 fr      &gt; almost every druid I've met so far<br />
<br />
when mr and fr are both 180ish, I wont even fear chanter druid combos.<br />
<br />
And one more thing... HOW is getting to 59 and getting 702784028420 hours of AA xp to get yer horse easier than asking a friend thats a bard to hang with you... rofl.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Absolutely true, this falls under that same line in my first post on this thread &quot;dealing with someone totally clueless&quot;.  If an even con druid (or any other class really) is in the same zone as I am and does not have MR/FR/CR in the 150+ range and if they are not looking to either try and kill me or avoid me they are clueless and easy to kill.  In fact I assume they are not only in full resist gear and trying to kill me, but they also know where in the zone I am, what class I am, what level I am and what gear I have.  If any of these turn out not to be true so much the better, but it is much better to overestimate the power of your opponent than underestimate it.<br />
<br />
I guess I didn't phrase that horse thing just right, it's harder to get the ability to summon a horse than it is to ask a bard to go PK with you, but it's a lot easier to click a button and have instant speed than it is to have to bring a bard with you everywhere you go.</div></div><hr />

PvP in ALL classes is stacking your buffs right, being prepaired ALL the time, and knowing your classes. People who say they got jumped means you didnt check your /who every 5 seconds like you are supposed to. clicking off your buffs means you didnt stack your buffs right in the first place so you could dispell the dots and keep the usefull ones. <br />
<br />
Get decent resist (MR of 100) some good FR/CR and go to town. WD can not be resisted in PvP so dont worry about it, its gonna land. Dispell it and keep on truckin. <br />
