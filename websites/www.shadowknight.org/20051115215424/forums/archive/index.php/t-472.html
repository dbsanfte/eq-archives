Last night, for the hell of it, i MQ'd a thurg plate helm (im iksar/male) after getting the runed helm (forget name offhand) i had it customized by the NPC near dain. <br />
<br />
in old graphics (luclin off) it appears as the smoosed - pink/grey helm (kinda the shape of a scottish terrier<br />
<br />
with Luclin graphics on, it appears as the cresent shape, with gem inbedded in middle.<br />
<br />
now, my concern is this, i headed back to my group....and non of them saw a helm graphic on me =\ i petitioned, and within a minute (stormhammer :)) a GM popped and told me he sees a helm....<br />
<br />
WTH is this, i can't go around thinking people can't see armor i bear, and i don't get it...<br />
<br />
just for fun, the GM wanted to see the &quot;female&quot; version of the helm - - cliked something, and bam i was female =O...grew it back tho /flex<br />
<br />
if anyone has ideas or iksar helm pics, please attach, or give links.</div></div><hr />
