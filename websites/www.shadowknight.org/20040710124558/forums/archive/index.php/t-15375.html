<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dharkenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i just noticed this today but when i had boon on me, my mental proc would never go off but the boon lifetap proc would...as it seems they no longer are letting us use stacking procs, is anyone else having this same problem&gt;?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">whichever buff comes first procs. the other doesnt. its always been this way i think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hollenritter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">This isn't broken or bugged.  Procs spells do not stack.  Now cast a proc spell and break out your weapon that procs, and both can go off.  Been this way a long time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shredderr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">like window said, you gotta have your proc above the boon, your not gonna get the boon proc then however.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Trewfelagh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Actually it hasn't been this way forever.  I remember only being able to have either Boon or Mental Corruption on, but not both at the same time.  I think the compromise with having only the first one do the proccing is rather recent.  That way if you want the dex benefit from boon, but would rather have your own mana proc you just arrange the buffs in your window accordingly.<br />
<br />
However, this is just a limitation of Boon (and perhaps some other proccing spells too of similiar level).  I have had Night's Dark Terror and Mental Corruption at the same time and both will proc accordingly.<br />
