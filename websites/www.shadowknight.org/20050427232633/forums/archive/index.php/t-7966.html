<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rienko999</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">(I play on a pvp server, but your input would be very helpful)<br />
<br />
First chose which class you think is the best and answer the<br />
following questions:<br />
<br />
Rogue/Ranger/Shadowknight/Monk/Bard<br />
<br />
<br />
1.Are there any good sites for this class?<br />
<br />
2.What no drop armor quests/lootable no drop items are<br />
there that this class can use?<br />
<br />
<br />
3.What is the best class for what you chose and why?<br />
<br />
4.What are some good weapons/weapon combos for this class?<br />
<br />
5.If I get PLed, and delvl, what lvl should I go up to, and then delvl down to? And as i'm going up what should I put practices into?<br />
<br />
6.Any strategies for PKing against casters? and what about tanks? What type of gear should I use against casters(I know resist, but should I get all BD gear, or mostly MR, and stats gear?), and what gear should I use Vs tanks?<br />
<br />
7.How could I get my faction up with SS, thurg, and kael with my low character, b/c I certainly know that my rogue cannot kill drags, frost giants, and the sort.<br />
<br />
8.I'm not sure exactly how much money I'll be able to<br />
spend on gear, i'm thinking somewhere between 50 and 10k.<br />
But with the money I can spend, what should I buy? Keep in mind this is on Rallos where I can be looted.<br />
<br />
Any and all input would be very appreciative, thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>synnoira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think you should buy one of each on e-bay and see which you like best.<br />
Really it would be the least bother for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Darkenesis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">1) Hmmm...<br />
<br />
2) everquest.allakhazam.com<br />
<br />
3) Best class for me is SK.  I've devoted too much time to throw it all away and start over.<br />
<br />
4) 2h &gt; 1h... The ability to cast inbetween swings and not have it reset the swing timer is golden<br />
<br />
5) Level &gt; all.  Deleveling is what pricks/bored people do, not actual players.<br />
<br />
6) vs casters:  Don't relent.  If you ghetto swap for a shield to interrupt, you can stun (if you don't go ogre/troll).  Tapping is a good way to do damage/return hp.  Shadowstep is your friend.<br />
<br />
7) Get to 40 before you worry about velious factioning.  Everyone starts off non-kos to Thurg, only rallos ogres/trolls start off non-kos to Kael (I believe) and everyone is a Skyshrine snack in the making.<br />
<br />
8) Invest in a really really good weapon.  Those can't be looted.  It's been a while, but putting a no drop item in every bag, and bagging your droppable armor right before you die used to be a good strategy to prevent them from taking your shit.  Not sure what the standing rule is now tho</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rienko999</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">what's the best race for the SK, and anybody else out there want to add anything, atleast PvP wise?</div></div><hr />

Get help, don't waste your time with EQ, its a game you play for fun.<br />
<br />
- Peace</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Taedirk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Like hell he needs to be a Gnome.  We don't need any more fucktard PLers here, go be a dark elf or something else unoriginal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Darkenesis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">How can anyone be original?  Game's been out for 3 years... only way you're gonna get 'original' is to be a Barbarian SK  :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Nazgaull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Question 1:<br />
SK - ShadowKnight.org (http://forums.shadowknight.org/) <br />
<br />
Brd - EQ Diva (http://www.eqdiva.com/)<br />

Question 2: http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/adv_search.html<br />
<br />
Question 3: No one can say which class is best, that would be starting a firestorm of debating, because no one will agree on which is best.<br />
<br />
Question 4:  See answer for question 2.<br />
<br />
Question 5: I have still not yet figured out why anyone would want to do this anyway.  I would rather keep the levels I worked hard to make.  <br />
<br />
What should you do with your skill points? http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/classes.html<br />
<br />
Question 6: Screw PKing.  Go blue server, that's where the majority of the real players are anyway.<br />
<br />
Question 7: Not possible.<br />
Level up to 45 - 50, then go here: http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/flist.html<br />
Complete faction list for every zone in the game, including how to improve, or not improve them.<br />

He is doing it so he can be an &quot;uber PK'er&quot; (IE: Pussy)<br />
<br />
meaning he wants to level to say 50, get all those lvl 50 skills, nodrop gear ect... then de-lvl to say 30, and pvp; and pretend that he is good at PVP.<br />
<br />
<br />
To bad VI nerfed that :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Shainaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">For you blues that do not know any better... if you &quot;level to 50 then delevel to 30&quot; you do not retain your 50 skills.... you are reduced to your 30 skills.  Verant patched that long ago.<br />
<br />
Buying all the best gear does not = skill... it means thereis a newb running around in really good gear that he didnt deserve.  Regardless of how you obtained it.<br />
<br />
There is no better or worse race to pick for a class that is viable.  Heh  that's a question though i always wonder.. people laugh about the concept of an Ogre wizard but hell they made Gnome warriors....  /shrug  go figure.<br />
<br />
On vallon, tallon and sullon it is not item loot.  Only cash.  &quot;Bagging&quot; is not a concern on them.  They switched vallon and tallon to cash only long ago as well... pre-kunark actually.<br />
<br />
Ebayed people are even more disgustingly obvious on pvp servers then they are on blue servers....   Don't ebay a pvp character.</div></div><hr />
