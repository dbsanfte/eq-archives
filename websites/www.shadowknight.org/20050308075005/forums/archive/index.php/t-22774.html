<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Baaguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Could they have possibly picked a more out of the way, god forsaken pit from hell than City of Mist for us?<br />
<br />
Which mob, then, for someone who gave up in Hate on the first epic?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>The Zenogias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Lhranc aint sayin shit to me, and i've finished the first one for quite some time</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ghismonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I found a human Lhranc looking guy laying on the ground near the Lhranc house/goo house (in COM, obviously).  I'm told he's a level 60 shadowknight mob.  When I hailed him, he groaned in pain.  That's all I have there.<br />
<br />
The luggald on the docks in Dulak's Harbor asks for 3 items to start summoning the sword of Innoruuk.  I am guessing that this is for people who did not complete 1.0, though, so I haven't looked more into finding the mobs with the drops he has requested.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>nezzka is sexy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">maybe you have to have the sword of innoruuk before the lhrac looking guy will respond to you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Stryph</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Luggald wants the following<br />
<br />
Ancient Flamberge of Hatred-Captain Varns in Dulak<br />
Essence of Hatred-Plane of Hate<br />
Stormborn Phylactery-Plane of Storms<br />
<br />
His name is Ritald, just right of the zone in of Dulak's, in the corner near the first dock.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">maybe you have to have the sword of innoruuk before the lhrac looking guy will respond to you<br />
<br />
Judging by Ghismonda's sig, I'd say it's a safe bet she's got that covered...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Inevub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">So if you haven't completed your first epic yet, is it still possible to do so and shorten up the 1.5/2.0 process?  Just wonderin since I have all the raid drops sittin in my bank just need to do the hole stuff and go finish it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Crynus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">As far as the dude in CoM goes, his name is Kilidna, and i spent about 20 mins saying everything i could think of concerning innoruuk, key words from the epic quest, any lore i could think of, how much pallies suck, and never got any kinda response. My best guess is that possibly part of one of the quests, and somehow you need to heal him or something.  Can get full quests from the luggold and from Kastane in PoK without him though, so doesn't seem terribly important to starting the quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>bastardlunatic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">did you have epic 1 on you?  i notice the epic title resets when you die because its on your corpse.  this could be a similar issue.  or i could be wrong</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Nanelane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Ancient Flamberge of Hatred-Captain Varns in Dulak<br />
Essence of Hatred-Plane of Hate<br />
Stormborn Phylactery-Plane of Storms<br />
<br />
Anyone know what drops the essence and phylactery?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Taladaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">You must have completed epic 1.5 before you will get anything out of Kilidna.  Be warned!  If you have done the 1.5 epic and hail him, he will respawn as a level 70(+) ass beater.  Search the other forums for &quot;Kilidna&quot; and you will find more info.</div></div><hr />
