(rar) I dunno which path to go myself.<br />
<br />
Also, how about an RP board on these forums? Not just to actually RP, but to discuss it too =D Just a thought =D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just trash talk paladins alot and challenge them to as many duels as you can (At least until they get celestial cleansing)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here on the Tony Bayle Server a lot of people speak (write) English like this ... without being roleplaying ogres. :D<br />
<br />
Now back to topic.<br />
<br />
Very, very few roleplayers on our server. Almost no ogres. And I think, I have not even seen one ogre shadowknight here.<br />
And only one troll I met so far spoke this a bit strange English on purpose.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drigg</div><div class="date">04-02-2002, 12:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I Roleplay my Ogre SK as smart. He has alot of INT gear that I use when i do my Tradeskills. So when i put it on he gets smarter. But for all intense purposes i have always played him as a bit smarter than other ogres. i have in my background that after he reached the time in his life where he was able to lay claim to his clan's name ~lvl 20~ he began living around the Freeport area. This exposed him to alot of different races. Since then he has gained in speaking different languages and he speaks clearly, but when he gets into a desparate situation where the pressure is on he will revent back to his natural way of speaking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">camal</div><div class="date">04-02-2002, 01:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I roleplay me oggy as smart.  I owe this to my guild who took me in as a very very young oggy.  I was exposed to many arts and languages at that time and trained in many different weapons.  Even my hand to hand training has been maxed out.  I'm only able to roleplay smart because of the training and INT I recieved from guildies. Now I have 3 times more int than before or at least it seems it because of new gear I grabbed and so I can be an Orge of intellect an study.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zemi</div><div class="date">04-02-2002, 01:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It all depends on how you view your ogre.  2 friends and I rolled ogres way back in the day.  One of them rolled a warrior, and played him pretty brain dead (due mostly to the fact that Crakneks are the ogres that were dropped on their heads, and too dumb to do anything else.  Wonder why their guild is called Craknek?).  The other rolled a shaman.  Who kinda speaks in ogre, but is very intelligent, like you would expect the shaman of a tribe to be.  I rolled a shadowknight, the emmisary of ogre kind to the rest of the world.  RP wise, I've tried to get his faction up in as many spots as possible, and played him quite intelligent, due to his contact with the outside world.<br />
<br />
But it's all what you want to do :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lejina Bloodbath</div><div class="date">04-02-2002, 02:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pretty much all the geared Ogre/Troll/Iksar SKs have an int even or superior to a naked Erudite/Dark Elf/Gnome.<br />
Basicly, consider 80-90 as the average intelligence.<br />
110-120+ high intellect<br />
150-160+ genious<br />
<br />
Not exacly the kind of creatures that should be talking like a retarded 1 year old kid if you ask me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mynegon</div><div class="date">04-02-2002, 02:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One way to handle RPing a Ogreor Troll is to speak dumb and emote smart.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jobrill</div><div class="date">04-02-2002, 02:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, the Ogre and Troll talking in broken &quot;common&quot; is sorta funny, but it's a bit of a misnomer. I mean, Barbarians ain't much &quot;smarter&quot; Int-wise than Trolls or Ogres, and I have yet to find someone who rolesplay them in broken common. To me, If you have a Dark Elf who's stayed in Neriak his whole life, and not even so much as gone into the Foriegn Quarter, It would make just as much sense for THEM to speak in broken common, as they would not have had much exposure to it being spoken.<br />
<br />
As an Ogre, I would perhaps use a bit of broken common. &quot;Har Har! Grog smash joo now, puny ting. No try to run, me be big, but me fast!&quot; or something  like that, not mangled, but still pretty basic...Then I would mostly focus on Ogre society, the barbarity of it all, the worship of Rallos Zek. I would imagine robed-casters and shorties and elves would be paticularly looked down upon for thier weakness, and of course Dwarves would be intense racial enemies...<br />
<br />
<br />
Of course, this is just my view, your mileage may vary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Buliwyk</div><div class="date">04-02-2002, 05:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We had an ogre warrior on Cazic Thule a couple years ago who used to roleplay a disco ogre.  The ladies loved him.  His name's on the tip of my tongue...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krushum Gudended</div><div class="date">04-02-2002, 06:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, meez am a troll, but meez got sum adviss for ju.<br />
<br />
/ooc Yeah, I RP my troll as being intelligent, I often point out that my int is probably much higher than the dr00d that thinks otherwise, but I still retain my swamp accent.<br />
<br />
&quot;Meez&quot; &quot;am&quot; &quot;iz&quot; and others are all used, and I even catch myself typing these things when I play &quot;udder&quot; characters.<br />
<br />
Just think &quot;ov&quot; &quot;jurself&quot; as being smart, but speaking like you were &quot;taut&quot; by your &quot;pawentz.&quot;</div></div><hr />
