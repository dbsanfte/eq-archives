<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Warspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been doing the explorer knives for about ten stacks now. I've hit max faction with the legion of cabilis (and did so quickly), and dubious with the residents, but since then, I've had no further increseases, despite a huge humber of knives turned in (relative to the number it took to get the legion to like me).<br />
<br />
I assume the faction hits are much smaller (yes, I know about the order of the faction being relative to the size of the hits), but is the bone chip quest a bigger faction hit for the other factions than it is for the explorer knives?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jabbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The knives are the highest faction hit, but the slowest to quest due to drop rate.<br />
<br />
I'd reccommend you take a break from the knives and turn in a few hundred bone chips.  Then go back to the knives for a bit.  Then go kill Forsaken Iksar in Warsliks.  <br />
<br />
The change of scenery from time to time should be enough to keep you at least mildly amused while you do the quests.  The knives are the best faction hit, but the chips are easier to get.<br />
<br />
Split your time between them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Warspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks. Goner and I went postal in Kurn's last night, which was kind of coo. I'd never been in the zone before, and it was one of those places that seemed to have a real story behind it, if only I could figure out what it was. <br />
<br />
On the plus side, the shamans now like me, but the crusaders and the merchants still have no use for me (at least they're not considering Inkie Stew every time I wander by any more). I haven't been brave enough to check out the necros yet. I suspect I know where they stand, and while Goner is a great companion, he's not much of a character witness. Especially since I seem to get him killed pretty regularly.<br />
<br />
&lt;edit&gt; Gah, hit send to soon. Meant to confirm...higher level creatures generally give larger faction hits, yes? I was thinking of heading to Trak's Teeth to the renegade camps there and maybe scrape together some experience while factioning. If this is impractical, where's the best place to make lizard bits?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hydian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The best spot for bone chips is the Paineel newbie zone.  There is a spot where 2 sets of 3 skeletons spawn.  Each set of 3 is instant repop with one caveat...there is anti camping code.  This actually makes life easier as you suppress the spawn while looting and then make them pop at will.<br />
<br />
When Kunark was first released, I got my bard's faction maxed out on bone chips and farmed them all in that spot.  I've also done it for other people.  The real limitation is how long it takes you to loot all of those skeletons.<br />
<br />
To start it, you will need to kill all of the skeletons in the area as they wander randomly and there is no way to tell which is which, so just kill them all until you see the 6 skeletons wandering away from their spawn.<br />
<br />
To find the spot, go into the newbie area until you reach the bottom of the hill directly opposite of the tunnel from the city, then follow that to the left.  There is a large rock on the hill at the end of it.  That rock marks the radius of the anticamping code.  If you keep going straight towards the wall about halfway from where the hill ends, that is where the skeletons spawn.  Noclin's pet is a rare spawn in place of one of the sets of 3 as well.<br />
<br />
Once you get them spawning you kill them, loot, back up to the rock, rush in and kill the next 6.  Rinse.  Repeat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>GenoReaper999</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i went to kurns the other night and got bout 13 stacks of bonechips, and went to turn em in after i turned in bout 8 stacks of explorer knives. but that one crusader by the cab ent always kills me tha moment my invis wears off. to help prevent this i would hide in mid trade while invised. this used to work, but for some reason instantly gets rid of my invis and i catch crusader agor, shortly followed by agro from everything in the general area...any suggestions on what ta do?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>coersion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've been carefully tracking the rate at which cabilis factions change through various methods. My experiments give the following numbers for the various factions...<br />
<br />
LoC = Legion of Cabilis (Troopers, warriors)<br />
ST = Swift Tails (monks)<br />
SM = Scaled Mystics (shamans, Crusader Quarg)<br />
CoG = Crusaders of Greenmist (Crusaders, shadowknights)<br />
BoK = Brood of Kotiz (necros, Librarian Zimor)<br />
CR = Cabilis Residents (Kloks, bankers, Frizazz)<br />
<br />
<br />
Killing sarnaks: +1 LoC<br />
Killing goblins: +1 LoC<br />
Killing iksar outcasts: +1 LoC BoK<br />
<br />
4 bone chips to Trooper Mozo: +1 LoC ST SM CoG CR<br />
<br />
Killing explorers: +2 LoC<br />
4 explorer knives to Trooper Vaurk: +100 LoC, +25 ST SM CoG CR<br />
<br />
Am still working on<br />
4 snout ring MMs to Drill Master Dal: ?<br />
<br />
<br />
A stack of explorer knives is worth about 25 stacks of bone chips. With my 32 DE SK, I can farm a stack of knives in roughly an hour and gain ~25pp in the process. I can't farm bone chips anywhere near as fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>GenoReaper999</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">ok, ill just sell a few stacks of bonechips then and go farm more knives :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Muhd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Since were on the subject of relative faction hits , for the Kotiz faction would higher lvl outcast iksars give higher faction hits ? I heard and was too lazy to check yet that there are iksar treasure hunters or something in emerald jungle wich would be more interesting to hunt than green crud in newbie zone (though i did get an explorer's locket getting those thrice cursed knives)<br />
<br />
*edited  i had the wrong faction there hehe</div></div><hr />
