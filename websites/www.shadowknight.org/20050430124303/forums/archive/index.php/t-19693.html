<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>janktron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ive read about people getting 8%aa and 6%aa per kill soloing certain places.....i would like to know where these places are?? i know that it takes 10+mins per kill.  i have a 54 bot shammy that i could drag with me to possibly slow these mobs if anything to speed up the process and to heal me to speed up downtime...so what zone and what mobs to kill to get 8%aa per kill...thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Red mobs deep in Fire are 18% per kill and soloable. Not the most efficient experience, but fun to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>janktron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">not flagged for fire <br />
and if anyone knows a spot where i can drag along my 54 shammy bot that would be nice too..thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Only places I've hear you can get xp like that is in the elemental planes. I know a magician in another guild who's told me about the xp he can get solo in the elementals.<br />
<br />
One day I may be able to see the elemental planes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cryptia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">5-6% aa solo is easily doable in the basements of HoH, on the humans of course. Just aggro kite them w/dots while your pet bashes them from behind. Be sure and grab a KEI or VoQ first, mana regen is the key to killing mobs back to back to back... without worry of downtime.<br />
<br />
Takes about 6 minutes for me to put them down, isn't really efficient, but it is something to do while /lfg.<br />
<br />
Just snare with festering, and DoT with Ignite Blood and Arystole. Keep your pet augmented as well. Heck, grab some pet items from a mage and kills will go a bit quicker. Oh and don't forget to turn pet taunt off hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There are still non-pop dark blues that you can straight melee, just have to spend the time looking for them. The experience they give is nothing like a good group, but can be a nice break if you need to do things on your own schedule.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you can get your Shaman bot into tactics, there are spots that make good solo kite areas in there also, I've used the one up above the pit on the left side usually.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Litoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I sometimes solo the outside cave of POV. Can take roughly 10 minutes a kill but get about 6% aa per kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Glitched</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">pof pet kiting at the tables is some insane aaxp, but also takes like 25 minutes a kill and the mobs so a good group would blow it away. also one slip when kiting there and you're goo.<br />
<br />
outside of ele's...... i used to pet kite at the castle wall in pod but it was never actual good xp, i just did it when i was seriously lacking groups. can also pet kite froggies in pos which is a step up in xp and mob hp.</div></div><hr />
