<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Merf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've killed 110 Iksar over the last few days and the Cabilis Necros are still scowling at me.<br />
<br />
The Explorer Knives worked just fine to get Legion to max faction and they've moved the SK's enough that I know it's just a matter of time.<br />
<br />
The Necros on the other hand seem to be unswayable.  Are there any other ways to raise Brood of Kotiz faction?<br />
<br />
I'm particularly wondering what the faction hits are for killing other members of the Cabilis social scene.  Anybody know if the Necros hate any of the other groups in Cabilis?<br />
<br />
Also wondering if any of the NPC's in the Cabilis sewers would give a positive BoK hit?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinsei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It takes a good 200-400 kills to get to glowering</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Merf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Are there Iksar Bandit faction NPC's anywhere in Cabilis?<br />
<br />
I love playing predator indoors with Gather Shadows, the riskier the hunt the better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Honestly, the only way to do it without hours and hours of more greenie killing is to get your pet up (assuming you've got the lvl 64, or at least the lvl 58(?) one), maybe get it a couple mage goodies, and then afk in the middle of one of the camps in WW. I did this for two nights, now the necros love me. Just make sure you afk right in the middle of one of the camps (i did the one just north of the river near the middle of the zone) so that you get 3 or 4 mobs agroing you when they pop, then just let mr. bones sort them out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Merf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well, you can't go AFK in the Iksar camp nearest OT with a 49 SK and his pet.  :)<br />
<br />
Based on the rez timer I probably got 3-4 hours of killing in before a Skulking Brute and Forest Giant wound up stuck on me and beat me down.<br />
<br />
Nihilists still scowling this morning.  I think I'll afk during the day next Saturday and check in from time to time to make sure nothng bigger than a manslayer is on me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jinsei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There are no NPCs in Cabilis on Outcast faction. They're all in either EJ, SoNH,FoB,WSW and LoIO</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Merf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The faction work required for a Gnome Sk of Bertoxxolous is pretty amazing.<br />
<br />
I've killed upwards of 150 low level bandits, marauders and manslayers along with about 50 of the higher level picaroons in Trakanon's Teeth and I've moved from scowling to glaring, hopefully close to dubious.<br />
<br />
The factioning is starting to feel like trade-skilling to me.<br />
<br />
Guess I will be logging on for an hour in TT to kill the camps twice each for the next month or so...</div></div><hr />
