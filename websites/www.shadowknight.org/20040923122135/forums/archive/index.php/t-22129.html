<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Svartrot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm consistently getting 360 crits with mental horror whereas I before the patch was getting 540. Looks like the crit does not affect the soul abrasion part (360 = 270+90).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Krushum Gudended</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">bugged here, as well</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Envoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">correct me if im wrong, but Mental Horror was never designed to work with Soul Abrasion AA... just the lifetap line of proc self buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Manslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You are wrong.  The damage part of MC and MH have worked with SA, the mana gain however wasnt affected by it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Envoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">guess ill get soul abrasion then, i never got it cuz i always use mental MC/MH and read that they didnt work together.  thanks for the info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Bugged too.  Can someone less lazy than me make sure this gets posted on the official boards?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Booze the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">This confirms my suspicion that not only SoC was affected. <br />
What seems to have happened is, crits are only being treated as if you had SA2, while Exceptional heals are getting the SA3 treatment.<br />
SoC  with SA3 is (65x3)x2 and Im getting the full 390 off it with exceptional heals, but crits are only getting treated as )65x2)x2, meaning, crits are only detecting SA2 and not SA3.<br />
<br />
Ive bugged it and and encouraging all other Sks to do so as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Avatar of Spacetime</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Aye it's broken, did a /bug, hope they are able to fix it soon</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">2800 lifetap ht crit, 1070 toi crit, i think its a bug with scf not working full strength on aa abilities?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Booze the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">were HT recently affected? I did over the base 7200 yesterday after the first patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Booze the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Nope. Just got a 9500 ht tonight, so SCF is working right it seems</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Trysbrina67</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I crit normally on spells like ToI and Harmtouch however my crits with Mental Horror seem to be broken(hitting for 360).  I did a /bug as well so lets hope its resolved soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">have theft of life 3<br />
have spell casting fury 3<br />
have soul abrasion 3<br />
use Shroud of Chaos usually<br />
<br />
IF both  toi and scf happen usually = was 780.<br />
Theft of Life or scf = 390<br />
<br />
last night sometimes I got 390 and sometimes 260.<br />
<br />
I guess the 260 was somehow it only saw soul abrasion 2?<br />
<br />
Inconsistant though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">why doesn't someone start a poll....&quot; How long do you think it will take the developers to fix this?&quot;  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Vermadas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">It makes more sense that SCF is ignoring SA altogether instead of just considering it at level 2, as the original poster suggested.<br />
<br />
The base part of the innate proc is the only thing getting critical'd.  For example, Black Shroud Strike is 90 dmg base.  SCF adds another 90 to it on a successful crit.  SA3 makes the proc 3x its base, for 270.  270+90 = 360.<br />
<br />
So basically the the SCF calculation is happening before SA is considered instead of after as it should be.<br />
<br />
Base + (Base * 3) should be (Base + Base) * 3 or (Base * 3) * 2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Svartrot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Todays patch did not fix it. Sent in a /bug on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Go figure!  :mad:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">ya, but they did fix the warrior shielding...guess I know where SKs rate with SOE</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Do warriors actually use that discipline?  I assume that's what they're talking about, and not the shielding mod.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Avatar of Spacetime</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Confirming that it's still broken after today's patch, doing another /bug atm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Keuven Nightstalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Noticed it yesterday just send /bug today . Im guessing it will be weeks or next patch when they fix it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I'm waiting for them to say, &quot;This is how we intended it to work from the beginning, so it's not really a nerf, it's a fix.&quot;<br />
<br />
&gt;_&lt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Wasn't this an old bug before PoP? That they fixed around the time of PoP I remember there was some kinda bug with like crits not workin with SA back in the day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Yah, it was one of the top things people were pushing to fix at that time.  But it was a different problem.  SA and SCF were not working together at all.  It was one or the other.  If you trained SA after you already had SCF, you stopped critting SoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Krazaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Dev I talked to said it was fixed on test.  If anyone wants to confirm.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">The new consent options is going to be sweet.  I also like them making the Everquest process &quot;friendlier.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Eggborn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">If it's not spell casting fury, then what happened to my harm touch?<br />
<br />
I had unholy touch (2)<br />

with unholy aura my harm touches were around 2600<br />

After I got spell casting fury (1)  (just had to spent the 2 aa's it burns! lol)<br />
my harm touches with unholy aura 1400 to 1700.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Improved Harm Touch -- it has a different hotkey than the old one.<br />

Human error here is the problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You need to make a new hotkey  for this..<br />
<br />
Line 1.   /discipline unholy aura<br />
Line 2.   /alt activate 86<br />
<br />
there now you should be getting ht to hit for about 4k now..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Eggborn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Is there a &quot;make hotkey&quot; on the AA screen?<br />
<br />
I unwisely spent some AA's into the refresh timer, so I would want to use a hotkey besides the homemade one.<br />
<br />
I also prefer to use the combat box for discs and not another homemade key.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Skoggel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">What I do:<br />
<br />
On main hotkey bank, I have a hotkey like Feriin listed above.<br />
<br />
On the second hotkey bank I have the actual IHT hotkey from the AA window. This is used generally if I pre-activate unholy aura to avoid the pause in my hotkey. It's also a way to tell if IHT has cycled yet or not.<br />
<br />
I also have the original HT hotkey on my third hotkey bank, simply because of that bug where IHT hotkey would look ready to go, but it actually wouldn't be (did that ever get fixed yet? :|)<br />
<br />
Once I finish out my current AA I'm probably gonna put 2 AA into the HT refresh timer simply because it almost matches disc recycle time then... and just glancing at my disc window will let me know if it's ready to go or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Krushum Gudended</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I actually like being able to burn HT as soon as it recycles with totw3.<br />
<br />
Always have typed /disc unh manually.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Eggborn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Finally the noob found it lol<br />
<br />
Glad I posted, and thank you.<br />
<br />
Yeah it doesn't grey out, so I too have my HT key floating around on a back page.</div></div><hr />
