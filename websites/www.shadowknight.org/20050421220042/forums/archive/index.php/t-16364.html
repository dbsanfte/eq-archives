<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>MasterVicker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was looking for some solid info on the shard.  Ive never been deep into chardok so I dont know what it takes.  What kind of group would i need to go in that deep and camp the herblist area.  How long is the spawn for the ass. herb..  How often does he pop and how rare is the shard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jabbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">One group of mid-50's can do the camp, provided you have crowd control and a decent puller.  Might be smart to bring two groups the first time you do it to learn the camp.<br />
<br />
He himself is very rare.  The shard drop from him is also very rare.  As to how long... well, I hope you like Chardok.  This is the bottleneck (imo) of the Greenmist quest.  I'd suggest finding a necro in your guild who needs the Mansi Herb and the two of you making a deal to put together groups from time to time to attempt to get the drops you both need from the same camp.<br />
<br />
As to getting there, that's easy.  <br />
<br />
When you zone into Chardok you'll fight or invis down to the castle.  At the entrance of the castle you've got 3 choices.  Into the castle, up to zone out, or up the passage which is raised up off the floor.  Get a DMF or other levi on everyone.  Then run up the stalagmite in front of the castle then beeline for the raised passage.<br />
<br />
You can also levi and invis everyone and go up through the castle itself to where the named spawns on the top part, left side.  Either works, just depends on how you wanna do it.<br />
<br />
From there, simply follow the tunnel down.  If you get a map (or the mapping feature from LoY) you can easily see the route.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nazgaull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Two weeks ago I got home and sat at my desk, clicked on my monitor to see if my Mule had sold anything.<br />
<br />
Just out of curiosity, I typed in &quot;greenish&quot; into the Bazaar Search feature...<br />
<br />
3 Shards came up.<br />
<br />
Two for 9k.<br />
One for 5k.<br />
<br />
Before I could log my SK on from my other account, a friend and guildmate took her Mule and bought the 5k shard for me.<br />
<br />
I also found the History of Greenmist for 400pp... <br />
<br />
Soon as I finish with the painstacking faction work I'll be moving along on this Quest.  Already got an offer from someone willing to MQ the Mirror with me.</div></div><hr />
