<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nazgaull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am considering going into Charasis after Drusilla Sathir.<br />
<br />
The Mirror is pretty much the only piece I have left that is holding me back on Greenmist.<br />
<br />
I can put together the forces to take Dru down, however, I am looking for advice...<br />
<br />
The zone was recently revamped, probably looks the same but different Mobs.  I have a couple maps I found but none show specifically where Drusilla spawns in the East? Wing... <br />
<br />
<br />
Take this map for example: http://www.legacyguild.com/images/Charasis_01.gif <br />
<br />
<br />
It just shows red dots for the big named mobs.  There are three of them in Dru's wing... Which one is her?<br />
<br />
Has anyone hit the zone recently after the revamp?  What can be expected of the mobs?  The above map shows pathing route fairly well, but it relates to the zones former state.  How reliable is it now, do mobs still path along the same routes and are the spawn points the same?<br />
<br />
Doors: there are some that are locked and unlocked.  Are they the same or changed?  <br />
<br />
For example, The Hole... all the doors in the jail are removed, including the cell with Caradon inside (I was there last night and saw him) and the locked door that leads up to The Tower is now no longer locked, one can run back out to the zone-out with no problem now.<br />
<br />
So what is the deal with the doors in Charasis now?<br />
<br />
I am hoping to maybe try to raid there soon and any information on the zones current state would help a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ashrai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Did her with 2 L65 Druids, 65 Monk, and 65 Chanter.  (I was running the druid at the time to just MQ the mirror later)<br />
<br />
When you appear in zone, the door you need to go through isn't locked. The others still are.  Use same method as always to get to the door without falling through pit in the stairs.  <br />
<br />
<br />
As you can see on the map, it's a pretty short run to Drus and from what I remember we found the mobs pretty much where they should be, It was undead all along the way. Pits in carpet spots are still the same. Pretty much don't step near carpet squares.<br />
<br />
I had a different map than you have linked but it was also very badly marked. Thinking back to where we pulled to, I *think* she's the red dot in the East Wing that's closest to north. We set up at the corner before and monk pulled her. <br />
<br />
I didn't exp there before the patch so couldn't give you a comparison of the difficulty with regards to pre and post patch-but as with many old world fights , you do it and go wow they were kinda gimpy. :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I *think* she's the red dot in the East Wing that's closest to north<br />
<br />
Correct.<br />
<br />
Should be a good time for a group of mid-50s.  No need to bring a raid force.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nazgaull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thank you for the advice.<br />
<br />
I have another question.<br />
<br />
Entering Charasis; I am reading, and being given conflicting reports.<br />
<br />
I have read and have been told that: 1 key = 1 group entering.<br />
<br />
I have read and have been told that: each member of the group, needs a key.<br />
<br />
I have read and been told, that there are two enterances into Charasis from OT.<br />
<br />
One is a circle of stones, of some such.  The other is a glowing red sphere, like Old Sebilis, with no circle of stones...<br />
<br />
I have read and been told that, the circle of stones let's in 1 group per Key... and that the Red Sphere lets in 1 group so long as each member has the key.<br />
<br />
So which is correct?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Odiumar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The mirror is the last piece I need as well...<br />
I've never been to HS so I know next to nothing about it.  Dru is in the east wing right?  Is there a way into the east wing without having to work all the way through the zone?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nazgaull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Is there a way into the East Wing without having to work all the way through the zone?<br />
<br />
Um yeah, you walk into the East Wing.  You'll need to levitate over the fake stairs though.<br />
