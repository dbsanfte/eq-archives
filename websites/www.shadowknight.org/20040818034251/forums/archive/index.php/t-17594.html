<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zackendorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can anyone tell me what the quickest way to raise chardok faction is? I pharmed droga for a long time before they changed it and im still scowl, is there a better way?  does droga still give + sarnak faction?  any imput is appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Paynreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you have money, go buy a shitload of salts and skins. <br />
<br />
I mean a whole friggen' lot of them, i think its well over 1000 that you need.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>kassdax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Back before the revamp I took my magicain to Droga for faction farming. I still go there now and then after I do a bit of slaughtering in Chardok. i can attest that Droga and Nurga both give good chardok faction hits. However each goblin is only one faction hit.<br />
<br />
I can't recall the exact numbers but from max scowling to threatening was the longest stretch. I roughly calculated 2000ish goblins just to get to threatening. From there to max ally was around 1800 or so.<br />
<br />
On a side note, I saved all my skins and salts for my wife's rogue. She had never killed a sarnak and was a bristlebane worshipping halfling. Although she was scowling it was just barely scowling. With just a few stacks of skins she went from scowl to indifferent. <br />
<br />
On the Saryrn server the skins and salts sell for 30pp-50pp each quite often in the bazaar. If you want fast faction this is the way to go but it will be somewhat spendy.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Fastest is to buy 3000 Mt. Death Mineral Salts and 3000 Green Goblin Skins in the bazaar at 50 plat each, then turn them in for faction.  If you are paying that much each for them, they should flow to you reasonably quickly.  Meanwhile, while you buy those as fast as your bazaar can supply them, kill stuff in droga and save the salts &amp; skins.  Turn those in also.  After 40 hours of killing and thousands of salt &amp; skin turn-ins, you should have the desired faction.<br />
<br />
And that's the quickest way to do that.  You get more faction from turning in salts/skins than you do from killing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Slagnath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">from what i read, warlord skargus is a +300 hit, so if you have a chum who is doing it, slap skargus!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zackendorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks for all the input, I was unaware that the salts and such could be used for faction, where can I turn them in at?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Paynreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Turn them in to Herald Telcha as soon as you zone in to Chardok - http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1887</div></div><hr />

Some people DO play for fun, and not the best gear you know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kaedian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Korucust to a degree and even moreso his guards give large faction increases in chardokB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ilvai Oloth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yeah, I hear the dokB faction hits are insane in comparison into droga work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Savoline</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">the southwest mines in Frontier mountains now give Dizok hits as well as they drop alot of salt and skin, alot more than the mobs in Droga. I started killing that stuff at 34, moved on to nurga and was just by exping of these mobs kindly at 51.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Marder Blacksoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">dokB (Halls of Betrayal) is by far the best way to increase faction in Chardok.  There are also some very nice item quests that can be done there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Theemop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">What does your faction need to con to do the salt and skin turn in's to the Herald?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I was able to turn these in at indifferent and get all the appropriate messages, not sure what your min faction would need to be as you should always be able to do a turn in at indiff to this mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kastizi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">You should get a chanter and a wizzy / mage to go with you to Nurga, pull a hella of a big train, and AE them.  Use your gimp AE.  Nurga is a lower level of the gobbies and they give out same faction.  Just a thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kastizi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Hrm, seem to be having a problem linking my sig and my magelo on this board.  :(  sorry all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>kassdax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">In response to when you can turn in the salts and skins to the herald, wife did it at scowling and got the positive faction hits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Yaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">When I wasn't collecting salts, skins, playing in Chardok B for Chardok faction, I was sitting AFK in front of the Droga entrance with my pet out.  Faction while you sleep.  It also works real good, if for some reason you go down to kill Chardok nameds, for fixing faction when you're done.</div></div><hr />
