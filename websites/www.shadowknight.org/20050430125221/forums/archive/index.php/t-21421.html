<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>dumpbush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So as a 6th level Erud SK, I get no experience for killing any of the newbie monsters in Paineel, I get immediately killed by a bunch of kobolds if I go in the warrens. I get immediately killed by a bunch of skeletons if I go in the forest.<br />
<br />
SO exactly how the hell am I supposed to gain any experience at this point?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Arikash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">goto Steamfont mountains and kill the kobold camps there, I think that is good xp at lvl 6, then what I did at like lvl 10-11, was goto Unrest with my friends till like 16, and then went to Paludal caverns till 24, HK till 30-32ish, then The Overthere till like 40, quit at 40(tried DL) came back when LDoN came out, did those till like 50ish, and then did PoJ/PoN/PoI/PoD till like 56, and bummed some pov groups from guildies, and I'm at 61, and still in PoV.  Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You can bind at the tox zone and zone in, HT a skelly, die, zone in, HT a skelly, die, etc. until they're dead (it's actually decent XP).  Once they're broken, you can probably solo them, or you can go kill kobalds or something elsewhere in the zone.  <br />

Oh the things you figure out when bored to hell...</div></div><hr />

How do I get to the Stonebrunt Mountains from Paineel? I've never found a way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dkhar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Why not just hit PoK, go to Freeport and then hit East Commonlands ? Kill spiders and stuff till you level and start killing bears, pumas and then Orcs. Work your way over to North Ro after that and do the Dervish camps at about level 10-11 ? Just steer clear of the guards if you're KoS, not a problem as they are all static.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Stonebrunt is the other side of the Warrens.  You have to go across Warrens to get there, unless you get a port from a Wiz/Druid.</div></div><hr />

I'm a total n00b. First ever EQ character. PoK?? KoS?? It's all Greek to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">PoK = Plane of knowledge...it's the grand central station of Everquest, you can get to and from most major destinations from there by use of magical teleporting stones.<br />
<br />
KoS = Kill on Sight...it means that because of your race and religions that there are many beings that will attack and try to kill you as soon as they see you.<br />
<br />
the big issue right now is that you are kind of in a tween level.  To get exp go into tox and find some kobold's that give exp.  Then once you're level 8 or so you can solo the entrance of the warrens.<br />
<br />
Make sure you have equipment for every slot as soon as possible.  Being an erudite this isn't too hard.  Just collect Kobold teeth and there is a quest that give you faction, money and rarely a piece of ringmail.  Keep doing that until you are fully geared.   That will make the warren hunting easier too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>dumpbush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thanks for the info, Keevel. Very helpful.<br />
<br />
One question: How do I get to the Plane of Knowledge?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Theres a stone book just west of Paineel out in Tox.  Pick up some kind of zone connection map or something if you want to see what zones connect to which once you get into PoK<br />
<br />
Start at www.eqatlas.com<br />
Dunno if thats still a good site, but it was good to me in the first couple years.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grulknar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'm really enjoying this :P</div></div><hr />

ZEM - Zone Experience modifier - It determines how good the experience for killing MOBS (Mobile objects) is in any zone.  <br />
<br />
The Warrens has a great ZEM, also Blackburrow (near Qeynos) is good and not only good experience per kill, but you are fighting indoors and that's a skill you'll want to hone before you get too high.<br />
<br />
Many people will suggest Paludal Caverns (PC) or Kurn's Tower (kurns) for specific levels to level up faster.  You know what?  Ignore them!  You're learning the game take your time, explore try different things.  What fun would it be to be a really high level and know nothing of the game?  Enjoy it, levels come pretty easy now, gear is good.  Stick with the Warrens for now, get yourself outfitted, learn some skills, kick some kobold ass.<br />
<br />
Ask any questions you liek in the appropriate threads and If I see them I'll pitch in.  Working a  RL friend through the game for the first time now and I remember just how much there is to learn that many of us now take for granted.  Don't worry you will too soon .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Fehl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Go to Tox, at our front proch hang a left and run to a big family bible looking statue near the stone/cliffwall. Click on it!<br />
<br />
Now your in PoK. your side of the yard is crab grass and rundown. all the little square platforms with what look like bad statue or dying plants are gates to other places to hunt. <br />
<br />
Before you go clicking on one ask some one to show you were the soulbinder is. Say Hail then Bind my Soul! Now when you die you will reappear in PoK in front of the soulbinderyou just talked to.<br />
<br />
Now run back to the bad yard side of town and look a dying plant statue on a square block that says Cabalis. Its in a corner of a big open space. Click on this.<br />
<br />
Now your in Field of Bone. move to the desert area and youll see a pig pit with a dried lakebed in it. con the mobs and depending on your skill and your equipment hunt what mob best suits you. Pull them to the white ramps and slaughter till you here ding!<br />
<br />
Join in  to groups when you can and ask others about their classes and any other how to do things in the game! If your serious about this post then do this one thing above all else...........ENJOY IT.....<br />
<br />
Dont worry about things like 6 toons said this was the place to hunt because your exp is higher while your in that zone. Dont listen to ubba lvl 6 toon with 35k one slot gear letting you know the what and h=whys of EQ. Just ENJOY  it wont last long hehe<br />
<br />
When your bored with that come post back here!<br />
<br />
Good Luck!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">FoB (Field of Bone) is fine and dandy<br />
<br />
The problems is getting you gear.  FoB won't get you your newbie armor or quest gear.  Make sure that at least your Armor (not ring, earring) slots all have something before you go for it.<br />
<br />
Ring and earring were my last two slots to fill.  Once you got to Pok, then Nexus then bazaar you can probably buy earring, ring stuff.  I know  those were my last four slots, but that was well before the new economy and bazaar.  Keep having fun and post upsates for us.  It's fun to see a new player work thier way through and help them out a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Requiam O'Souls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I recommend the Warrens until things blue out, then head to Field of Bone until around level 10, then Kurn's Tower until level 20.<br />
<br />
All have Zone modifier's so levelings fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Satist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Okies, zone into Toxxula Forest from Paineel.  While you are standing on the porch, hit the backspace key.  Providing you have the Legacy of Ykesha expansion, using the backspace key will bring up a map of the zone.  Look carefully at the map.  there should be a black arrow on it.  this arrow is you.  it points whichever way you face.  Notice, down in the lower corner, there are numbers.  They indicate the size of the map.<br />
  Now, zoom out on the map until you see a set of circles on it.  This is a kobold camp, that should range from conning yellow to blue to you.  Odds are, that when you pull one, the others will come too.  It's no big deal, for now.  As long as you kill one, using HT if you need to, and die each time, you will manage to get the camp spawn broken.  These kobolds should last you until level 9, I think.  Also look around, and watch the other monsters that wonder by, killing the ones you need to to finish your beginning armor quests.  Once you have finished them, you should be level 8-12, depending upon how lucky you were with the drops of crude bronze, etc.  <br />
  At that point, you can either go to the Warrens, killing kobolds, gaining molars, and getting faction and perhaps armor from the quest, or you can go to field of bone, and kurn's tower.  i highly recommend going to kurn's, not for the xp bonus, but because your pet spell requires bone chips as a reagent in order to finish casting it.  you will literally gain backpacks full of bonechips in kurn's tower.  this is the reason to go there.<br />
  even if soloing there is slow, you will see other classes in there, leveling.  by all means, shoot them a tell, meet them, group or partner with them if possible, etc.  it doesn't matter if they have better armor than you or not, what matters is that by partnering and grouping, you drastically cut downtime, and you meet people that you might eventually need, or get to know better, etc.<br />

<br />
A lot of good advice has been given here (am I on the right boards?!? :D ).  With all the choices of hunting spots presented, I'd say you should try as many of them as you can!<br />
Get a feel for which ones you like/dislike.<br />
<br />
Despite the fact that it is super-fast exp, I'd avoid Paludal Caverns, though.  It should be easy to find groups there (once you hit level 12 or so, although you can do well there at lower levels, too), and levels will fly, but the idiots that perpetually fill the zone will detract from the fun (particularly the endless fights about who KS'ed who).</div></div><hr />
