<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kazzil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Someone told me the other day that you will actually proc more without haste.  Still doesnt make sense to me.  If this is the case can someone explain why or how that happens.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">HASTE DOES NOT EFFECT PROCS<br />
<br />
Very Simple:<br />
You have the same # of procs per minute with more swings per minute when you have haste<br />
<br />
10 swing in a minute with 2 procs = a ratio of 1 proc in every 5 swings<br />
<br />
14 swings per minute with 2 procs - a ratio of 1 proc every 7 swing<br />
<br />
Why that's over-simplified:<br />
It's more complicated than that when you start to delve into it and realize that haste effects attack speed it does not decrease delay and that weapons could have adjusted procs that will proc more or less than normal proccing rates, then there is WA etc. etc.<br />
<br />
Edit Add:  <br />
Generally I hear the &quot;you get more procs the slower you swing&quot; argument from warriors.  It has, generally, to do with earthshaker groups.  The Warrior group (usually all warriors with maybe a shaman) gets slowed, train themselves, pop a disc and let the weapon AE proc everything dead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KlowdKill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just to go with another explination to rule out questions towards keevel's.<br />
<br />
Crits have a % chance at any given attack to go off.  Procs are based on timers for how long before they go off.  Timers random, it's why you'll proc 5x's in a row than take 5 mobs before you see another proc.<br />
<br />
Hence, if you're slowed and your delay is 1 full minute..  You'll guarantee a proc every swing basicly.<br />
<br />
Like Keevel said:<br />
2 swing a minute = 1 proc<br />
198,762,172 swings a minute = 1 proc<br />
<br />
I hear having piss in your boots helps you proc more though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>zarzac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I had heard that better dex = more procs i take it from the prev posts that this is not true??</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wow, I hadnt heard the 255 part.  So having a Dex over 255 is about as useful as agility over 75?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I don't have my parse results from when I was looking over dex anymore, but I seem to remember there was an affect over 255, just greatly reduced.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Medzgaleer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">All this being said, I guess the next logical question would be, is there a heirarchy to procs?<br />
<br />
Inate Weapon Proc v. Spell Cast Proc v. Augment Proc<br />
<br />
and that being said, if I have a weapon with an inate proc and augment it with another proc and cast say... shroud of chaos on me.... will i get more procs overall or are the timers on the procs linked somehow?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Proc Order is<br />
1. Natural Weapon Proc<br />
2. Augment Proc <br />
3. Self Imbued Proc Buff<br />
4. Imbue Proc Buff - Katta's Song (bard, never used).<br />
<br />
Last August they supposedly made it so you can have multiple procs go off in a single round (can't remember if that was confirmed).  <br />
<br />
If not you can lose later possible procs.  Meaning you'll proc the natural one more, but as a result over time you'll see a slight decrease in other procs.<br />
<br />
WA does not effect self imbued procs.<br />
<br />
Edit add: Search for procs, or WA and look about the time GoD was out to see multitudes of proc discussions and how valuable WA is.  Might clear up any other questions you have.  This has been discussed so many times.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">on topic, since people keep posting misinformation...<br />
you can proc multiple times per swing, the only thing that can't go off at the same time is primary &amp; aug... so you can get the following combinations in one combat round:<br />
primary<br />
aug<br />
SoD<br />
TotC<br />
primary + SoD<br />
primary + TotC<br />
aug + SoD<br />
aug + TotC<br />
SoD+TotC<br />
primary+SoD+TotC<br />
aug+SoD+TotC<br />
<br />
with WA5 and around 290 dex, using a 30 delay weapon with 41% worn haste, over a 317 minute period (8691 combat rounds) i got:<br />
941 primary procs (2.97/min)<br />
843 augment procs (2.66/min)<br />
634 SoD procs (2.00/min)<br />
630 TotC procs (1.99/min)<br />
<br />
so...<br />
the number of procs per minute is<br />
primary: 2 + 0.2*wa<br />
augment: primary* (1 - primary * delay / 600)<br />
SoD: 2<br />
ToTC: 2<br />
<br />
for example for the augment proc rate:<br />
with my 30 delay weapon and 41% haste, the delay was 30 / 1.41 = 21.277<br />
so expected proc rate was 3 * (1 - 3 * 21.277 / 600) = 3 * (1 - 0.1064) = 2.68 expected ppm, which is just about what happened over the 5 hour parse.</div></div><hr />

What about weapons with more than 1 augment? I.e. epic 1.5s and 2s, and the GoD smithed weapons that if you have the right augments for, you could double augment.<br />
<br />
Also, I saw a link once from a cleric who augmented thier shield with a proc, and it leads to the question, would that proc on a bash? (not that I would even think about replacing my AC augment on my shield, it's just a curiousity).<br />
<br />
<br />
And on a related note, I thought I remember reaing somewhere on these boards that the epics 1.5 and 2 had modified proc rates, but Lucy doesn't list there being any (unless of course I am reading the raw data wrong). Was the modified proc rate just wishful thinking on my part?</div></div><hr />

the first augment will act as primary proc, the 2nd will act as augment. when i say &quot;augment&quot; just pretend i'm saying secondary proc.<br />
<br />
proc on a bash?<br />
no, and you can't proc with a 2h bash either, or on a riposte. proc checks only occur at the beginning of each combat round. combat rounds go like this:<br />
primary proc chance OR secondary proc<br />
buff proc OR other buff proc OR other buff proc<br />
ToTC proc<br />
swing<br />
another swing if dual wield checks<br />
another swing if triple attack checks<br />
<br />
Was the modified proc rate just wishful thinking on my part?<br />
yes, lucy would list it obviously otherwise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Ravilicus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Window, given the fact that there can only be one buff proc firing in any given melee round, how beneficial/detrimental is it to use the buff on a Symbol of the Planemasters (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=20898) if you have Soul Abrasion 3 and Spell Casting Fury 3?<br />
<br />
Is there a way to dictate which buff proc has precedence on the check?  (I.E. does buff order matter?)<br />
<br />
Is the additional chance of successfully proccing 75 DD+ stun worthwhile given the fact it might come at the exclusion of what could be a 1k+ Crit heal?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">i do not have symbol of the planesmasters, but i'm pretty sure they don't stack at all. they're both slot 1: add proc things. they didn't stack last year for sure.<br />
<br />
i did not check buff order precedence, but my SoD proc was first and seemed to remain at 2ppm. i'd guess first buff has precedence.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>khuan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">back in teh days warriors with Earthshaker would clear PoG and PoFear by being shaman slowed, they would proc almost every hit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That was by having a bard pull every mob within distance to them in one bigass group, and then the warrior (usually 2-3 of them, one after the other) would AE taunt and put on Rampage (I think? I dunno, never played a warrior) disc which would make them swing at every mob within distance, meaning that they would swing at 30 mobs every swing, and while 75% (or whatever it was) slowed, they would proc on nearly every mob, meaning 25 procs for 200 or whatever damage = 5k AE damage per weapon swing. It's not like they could just walk up to mobs and wtfpwn them to death, it took a lot of set up and a long reuse disc to pull it off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>khuan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">lol uh yeah, it was simple - buff warriors, pull mobs, break out Earthshaker, start wackin away. I know this cause i played a warrior for 3 1/2 years. We also do this for shits and giggles in p5 of time to clear the armies.</div></div><hr />
