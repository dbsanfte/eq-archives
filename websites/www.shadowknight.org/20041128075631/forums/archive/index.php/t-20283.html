<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ok, this may be a newbie question....<br />
<br />
Do you need a flag or key for Temple of Veeshan, or just good faction with claws of Veeshan?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">AFAIK, no flag/key is needed for ToV.  You need a key if you want to enter Cobalt Scar from Skyshrine, IIRC, but ToV is wide open to both those who have good faction with CoV and those who don't.<br />

CoV dragons are equal opportunity Player Killers. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>cames</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">This is for folks that miss ports on the way to ToV.  You do not need a Cobalt Scar key anymore to get there.<br />
<br />
The journey will be: <br />
<br />
Plane of Knowledge - Great Divide - Plane of Mischief - Cobalt Scar - Siren's Grotto - Western Wastes - Temple of Veeshan <br />
<br />
I generally run this with Bobbing Corpse on wherever possible.  This is not required but are helpful.  Being able to invis is just about manadatory.<br />
<br />
Plane of Knowledge - <br />
Click on the Great Divide (GD) Book <br />
<br />
Great Divide - <br />
<br />
The zoneline to Plane of Mischief (PoM) is in a cave entrance on the South End of the River that divides the zone. There is a miniature house in this entrance. Click on it to enter PoM. <br />
<br />
Plane of Mischief - <br />
All the mobs in the zone in area do NOT see invis. So, invis up. The zoneout is a random tree in the forest in front of you. The zoneout moves periodically, so we will be searching for it invis. To find the zoneout, left click in random directions at the trees. You will eventually get the &quot;You are too far away&quot; message. That is the current direction of the zoneout. Keep clicking and run in that direction. Eventually you will stop receiving this message. I generally hit escape (to create a fresh text line) and turn and click. Again, run at the too far away message. Eventually, you will zone to Cobalt Scar (CS). <br />
<br />
Mobs in PoM in this area hit like Tier 1 PoP mobs so be prepared for that or invis up. <br />
<br />
Cobalt Scar - <br />
<br />
You will zone into the bottom of the water in the middle of the zone. The Siren's Grotto (SG) zoneline is a bit west of northwest of you. Swim to it and zone in. <br />
<br />
Siren's Grotto - <br />
<br />
Well, SG removes any levitation you had. The mobs on land generally do not see invis. Some of the ones in the water do. We will be going through the water. Expect to be seen on the way and mobs to aggro you.  You are very likely to be hit and perhaps stunned, just keep going.<br />
<br />
When you enter SG, there is a mob in the little tunnel area. Just beyond this mob is some water. Facing this water, you will see to your left an underwater tunnel. That is your route. <br />
<br />
Swim through this tunnel. It will lead to a dead end and you must swim up quite a ways. When at the top, you will see a waterfall. Go over the waterfall and you will land in more water. Once over the waterfall, you want to get to the nearby ledge on the North side of the water. Its a good idea to re-invis when out of the water. <br />
<br />
Once re-invised, go north and take the first opening on your left. At every choice along the way, you will stay left. When you are near the Western Wastes (WW), you will see 2 paths you can take straight ahead of you. The left one goes to WW. <br />
<br />
Western Wastes - <br />
<br />
Depending on how KoS you are will lead you to invis or not. Levitation is preferred but not required. The entrance to the Temple of Veeshan (ToV) is in the second canyon. Most mobs do not see invis but some do. Most dragons are on the Claws of Veeshan faction, except for Escorpa of the Ring. Escorpa is on Kunark Dragon faction.  Sontalak does see invis, so if you are KoS and need to get past him use Harmshield.<br />
<br />
Remember if you zone into ToV, you probably need a way to port out.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Theoretically, if you still have good CoV faction, couldn't you also go through Kael to WL, WL to Skyshrine, Skyshrine to CS, CS to SG, SG to WW, WW to ToV?<br />
<br />
I realize that it's a slightly longer run with more zone changes, but it would minimize having to run through PoM forest clicking on trees. Also, I think what mobs are up in the forest and whether or not they see invis might depend on the version of PoM your server is currently running.  IIRC, there are three versions, and again, IIRC, the last time I was there (Zebuxoruk, version 3 at the time), there were a few mobs in the forest who saw invis.<br />
<br />
I could be wrong (or remember incorrectly) of course. /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>yuggoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If you have good CoV faction, there is a zoneout in West ToV.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>cames</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Skyshrine is locked going to Cobalt Scar.<br />
<br />
Getting the key is easy, but the other method avoids the key altogether.<br />
<br />
You are correct about WToV, but generally unless you are hunting in HoT (which I have not done for a couple of years) you have wrecked your CoV faction.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Wienaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I have used the same tree at the same loc for months now, it has never moved on me (in PoM)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>cames</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well after the patches of late I made this run to complete the old Strength of Elements quest and two things have occurred.<br />
<br />
First, the zone out tree seems to be static now.<br />
<br />
Second, the range to get the &quot;Too far away&quot; message has been considerably shortened.<br />
<br />
So, my suggestion is to run straight out from zone in and the zone out currently looks to be about 1/2 way out from zone in to the castle.<br />

PS - I have not yet zone warped so I have no idea what happens if you do.  Proceed with extreme caution.</div></div><hr />
