I am currently a warrior on Seventh hammer and I am about to get another computer in order to share time on eq with my wife.  So what I am thinking is I love to melee, but hate the down time and group dependency of a warrior...so will I enjoy SKs let me know what you think, and how you would recruit more Shadow Knights into the game.<br />

Reason is, and you'll find this all over these boards, if you have to ask then SK isn't the right class for you. so why not just start one and when you decide after lvl 20 that you don't like it then you can go start a ranger or other similar treehuggin class.  But if you really need a reason then your reason would be <br />
VERSATILITY.  Our reason is why play anything else, and the gereal cool factor of being and evil bastard with a big sword.:D</div></div><hr />

Dude heres what I think. I think that you should make something strong,something fierce, and something troll. Make a troll and love every minute of it. Sure the XP pen sux but It ok. Your and SK right? That only means there will be more blood on your sword than a human or gnome or even a coughcough loser Dark Elf. Its only too bad you have to start out in Neriak now...Grobb and Innothule was actually a really nice Newbie area. Neriak and Nektulos suck ass with all the newbie necros and all</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Most of the time, even if they DON'T have to ask, SK isn't the right class...<br />
<br />
<br />
Hi.  My name is __Groff__.  I like cake.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Hekk Fire</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I played a warrior when I started EQ, and I loved it.   Smack stuff, take a beating and survive, no complications just simple fun.<br />
  Then I got tired of EQ and took a break.  Came back and made a new warrior- same thing.  I loved it, but ended up tiring of the game a few months later.<br />
<br />
  This time I tried a shadowknight...<br />
Been playing him for over a year and never got tired of him yet.  I can still beat on stuff, and cast some very useful spells (fear and darkness anyone?), play dead and survive more often than not when things get too rough, say and do &quot;evil&quot; things in the name of roleplaying- it's great!  I have made a twink here or there at the request of friends wanting to mess around with stuff, but couldn't get into any of them.  I wouldn't trade my SK for any class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rotarr Rok'Vodarna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Without being a dick about it, I will try to explain the deal about Shadow Knights.  Don't look to be convinced.  Asking to be convinced is going to be taken as an insult here.  If you need convincing and you want to play a melee, go play a beastlord, they solo PoP content better than SKs.<br />
<br />
Read over the powers and abilities you get as a SK.  Does it sound perfect to you?  If not, move on, there is nothing to see here.</div></div><hr />

Living up to your stupid self eh?<br />
<br />
Dark Elf or Iksar. Sk's are the best class. Plain and simple.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>chardrok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">some current SKs to tell me why they enjoy their char and why they think I would enjoy this character selection. <br />
<br />
<br />
I enjoy being evil,  Killing anything I want to without regard to faction, and the &quot;thanks&quot; from the slowers that I main tank for.<br />
<br />
 <br />
So what I am thinking is I love to melee, but hate the down time and group dependency of a warrior...so <br />
<br />
SK fits here, but a better meelee solo'er is probably a beast lord.  And they've increasingly made soloing less rewarding than it used to be.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
will I enjoy SKs let me know what you think, <br />
<br />
That depends...<br />
<br />
Do you like to bitch over every spell, xp, aggro, pathing change? Do you like to flame anyone who may ask you for information?  <br />
<br />
Oops, maybe that's just on this board.<br />
<br />
Do you like having a shot at being able to get out of just about any bad situation that is escapable?  Taking aggro and holding it?  Being able to role play by just being in a bad mood?<br />
<br />
 <br />
 <br />
and how you would recruit more Shadow Knights into the game.<br />
 <br />
<br />
We don't want 'em, and don't need 'em.  This isn't the monk board. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Pharr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I play an SK for the versitility of the class.  Like you, I enjoy melee.  I also like the casting aspect.  Having spent a good deal of time in my EQ career playing almost everyclass, SK is the one I enjoy most.  I can solo, or group depending on how long I have to be on or my mood.<br />
If you are soloing, there will be downtime no matter what class you play.  Group downtime will be dependant on group make-up, and what you are killing, so it will variy in every situation.<br />
I cannot say for you if you will enjoy the SK class, but I love it.  I did get fustrated for a time with it, learning how to play the class (and still have more to learn) dieing while pulling indoors, splitting caster mobs, etc.  But now that I have a basic grasp it is becoming easier for me.  From the other classes I have played SK was/is the hardest to learn, but the most enjoyable I have played.<br />
On the matter of recruting more SK's.  I wouldn't try.  There are to many people that have played another non-similar class that think they know everything there is to know, therfore do not learn the SK class.  The constantly do stupid things, and thus give the good SK's out there a bad rep.  For every great SK I have every watched, I have seen 10-20 Horriable ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sepcieulus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Originally posted by mshmcm <br />
so what I am asking is for some current SKs to tell me why they enjoy their char  <br />
<br />
Aggro control, Tanking, FD, Debuffs(that buff your self), snare (darkness line), cast your own proc, invis, eb/lev (bobbing corpse), you get a pet (more like a small DoT and useful in various situations if used wizely), summon corpse, hide, harmshield (18sec invulnerability), lifetaps, spears, the torrent line (mob debuff, group buff), fear, killing the guards in Misty thicket and Rivervale.<br />
<br />
Many many reasons I enjoy playing an SK ... but they can be summed up in 3 words:<br />
<br />
Survivability, Versatility, Evilness<br />
<br />

I wouldn’t even try. I’d try to convince them to play clerics, shaman, and chanters. (more peeps to buff and heal).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Warscout</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">First of all your an Ex-Warrior so i dont want you to play an SK at all you will only mess it up and then mess me up. First you will Twink yourself like a warrior and ignore your birthright to casting. Then at level 52 you will have your very first apifany, learn to incorporate spells correctly, figure out that you now have the slipperyness of a monk combined with the damage mitogation of a warrior (yes thats correct we are on the same mitogation scale) the DPS of a ranger and the agro management of a paladin only takeing a 5% penilty on damage avoidance over a warrior and you will shout it from the roof tops in every zone you cross on a god damned hot key and get me nerfed. <br />
<br />
If there isnt any way i can convence you to go try a ranger, then my best sugestion to you is this.<br />
<br />
1) pick a race that is as far removed from a warrior as you can go, this will FORCE you to rely on your magic and will help you unlearn what you did as a warrior.<br />
<br />
2) set a requirement for yourself and put a common standered on your gear selection. Dont twink with any piece of gear that doesnt complment your mana pool. if you see a 60ac mask with 500 HPs on it toss it in the trash for a 7ac 30HP 30 mana mask untill you have learned to respect your full range of abilitys.<br />
<br />
3) look at your current circle of influance on your server, figure out if you know any grand master traidsmen. I knew both a grand master erudite Tailor and a grand master human smith, so i looked at human made cultural and erudite cultural, erudite was much much easyer to farm so i am an erudite with a full suit of cultural i payed less than 10k to have made and i have been useing it sence 45. Any of the cultural will give you a 1200 unffed AC and 600 to 1k additional HPs and mana its everything you need as an SK and its cheep unless your buying it in the bazaar.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jodgrim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">4) Don't listen to Warscout. He just wrote a huge pile of steamy crap and has no idea what he is talking about.<br />
<br />
The real secret to choosing the right race for you is looks and play style. If you are a power gamer then pick which ever one looks the best to you. If you aren't a power gamer pick which ever one that looks the best to you. If looks don't matter then pick one with a high INT if you plan to solo, or pick one with high melee stats if you plan to group.<br />
<br />
The only thing that matters in this game is that you are having a good time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>chardrok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">heh, if you can stand all the abuse here, then you're cut from the sk cloth.  get busy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Rugs Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Cause im a melee that can feign death, invis instantly and kill something with dots while my shitty pet hits it for 50s.<br />
<br />
If all a SK could do is FD, snare, and tank...i would still be one and be able to do things no other class can.<br />
<br />
All the other spells and crap is just bonus IMO.<br />
<br />
On a different note: I think you would enjoy a monk =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Bruiser Bigins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">some of my friends made a sk after playing with me for awhile.  shadowknights are pretty self sufficient class.  you can invis yourself, if in trouble you can fd and you won't die, you can cast leviate on yourself if you need to float, you can also cast endure breath spell if you want to explore under water dungeons...you have spells so its not just a pure melee.  however the life of a sk is not easy, we are hated most of the old world, we get exp penalty (before you flame here, I 2 box a halfling cleric and my sk, and my cleric beat my ogre with an entire level from 61 to 65).  when grouping you can play tank, puller, simple dps...whatever needed.<br />
<br />
so, if you want a sk, try it...if you like it, you can stick with it..if not...life goes on and try a different class.  <br />
<br />
downside is that at low levels really won't know what a sk can do...I think we get fd at lvl 32 or so and invis is about that level as well...so, you won't be a real sk until lvl 32 at least, and your real power will come once you get to 65 and get a bunch of aas...but perhaps you enjoy different things then me and you find playing lower level chars more fun....so, good luck with the sk class, you migth make it..hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Greggthegrmreapr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Originally posted by Bruiser Bigins <br />
 we get exp penalty (before you flame here, I 2 box a halfling cleric and my sk, and my cleric beat my ogre with an entire level from 61 to 65). <br />
<br />
i think this was the ogre race penalty... the class penalties were removed as far as i know...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Daywalka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">And Halflings get a exp bonus, right? And I take it that you are saying that by two-boxing your exp bonused Cleric and your exp penaltied SK, that the difference was only one level by the time you hit 65? If that's so, that doesn't seem like a whole hell of a lot of an experience penalty.<br />
<br />
Anyway, pick Erudite. Why? Cuz if you type &quot;/who Shadow Erudite all&quot; , you'll be on a list of 5 people tops, and 3 of them will be bazaar mules because they look cool. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Wickett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Sk is my choice of class because even a pussy little gnome (as seen below) can smack the ugly out of any mob :D <br />
<br />
Show me another class that can do that...</div></div><hr />
