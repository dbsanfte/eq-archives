<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Souldor Dvi'Tokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Aside from the fact that I spent 24 hours in Charaisis, the bracer finally dropped.  What happens?  I get trained by some feg newb, die, and lost my bracer  :( <br />
<br />
I wanted to let you guys know that the mob that dropped it was The Crypt Excavator...which is really weird.<br />
<br />
Anyway, going to bed, pissed off and depressed.  Gotta spend even more in that fugbo zone.<br />
<br />
Hope this information helps some of you guys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Astaren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">When I camped my bracer, I kept the back two rooms of golems clear forever and it never dropped.  My friend decided to kill the random trash near the beginning of the east wing, just b/c there was one or two golems up when I plowed through.  The bracer dropped twice in a span of two hours (I missed the first b/c I was afk watching a crappy ass movie in between repops of my mobs).  Like the first 10 mobs in the east wing CAN spawn as golems, and it seems that the drop rate is much greater from them.  Someone give it a shot and let me know if they get it relatively quickly, b/c I am never going back to that shit zone ever again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Souldor Dvi'Tokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Friend of mine just got one in 30 minutes, that lucky bastard.<br />
<br />
No, actually two of them.<br />
<br />
2 Morticious(spwhatever) Golems were up at East Wing.  One before the Venril Picture, one after it.  they both dropped one.<br />
<br />
Seems either luck or a better drop rate</div></div><hr />
