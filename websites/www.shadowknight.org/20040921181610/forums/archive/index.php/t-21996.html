<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I did a search regarding ST and came up with a couple posts, the most recent was a couple months old; and rather than resurrect that one, I'd like to ask quickly here.<br />
<br />
Our small family guild of Ornate/LDoN geared toons would like to hit ST for possible Prismatic weapons.  We are just starting to get keys.  The plan is to get a half dozen of us (melee/hybrid) some Prismatics and then be done with it.  Other quests, loot drops, etc. we generally have no interest in.<br />
<br />
What is the minimum force necessary for a first scouting mission / test foray into the zone?  Do yard trash / ent mobs have a chance to drop Prismatic, or only named mobs?<br />
<br />
None of us in the guild have ever set foot in there.  Basically all we know is that most mobs have a ton of hp; but anything else we have no clue.  We were planning to have perhaps myself (SK), clr, rog, rng, bst plus one more give it a try when we have 6 keyed.  On the other hand, our entire guild is only ~12 peeps with, naturally, most casters not terribly interested but willing to support.<br />
<br />
For example, if we were to zone in with a group once a day and kill a couple mobs and zone out (this is, assuming we are capable of even that), do we eventually stand a chance to get some weapon drops, or do they only drop off named and we should stop keying now?<br />
<br />
I realize Prismatic isn't the best around these days, but oddly enough a 2 hander would be an upgrade for me but downgrade for mostly everyone else (proc aside, just the weapon).<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for thoughts / input / recommendations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Woot a topic i know about! heh my guild is currently keying for st. I wish i had numbers in my head to offer but last outing to ST was actually about a year ago. Lets see...<br />
<br />
Well first primals only drop off 7 named mobs in the zone that are on 1 week spawn times. MoTG, Prog, FA, 4 ancient dragons. Each name drops up to 2 primals, i think the entrance named (motg + prog) can also jew you and drop crappy caster books instead of primals rarely. The 4 ancient dragons drop 2 primals + 2 loots or so i think.<br />
<br />
If the rest of your guild is as well geared as you and as skilled I imagine you could handle MoTG and Prog. MoTG is a vindi type fight with add's that spawn and run to assist the MoTG until he is killed or so. What i remember of this encounter you have MT war tank MOTG ch chain on him and have 2 off tanks tank adds and burn the add's down, multiple add's spawn im thinking it like 6 of them will spawn before you kill MoTG, i used to do this encounter with 18 members mostly 65 but mostly wearing bazaar gear. He's the first named and is like a good 1 min run to but to clear the mobs around him takes like a good 30mins i think. Wiped on him our first attempt i think.<br />
<br />
Prog is behind MoTG, supposedly he is supposed to come with lots of little adds but all the times i did him a guild monk was able to single pull him. He's a vindi type fight never wiped on him. War mt tanks cheal rot does their job everyone else dps.<br />
<br />
Now the other 5 mobs are in deep inside ST as such most guilds park a CoH mule their to coh the raid to them i think supposedly it takes like 2 hours or so to clear to the coh spot if you dont use a coh mule. As a small guild i dont imagine you guys having a coh mule for this so suggest you just stick to the first 2 named. Though most of the real primal farming comes from the dragons.<br />
<br />
FA = identical to Prog fight cheal rot+mt+dps easy.<br />
<br />
4 ancient dragons each have different Aoe's what i remember of them they were worse then Lendi but not as bad as Sonti. Excluding the 4th dragon who unresistable AOE slowed. Though due to the Aoe i dont think doing them with less then 18 is a good idea.<br />
<br />
Resists were really high in ST i remember, like dragons i think most were DR/PR immune and i think also had high MR FR and CR to the point that non lures weren't very useful. I think the golems and garg's (fa,prog, motg and trash) had just high resists in general i remember casting AuraoHate on guildies rather then on the guards due to the resist rates for instance. Anyways hope this helps i honestly have some of the fondest raiding memories in ST.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xanathol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">IIRC, I think you should be fine for a couple of nameds. Nameds drop the weaps, and you can pull the first 2 to zone in ( never left it myself ). Yes, they have a ton of HP, but with about 3? groups there we were never in any danger last I went; was more time consuming than anything else. Maybe someone who's more familiar with the zone can help you more, but IMO, it was cake.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rackasaur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Last time I went we cleared all of ST with 16 people level 65 , not geared particularily well (ToV + some raiding) but really, I dunno if I would say its worth it to bother keying up for it. <br />
<br />
Probably better to work on something that will give you more in return - VT or EP's .<br />
<br />
-=Rackasaur=-</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Menon Lifeblight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You can one-group the first two named with decent bazaar gear.  I'd zone in once/week, get a couple primals, and then zone out.  No reason to waste time fighting back to the ancients if you want to equip a total of 6 people.<br />
<br />
Good hunting, Klotar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tomic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you really want to do MoTG with just 6 there is a lot easier way than dealing with the adds and him at the same time.  <br />
<br />
MoTG has 8 untargetable mobs that come alive during the fight of MoTG.  Once he is pulled,  every 30 seconds 2 will charge the raid, zone wide agro, that kind of thing.  So MoTG, who doens't have zone wide agro, were to be kited for 30 seconds,  and then the kiter happens to FD and MoTG goes back to his spawn point,  2 of his protectors are gone.  Don't use darkness or dmg to pull for obvious reasons.  After he is back at spawn point,  go back to group and help kill the protectors.  You will have to kite MoTG for longer times each time since each set of mobs is on the 30 second timer,  so a min for the next set,  then kite for 1.5 min for next set,  then 2 min finally.  It might be longer than 1.5 and 2,  but i usually zone out while running around in circles.   MoTG himself is resistant and when you finally pull him,  keep dark/fd till it lands and then kite him around in circles till all the debuffs are in.  We used to do him frequently with myself,  and a war/wiz/chanter/shaman/cleric. <br />
<br />
The way prog is pulled single is he has like 10 mini mobs that are right in front of him.  Just agro the front mobs, and pull them down to the big room and have.  another person pull Prog once the little ones are clear.e usually move into the room up the left ramp and opposite of progenitor.  We added in a bard and another cleric to kill prog as he puts out more dmg.  can't remember if he's not slowable is the reason or what.    Only killed him once since we did the majority of the farming with just 2 people 3 boxing. <br />
<br />
I would suggest only doing these guys as taking your casters through an entire ST raid will get you no casters at your next raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Belyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If coh still works in that zone get a mage bot keyed up and put him down by the 4 dragons permanently.  Once a week ya zone in and kill the dragons quick and leave.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Leafweir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">First run my guild ever did on ST back in the day I dragged a mage corpse down to the FInal Arbitor and Vox sticked it. We did the Warders with 18 at 60 and no AA, you could prolly manage em with alot less now. The Ancients drop some nifty toys other than primals, if you work up 12 keys for the entire guild and head down there you could have some fun. Dragging is a tad harder now but still doable, 18 seconds at a time if you hvae to (Harmshield) have a necro follow ya if you don't have a Vox stick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sithanator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Probably best for 2 groups for MoTG and Prog.  Milas in the library can be rough on 2 groups at that level. FA is vindi, and dragons are pretty easy. With Prog I always opened the door shot him with an arrow, would only aggro 1 of the little guys standing in front of him and those little ones are mezzable.  If your just going to kill Prog and MoTG, I would recommend hitting the Overseer. He drops priceless(forget new name for them). The Overseer is a step between the trash mobs and MoTD/Prog. You spawn him by clearing the balcany (takes about 15 minutes clearing and killing him). When my guild went through there alot of war's liked getting the priceless to use when not tanking, the 2hb can make nice caster toys too.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>cames</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I would start with the MoTG and Progenitor if I were you.  Once I could clear those easily then I would ponder how to get to the other mobs.<br />
<br />
Master of the Guard (MoTG) use the FD method described.  You raid has to be able to handle two mobs at once anyway, since the first doorway has two guards behind it.  These aggro pretty much as you open the door (my suggestion stay FD if you form raid inside, some moron will aggro them).  I had him double aggro me one 1 pull and he loosed 4 guards.  If so, just flop down till it all resets.<br />
<br />
Progenitor is an easier fight.  His guards can be pacified.  Then pull him and walk him in the little halls outside his room.<br />
<br />
From that point, we had a necro + monk + SoS rogue pull a CoH mage (who was then necro rezzed) to above the Final Arbitor (FA).  This was tricky and the necro died twice doing it.  However, once there you then have 5 named mobs with just a couple of wanderers to clear.<br />
<br />
FA is the same fight as the Progenitor.<br />
<br />
The Ancients are straightforward fights.  You can use the gate area right behind the FA to park them so that casters can avoid the AE.  Read up on their AEs, some of them are quite nasty.<br />
<br />
If you are just interested in Prismatics, I would just do the MoTG and Prog.  The ancients drop a couple of interesting pieces (my back slot is an ST drop).  One thing.  Caster loot in ST sucks.  They will be POed after a while about this and not want to go there.<br />
<br />
We used to do this with 14 folks.  The ancients were touchy fights with this number.  The others not bad.  As for a ton of HPs, these are not close to say VT mobs.</div></div><hr />
