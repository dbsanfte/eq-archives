<br />
Due to the increased costs of running the EverQuest game service, we will be increasing our subscription rates in April. Effective April 25, the new monthly subscription rate will be $12.95/month. We will continue to offer discounts from the new rate plan on multi-month subscriptions. You don’t have to do a thing; you will automatically be migrated to the new billing structure under your current subscription plan when your current subscription plan expires.<br />
<br />
New EverQuest rates as of April 25, 2002: <br />
<br />
$12.95 per Month <br />
$35.85 for 3 Months <br />
<br />
$65.70 for 6 Months <br />
HOWEVER, for a limited time only (from April 10 through April 24, 2002), you may extend your current subscription for an additional 12 or 24 months by signing up for the new EQ 12 or 24 month plan – and reap great savings off of the new rates:<br />
<br />
Extend for 12 months for $109 US – and get a 30% discount off of the new monthly rates!<br />
<br />
Extend for 24 months for $190 US – and get a 39% discount off of the new monthly rates!<br />
<br />
Now is the time to lock in these rates, so don’t miss out.<br />
<br />
All pricing plans (except for the 12 and 24 month extension plans) are recurring, meaning you will continue to be billed at the appropriate interval, until you cancel your subscription. Note that purchasers of the full game will receive their free month of game play after supplying valid billing information. If you cancel your subscription during the free month, no charges will be made to your credit card. <br />
<br />
New York State and Texas residents will be charged sales tax. <br />
<br />
All subscription fees will appear on your credit card statement under the heading &quot;SOE*EverQuest&quot;. <br />
<br />
Please note:<br />
<br />
The subscription charges are in addition to the cost of the game. You will need to purchase a copy of the game from a retail store or online at the Station Store. The price of the game will vary depending upon the store.</div></div><hr />
