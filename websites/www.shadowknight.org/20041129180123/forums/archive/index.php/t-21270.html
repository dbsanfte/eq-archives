<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>rosco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I think giving TASHAN line of spells to Sks could solve some issues :<br />
<br />
- TASHAN is great aggro spell. It could replace the broken TERROR line of spells to get aggro fast (due to its Poison counters). It is also a fast and cheap spell to cast<br />
<br />
- Paladins can stun mobs on inc to give slower more time and mitige some damage while locking aggo. With TASHAN Sks would be able to lock aggro fast while allowing slower to slow faster, therefore mitigating damage too.<br />
<br />
- Giving TASHAN to Sks would give them more group utility, and prevent group &quot;tashicides&quot;, because let's face it : no enchanter likes to Tashan early.<br />
<br />
- Eventually, TASHAN is an enchanter-only line of spells. Malo is shared by shamans and mages, so why not share TASHAN with Sks too<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shainaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">we are NOT a freakin utility class.  Stop trying to make us a utility class.  stop trying to give devs any more ideas about us being a utility class.  we are, have been and always will be KILLERS.  we should be Mana-focused/weapon based DPS melee.  Period.  Take any thoughts of utility for us and cram it in a dark hole and leave it there.  Sony fuggered us up by trying to introduce utility into our class and it did nothing but screw us up and put us in the position we are today...  fucked.  :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kahntun Derstand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">While I don't think the idea would be plauseable, I also don't think we should rip on people for trying to come up with ideas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rajak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well, that was imaginative anyway.<br />
<br />
With all the heated arguments they're resisting about giving us a piece of the warrior pie.....which the class is bonded to, I don't quite think they'd go so far out of the box to dole out unrelated spell lines......<br />
<br />
And if your tempted to say create one, remember what happened with the aggro line......<br />
<br />
Put your hands in the air and step away from the idea.........</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ashrai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">- TASHAN is great aggro spell. It could replace the broken TERROR line of spells to get aggro fast (due to its Poison counters). It is also a fast and cheap spell to cast <br />
<br />
Um I already have a fast and cheap spell to get agro. If you're using Terrors as your primary agro spell then you have worse problems than the rest of us.<br />
<br />
Also, what then would you suggest you use to get MORE agro than the chanter who just Tashed? <br />
<br />
- Paladins can stun mobs on inc to give slower more time and mitige some damage while locking aggo. With TASHAN Sks would be able to lock aggro fast while allowing slower to slow faster, therefore mitigating damage too. <br />
<br />
SKs can get agro on incoming too. If your slower can't slow on inc then again your problems don't stem from your lack of spells.<br />
<br />
- Giving TASHAN to Sks would give them more group utility, and prevent group &quot;tashicides&quot;, because let's face it : no enchanter likes to Tashan early. <br />
<br />
Enchanters who play with good SKs don't worry about early Tash.<br />
<br />
- Eventually, TASHAN is an enchanter-only line of spells. Malo is shared by shamans and mages, so why not share TASHAN with Sks too <br />
<br />
Sure. And let's give your FD to Pallies since you're so into &quot;sharing&quot; without any logic behind it.<br />
<br />

I'd go one step further than banning, I'd force you to reroll as a Druid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Chayde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I am an SK, I play this class because after playing a cleric for many years, it was a nice break. I did not pick this class because I wanted some Enchanter spells. I did not pick this class because I wanted to be well liked. I picked this class because I wanted to jump into the battle, keep mobs off shaman and chanters, peel away the mobs from an incompetent toon who grabbed aggro for some silly reason, and many other qualities the SK class can bring to a group.<br />
<br />
I don't want everyone to share everyone elses spell lines. SKs should not be able to SoW, Mez, Tash, Complete Heal, Port.. or any of the other classes special skills.<br />
<br />
<br />
I know I don't post anything that ever makes sense, and as someone pointed out that I usually make stupid remarks... but I don't think this is a good idea, and just because I don't know how to express what exactly it is I want to say.... it just comes out in text all wrong =o(, doesn't mean I don't know what I am doing. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If everyone's ideas went live... we would all be one super-class and it would be extremely boring.</div></div><hr />

What I've gotten out of the board?  SK utility is a myth on par with Elvis sightings, quality airline food and stress-free relationships.  There is very little there that potions and easily accessable equipment can't replace.</div></div><hr />

Must not have been untwinked/unguilded during Early velious or before, we have never been death walking<br />

We were pretty fierce the first couple months after release.</div></div><hr />

I'll remember that every time I look at the Reclaim Energy in the back of my spellbook. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The one interesting thing that this bad idea brought to mind was that maybe Aura of Darkness could use some work still. Perhaps a better resist check mod. than -75 DR, and maybe allowing its group recourse to land in the short buff box.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Draxious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'd rather have the ability to make the mobs stunned and FD with my resounding flatulence.  =)<br />
<br />
Now there's a unique skill which no other class would be fighting us for.  <br />
<br />
&quot;You fart in the general direction of a Doomfire Wizard&quot;<br />
<br />
Drax<br />
<br />
P.S. Ogres and Trolls would have a racial advantage in this skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Arikash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Gnomes could force things into a stupor by showing them how they become a tripod....<br />
<br />
Look, we're getting racial abilities now!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Dkhar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Yea, was thinking that Aura of Darkness kinda is our Tashan spell. It is only -10 to all resists but gives back -30 resists to all group members. Not a bad spell. I use it while pulling sometimes when we have a shammy instead of a chanter and I have some time to bring the mob to camp. Usually in PoV Outter camp or something where it's a longer pull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Darkenesis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Nein</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Shainaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Must not have been untwinked/unguilded during Early velious or before, we have never been death walking <br />
<br />
Born Vallon December 99.  Yes, pre-velious.  yes untwinked.  Deposit all assumptions at the wasted space in front of your keyboard.  <br />
<br />
thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Maybe a &quot;Mana-focused/weapon based DPS melee&quot; approach would be better off with SCF3 instead of Innate Stamina 5 though, 'Killer'...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Dkhar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">We can always use my idea. <br />

Merchant Shredder says &quot;Welcome to my shop Grulknar, it looks like you could really use a used tampon&quot;!<br />
<br />
pap pap pap pap pap pap pap pap pap pap!!<br />
Merchant Shredder is dead!<br />
You gain experience.<br />
<br />
You say &quot;On second thought... damn&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Shainaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">thanks for analysing my magey Dykk but atm my HP and defensive aa's are more important then going from scf2 to 3.  Tanking and Offtanking have higher precedence by necessity<br />
<br />
Once you have finished picking that nit, feel free to post your magelo.  but of course now that i have said something i half expect you to post a bullshit fake magy... but hey whatever helps boost your ego.  regardless, until then you can place your comments in your wasted space as well.  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />
