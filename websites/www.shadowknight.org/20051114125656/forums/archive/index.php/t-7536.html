<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maniacles</div><div class="date">10-27-2002, 02:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dunno, I just had this odd non sk related thought, wanted to share, and didn't have anywhere to put it.....<br />
<br />
I always wondered why there wasn't an anti ranger the way that the sk is an anti paladin.....While too late for eq....perhaps in eq2, the TRADER class could be that class....hunting animals for their furs....ruining ecosystems with the runnoff from mines to get ore....clearcutting forests to stock their bakeries.....summoning elementals as cheap labor.....That would be the theme...<br />
<br />
Their spell line would use a lot of components that dropped off mobs....or create reagents that were used in other classes spells...they'd have buffs that had side effects of reducing faction with natural critters while on....<br />
<br />
Their weapons would all be clicky and procky.  They'd get all the anti summon and control summoned spell line.  They'd get access to all class/race based trade skills like tinkering, poison making, and alchemy.  <br />
<br />
Their nukes would be powerfull, but long recast (this is my BOOM stick), And in the form of summoned items with charges that used reagents which were also summoned.  (the spell which summoned the item would have long recast time, while the time to use the charge and damage amount and type would be dependent on the item).  <br />
<br />
They'd have a version of charm which only worked vs sentient critters and had higher and higher cost gems as reagent (How much is your boss paying you? I already love the possible names for this &quot;spell&quot; line: Fasttalk, bribe, extort, blackmail.....).  <br />
<br />
Of course, a horse would be one of their class aa skills....and cart....<br />
<br />
Clearly they'd be hybrid magician/rogue, much like the bard is hybrid chanter/rogue.  But the playable races would be gnomes, dwarves, and humans.  Perhaps dark elves, half elves, and erudites as well (heck, if paladins are erudite warriors, Merchants would be erudite rogues).<br />

They have the animal control/tracking skills, they just use em for evil. Hell, With all the Rangers who go around mass-slaughtering animals for exp, you could almost call a good portion of the rangers in game &quot;anti-rangers&quot; from a strict RP Point. :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
That would imply that he's doing it on purpose!<br />
<br />
The name of this class is clearly the Merchant!<br />
<br />
It's not that he's &quot;trying&quot; to kill the environment, it's just that he doesn't care.  Ok, maybe the dark elves are...but....<br />
<br />
As everyone who played in the first year knows, Merchants were badasses!<br />
<br />
Though, despoiler wouldn't be too bad.....</div></div><hr />

<br />
This class would be great if you could alter the environment.  Imagine being able to set up toll booths at zone lines (oh the piles of corpses without correct change) or imagine being able to cut down all the trees in Greater Faydark (personally, I always figured one match could wipe out all the wood elves).  Maybe Merchants could buy xp, so they don't have to kill stuff and can just focus on business.</div></div><hr />

This kind of individuals use the same tools and share the same abilities with the plain old regular rangers. One could say its only a difference of alignements. They developped skills and abilities relative to their jobs, which are exacly the same even if they actually use them to do the opposite.<br />
<br />
<br />
Paladins and Shadowknights on the other hand are religious fanatics and have been gifted their powers from the gods they worship.<br />
<br />
For the people who have gods who can gift their people of both clerical and necromancer powers, their knights should have the ability to use either (it should be possible to have Dark Elven Knights whorshipping Innoruuk but using Clerics spells like the regular paladins). The Akhevans can be both Paladins and Shadowknights, yet worship the same evil deity. This is an ability that should be shared with the CT-Erudites, Inny-DE and Bertox/Inny-Human/Gnomes imho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Poxy</div><div class="date">10-28-2002, 10:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have always thought there should be a class called Poacher, as an anti-ranger.<br />
<br />
Either a Rogue/Range or Rogue/Shammy/Ranger hybrid<br />
<br />
I do not know if I would make them a magic class, but if I did I would think they would be int casters using debuff/poison/concealment spells from the shammy line. (yeah, I know Shammys are wis caster/ but what the hey). If made a caster, diety restricted to the 'evil' god line.<br />
<br />
Rogue skills- Sneak, hide Evade. Make posion, use posion, sense and disarm traps, dual wield<br />
<br />
Ranger skills- tracking, archery bonuses<br />
<br />
Maybe a class specific skill called Ambush.. bonuses when striking from concealment?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Poxy</div><div class="date">10-28-2002, 11:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">thinking on it...<br />
<br />
no magic at all, instead that ambush skill... an incremental chance, based on skill level, that a range attack will NOT break sneak/hide<br />
<br />
AND<br />
<br />
a class specific toolsbox and recipes that allow a poacher to manufacture poisoned arrows, rather than the rogue skill that temporarily 'poisons' a specific weapon slot for one time use.<br />
<br />
:chuckle:<br />
<br />
and since we are dreaming.. wouldn't it be cool if you could manufacture snares? little DoT/Debuff packages that you can drop on the ground (looking like all those little bags).. a mob runs over it and they set it off, or a pc picks it up and it goes off.<br />
<br />
I can see it now on PvP servers... Greedy enemy player sees bag of goodies on ground, Picks it up<br />
<br />
:YOU have been Snared:<br />
:You are hit for 20 non-melee damage<br />
:An arrow pierces your side from an unseen attacker</div></div><hr />

Who do Unkempt Druids worship anyway?<br />
Personally i'd like a lot more religious conflict in game storywise, i think it adds to the flavour. I can understand that the dev's probably throw their hands up in horror about the problems deity-specific quests and items create, but i think they add spice to the game.<br />
As to Luclin (that's who the Akhevans worship right?) is she actually evil? Or just neutral? If she's neutral that would be an explanation why Akhevans can be both sk's and paladins, whereas Innoruuk and CT only inspire sk's. <br />
I still think Barbarian Bards are the most obvious race/class combo that's missing.</div></div><hr />

The EQ world is in need for another &quot;evil&quot; class.  But instead of magic and such, I think the class should be able to focus on the ever present topic of &quot;Technology Vs. Magic&quot; in a lot of fantasy role-playing.<br />
<br />
For example,  like how rangers are supposed to be &quot;masters of the bow and arrow&quot;.  This anti-ranger should be able to use guns, at least primitive guns like matchlocks or an arquebus.  If guns are too much of a stretch, have them use semi-automatic crossbows (yes, they did exist, the Chinese made them and they were called chu-ko-nu).<br />
They could make big steel bear traps with a toolbox, and drop them on the ground when you are being chased or when you are pulling.  I think this class would be such an awesome idea!<br />
<br />
And are there such things as Rangers that RP anymore?  I don't think there rangers out there that *won't* kill animals.  Same goes with beastlords too (well, maybe not Ogre/troll BL's..).</div></div><hr />

<br />
on topic...<br />
<br />
I used to run a D&amp;D pen and paper campaign and all my friends always played evil characters, so rather than waste several good classes i made neutral and evil counterparts to most of them<br />
<br />
Death Ranger was the evil ranger<br />
<br />
They only had power over vermin and filthy creatures, worshiped the god of disease and death, enjoyed killing for sport, combat and magic skills were similar to regular rangers</div></div><hr />

There's this &quot;Aragorn&quot; guy that some people think is fairly famous too.<br />
<br />

<br />
Salvatore is a decent writer, but the Drizzt books are utter garbage.  He runs across the problem that you can't really depict a fully CE &quot;society&quot; as such.  He gave it a good go, but the Drow society ended up too organzied, in order to keep the story moving in a coherent fashion. Of course, it's difficult to conceive of a lasting society that is totally chaotic, and most of the worst evils in modern history were very lawful and organized, but I digress. I'm not even going to discuss how utterly annoying Catti Brie was.<br />
<br />
Personally, if they allowed DE rangers, I'd be really really disappointed.  I know Dark Elves are a degenerate race that have been tainted by their close proximity to the humans, and are smart enough to make decisions about being evil (but most still prefer it), so from a RP perspective it makes sense.  But I'd go crazy seeing Nekutlos forest overrun with &quot;Drizzzzzt&quot;, &quot;Drizztx&quot;, &quot;Dryzzt&quot;, &quot;Dhrizzt&quot; and 10 thousand other variations of that name.  Just like I personally hated seeing every stupid dark elf wizard that thought he was the shiznit because he got a creative misspelling of Raistlin through the name generator.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure I liked when they added muskets to AD&amp;D, but the concept of an evil ranger or druid makes a certain amount of sense. For every wise noble strider of the woods, for every druid indifferent to all but their preserve, there's a crotchety old bastard that will blast anyone that sets foot in his forest. Toxic shaman for you shadowrun types. Bertoxx would be a perfect god for the toxic ranger.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Big nuke, long recast, uses reagents (bullets), (rifle)<br />
Summoned item (long summon time) with a few charges of clicky nuke, uses reagents.  (pistol)<br />
Summon an item that is used in other character's spells (chemist).<br />
Buffs that poison the environment as a side effect.<br />
Slight bonus to poison resistance.</div></div><hr />
