<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>sofa_king_we_todd_it</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">anyone know of a good place to hunt that is on luclin, either for grouping or soloing?<br />
<br />
besides the bazaar and some dawnshroud, I never really went there, just interested if it was worthwhile somewhere.<br />
<br />
Hard to find good groups in the planes...unless I can a PoV group or something...<br />
<br />
any info would be good.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Amphitryon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">at 56, id say you can still gets some halfway decent XP in Scarlet Desert (on the plateau) or in The Grey.<br />
<br />
Katta guards could be good for you too.<br />
<br />
I learned to avoid Maidens Eye, the mobs are too hard for the dribble of XP they give.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Oberyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">...Katta Guards along the walkways.  Endless targets, easy kills, should take you to 60 fast.<br />
<br />
Once 60, if you are still playing in Luclin, get your DR way up, and solo pull some shrooms in FG:)  Bank is nice and close, as is Nexus if you get called to do something.<br />
<br />
I never found ME worth the XP, personally.  <br />
<br />
Akheva can be ok too, with care, once you break the 60 barrier.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>kassdax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'll have to second the lousy xp in Maidens Eye. However, there is some fairly decent loot to be had in ME. Here's a small portion of what a SK can use from there.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kalendrox Grimblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Keep in mind that most of the loot listed above dosent drop off anything you can solo.<br />
<br />
Fear kiting the shissar behind the temple in The Grey is probably best to get to 60, assuming the pathing is still buggy there.  Use panic the dead, saves mana.  You'll probably have to pet-kite any named you get, but there is plenty of space.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Excessium</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Noticed you are level 56 atm. Just De-level to 55, and solo KC for AA exp. <br />
If you do this, a great thing will happen...Next time you do an LDON, your group will think you are the uberest of the uber level 55 toon alive! I shit you not.  ;)</div></div><hr />
