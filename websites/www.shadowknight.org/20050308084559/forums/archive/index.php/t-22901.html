<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nytmare Bloodrose</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Rumor has it the combines were meant to be no fail and will be changed to reflect this wednesday, but wouldn't be the first time SoE crapped out on us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>The Zenogias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Was there a hidden update or something today?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">A dev made a post on I think the necro forums.  The combine will be no fail, but you'll need 160+ to attempt the combine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Eitsekur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Patch was pushed back a day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kendril D</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Was a patch today, and i did the combine with the skill of 113, and the trivial must of been before that because it said i could not raise my skill on this item anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">After patch on 23 Sept 04<br />
<br />
If you attempt to combine items with a skill lower then 160 (Im guessing its that since peeps said that was trivial message and some dev posted on necro forms):<br />
<br />
You will get the following message:<br />
<br />
You are too inexperienced at your craft to even attempt this combination.<br />
<br />
NO items are lost. It simply doesnt even try the combine.<br />
(Yes I got fed up with Tailoring (78) and said fuck it. I would much rather camp items again then do fucking ghey ass trades) <br />
<br />
Anyways 160 or bust</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ilvai Oloth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I did my combine this morning at 193 tailoring, no sweat.  No clue on SOE with the patch though. :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rukog DethBryngr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">OK - Kendril and Gaxx seem to be giving conflicting information.<br />
<br />
Did you get the message Gaxx posted and mistook it for the &quot;cannot raise skill&quot; message, Kendril?  Did your combine at 113 actually work?<br />
<br />
Something's not adding up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Chanaluss Neiton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i combined mine successfully at 128 skill, claiming trivial</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kendril D</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yes, i did the combine successfully at 113 skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Rukog DethBryngr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Then the actual trivial must be between the 78 Gaxx tried it at and was denied (and then assumed it was 160) and the 113 Kendril was sucessful at.<br />
<br />
That's assuming Kendril wasn't using a modifier.  Or maybe the minimum skill check doesn't even take mods into consideration.<br />
<br />
Either way, it looks like the 160 isn't necessary.  Just don't know what it is yet...but something around 100 shouldn't be TOO hard to get, right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kendril D</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yes i used a 5% mod, my skill wasnt 113 without the mod, but when i put the mod on it was 113, and yes 100 is easy to get and i would say 100+= No fail.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Cause im a krazy mofo this was result:<br />
<br />
Tailoring 107 (listed skill) then add +5% geerlock = Successful combine. Trivial message was given.<br />
<br />
So it appears that they lowered th required skill caps to complete the combine.<br />
<br />
This attempted after 23-Sept-04 patch to live.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Thaln V'Orro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">So is the combine indeed no fail now?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Majingoku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">i did it at 129 today and it was trivial.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>frotty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">112, triv, no mods, success.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>vex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Can you tell me WHY sk's need to know tailoring and necros need to know smithing for their epics? Does this seem backwards to you?!<br />
<br />
Grr.<br />
(250 smith btw, 1 tailoring, weee.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>PokenHopen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">If you want to complain about something, take a look at the beastlord epic 1.5...<br />
<br />
<br />
all mobs till last one are slowable and hit between 600 and 700 and last one has a ae and hits for 800ish(spawns with 5 adds that hit for 600ish everything is slowable).<br />
<br />
Looks like they looked back to epic 1 for making them the same dificulty from class to class.<br />
<br />
I will probably help my fiance with her epic and trio most of it(1.5) and last one will need a few groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Iosif_McCloud</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Heheh im almost crazy enuf to give it a shot at Skill level 66 just to see what happens.. i hate this skilling up crap</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Nytmare Bloodrose</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Lowest Min skill for the NO FAIL combine I've found is 105 without a gerlock. So have no fear, Mandrake root - Crystalline silk to get from 0-105 in 45 mins.</div></div><hr />
