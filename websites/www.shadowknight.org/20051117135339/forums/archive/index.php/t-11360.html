You have to be stupid for this to happen. The same type of people who go to the beach to watch an incoming Tsunami.</div></div><hr />

<br />
and how the fuck do you die in a cock sucking snow storm? it's snow, lots of it, it's cold. maybe homeless crack heads died? oh no! why do they even tally that shit.<br />
<br />
well i guess people coulda died in car wrecks or something, still i'm sure it was mostly hobos.</div></div><hr />

When a homeless person asks you for change do you turn around and kick them in the balls too?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nnod</div><div class="date">02-20-2003, 02:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">what kind of moron dies in a snow storm? maybe a crazy Alaskan snow storm that goes on for 6 months, sure. but three days of snow in DC? oh NO! not that! might have to shovel some snow! :eek:  oh the horror! <br />
<br />
If I am dumb enough to go out in that shit and die, I'd say the world is well rid of me. Darwin Awards anyone?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kebsis</div><div class="date">02-20-2003, 07:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only people who died in that storm were 1)homeless people who were too stoned to find the bus terminal, 2) people who got into car wrecks and 3) old people who got lost on the way home.<br />
<br />
But ya know what, homeless crackheads and old people die all the time, and people get into car wrecks pretty frequently too.  But its only once in a blue moon that I have to shovel through 2 to 4 feet of snow.<br />
<br />
Not only that but my moms car broke down in the driveway during the storm, trapping my car and my brothers car in the driveway.  Leaving only my fathers car to be shared between the four of us until the snowbanks on either side of my driveway melt enough for the towtruck to get in and take the car.<br />
<br />
Bah, if I had real shadowknight powers I would cast disease cloud on the weather man, and give him horrible cramps until he agreed to change the weather back to normal.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">truc</div><div class="date">02-20-2003, 07:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">no compasion for homeless people. i've only talked to a few that serriously weren't drunks. but the ones that aren't drunks or junkies are crazy, so what else are they going to do? is it my responsibility to support some other fuck's bad habbits? i don't particularly care, i just give them a hard time. some of them are cool and i talk to them. but most of them are just worthless pieces of shit. drunks or junkies. theres a huge meth problem in this area and it fucks up a lot of people..<br />
<br />
so no, i'm a very compasionate person but my compasions is only shared with those whom i feel deserve it. an hobos aint gonna get none.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drakkle</div><div class="date">02-21-2003, 01:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Jesus, it's amazing how no one reads the forum discriptions. Ahem, &quot;Post your rants and unconstructive complaints here&quot;. Notice that word, &quot;unconstructive&quot;. It doesn't have to make sense, have anything to do with important information, or solve world hunger. It's where people post their thoughts on how stupid the world, EQ, people, items, websites and shit is. <br />
<br />
That's why the Flame Board was made! So we can all sit around and bitch, laugh, complain, insult, and whatever else. There, I said it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rezzbagg</div><div class="date">02-21-2003, 01:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well in the Baltimore area there was at least one kid who died who was neither homeless or a crackhead. It was a 4 year old kid, his dad had him outside because he wanted to play in the snow while dad shoveled the car out. Dad was still shovelling, and the kid said he was cold. Dad turned on the car, turned on the heat, and put the kid inside to warm up. Unfortunately he didnt realize that snow was piled up blocking the exhaust pipe, and the kid died of carbon monoxide poisoning in like 10 minutes. Did dad fuck up? Yeah, but you gotta feel sorry for the guy, it seems like an honest enough mistake.<br />
<br />
On a different topic, I remember hearing a comedian, can't remember his name, and it was a long time ago, but he had a bit that went something like this &quot;I'm from Minnesota, we have a program for the homeless....it's called winter.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jodgrim</div><div class="date">02-24-2003, 04:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You guys should be nicer to homeless guys. This one time before I owned a car (part of the reason I got one) I bought a homeless guy some cookies and a 7up while waiting for the buss. As a reward he told me about this secret connection between the movie A Clockwork Orange and the February 1977 Playboy. He told me the reason that he was homeless is becuase he found out about it and the CIA ruined his life.<br />
<br />
Then he told me that there are women on Venus and they are all good looking and none of them have any venereal diseases.</div></div><hr />
