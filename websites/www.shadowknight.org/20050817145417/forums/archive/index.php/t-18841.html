<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zzketza</div><div class="date">12-11-2003, 01:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm looking for some ideas of places worth trying to solo outside the planes at level 61.  I've been doing Nurga, Katta, and the Grey, but want a change of scenery for those times when a LDoN group is impossible to get.  I don't need massive fast exp, but just enough to make it worth hunting in (light blues with a dark blue mix?)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just started Centi's in Ahkeva Ruins - dark blue, not bad, but still learning the timing of the wandering mobs for adds.<br />
<br />
Spiders in Velks, but kiting can be tricky there</div></div><hr />

You don't have to kite those.  I have tanked them solo without much downtime.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ramgar SK</div><div class="date">12-11-2003, 05:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Torgiran Mines are good for me at 63.  Zone in from Nadox and pull em through the secret wall back to zone.  I can get singles if I'm careful.  You should be able to fear kite them from the zone in using short fear.  I usually 2box there and it works nicely.  loot is good and exp is ok.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">natus</div><div class="date">12-12-2003, 11:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I found the lower hall further past where Ramgar kites was way easy.  Not many resisted spells and good fear pathing.  Nice little safe spot to park bones.  If you have very good mana regen you can prolly do all 3 rooms (12 mobs or so) and keep the hallway clear.<br />
<br />
Just watch out for the fake floor in the one hallway and do not attack any of the mobs standing around a small pool behind the small door as they will put the hurt on you.<br />
<br />
Should net you 1 aa or better, depending on mana regen, per kei.  Coin can be ok too if you get lucky with the belt buckles and other small drops.  Lots of cash weapon drops.<br />
<br />
Lineup was DP, Festering, Fear, Ignite, Zevfeer's(this slot flexible), Spear, Pet buff, Tap.  Regular mobs were almost dead by the time festering / ignite wore off.  They like to flee under 20% though so keep that in mind.<br />
<br />
Most common named pop is the Defender.  Can drop a nice priest / caster FT neck that was going for 60k or so last I saw on Lanys.  Common drop is the Defenders Cloak, semi rare is some Defender's something blade, 2 HS.  Can also drop a charm that increases stats with more money you have on you.<br />
<br />
Named are immune to fear so you will have to kite them back and forth in the hallway.  Make sure you have serious agro otherwise your pet will get a beatdown and you will need the pet for all the extra dps you can get.  Named don't hit too hard ( 180ish) but they hit fairly quick so head to head tanking won't work unless you have 6500 hps or so and a bunch of taps memmed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Makkon</div><div class="date">12-13-2003, 07:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">you could try mobs in the deep at zonein - i think they are probably fearable and there is a nice bonus in zone<br />
<br />
aggro kite sun revs in the grey - or fear kite at the shissar huts (not sure of pathing anymore its been a very long time since i was there)<br />
<br />
um..that's all that comes to mind right now<br />
<br />
maybe chardok is still decent xp? i used to fear kite at zonein back in the day low 50s with the sk. with the nec i went in much deeper..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maujin Buu'jin</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 01:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can fear kit the 2 named scorponiks in OT if you get bored they are NOT in the chasm that leads to HS. If you follow the cliff line where all the scorponiks are you should run into them.<br />
<br />
+Both mobs are fearable and Snarable.<br />
+No faction hits.<br />
+They forget you fairly easily after FD.<br />
+5min timer.<br />
+Do not summon<br />
+Fairly Low resists<br />
+always Con non-kos to me (DE sk)<br />
?? should still be Dark Blue.<br />
<br />
-They have a good amount of HP<br />
-they cast (but hey they are fearable)<br />
-they both come on pull so you have to FD split<br />
-they only drop pocket change (0 to 4pp)<br />
<br />
I played with them for a bit at lvl 58 when i didnt want to group or farm for my smithing just for kicks,I have not tried it at lvl 61.<br />
Pull away from the Chasm so fear doesnt path them over the cliff.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />

<br />
yay</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Croaakk</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 02:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I do akheva..fear kite the centi's. You just need to pull them all the way back to the entrance to give yourself running room. If you have the AC, you can tank them down too.<br />
<br />
Just be careful, there are a couple wanderers in the hallway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maujin Buu'jin</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 04:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Boy my memory is bad.  If i remember correctly in AR when you pull Centies (snare) and immediatly fear them they will Path towards Zone in.  After your first fear wears out, Refearing will path them back towards their spawn spot ( im talking about first few centies by the first broken down column).  Dont know about mobs deeper in but i didnt hunt there much since it took me so long to kill them at whatever lvl i was fearkiting there.</div></div><hr />
