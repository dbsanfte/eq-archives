<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>duncan_watson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all,<br />
<br />
I am a newbie,  Been playing all of 1.5 weeks. I have been afraid of EQ addiction for almost 4 years. I finally dove in.<br />
<br />
I am looking at starting an Ogre SK. In almost all other games I play casters. I just like the group interaction and control that comes from Tanking. Taking damage and holding aggro sounds like fun.<br />
<br />
I really like the pet and the extra magic makes the SK good, I hope. It seems obvious that an SK is a group player bar none. But can an SK solo well. I spend a lot of time soloing and in small pickup groups. How are Ogre SKs at soloing?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1) pet is nice, but not awesome.<br />
2) SK's can solo, stick to undead or things in wide open places where you can fear the mob then chase after it beating on it's back (it's called fear kiting)<br />
3) Ogre's have good sta and good HP to start with, so makes the beginning easier.<br />
4) Orge's can't be stunned from the front <br />
<br />
Orge SK's can solo, would just stick to the points in 2.  <br />
Do as I say not as I do.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>duncan_watson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks for the help.<br />
<br />
re pet- I just like the idea of my pet nailing the back of the guy, while I tank the front.<br />
<br />
fear kiting- thanks much.  I have been using this with my necro and can see it is a bit different for a sk<br />
<br />
solo- glad to hear this will work.  Worried since I don't know many people.  I am playing on Prexus since I have a old buddy on the east coast who is on prexus.  Still haven't see the guy.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Calamity_Daemon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well...you CAN solo actually. But as an ogre remember than your mana pool will be relatively small and not to mention that you DO have large amounts of HPs making it take forever to regen. I highly suggest troll/iksar for solo...iksar would be better since they're smarter but trolls have more HPs so it all evens out in the end eventually...<br />
I guess it still all depends on how you wanna look in life...<br />
<br />
p.s my friends wont play EQ because they think Im addicted...but I know Im not..one time I went 5 hours without EQ. I think I set a record there</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>duncan_watson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Sounds good.  I started my Ogre SK today.   He is lvl 4 after about 2 hours.   Working on the newbie armor.  He is a lot of fun.  When he gets to lvl 9 I will see how the spells go.<br />
<br />
For creation I put 5 pts into Agility and 15 into Int.  Man he hits hard.  He has taken out a yellow bear cub and two blue froglok tads in one fight.  He didn't choose it but hey, he did finish it. ;-)<br />
