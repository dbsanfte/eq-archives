<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aarok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Since they fixed the quests in Chardok I have seen both the right hilt for the sword quest drop, as well as gem 1 for the staff/gems quest.<br />
<br />
When you turn in the 4 pieces for the sword quest, you go through the script and you will recieve an 8-slot container and a no drop, no stat, sword.  He instructs you that you need to kill the 8 councilors in Chardok (A) and get their bloods.  Combine the bloods in the container and turn that and the sword back to him and he will give you a reward.<br />
<br />
I have only seen 3 councilors in Chardok though.  I had to log right after doing that turn in so haven't started camping the councilors yet.  So I'm thinking either the blood is not lore and you just have to collect 8, OR there are 8 different councilors out there somewhere.  Anyone have any info on this?<br />
<br />
The staff/gem turn in (no fight btw) gives you a range item.  I wish I had bothered to write down that stats on it, but from what I remember....<br />
10 ac, 10 str?, 10 sta?, 10 wis, 10 int, 50 hps, 50 mana, 20 PR, 20 DR, 10 FR<br />
<br />
Very nice range item, but of course most SKs that are hunting that zone probably have access to a good bow to put in range already.  The resists would still be usefull.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Motak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My guild ran into a councilman last night on our way to royals.  Name was Councilman Yabbin III(not sure on spelling).  All he dropped was blood of Councilman Yabbin III.  He was at the bottom of the stair case just after the trap bridge when you first enter the Royals fort.  We didn't stick around to see what his repop time was.</div></div><hr />
