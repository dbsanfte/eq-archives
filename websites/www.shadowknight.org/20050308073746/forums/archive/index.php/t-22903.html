<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shredler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Today i have camped the horse hair in POG. Killed all the horses in the zone and it did not drop for me (Don't know for sure but killed like 20-30 horses). It is esily soloable, but very time consuming. As in their name they only exist in plains (pain part of the zone), so don't bother wandering in the forest/mountain part of the zone. And it may not drop even if you kill all of them :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Up to 50 horses now</div></div><hr />

The spawn time is always like 26-27 hrs for me. Last night they started popping around midnight. Tonight I rolled in at abou 3:30am and there were only 5 up. Maybe I can get lucky before servers go down, 2 and a half hours left hehe.<br />

PoF is easy killed a bunch of amys and a total of 8 eyes droped.</div></div><hr />

I am 193 tailoring by God I prefer to farm gayhoppers to raise my skill (if they make the required over 193) over going back to PoG,  after all the horror stories I have heared about the drop rate.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Lufan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">My friend cleared all of Growth today and he got no hair. So I assume the drop rate is the same.</div></div><hr />

Maybe SoE has gone and made certain drops for certain flagged people or just certain classes /shrug. just a thought. Really seems wierd that some are reporting 5-10 kills and getting the drop while others are claimin 30-60 kills and no drop...can't believe that half of us are lucky and the other half are being screwed.<br />

wait this is SoE...still can't believe either it would drop like mad or not drop at all....</div></div><hr />

Its called random.<br />

After server up, with the help of another SK, we cleared all the horses and the second last one dropped the goods. Going back tomorrow to see if we can't get another drop for him.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No joke. I didn't see it, and when the corpse didn't disappear, I checked again and STILL didn't see it. In my defence I use a 48-slot (or is it 96?) loot mod UI, so the boxes are very small and dark, but it took Kkhaarn to /bonk me on the head before I saw it. So be careful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Utmost</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I missed mine too until my buddy saw it and told me.  If anyone is frustrated finding the spawns, I would wait till your server comes down.  They seem to be full pop after a patch.</div></div><hr />

Has been pretty easy, pretty much find horse, attack horse, ignore everything else including PoGs then FD when done. Even with 6 mobs on you at 2100ac you're taking almost nothing in damage.</div></div><hr />

After a few minutes i saw it wasn't depopping so i bent down and still didnt see it, i put my pointer over the first slot to see if it was just a bug and maybe invisible when low and behold it was there, its very dark brown very hard to see.  You who have cleared many times make sure that the corpses are empty.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Booze the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">No. Only the 2 protectors of growth have zone-wide agro which takes them 2 minutes to get to you since they have a 3 mile jog.<br />
so zone in invis, locate horsey, kill horsey, FD and let prots hike back home, rinse and repeat till you have hair.</div></div><hr />

The drop was a tad too rare.  I made the hair drop a bit more frequently, so it should be a little bit easier now.  Change should be included in the next patch.  Thanks for the feedback.<br />
