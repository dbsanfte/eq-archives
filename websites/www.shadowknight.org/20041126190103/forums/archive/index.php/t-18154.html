<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was going to originally post this in a couple more days, but I have been having trouble convincing most potential testers to assist me with this so in the hopes of sparking some interest I am posting this early even though it means everything isn't 100% accurate.<br />
<br />
All tests done on Tarmok Beetle Harvesters in Fungus Grove.<br />
<br />
Using some basic info found here (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=3789&amp;perpage=15&amp;display=&amp;pagenumber=1) I decided to figure out SK melee aggro generation.  If you don't feel like reading the thread I just linked what it shows is that each swing of a weapon (not to be confused with a round) provides a set amount of aggro regardless of the amount of damage done or as is often the case, not done.  The rest of the information however is more or less irrelevant for us other than the formula used to determine hate/swing.  Also, just for the sake of comparison I used the same mobs/spells in my testing however any could be used.<br />
<br />
To start with I verified the initial testing with Terror spells.  <br />
The first thing to do was to confirm that Terrors do or do not work at range.<br />
Test 1:  Cast Terror of Darkness once, SK #2 stands 150 range away and casts Terror of Thule, takes 2 casts to pull aggro off me.<br />
Test 2:  Cast Terror of Darkness twice, SK #2 stands 150 range away and casts Terror of Thule, takes 2 casts to pull aggro off me.<br />
Test 3:  Disarm mob to initially get on the hate list and cast Terror of Darkness x2, SK #2 stands 150 range away and casts Terror of Thule, takes 2 casts to pull aggro off me.<br />
Test 4:  Cast Terror of Thule once, SK #2 stands 150 range away and casts Terror of Darkness, takes 2 casts to pull aggro off me.<br />
Test 5:  Disarm mob to initially get on the hate list and cast Terror of Thule, SK #2 stands 150 range away casts Terror of Darkness, takes 5 casts to pull aggro off me.<br />
Test 6:  Cast Terror of Thule twice, SK #2 stands 150 range away and casts Terror of Thule twice.  Mob stays on me, run mob closer to other SK than to me and mob turns to the other SK.  Repeat placing me as the closer SK and aggro back to me.<br />
<br />
Conclusions:  Terrors have a hate cap on them when used as your first method of aggro on a mob, in addition to this mobs's have a hate cap on their initial aggro which most likely increases as the mobs level increases.  Higher level Terrors hit this hate cap when casted on lower level mobs, but lower level Terrors do not.  Terrors work exactly as they're supposed to at range and are not coded to give low amounts of hate when outside of melee range.<br />
<br />
Now that we know for certain that Terror works like its supposed to, testing weapons can begin.  The method used is similar to the post I linked, I pull the mob with Terror of Terris and then cast it either 1 or 3 more times depending on which test is being done.  I'm going to start with 2h weapons.<br />
<br />
The weapons used for this test are:<br />
Fine Steel Great Staff (9/36, 39 db)<br />
Sullied Two-Handed Sword (9/48, 49 db)<br />
Enchanted Tier'Dal Staff (15/42, 42 db)<br />
<br />
<br />
Mob pulled with Terror of Terris then hit with Terror of Terris once more, then engaged in melee.<br />
<br />

<br />
Test 1: <br />
12 swings until it turned on me (last round double attack)<br />
232 damage<br />
5 hits<br />
7 misses<br />
<br />
Test 2: <br />
11 swings until it turned on me<br />
281 damage<br />
6 hits<br />
5 misses<br />
<br />
Test 3: <br />
11 swings until it turned on me<br />
299 damage<br />
6 hits<br />
5 misses<br />
<br />
Test 4: <br />

6 hits<br />
5 misses<br />
<br />
Test 5:<br />
11 swings until it turned on me<br />
335 damage<br />

6 misses<br />
<br />
Test 6:<br />
12 swings until it turned on me (last round double attack)<br />
741 damage<br />
11 hits<br />
1 miss<br />
<br />
Terror of Terris casted four times<br />
<br />
Test 1:<br />
29 swings until the mob was pulled off me<br />
1109 damage<br />
17 hits<br />

<br />
Test 2:<br />
29 swings until the mob was pulled off me<br />
1130 damage<br />
16 hits <br />
13 misses<br />
<br />
At this point I confirmed that just like in the other tests our aggro is based on swings, so could shorten the number of tests needed significantly as I only need to confirm the number of swings to pull aggro.  <br />

Using the formula of Initial Aggro+Subsequent Aggro=Swings*X*Hate per spell, with X equaling the % of the spell being cast (in this case, % of 510) and substituting Initial Aggro for the value Y we have the following formulas for the three weapons.<br />
<br />
FS Staff: Y+510=5610X and Y+1530=14790X<br />
Sword: Y+510=4590X and Y+1530=11730X<br />
Enchanted Staff: Y+510=4590X and Y+1530=12240X<br />
<br />
Solving these we find that for the value for the FS Great Staff is .11, the Sword is .14, and the Enchanted Staff is .13.  However, there is actually a range here with the values being .105-.1149, .135-.1449, and .125-.1349.  This gives the weapons the following hate ranges<br />
<br />
Fine Steel Great Staff (9/36 39 dmg bonus) 54-59 range<br />
Sullied Two-Handed Sword (9/48 49 dmg bonus) 69-74 range<br />
Enchanted Tier'Dal Staff (15/42 42 bonus) 64-69 range<br />
<br />
Finding a formula from this I determined there the aggro formula is Dmg+Dmg Bonus*Mod, this mod is somewhere between 1.22 and 1.29, more weapons need tested in order to narrow this formula down further.<br />
<br />
One Handed weapons:<br />
<br />
For 1h tests I used the following weapons:<br />
Blade of Abgoration (20/39 13 bonus)<br />
Dagger (3/20 13 bonus)<br />
Tri-Plated Golden Hackle Hammer (14/24 13 bonus)<br />

Putting this data into the formulas, the results are <br />
<br />
Hammer: 14 damage 13 bonus, 18-23 range x value was 20<br />
Dagger: 3 damage 13 bonus, 8-13 range, x value was 10<br />
Blade: 20 damage 13 bonus, 23-28 range, x value was 26<br />
<br />
Right now I believe the formula for this is similar to the 2h one with the only difference being the modifier (dmg+dmg bonus*mod), however the mod for 1h is currently a much larger range with it varying from 0.35 to 0.65.<br />
<br />
PS.  Only 1 Tarmok was hurt in the gathering of this data, and it was his own fault for daring me to /disc IHT him.<br />
<br />
Sometime tomarrow I will hopefully be able to confirm or deny that the formulas work, and if they do, I should be able to narrow the valid range on the modifier down significantly, I should have 1h/2h bash completed tomarrow as well.  Also, I have begun testing spell aggro and just like in melee there is a modifier (on non direct +/- hate spells) but I cannot tell what it is or how big it is currently, I need way more testing on that before I can start to figure it out.  One more thing, it's also my current believe that the voice line works by moidfying what I will now refer to as the hate modifyer, what this means is that if someone had a modifier of 1.25 and Voice of Thule was casted on them the new modifier would be 1.42 (1.24/.88).<br />
<br />
And one final comment before I get some much needed sleep.  Thanks to Okami, Thenger, and Percog for helping me test this so far.</div></div><hr />

Samples are a little small for real proof but they look reasonable. Borderline I'd say, giving you the bonus of doubt there.<br />
<br />
If you need help with parsing/testing feel free to ask.<br />
<br />
What I would like to know now is the initial hate generated by <br />
- Festering<br />
- Clinging<br />
- DC<br />
- Asystole<br />
- HF<br />
- Spears<br />
<br />
For snares get an immune shroom, for disease a scrounging rat from CoD I'd say.<br />
<br />
Gonna try to find another sick SK on AB that is interested to help but actually 95% are crap and thus hard to find testing help.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rhowne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">That is damn nice work.  It will help quantify the difference between weapons - especially for warriors.<br />
<br />
In regards to the initial test with the Terror line, there is currently a heavy thread on the Steel Warrior forums in regards to 'Bonus Hate' and at this time, the extra hate from first aggro is unknown, therefore it may change the results of your tests with the terror line.  <br />
<br />
If possible, I would like to see information on another aspect of what you are testing - and I'm sure the warriors do as well.  Once the second SK takes aggro, I would recommend taunting until you have aggro and then see the number of times it takes the second SK (using the LOWESET terror) to regain aggro.  Using a few tests like this, we may actually be able to determine how much extra hate is generated by Taunt.  Since the terror line is only pure hate (no stun or other components), we know exactly how much hate that generates.  This is a separate test from what you're doing, though.  Depending on how our production rollout goes this weekend I may grab another SK or two in my guild and try these tests myself.<br />
<br />
Note: My logic in regards to the Taunt test comes from reading this thread (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?threadid=1811) on the Steel Warrior forums.  It points to evidence that Taunt does two things: 1) puts the taunter one point on top of the hate list and 2) gives a small amount of additional hate.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dester</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Very good data.  Few things though... isn't a plain o' dagger 19 or 20 delay instead of 10?<br />
<br />
It would be very interesting to see if your numbers hold true with a larger Delay on the weapons, ie a shovel vs a weighted axe(if you have a troll or Oger testing)<br />
<br />
I believe it was mentioned above, but I have always believed that the first person to agro a mob has a jump on agro.  So if you can get a 3rd person to pull the mob, then when in melee range do the terrors and see if your data changes.<br />
<br />
Just trying to elminate all variables from the equations.<br />
<br />
Dester</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gneeker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Awesome testing there. Very impressive.<br />
<br />
The dagger concerns me though (and yes, it's not delay 10). It throws a huge gap into a nice tight number range.<br />
<br />
Another option that might be considered is using a non-magical weapon on mobs immune to it, to see if that generates aggro per swing without damage entirely.<br />
<br />
<br />
I would recommend taunting until you have aggro and then see the number of times it takes the second SK (using the LOWESET terror) to regain aggro.<br />
<br />
<br />
That is a great idea. Would be fun to finally be able to quantify the effect of taunt. With these tests the aggro+ generation of almost any spell could be quantified (no more arguements over fear vs terror vs Fester vs CD vs...). I for one am VERY interested in the results.<br />
<br />
EDIT- Mis-read a little bit, removed my ignorance :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Feriin Cydovu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If am I am reading it correctly, basically  what Breal shows is that the higher the dmg and the dmg bonus on a weapon is , the greater amount  of hate per swing.<br />
<br />
Dmg + [Dmg Bonus * the agro modifier ( 1.22 to 1.29)]= Agro generated per swing..<br />
<br />
But then again I could have misread it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Rueeliar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">What it shows, for those getting lost in the math, is a very solid support for the old theory that melee aggro is based on damage &lt;i&gt;potential&lt;/i&gt; rather than actual damage done.<br />
<br />
i.e.  The mob turns based on what kind of damage you could or should be doing, rather than the damage numbers we see.<br />
<br />
With enough time, either Brael and his buds helping with the tests, or others using the numbers they have found, will be able to determine a trend between weapon ratio, damage bonus, and 'aggro modifier' to make hypothetical quantifications for certain weapons.  We know misses generate aggro, so the miss rate in those tests may be connected to the 'modifier' calculated, and the difference may be any number of things... unaccountable crit-rate, high attack throwing off the engine's estimates for damage (which would not surprise me... I dont exactly see a large difference in aggro generation between a warrior without atk buffs, and a warrior with an extra 300-400 atk), or whatever.  *shrug*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Feriin Cydovu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I never said if the swing hit or not , I just said per swing. Go back thru and reread what Breal Posted..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Xulan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Once the values for hate per swing are more refined - the equation which allows us to find hate per swing - and if they prove true for a wider array of weapons (I'm interested to see weighted axe, dathor great hammer, tantor's tusk, rubicite staff), then I guess the next step would be to factor in delay.  Although DB is related to delay...  If I have two weapons with the same hate per swing, it is obvious that the lower delay weapon will generate more hate over the same period of time.  However, if hate per swing is not equal, namely where lower hate per swing coincides with a lower delay weapon, then we will need to enter in the delay to see which weapon will give more hate in the same amount of time, in order to find which weapon is a superior tanking weapon for hate generation over time.<br />
<br />
For example in the examples Brael gave:<br />
<br />
Fine Steel Great Staff (9/36 39 dmg bonus) 54-59 range<br />
Sullied Two-Handed Sword (9/48 49 dmg bonus) 69-74 range<br />
Enchanted Tier'Dal Staff (15/42 42 bonus) 64-69 range<br />
<br />
We see that the Sullied Two-Handed Sword produces the most hate per swing, but would the Enchanted Tier'Dal Staff be better over time due to the lower delay?  How can we express this mathematically?  Would it be hate/delay?  I really don't know, just guessing.<br />
<br />
If we took the lowest number of the range, and divide it by the delay:<br />
<br />
Sullied:  69/48 = 14.375 hate per second? (unhasted)<br />
Enchanted Tier'Dal: 64/42 = 15.238 hate per second (unhasted)<br />
<br />
This would show that the Enchanted Teir'Dal Staff would be superior for hate generation over a set period of time even though it gives less hate per swing.  Please correct me if I am wrong.<br />
<br />
EDIT:  fixed my decimal places.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am going to try to test this out as soon as I can. I too am very much looking forward being able to end the debate between which darkness and whether terror or fear is better for aggro(personally I believe Terror of Thule &gt; fear but we shall see).</div></div><hr />

<br />
From what I have shown on Terrors right now the lower level the mob is the better of a choice it is to use over darkness/fear (and under level 54 mob completly forget fear), on this test mob for example I was estimating it to be giving between 299 and 300 hate, but on a higher level mob darkness quite obviously gives more than 600 since it is capable of pulling aggro off thule.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How so?<br />
They still generate crap hate.<br />
Your still wasting a Spell slot by using them<br />
<br />
Maybe I just have been level 65 for to long, and didnt have to grow up without the Shadow vortex/disease cloud nerfs, but so far too me it just seems we have found 1 use for the terror spells. this test.<br />
<br />
At any rate even if at lower levels its better too use a terror spell, at what point is this cut off, and your best to switch to clinging darkness? Also just proves Terror of thule needs a heavy hate upgrade for the level we get it possibly terris also.<br />
Watching this thread with great interest ....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I can say from my experience with a warrior with EB weapons that clinding darkness comes close to the same amount of hate as an enraging blow proc (we have about the same hate from melee, and EB will mostly pull aggro from a CD pull) - this is in highborns in Veksar I'm 63 warrior is 65.  <br />
<br />
EB is 700 hate.  CD is 20 mana. Terror of Thule is 60 mana for 600 hate.<br />
<br />
Maybe if the terror spells had their mana costs chopped to a third they would be worth the mana (and 4 recast time versus 6), but they don't.<br />
<br />
I agree that terrors can be effective, but they're generally not worth the mana except in certain specialized situations (mezzable mobs that can 1 round an enchanter while slowed is about the only 1 I can think of).</div></div><hr />

<br />
A synopsis would have been cool though :)   I was not sure myself what you were out to prove until someone said it.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think Terrors are by no means useless.  They are best used not as  pure hate generators but as QUICK hate generators.  I use them when I need quick aggro and will recast to hold aggro.<br />
<br />
If I am balls to the wall trying to keep aggro I use Festering and toss in a Terror maybe once or twice (with Taunt of course and Voice)<br />
<br />
<br />
Breal, how does the Voice series affect all of this?  Is it just as simple as a base % modifier to whatever amount of aggro you currently have?<br />
<br />
<br />
Also what about 1h weapons while using a shield to bash?  Does the damage potential just add to the potential of your 1 hand weap to equal your total aggro from melee?  And on that note where the hell does your bash damage potential come from?  Or is that just some contant depending on your level and skill?<br />
<br />
DQ</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I'll go into more detail on your quetions later if I remember to DQ, double checking this stuff for mistakes right now since I just finished testing some weapons for the day and one weapon doesnt fit within the range (or even close), so some quick answers:<br />
<br />
I'm not sure how Voice works yet, finding that out is just going to be a side effect of this other stuff, my assumption though is the same as its been for a long time and that it works by adjusting your aggro from every aggro giving event.  I know its a broad defination but thats about the best definition there is.  I know for a fact theres an aggro modifier on spells and melee now though that modifys the aggro given from everything you do.   I think Voice adjusts these values, however its possible that it adjusts the mobs modified aggro list (where your aggro gets modified based on your level, distance, hp%, and a couple other factors).  I'm still a ways away from working on that though.<br />
<br />
I was originally planning to work on bash today but have spent the day verifying 1h weapons instead, didnt even get to verifying the formula for 2h weapons.  Bash damage comes from the AC of the shield up to 25, once the shield is 25 or higher AC damage done is treated as 25 regardless of the AC.  So for most shields (and just about any shield you would be using at level 30+) bash is basically nothing more than a 25/60 offhand weapon that can't be hasted, can't auto attack, and can interrupt spells.<br />
<br />
And yes, Terrors blow.  Even for fast hate they suck, check the casting times, it's .1 faster cast than other spells.<br />
<br />
Someone mentioned wheres the cutoff for where Terrors are no longer viable?  Not having an SK of the appropraite level range to mess with it, I would say level 53 or so based off what I know.<br />
<br />
Bah, one more comment (found my mistake atleast, so this formula still works), right now I'm not trying to prove anything I just want to find out aggro generation for us from melee and spells (and finally get a decent post worth moving to the archives when I'm all done).  After that I'll work on proving stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Jice Virago</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I rescently helped a guildmate level up her SK twink by playing along side her with alts, leveling naturally.  There is only one time in your entire career you would ever mem Terror over clinging:  When you are concerned about mez breaking.  Unfortunately, most SKs are going to be the MT of the majority of sub 60s group they are in and picking the targets, making this concern irrelavent for all but the most incompetant SKs.  By the time you get high enough level that it becomes an issue, you can start using Fear/Spook the Dead.  With CD, Fear and a mere 2 AA in SCE, you have fizzle free dirt cheap agro on the level of being able to proc a BOW at will, basically.<br />
<br />
As for the Voice spell line, my obvervations (nothing tested, but this is something that can be easily tested) are that the modifier only appears to affect mele based agro. You can, for example, cast Voice on an enchanter and cleric (I have done this on raids to test) and they are no more likely to pull agro.  It could also be proximity based, but again that would be easy to test and I think its unlikely, since Terrors are unaffected by range, but what do you really know before a test?  If Mele based agro is small compared to proc agro, then that makes the voice spell line pretty worthless for the buff and spell slot it consumes.  If a lot of agro for warriors comes from mele (say 2/3 on a BOW using warrior or more), then perhaps the spell is worthwhile.</div></div><hr />

I'm going to skip a bit here and jump straight to the hate ranges of the weapons tested today and yesterday without repeating my math since I don't have it written down again and have a bit of a headache from doing this, also I have provided the necessary information in my posts to provide you with anything needed if you wish to check it.  <br />
<br />
BoA=23-28<br />
Dagger=8-13<br />
Hammer=18-23<br />
Pick=18-23<br />
Jawbone=18-23<br />
Whip=23-28<br />
<br />
And the ranges minus the weapons damage<br />
BoA=3-8<br />
Dagger=5-10<br />
Hammer=4-9<br />
Pick=2-7<br />
Jawbone=7-12<br />
Whip=7-12<br />
<br />
From this you can see that the only valid number is 7.  This means that the modifier on the Damage Bonus is between .5 and .57, I'm not really sure if it can be narrowed down beyond that because you cant have a weapon that gives 16.5 damage for example.  However there is another idea which I thought of while writing this post that could provide a different modifier.  Awhile ago hate modifiers were changed to be hate*x to hate/x.  I'm sure you remember the posts from people thinking Voice spells were nerfed when they were adjusted from increase aggro by 12% to decrease aggro by .88%.  If this idea is correct it would mean the modifier on our 1h weapons is not bonus*.5 to .57 but instead bonus/1.73 to 1.53.  At this point im unsure which is correct as they both give the same results, it should be possible to verify which works once I get back to working on 2h weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Jice, voice affects spell and melee aggro.  Pure hate values are not affected by any aggro modifier altering spell or aa however.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Jice Virago</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">So Basically hate procs and Terrors are completely unaffected by Voice line (and the Enchanter line, Warrior Time BP effect, ect) but spells that generate agro based on mob HP (ie debuffs and snares) are?  I find this somewhat dubious, but its probagbly really easy to test.  Just have a SK generate a set amount of agro on a mob and count how many Terrors it takes to pull said mob off of the first, using something that generates non scaling non direct hate like a spear or tap, and do it with and without Voice up.  I'm not disputing your assertation, but my personal experience with the spell has indicated it does not affect spell agro at all, so I am just curious what the source of your opinion on that aspect of the spell is, be it experience, testing, or a conversation with a Dev.  I for one would like to irrefutably determine the value of this spell once and for all, especially since warriors keep mentioning it in their nerf knight crusade.</div></div><hr />

For a long time I have totally dismissed Voice of Thule as being a novelty spell, one to make us feel better by saying &quot;Look at me! I have an agro buff!&quot;  Are you suggesting that it is actually a spell worth using? Pardon me if this has been common knowledge to some, but I have totally disregarded this spell and any conversation about it, but the above quote is kinda hard to miss.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>cft2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Nice testing.  Being a fan of round numbers, looking at your ranges, I'm going to tenatively assume that the mod for 2H is 1.25, and that for 1h is either 0.5 (nice round number) or 0.625 (half of 2h number)<br />
<br />
Overall its good to know that aggro is determined by potential damage rather than actual damage.   What this means is that even with a LOW atk value, we generate the same hate from melee as having an UBER atk value...<br />
<br />
This is a good thing for tanks when comparing vs heavily buffed DPS melee.  Even if the rogue/ranger/monk are max hitting constantly and we are missing a lot, we can generate good aggro from melee.<br />
<br />
If the 1h bonus is 0.5 instead of 0.625, then it looks like, for the same ratio, 2H generate better aggro than dual wielding 1hs  (of course this is not an issue for us).  And definately for a knight, 2h will be more melee aggro.<br />
<br />
Add to this the fact that 2h get a better damage bonus and it does seem like 2H weapons are the way to go when you want aggro.  (even if you weren't factoring in riposte damage).<br />
<br />
This is bad for warriors: who mostly dual wield to have more procs, if 2 1h is less melee aggro than a similar 2h, then they are doing less melee aggro than they could.  I wonder how 2h with aggro proc + aggro augment compares in aggro generation over time to a 2x 1h combo with procs + proc augs?  (but I'll let Steel Warriors do that testing)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>cft2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Breal, after re-reading your posts, I have a question of interpretaton...<br />
<br />
You are using a formula of:<br />
<br />
dmg + (dmg bonus * mod)<br />
<br />
         or<br />
<br />
(dmg + dmg bonus) * mod<br />
<br />
and solving for mod.  I haven't plugged in your numbers to be sure if mod is applied to both dmg and dmg bonus or not.  But could it also be?<br />
<br />
(dmg * mod) + dmg bonus?<br />
<br />
I'm at work so I can't try plugging in all your numbers just yet to see if I get any consistant value with this equation.<br />
<br />
Still, thank you for this detailed testing.  Whatever the exact formula, it looks like my GSWH (35/25 35db) does about 80 aggro per swing, so if CD is in the 700 range, it takes over 5 rounds of melee for me to compare with 1 CD for aggro.</div></div><hr />

Brael, if it's possible, could you check the aggro for shields and Bash?  I have ideas, but dont have the means to test them.<br />
<br />
Is Bash aggro a &quot;gimme?&quot;  I.E. if melee potential determines melee aggro, is this factoring in things which are activated like Bash, Kick, or Slam?  Either way, does Bash provide enough aggro to make it worthwhile?<br />
<br />
Easiest way to test this is with the current tests having Bash used in one of the longer strings after the trend is established.  If it takes 30 swings with a certain 1handed weapon and a shield equipped, will it take 25 if two bashes hit, or will it still be 30?  Or would it be 25 even if the Bashes missed?<br />

Now that it's confirmed to give aggro the same way melee does, I could shorten the tests needed greatly.<br />
Four Casts 27 swings.<br />
Efreeti War Shield (15 ac)<br />
Two Casts 14 swings, Four Casts 37 swings.<br />
Wooden Shield (5 ac)<br />
Two Casts 40 swings, Four Casts 91 swings.<br />
<br />
That gives a hate range of<br />
Fearsome Shield (40 ac, damage cap at 25)=25-27 range<br />
Efreeti War Shield (15 ac)=17-19 range<br />
Wooden Shield (5 ac)=7-9 range<br />
<br />
Now since I had some no drop shields I bashed while my partner tanked, well after one mob I realised something was off so retested the other shields (minus the wooden shield that I destroyed)<br />
<br />
Fearsome Shield (40 AC)<br />
Two casts 16 swings, Four casts 42 swings<br />
Efreeti War Shield (15 ac)<br />
Two casts 21 swings, Four casts 56 swings<br />
Ashenbone Shield (25 ac)<br />
Two casts 15 swings, Four casts 42 swings<br />
2H Bash <br />
Two Casts 61 swings, Four Casts 89 swings.<br />
<br />
Breaking that down to a hate range.<br />
Fearsome Shield=15-17 range<br />
Efreeti Shield=11-13 range<br />
Ashenbone Shield=13-15 range<br />
2H bash=13-15 range<br />
<br />
At this point I thought Casting Subtlety was affecting melee, so I checked Terrors again, but confirmed they weren't affecting it, so checked another weapon.<br />
<br />
Sentient 2h axe Thenger hitting the mob me tanking<br />
Two Casts 8 swings, Four Casts 20 swings<br />
84-89 range<br />
<br />
Well, there you have it, casting subtlety is affecting melee aggro and I'm completly lost now for aggro generation since I cant come up with another formula.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">Those of you who said it makes voice more attractive, you're thinking about it wrong.  If it works the way I'm assuming it does it alters the modifier by 12% not all aggro by 12% making it actually add less than it says to your aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Maniacles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">In the steel warrior taunt test thread, there were a number of things found.  I'm just reiterating the important bits here.<br />
<br />
1) Hate does not equal aggro<br />
<br />
Hate and aggro are two separate things.  The &quot;Hate list&quot; is a set of numbers that each mob has about each player.  A successfull taunt brings the taunter to the highest number on this list, plus one.<br />
<br />
  An aggro check takes a number of things into consideration, of which the hate list is ONLY ONE OF MANY.  Perhaps the most important one, but not the only one.  Other things which modify an aggro check are distance, whether one is sitting, whether one is in melee range, and, as discovered in the thread, the order that the players initially get on the hate list.<br />
<br />
What the steel warriors discovered is that the &quot;initial aggro&quot; bonus was worth 3 hate tacked on AFTER the hate list is checked.  Such that taunting to get to the top of the hate list didn't automatically get one aggro.  Barring any melee activity, it took 4 successfull taunts to get aggro from a puller.<br />
<br />
<br />
What I'm pretty sure brael is saying is that the &quot;12%&quot; gets applied at the &quot;aggro check&quot; point, not at the &quot;hate generation&quot; point.  This means that if you create 1000 aggro on a mob, then cast the vot on yerself, you will have effective 1120 aggro, and you clicked it off, go back to 1000 aggro.  I'd love to see that test, which would involve a second sk that has 1100 aggro for the mob to switch from and to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">No manicles, its 12% additional aggro on your actions it doesnt increase you on the list by 12%.<br />

<br />
I am not suprised you are unable to fit a formula to these results, they seem to be inconsistent with any form of common sense.<br />
<br />
For example :<br />
Sentry Maul (22/43 45 bonus) 54-59 range<br />
Fine Steel Great Staff (9/36 39 bonus) 54-59 range<br />
<br />
Even assuming the staff is 54 and the maul is a 59, we have an example where a vastly inferior weapon is doing considerably more aggro.<br />
<br />
One thing seems sure - whatever principle is used to weight the aggro on weapons it is either broken or makes no sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Blackstone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">First, let me say that I think this is wonderful testing Brael.<br />
<br />
Second, no one should be surprised that the Hate List values and &quot;agro&quot; are two seperate issues altogther.<br />
<br />
When you say agro, its really a proxy for the mob's AI.  The most obvious example is Root.<br />
<br />
When root is on, it doesn't matter where you are on the hate list, the mob attacks the closest person in melee range.<br />
<br />
Simple old world mobs follow the simplest rules, but many Boss mobs I've discovered (empirically) have modified AI to make them highly sensitive to proximity for example.<br />
<br />
Second, I can't make any sense of your 2hd data.  Its all over the place.  The best that I could say for it is that it appears that damage has a very low correlation with hate/swing and that bonus is most highly correlated with hate/swing.<br />
<br />
However, there are some really dubious looking anomolies in there.<br />
<br />
For example, this:<br />
<br />
Sullied Two-Handed Sword (9/48 49 bonus) 69-74 range<br />
<br />
appears to &quot;outperform&quot; all the other weapons you tested.  That weapon is a peice of garbage that even my pet would turn down.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree with you some of these weapons are way off from where they should be, I'm beginning to wonder if blunt/slash have different formulas or if some weapons have innate modifiers.<br />
<br />
I'll go back through my notes and recheck the Sullied 2h sword and redo the math but I'm pretty sure it's correct.</div></div><hr />

You have to remember though that even though it has a higher hate/swing than the other weapons it's delay is also high, prior to haste it swings once every 4.8 seconds reducing its actual hate/sec to 14.38-15.42 and another weapon such as the Fine Steel Great Staff would be giving between 15 and 16.39 hate/sec.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Blackstone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">Ok, I've grouped your data points together in the following fashion to put the &quot;like&quot; damage bonus scores together and eliminated the points that didn't have something to compare them to.<br />

<br />
This makes sense except... the staff is the highest aggro over time of the lot, so that would actually have the opposite effect.<br />
<br />
The non-magic may have some bearing as well except... it's a value *the wrong way* - I could see non-magical weapons having less hate maybe, but certainly not more hate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">Spell aggro is done by the spell however.  It would make more sense to simply have low level spells be low aggro, also back when that was an issue there weren't even mana regen buffs at that time heavily limiting caster dps.  I'm wondering if its a result of spell casting subtlety, it reduces magicial activities by 20% (or so they say, check that bash data and sentient 2h axe comparison, it's more).  It's possible that the magic tag on the weapon is making the game think of it as a magicial attack thus applying the hate reduction on it.  It's already proven that casting subtlety is doing something to melee aggro generation but I'm thinking that may be the reason.  I'll try to get some more data points tomorrow off an SK without subtlety.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>Elysea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">Brael, did you test any magic 1H'ers vs. non-magic 1H'ers?

<br />
Should be interesting.  If non-magic weapons generate more agro than magic weapons, and agro values are based on damage potential rather than actual damage, I can see Reavers becoming the Warrior raid weapon of choice...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I only skimmed the data with this thought in mind, but it kinda looks like maybe the hate from the damage is scaled by the delay, sorta like how procs are scaled.<br />
<br />
This would at least partially explain why some bad (high delay) weapons have sorta good hate-per-swing?<br />
<br />
Heck, maybe try being SLOWED and see if you get different hate per swing, might show that the hate is scaled...</div></div><hr />

This is my first post here because I don't actually play a SK 8) but I have been skimming these forums off and on for quite awhile.  Not often that there is a post worthy of reading.  This reminds me of the studies we did on strength spells and the cripple line on the shaman's crucible way back in early EQ. 8)<br />
<br />
<br />
I have read everything so far, but I have a few questions (maybe I missed these answers).<br />
<br />
Have you determined whether hate is equal across classes with DBs.  For instance, if a monk, warrior, ranger, sk, and paladin can all wield the same two hander do they all acrue (sp?) hate at the same rate?  I'm wondering if maybe they don't since they have different damage tables and if it is off potential damage the table might be silghtly factored in.<br />
<br />
Have you determined how long it takes before hate drops off a mob?  This is an assumption I have because we have seen low level mobs attack you for several minutes and then just walk away.  On long fights this might have some impact.<br />
<br />
And I might suggest that you can test how proximity modifies hate by fighting the big cubes in skyshrine.  I'm sure there are tons of other mobs with a similar situation.  Would be interesting to see how many hate nukes it takes to overcome a certain distance and minimal hate or some such 8)<br />
<br />
BTW I'm glad the word is getting out on how good the voice line actually is.  Its awesome.  My SK partner has long used it and a big darkness to control aggro when there was a lack of manaregen while leveling.  This gives real snare, damage, and plenty of hate instead of having clinging that lets the mob run a good bit and doesn't give damage and can cause a slight drop in dps from delayed swings while casting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">I originally thought it was different by class, however Monks and Warriors are on different damage tables but are appearing to use the same aggro generation.  It hasn't been tested enough yet however.<br />
<br />
Wizard testing is showing hate to not decay.  Mob's will sometimes memblur themselves after a certain amount of time but hate is not decaying.<br />
<br />
I've done a minor amount of testing with proximity, take a look a the Terror tests took 1000 hate (I think, maybe it was 800) to overcome 600 hate from 150 range away.<br />

Voice is useless in most cases.</div></div><hr />

<br />
voice line sucks. the only time its worth bothering with is against a boss mob where its imperative the mob never turns.<br />
<br />
it doesn't make warriors magically hold agro. it helps them out slightly, but all in all everyone in a raid needs to control their own agro generation, and should stay well below the 12% leeway voice can give.</div></div><hr />

I know you are a big poster here window but you took my quote 100 percent out of context to make your point.<br />
<br />
One thing I find rather odd is that on these forums it is suggested to use darkness for aggro on mobs that are immune to darkness, but from playing in LDoN it seems almost certain that darkness sucks for aggro on those immune mobs.<br />
<br />
I always group with a SK and he pulls with darkness and the chanter/shaman slows and the mob is always stuck to SK.  Now, if the mob is snare immune and he pulls with darkness and the chanter/shaman slows the mob immediately heads towards the chanter/shaman on slow.<br />
<br />
However if the SK pulls with hate instead of darkness the mob does not head to the slower.  <br />
<br />
I'm sure I can get some tests going to see exactly how this work as there are plenty of nonsnareable mobs in LDoN and we almost always have a SK and chanter/shaman in group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u80"><b>Eliezar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p80">Brael I had read your tests on proximal aggro or the one with the two SKs and the mob not switching unless you ran it by the other SK.  What I'd be interested in is if both players are in melee distance against a boss type mob (most have the same aggro?  always seemed that way) but one is as close as possible and the other is as far as possible but still in melee range how much +hate does it take to get the mob to switch.  <br />
<br />
Of course there are different ranges to attack different mobs.  Some you can hit from across the room and others you can be at their graphics and out of melee range!<br />
<br />
They actually have made aggro management far too easy in raiding situations as it seems that proximity &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hate.  I remember in Velious when you have a mob almost dead and your casters are out of mana (FT almost didn't exist yet) and the CH chain is told to DA and sit at bosses feet to give you an extra minute to finish the mob.  Aggro and hate is just too easily manipulated by players.</div></div><hr />

Voice is a waste of time, in xp situations.<br />
Its taking up spell slots that arent nessesary to keep agro.<br />
even if you are without voq. and FT. Pact of hate and mental corruption should be more than enough. (and far more useful spells to have up)<br />
<br />
In my experience with those LDON you speak of, your better to just deal more damage too the mob to retain agro, cause those terror spells are just as ineffective against those select mobs that are immune to hate effects off darkness. Remove that crap terror and voice shit, and add something like Scythe of innoruuk, or spear of decay.<br />

 <br />
<br />
That's missing a lot of the point.  Say you are fighting undead that do not run and you are killing mobs in 30 seconds.  If its a SK and a ranger, rogue, or monk all you have to do is put voice on and you will keep aggro over them.  You say just use your spears, but you are talking manaregen issues here AND you are waiting on timers.<br />
<br />
If you are just talking about being a level 65 SK then yeah mana proc alone is obviously enough to keep darkness casting and keep aggro.  What do you do at level 50 with no manaregen?  Voice line is great for that point in time.<br />
<br />
There just seems to be a lot of box SKs.  I've especially noticed in slow kill groups SKs would rather use spears and clinging than festering when festering is more efficient damage.  Having a spell you can cast once every what 10 minutes for aggro is a lot better than casting a spell every mob when you have no manaregen.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u84"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p84">clinging darkness is always enough to get significant agro over others.<br />
in exp groups, the point is to get snap agro at the start, preferably enough that will keep agro through slow. clinging darkness unvoiced 1 cast does this (even if mobs are snare immune). that's why i didn't even cosnider voice as useful in an exp group. regarding mana efficiency, its 250 mana to cast the best voice, lasts 10 minutes, and uses a buff slot and spell gem slot. you can cast 12 clinging darknesses for less mana, which produces more hate overall, and is the snap agro that knights are expected to have.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u86"><b>velk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p86">Shadowblade, I said the bug. Casting Subtlety is affecting melee aggro <br />
<br />
I couldn't really follow your description of testing that, so if I made an incorrect assumption please correct me -<br />
<br />
<br />
As I understand it the test was first someone else terroring a mob and you hitting it with a sullied two hander until it turned on you, and the second test was you terroring a mob and then having the other person hit it with a sullied two hander until it turned on them.<br />
<br />
Is it possible that it's terror that is being affected by spell casting subtlety rather than the weapon ? The damage focus modifiers add a random amount between 0 and 20, is it possible that sublety reduces aggro by a random amount between 0 and 20 ?<br />
<br />
Did you try the same test with a non-magical weapon ?<br />
<br />
On a different note, both the weight aspect and the magic/non-magic aspect are interesting, but don't hold any answers either that I can see - <br />
For example the ogre war maul (17/50, wt13) has a higher damage, higher bonus, higher weight than the sullied two-hander (9/48 wt12), they are both non-magical and yet the ogre war maul still has less aggro per swing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u87"><b>Thakalas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p87">He did tests with the aggro spells between the two SKs to confirm they aren't affected by subtlety.  AAs work full every time, it's only the focuses (and not even all of them) that have the range.  <br />
<br />
Earlier in the thread was where the magic/non-magic testing was brought up, that's part of what led to finding the subtlety bug.  It had to do with the 2her hate generation numbers not matching up at all, which led to the &quot;This is the data set of the damned&quot; comment and the suggestion that magic weapons act differently than non-magic.<br />

Well, I think I made an error in alot of earlier testing and grouped data between someone with and without SCS together after looking at my tests tonight, who would know SCS would screw with melee aggro?  I sure as hell didn't.  Sorry about that to whoever was trying to figure out something that worked with it.  Now, this makes alot more sense though.<br />
<br />

<br />
But, since I know my original tests were without subtlety now and tonights testing showed errors with some other weapons as well (I was told I meleeed for the first ones but I guess not... pain in the ass to remember when you're half asleep) we can seperate some of these data points for now.  Can make use of them again later on when determining exactly what SCS is doing to aggro but for now while concentrating on the actual formulas we can forget about them.  I put the new Sullied Two Handed Sword data in its place however.<br />
<br />
Sarnak Ceremonial Sword (8/34 38 bonus) 33-38 range<br />
<br />
Runic Carver (18/37 39 bonus) 43-48 range<br />

Ogre War Maul (17/50 51 bonus) 54-59 range<br />
<br />
I kicked the Argent Defender out of the data set as well even though none of my data collected tonight leads to that conclusion.  It appears I made a mistake (another one even!) and I don't have detailed info on the Argent Defender in my files and since I'm basically error checking myself tonight I would be willing to bet I accidently wrote down the range it has without SCS instead of its with SCS range.<br />
<br />
The data looks much better now and you could possibly construct something useful from it now.  Grouped by like bonus again with damage subtracted from the range.<br />
<br />

<br />

Sentry Maul (45 bonus) 32-37 range<br />
Myrolkars Gift (45 bonus) 29-34 range<br />
Arbitors Combine Greatsword (45 bonus) 29-34 range<br />
<br />
Sentient Two Handed Axe (49 bonus) 34-39 range<br />
Sullied Two-Handed Sword (49 bonus) 29-34 range<br />
<br />
Ogre War Maul (51 bonus) 37-42 range<br />
<br />
This leads me to believe that my original formula of dmg+(bonus*mod) was correct.<br />
Solving for the mod<br />
38*x=25 to 30<br />
39*x=25 to 27<br />
45*x=32 to 34<br />
49*x=34<br />
51*x=37 to 42<br />
<br />
This is the results of the range x could be<br />
38=.65 to .8<br />
39=.63 to .7<br />
45=.7 to .76<br />
49=.69 to .7x<br />
51=.72 to .83<br />
<br />
This makes me think that 50+ delay weapons get a bonus to their modifier and other 2h weapons (possibly excluding under 28 delay 2h) share the same modifier which would appear to be .7.<br />
<br />
Anyways, thats all for tonight I should have been sleeping an hour ago.  Hopefully this is progress and not a step backwards.</div></div><hr />

Me and my guild Sk's kinda think there may be some sort of aggro mod on Pact of Hate.  When we raid, if we're in Skelly seems aggro comes our way a whole lot faster off of spells, specially spears.  If you get a little extra testing time maybe you could check this out.  There may very well be nothing to it at all, still if it were it would be good to know.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I mean, just casting Darkness u can keep the agro over the cast of Malo and maybe a couple of slows, but if u cast it twice no one cant turn out the mob from u, and then use taunt and bash ( or 2hb ) as normal.<br />
<br />
Maybe u need to cast and extra Darkness if some people is overdoting like my regular group friends does ( SHM 65 and NEC 65 ) they usualy make a competition and every one of them can do more then 1k dmg per tick on dots so the mob get piss and u need to cast and extra darkness beside the Taunt and Bash.<br />
<br />
I tested those Terror Agro line spells and they suck, like and example if u pull a mob with one agro spell he will attack the slower ignoring u, but if u pull it using darkness even resisted the mob will keep u on the agro list after the slow. And if u are on a Uber Agro group like i said before u can continue using Darkness like and agro spell or Deassease Cloud that lvl 9 cheap and awesome agro spell.</div></div><hr />

I did my research and posted it in the officer's board, but will post it here for those who dig this kind of info.  Very interesting stuff, and good toilet reading if you want to print it out, hehe.  Warriors and brainiacs are encouraged to read this, but the rest of you &quot;normal&quot; people can skip it if you want. (note: this info has been modified slightly from what was on the officer's board, due to further analysis and clarification)<br />
-------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Ok, the test has been performed, and my findings are this...<br />
<br />
- I believe that aggro generation has nothing to do with the &quot;delay&quot; of the weapon.  It has to do with the dam/delay ratio, and maybe a bit more (see later)<br />
- Damage does not have to be dealt to generate aggro.  Larath stunned a willowisp to get initial aggro, and after a set amount of swings with non-magic weapons (no damage to the mob), I was able to pull aggro off him.<br />
- I now believe that there is a &quot;hidden aggro bonus&quot; of sorts, but see below...<br />
<br />
It is apparent that weapon aggro is &quot;predestined&quot; to an extent before the fight starts.  The actual damage that the weapon puts out in any given fight has nothing to do with the aggro that weapon generates. (of course, specific amounts of aggro are still generated from weapon procs.)  It's almost as if SOE held the dam/delay ratio up on a pedistal and decided that no matter what the weapon hits for on any given swing (even on a miss), there will be XX aggro generated (based on that ratio).<br />
<br />
ie; I am attacking with a rusty weapon, with a crap dam/delay ratio.  Each swing (hit or miss) against a mob will generate 3 aggro points, let's say.  Now, I will get the fine steel version of that weapon, which has a better dam/delay ratio.  Each swing of that (again, hit or miss) will generate 5 aggro points.  The damage the weapon does on each swing is insignificant.  So, if a weapon hit for exactly 100 damage each time for 10 swings, it would have generated the same aggro had it missed every time.<br />
<br />
That is a quite a revelation for me, since I was brought up believing that damage = aggro.  I was told that over and over by warriors in uber guilds that I looked up to.<br />
<br />
Here's the test results, with analysis.  In each of these cases, I had Chelynn (druid) snare the mob twice and pull it to her, then let it beat on her while I attacked and tried to pull aggro.  These mobs were the guards in WC.  I had a lightstone in my offhand, and absolutely no buffs of any kind, save a &quot;swift arms 1&quot; tribute buff, which increases my worn weapon haste slightly.  I was also wearing a Cloak of flames (36% haste).  Every weapon I equipped in my pri hand had a damage bonus of 13, and no procs went off during the testing.  The mob was kept equidistant from Chelynn and myself, thereby eliminating &quot;proximity aggro&quot;.  Keep in mind that the reason I sometimes get more swings in over time is due to double/triple attack &amp;/or flurries going off.  The &quot;TOTAL TIME&quot; below is the time it took me to pull aggro off Chelynn (get the mob to stop attacking her, turn around, and start attacking me).<br />

Notice that the same number of swings were required to assume aggro control, yet the damage and elapsed time varied.  Also, it's interesting to note that against guard valon, aggro was assumed after a miss.  This fortunate event is what showed me that the damage the weapon randomly puts out each strike is not what is determining the aggro.  (To be more clear...I was swinging at a mob while it was still attacking Chelynn.  Then, after one of my whiffs, it was all over me.  This guarantees that damage output is NOT the factor that is creating the aggro, because the mob went from aggroing on her to aggroing on me in a split second without me damaging it, and all I did was swing at it and miss.  Interesting.)<br />

Note: horrible damage/delay ratio, yet only slightly more swings needed to grab aggro.  It has to be the damage bonus that is allowing this weapon to generate any damage &amp; aggro at all, which leads you to believe that the damage bonus is somehow added in when calculating the &quot;hidden aggro value&quot; of each weapon.  Otherwise, no way would this weapon (2/40) only require one more swing to pull aggro than a 5/36 weapon would...the dam/del ratio is not even half as good!<br />

Near the end of the guard valon encounter was a triple attack, hence the extra swing.  Had that not occured, it would have been just 10 swings needed to obtain aggro.  You may begin to notice that as the delay of the weapon gets lower, the time needed to pull aggro gets lower also, but this is not an accurate observation, as you will see later.  The truth is, the dam/delay ratios are getting better, and that's the reason.  It is true, however, that since the damage bonus is going to be applied more (due to more swings) that a lower delay weapon will get a greater increase to its dps than a higher-delay weapon would, when it's being equipped in the primary hand.<br />

A flurry near the end of the guard valon encounter added one extra swing.  Now comes a very important point.  If you'll notice, the delay on this weapon (21) is not much different from the delay on the fine steel rapier (23).  However, this weapon pulls aggro in 7 swings to the rapier's 10.  Yet, the rapier's delay (23) is much, much better than the rusty broad sword's (36) and it pulls aggro only one (1) swing sooner.   Since we know it's not the damage, and it's not the delay, it has to be the damage/delay ratio that determines the &quot;hidden aggro bonus&quot;.  This would imply that, for example, wrath's edge would command a huge aggro advantage over a corrupted shissar warsword, since a weapon in the 16/20 to 19/20 range has a much better dam/delay ratio than a 13/20 weapon...and that doesn't even add in the proc.<br />

There was a double attack at the end of each of these tests, so it's possible that this weapon will pull the aggro from a double snare in 7 swings, just like the shank.  It is a faster weapon than the wicked shank, but dam/delay ratios are almost identical (.778 ratio to the shank's .762).  In addition, this weapon enjoyed a slightly higher attack rating, courtesy of the 250 skill I have in 1HS, as compared to my 240 skill in piercing. Suffice it to say that the weapons &quot;should&quot; be nearly identical in dps, with the shank holding possibly a slight &quot;mysterious&quot; advantage in aggro. (read on)<br />
-------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
So in summary, my findings show that higher dam/delay ratios (with the damage bonus being added in) yield higher aggro generation per swing.  I am more than welcome to go out anytime, with anyone, and re-perform these tests to verify these results.<br />
<br />
Let's look at the results Vtull's buddy on the SK boards came up with a sec:<br />
<br />
- a dagger (3/20) pulled aggro in 48 swings<br />
- a blade (20/39) pulled aggro in 22 swings<br />
- a hammer (14/24) pulled aggro in 28 swings<br />
<br />
All this makes since, except for the blade.  The hammer has a better dam/del ratio than the blade, and should have pulled aggro in fewer hits (I can gaurantee you it pulled aggro faster if you count elapsed time).  Now, in the case of my shank, it pulled aggro just as fast or even slightly faster than my GBoS, so MAYBE there is a hidden aggro bonus there based on the dam value of the weapon, in addition to the aggro generation based on the weapon's dam/del ratio.  What I mean, in easy to understand terms, is:<br />
<br />
A 15/XX 1HS weapon will create slightly more aggro per swing than a 13/XX weapon.  This aggro &quot;adjustment&quot; is added in before the dam/del ratio is calculated for the &quot;base&quot; aggro.  So, we look at a 15/20 weapon.  We award, say, 6 points of aggro per swing because it has a damage value of 15, then we add in 12 more points of aggro due to it's dam/del ratio of 0.750.  Finally, we add in 3 points of aggro for the damage bonus.  So, total, it had a &quot;hidden aggro bonus&quot; of 21, meaning it generates 21 points of aggro per swing, hit or miss.  Now let's look at a 12/24 weapon.  Let's say this one gets 4 points of aggro due to the damage value of 12, then we add in another 8 points of aggro due to the dam/del ratio of 0.500, and then the 3 points of aggro for the damage bonus.  So we are left with an aggro generation of 15 points per swing for a 12/24 weapon.  This WOULD explain why the shank generated slightly more aggro per swing than the GBoS, even though it had a slightly worse dam/del ratio.  (Again, the numbers I picked for aggro values are arbitrary.)<br />
<br />
Going back to the SK's findings, let's look closer at the blade and the hammer, to try to determine in a RL situation, which one would hold aggro better.  Assume we are tanking mob &quot;X&quot; and are using the hammer.  It will take, according to him, 28 swings to pull aggro off two terris casts.  The hammer, with no haste buffs or haste items, will swing once every 2.4 seconds.  So, in order to swing 28 times, it will take 67.2 seconds to pull aggro.  Now, let's look at the blade.  The blade will swing once every 3.9 seconds, and takes 22 swings to pull aggro.  That would take 85.8 seconds.  This means, that even though it takes the hammer MORE swings, just due to the fact that it is swinging faster, it will pull aggro faster and hold it better than the blade.<br />
<br />
This is why the SK's findings are not worth memorizing blindly, if you are trying to find a weapon that is better than another at holding aggro.  He neglected to include the time factor.  However, it is nice to see that through his findings, there may be that other bonus to aggro based on higher damage values for weapons.  Would be worth looking more into.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u97"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p97">I was determining aggro per swing, getting the aggro over time is simple, you take aggro per swing*avg swings per round/(dly/10), proc rates are easy to obtain and hate values on them aren't much harder.  As I've said before dmg+(bonus*mod) works in all situations so far.  With SCS3 2h weapons with a delay of 29-49 have a modifier of .7, this has been tested and the data doesn't match up with it being related to ratios, I specifically took weapons of equal ratios in some of those tests to disprove that theory.  Without SCS, I think its .82 for the mod, it should be listed in this thread somewhere.<br />
<br />
Ordered by weapon damage (Used 1.2 as dmg bonus mod but there is a range):<br />
<br />
Orc Pawn Pick ~16 hate/swing, 12 swings for aggro<br />
Rusty Broad Sword ~21 hate/swing, 11 swings for aggro275.76<br />
Fine Steel Rapier ~21 hate/swing, 11 swings for aggro<br />
Great Blade of Storms ~29 hate/swing, 8 swings for aggro<br />
Wicked Shank ~32 hate/swing, 7 swings for aggro<br />
<br />
If you apply my formula to that you'll see it works.<br />
<br />
That info atleast says that Knights and Warriors have a different modifier.</div></div><hr />

Did you really look into your reseach each and every way possible?  You only used snare or ensnare off the bat?  Was this druid friend of yours healing you during the combat?  You sure the exact amount of agro snare/ensnare generates?   See one of the nice things about SK's is that we have spells that say exactly the amount of hate we gain.<br />
<br />
To say that the research that Brael did is unsound well that is just foolishness.  Brael spent many hours and days working out the forumla.  Agro generation is not as easy as it seems right off the bat, after spending hours and days with Brael doing this he tought me some things that I didn't know.<br />
<br />
Don't over look the small facts and blow over them Kharlos, they are more important then you think.  In closeing agro generation is not so cut and dry as you think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u99"><b>Kharlos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p99">If you apply my formula to that you'll see it works. <br />
Ok, will check it out and do some more testing, thanks for the input.<br />

Someone needs to chill.  This was not meant to be a rant or flame, in fact, when I said:<br />
<br />
Again, thanks for the great work on an area that I &quot;thought&quot; I knew something about until I was directed to your thread and got motivated to find answers.<br />
That is &quot;warrior speak&quot; for giving credit where credit is due.  I'm sorry that I didn't know how I should have phrased this in &quot;shadowknight speak&quot; so as to convey respect sufficiently.<br />
<br />

Thank you for putting words in my mouth.  I actually did not say this, or even imply it.  The only thing I said was that his data wasn't worth memorizing blindly, meaning, looking at how many swings it takes a certain weapon to pull aggro and believing that THAT weapon is better for holding aggro than a weapon that takes more swings.  I know this, and Brael knows this.  However, there are people who don't read into data enough to understand what they are supposed to be gleaming from it...they see a number, and that's all they focus on.  That's what I was getting at.  Just like how you scanned my entire post and chose to focus on the slightest critique of Brael's research, totally ignoring the positive things.  Not very cool at all.<br />
<br />
To answer a few of your questions tho,<br />
<br />
1) I do not know exactly how much aggro was generated from casting ensnare twice by a lvl 65 female wood elf druid that was kos to the mob to begin with and whose name begins with a &quot;c&quot;, but I am pretty certain it was a consistent amount, from cast to cast, on the same mob type.  That is all that was needed to make a reference for comparison.   And yes, only ensnare was used.<br />
2) Lol, no, the druid was not healing me at all during the fight.  I think each mob may have gotten me down to 99% at the most, so heals weren't really needed.  I do understand something about having a static environment for testing, and under no circumstance would I have chosen a mob type where healing on me was needed.<br />

<br />
GJ Brael, I hate math and suck at it, you sir are a much better man.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u101"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p101">Oh, should mention that Brodda who did the original tests on this stuff did some monk ones and the valid range for that was 1.27-1.4 or so, would have to reread the thread, good chance monks and warriors use the same modifier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u102"><b>Moghedred</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p102">From reading all this, my understanding is that using non-bane weapons on melee-immune mobs like Seru and Emperor Ssra will generate the same amount of hate per swing, despite not doing any damage. <br />
<br />
Is this correct or did I mis-read the example of using non-magic weapons on the &quot;magic&quot; mobs? One experience where our MT on Seru had no bane but had no problems keeping aggro seems to support this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u103"><b>Squigle D'Muerte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p103">It's almost as if SOE held the dam/delay ratio up on a pedistal and decided that no matter what the weapon hits for on any given swing (even on a miss), there will be XX aggro generated (based on that ratio).<br />
  <br />
<br />
That would actually make sense as it is in keeping with the way spells work.  Resisted spells draw just as much aggro as ones that hit (sometimes it seems like more).  So it would make sense to make weapons work the same way.</div></div><hr />
