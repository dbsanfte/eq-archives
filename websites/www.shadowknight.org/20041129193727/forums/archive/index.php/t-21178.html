<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Bah, moved already?<br />
<br />
Yes, a lot of this isn't anything new, but I'm going to try to be as thorough as possible.  (Warning, very long.)<br />
<br />
_________________________________________________<br />
<br />
<br />
First, an overview of the issues SK's are having.<br />
1) Shadowknight desirability during the PoP era stemmed from their reliable snap aggro.  This was an effective counterbalance for warrior superiority in raw tanking.  Warriors are now sufficient in this category, and even further ahead in raw tanking, dramatically reducing value of shadowknights, as warriors do the rest of the job notably better.  <br />
<br />
2) SK's raw tanking power is well behind that of warriors.  Disciplines aside, warriors are roughly 15% better tanks than knights.  This gap is then widened further by defensive, making warriors the only viable tanks for many encounters, and highly preferable tanks for most raid/named mobs.  While there are many things a SK can tank, warriors can almost invariably do the job better.  There are many situations where content is doable with a warrior, but not with a knight (or only by adding more to the size of the party).  <br />
<br />
3) Non-tank classes come very close to SK's in tanking ability.  Opponents of knight upgrades often point out what knights can tank.  DPS-oriented melee classes, rangers in particular, can fill nearly any knight tanking role.  Rangers are very close in raw tanking power to SK's, have equivalent aggro capacity, and even have a distinct advantage in the form of weaponshield.  As such, rangers are sufficient in terms of tanking for nearly anything a knight is - they aren't the best, but then again, neither are knights.  Additionally, rangers can fulfill tank roles that knights cannot due to the power of weaponshield.  That said, non-tank class tanking abilities are largely fine in my opinion.  The problem is that the gap needs to be moved in between knights and non-tanks, rather than being between warriors and knights/non-tanks.  <br />
<br />
4) Shadowknights have effectively lost their pulling role.  They are still capable of pulling, but other classes can do it more effectively.  Bards, and to a lesser extent, clerics, enchanters, rangers, and druids, can pull much more effectively in many situations using different techniques than SK's.  Monks, using exactly the same tactic employed by SK's, can pull more effectively in nearly all situations (especially those encountered on raids).  While some shadowknights still pull for their groups/guilds, this is generally because of the skill of the player.  Given an equivalent monk character, that same player would do the job more effectively.  <br />
<br />
5) Shadowknight utility is no longer a valid argument against more real power (if it ever was).  Aside from the fact that utility is a poor substitute for raw power in most situations, SK's utility has been largely trivialized by item effects and endurance based skills.  <br />
<br />
_________________________________________________<br />
<br />
<br />
An often proposed fix for knights is a defensive disc.  Some among the knight community, along with a number of warriors, oppose this change, especially pre-GoD.  Reasons sited generally revolve around the following.<br />
<br />
1) Warriors only have one role (tanking), thus it's &quot;fair&quot; that they're significantly better at that job than knights.<br />
Knights have always shared that same job.  It is the core function of the knight classes.  The difference is that they have traditionally been balanced in that role by having an advantage over warriors in one area (aggro) to counterbalance their deficiency in another (inferior raw tanking and the lack of disciplines).  Warriors have made significant gains in the traditionally knight-dominated area, thus to maintain the balance, knights need to make gains in the other.  <br />
<br />
2) A defensive discipline for knights would make warriors obsolete as raid MT's.<br />
On account of the fact that warriors have moved in on the conventional knight strengths of offtanking and small group encounters, it would not be unfair for knights to have some functionality in the established warrior role of raid main tanking.  That said, giving knights a defensive discipline would still leave warriors as the preferred raid MT's.  Knights lack such invaluable tools as furious and AE taunt, are roughly 15% behind in raw tanking, and are actually worse in aggro over time.  Furious and AE taunt are hugely important for tank switches - AE taunt makes the point at which aggro is transferred predictable, and furious allows for a lot of added stability.  Lacking these tools, the only spot in the tanking order knights could compete for would be the first spot.  Warriors would still reign supreme for the latter spots due to the ease of tank switching, and being better overall even for the first due to better overall tanking and the value of furious in comparison to the slight knight initial aggro advantage.  <br />
<br />
3) Knights already tank fine pre-GoD outside of raid main tanking.<br />
Sure they do for the most part; they tank exactly as well as they did when they were content, during PoP.  The problem is that warriors now tank significantly better, making knights' sufficient tanking abilities obsolete.  That said, there are some things that knights are insufficient for even pre-GoD and outside of the raid MT role.  To kill the Daiku Overseer with a single group, a warrior is effectively required.  For many bazaar/LDoN-geared groups (which are not out of place progression wise) in BoT, the wing-bosses are nearly impossible with knight tanks, especially compared with defensive warriors.  <br />
<br />
The areas in which knight tanking is &quot;fine&quot; already would not be significantly affected by a defensive discipline.  Defensive would have little bearing on XP mobs, where knights are fine and to which warriors often point to try to say that knights are balanced.  Defensive would have a limited effect on offtanking in pre-GoD content, as offtanking often requires tanking for much longer than the duration of a discipline.  It would, however, have the positive effect of bringing knights into the same league of warriors in areas where defensive is relevant.  If you look at where the balance problems exist, they are where defensive is applicable; knights aren't in bad shape where it is of minimal use.  <br />
<br />
4) Knight tanking inferiority is justified by their spellbooks/utility.<br />
Most knight spells add minimal raw power.  Many are nearly useless, and many are merely utility based.  Utility does not make a class - it is nice to have, but it is no substitute for real power.  Furthermore, much of that utility is available to other classes through item effects and endurance based skills.  Many of those spells which do add real power are greatly overshadowed by the outright superiority of warriors in that to which they contribute.  Others, such as feign death and healing, yield secondary roles, but still leave knights lacking as those roles are as dominated by other classes as tanking is by warriors.  <br />
<br />
Shadowknight spell DPS is not sufficient to be a valid balance issue with regard to tanking.  Warriors are vastly superior DPS while tanking.  When not tanking, they are better at the high end and at least comparable at the low end, particularly over longer periods of time.  <br />
<br />
5) Giving knights defensive would trivialize many old encounters.<br />
Quite simply, it wouldn't.  It would not raise the available tanking power, it would simply distribute it a bit more evenly among the three tank classes.  Any content that would be &quot;trivialized&quot; by giving knights defensive can already be trivialized (and to a greater degree) by replacing that knight with a warrior.  <br />
<br />
_________________________________________________<br />
<br />
<br />
Advantages of a defensive discipline as a fix:<br />
<br />
1) First and foremost - scalability.<br />
Defensive scales extremely well to content.  Lifetaps, leechcurse, runes, etc. do not.  <br />
<br />
2) Would not dramatically impact the areas of the game where knights are fairly well balanced with warriors.<br />
Knights are generally in reasonable shape in comparison to warriors where defensive is not a factor.  Where defensive is applicable, serious issues are evident, however.  <br />
<br />
3) Would set knights apart from non-tank classes to some degree.<br />
Non-tanks would retain the advantage of melee immunity disciplines for very short term tanking tasks.  Knights would open the gap with non-tanks and close the gap (without overcoming it) with warriors on longer encounters, and remain largely uneffected in XP grinds and long-term offtanking roles.  <br />
<br />
_________________________________________________<br />
<br />
<br />
Other things of note:<br />
<br />
1) This is not a GoD problem.  This is a class balance problem, which was highlighted by GoD.<br />
Knight-warrior balance became an issue when the aggro gap was closed.  A logical way to re-establish the balance would be to close the tanking gap.  Hard-hitting GoD mobs simply serve to make this more evident.  <br />
<br />
2) There are supposed to be three tank classes: warriors, paladins, and shadowknights.  <br />
Right now, warriors are far and away the best tanks.  Knights are situational seconds, with DPS-oriented melees filling the #2 spot in others thanks to their melee invulnerability disciplines.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Very well put together Slein Jinn.<br />
<br />
I hope at least somthing (even if minimal) comes from this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Also worth noting that the bulwark-like spell (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5165&amp;source=Test) that has seen much speculation as a possible upcoming knight spell would accomplish much the same thing, and could generally replace &quot;Defensive&quot; in my post.  <br />
<br />
Granted, I don't personally feel that it is intended as a PC spell, but should it end up as such (or something else of the same nature) it would satisfy that which I discussed in the initial post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Elkar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Perfectly stated.</div></div><hr />

On the chance that any dev's are reading this thread...THAT DOES NOT MEAN ALTERING CONTENT !  THAT DOESN'T SOLVE SHIT!<br />
<br />
Instead of sending a damn petition, I recommend everyone use the link to reply to the thread on the eq board.  Maybe they will eventually take a look if it gets the kind of replies and views that newtank threads got.<br />
<br />
It's not like we could &quot;threaten to boycott&quot; on a particular day, and anyone would give a shit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>tyrrax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">One problem with a potential knight fix will be the backlash from the warrior community, specifically the Steel Whiners.  I can just see yet another &quot;Warrior Standown&quot; coming if we do get any changes.  They are dead set against any improvment in knight tanking ability period.<br />
<br />
One other funny thing.  If you mention the words &quot;knight nerf&quot; on the Steel Whiners they will outright deny it.  No one remembers Furor's long childish rants about how warrior were supposed to be godly tanks.  Please...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I personally couldn't care less.  Bitching means nothing to me.  If they can't present a logical case against the issue, they have no business bitching about it - If any of them think they can present a logical case, let them try... they'd have no logical case to be presented.  <br />
<br />
Bitching is one thing, debating actual class balance issues is another.  An aweful lot of warriors seem to excell at the former.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">So I've been trying to decide exactly what it is that will bring knights back up to par... not really anything too earthshattering, but I've not yet seen it really spelled out.  <br />
<br />
<br />
The best I've come up with is a set of two disciplines (separate timers from eachother and unholy aura):<br />
<br />
One similar to weaponshield/furious/etc. - a short duration melee immunity for &quot;oh shit&quot; situations, fight stabalization, etc.  <br />
Parry or a shield block would be ideal - giving us ripost would be encroaching on warriors, especially considering its burst damage is somewhat analagous to HT.  <br />
Duration of 2-4 ticks.  <br />
Reuse upwards of 30mins.<br />
Endurance based, vendor purchased tome.  <br />
<br />
A &quot;mini-defensive&quot; - notably less effective than defensive, but enough to put knights well beyond anything else; perhaps in the order of 25-35% off the DI.  <br />
Much shorter duration than defensive - somewhere around 60-72seconds.  <br />
Short reuse, in the area of 4.5 minutes.  <br />
Endurance based, vendor purchased tome.  <br />
This would be of minimal use as a raid MT, as it's simply too short, and warriors have comfortably better in terms of raw tanking.  Add tanking doesn't generally require much more than a minute, however, and its short reuse would make it ideal for offtanking - it would be readily available as more adds came in.  It would also be sufficient in duration for 1-group named.  <br />
At 72 second duration and 4.5 minute reuse knights would spend less total time under discipline than warriors, assuming both classes were using the disc every time it popped (warriors can spend 1min/3.5 disced, knights would have 1min/3.75).  <br />
<br />
<br />
Play with the numbers if needed, I havn't done alot of extensive math or anything on them at this point - I may at some point.  <br />
<br />
<br />
These combined would still leave us well shy of warriors overall.  They would, however, put us clearly above DPS classes in virtually all tanking situations.  Their specifics would be more tailored to the traditional roles of knights than would other options, implimentation would be fairly simple, they scale marvelously, etc.  <br />
<br />
Content trivialization would not be a problem, as anything that would stand to be &quot;trivialized&quot; by knights tanking with the new abilities would already have been trivialized to a much greater extent by warriors.  <br />
<br />
Do NOT put an aggro or casting time penalty on it.  (Casting time penalty would basically be an aggro penalty anyway.)  We need our aggro to perform our offtanking roles.  Requiring a shield is fine; warriors are required to have two, sometimes 3 weapon sets for different situations - it's perfectly fair that we need different weapon sets as well.  <br />
<br />
<br />
As with all of my class balance posts, feel free to copy it to anywhere you feel so inclined...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Amphitryon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Thanks for the well thought out and laid out post on this topic. Ive tired of the simple &quot;we are broke, fix us because we whine loud&quot; threads<br />
<br />
On the various points<br />
<br />
1) I agree that that we would not displace Warriors from the MT role (a properly equipped warrior will outstrip a SK on HPs, and that often is the deciding factor).  I do disagree that the pallys and SK were meant to be MTs from the get go,. We were classes that could fill in when a warrior was lacking (aka warrior desirable but not required) We are in fact Hybrids, half warrior, not all warrior (personally I think the orginal designers never tought of hybrids in key roles, i think they were more their answer to folks who want to solo more than anything else.<br />
<br />
2) I agree a defensive disc for knights wouldnt be a bad thing, however it should not be equal to the warriors, keeping in line with the fact we are not 100% warrior. There is precedent for this type of thingBTW, like when SKs got put on the old Warrior combat tables when they bumped up the warriors tables.<br />
<br />
3) I agree..Pre-GoD content wont be trivialized anymore than it already has been. If anything it will probably help out smaller guilds (like my own) who have to raid using whatveer folks happen to be online, we dont have the luxury of having the ideal classes for our encounters. Again..the disc should not be equal to a warriors defensive disc.<br />
<br />
4.) Again with pulling, i think there is nothing to complain about here. When grping and no monk is around, SKs get to pull. If a good monk is there, he gets to pull. Seems pretty fair to me. (most of the time, there arent monks available when I play, so I do quite a bit of pulling). ANd in quite a few places, only monks can pull the pulls off effectively - insta FD &gt; fast cast FD. I really think there is no valid complaint here<br />
<br />
5) To the solo, small grp SK, utility is what it is about, so dont dis the utility spells..They are far from useless. They accomodate a different style of game play, one of which i believe our class was designed from the get go for. I for one like the independence these spells grant me. Its nice to go mano-e-mano with a mob and know i can take it out. I dont see a valid complaint here..useless is in the eye of the beholder..if all you do is tank, then yea our spells seem week..but then again if all you do is tank, why did you pick a SK to play instead of a warrior in the first place? (sorry becoming a warrior who can cast, wasnt in the game plan, thats not what hybrids are about)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Actually, hybrids were originally intended to be MORE powerful than warriors.  It was a case of gaining increased power for increased penalties (re: large group-wide hybrid XP penalty).  In the end, that didn't work out that way, and the game has long since moved away from that.  <br />
<br />
It's to the point now that to say &quot;knights are only part warrior&quot; means jack shit - we're not warriors in any shape or form.  We're separate entities.  The fact that we happen to share the tanking role is irrelivant to that.  <br />
<br />
We don't need a defensive-style disc &quot;because we're part warrior&quot; - the part warrior notion is dead for all purposes other than as a tool used by warriors to supress knight balance.  We need it because it's the most effective way to fix the tanking problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Steelbreeze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">What about an AA defensive ability?  It'd be easy enough to implement with Omens of War coming out.  Also they could make it cost like 10 or 15 aa so that not every sk would have it and war's couldnt bitch.</div></div><hr />

What about an AA defensive ability?  It'd be easy enough to implement with Omens of War coming out.  Also they could make it cost like 10 or 15 aa so that not every sk would have it and war's couldnt bitch.  <br />
<br />
It wouldn't have any advantages over discs - warriors will bitch anyway, any SK idiot can grind 10-15 AA's, etc.  It shouldn't be limited to certain SK's anyway - this is a problem that effects all 65 SK's, as I went into pretty clearly in the first post.  <br />
<br />
Our fix shouldn't require us to work for it however.  SK offtanking abilities are broken, and this is a way to fix it.  If you buy a car, and something on it is broken, does the dealer sell you the parts and leave the labor to you, or do they fix the problem?  If the dealer's worth their weight in dog shit, the answer should be clear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Maniacles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">So a decent spell equivalent would be the melee suck....<br />
<br />
aka &quot;By fighting you only make me stronger, muahahaha&quot;<br />
<br />
a debuff that sends a % of the damage of every melee hit of the afflicted mob as healing hit points to the caster of the debuff.<br />
<br />
5% 10% 15% 20% 25% 30% 35% heck, maybe even eventually 50% (i'd cap it at 35%, but then I'd cap slow at 35% as well)<br />
<br />
This would be an entirely sk centric method of healing/mitigation which the warriors would have ZERO, and I mean ZERO position to argue against.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Doesn't keep you from getting 1-rounded, thus it'll only do half the job.  It's been suggested many times, and it's just not a fisable solution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Harok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">It's sad to see how far the SK has fallen.  SE and Verant have painted themselves into a corner by their idiotic decisions and now the SKs suffer for it as always and it all started at the beginning.  Originally SKs were not meant to be party tankers for the most part.  Every description of a SK had them as a combat monster who used a combination of martial prowess and arcane skill to devastate enemies.  IOW we were supposed to be among the supreme damage dealers in the game.  Unfortunately because a number of the developers favored rangers and hated evil classes that task went to them and SKs were left in the dust.  At the time the idea of using a SK to tank other than as a last resort met with derision at the higher levels.  Yes SKs could tank but Paladins and especially Warriors were better at it.  It was &quot;common knowledge&quot; that SKs sit on the sides of battle, hit the mob for their pitiful damage, and occassionally take a hit to which we were given the lowest healing priority.  We were gimp tanks no more, no less.<br />
<br />
Then came Velious and towards the end of that expansion the developers magically reveal that SKs are supposed to be good at tanking and decide to start beefing up their defensive abilities.  They completely abandoned the original theme of the SK in order to make him a more viable tank.  Note that prior to this statement there had been SKs out there including myself who had been proving that SKs could indeed tank since Kunark came out.  After that statement was made SKs became secondary tanks and the kings of aggro.  We were the ones who saved the Enchanter's butt when a mez broke.  We were the ones the casters turned to when they cast one spell too many and had to get the mob pulled off them before they became a corpse.  This kicked off what pretty much became the Golden Age of the SK where Verant got off its lazy ass and started attempting to fix our class.  It continued all the way to Planes of Power.<br />
<br />
Sadly that time is now over.  Warriors kept complaining about SKs due to a sick, arrogant view that they were supposed to be the kings of combat bar none.  The Rangers joined them in this statement and the Paladins complained simply for the sake of complaining despite the fact that it was also a prosperous time for them.  Of course Verant and SE had to listen to the Warriors and Rangers as they were two of the main classes of EQ and so we now have this piece of shit expansion that has once again reduced us to uselessness. :mad:  <br />
<br />
So how do we fix the SK class?  :confused: I say we abandon this foolish defensive warrior crap and rise to position we were meant to have in the beginning: Melee/Magic combo damage monster of doom.  Give us better DDs and a tweak in melee damage so we can't actually put a significant hurt on the mob without having to resort to HT.  Give us better debuffs that actually can cripple a mob when stacked on them.  As it stands the majority of our spell list is a cruel joke.  Most of the recent additions to it were a pathetic attempt to placate angry SKs who saw that for the most part their magic was pointless.  We need to drop this defensive crap because we will never be as good at it as the Warriors and Paladins.  The Paladins are supposed to be the defensive knights, we are supposed to the offensive ones.  I don't it care if the other melee classes complain about it, this is what we were supposed to be in the first place.  Screw them and their stupidity and let the SKs have their birthright!</div></div><hr />

1) most of that post was 100% irrelivant to this thread.<br />
<br />
2) a fuckton of it was simply wrong.<br />
<br />
3) there are too many DPS classes as it is - trying to add us to the list would be bad for our class and the game alike.  <br />
<br />
4) SK's wanting SK's to tank worse than pallys are going to kill the class.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Woah there, originally SKs were gimp tank and great damage dealers?<br />
<br />
SKs stoped to be damage dealers mid way trough Beta A, when they lost dual weild.<br />
<br />
Granted, for a few months after release they were seriously lacking hp wise, but that got fixed before the release of Kunark. Even with their original hp state, they could tank just fine for everything. I personally main tanked just fine on dragon raids back then.<br />
<br />
Warriors were much better damage dealers than Shadowknights, since they had dual weild, but the ability to snare and to FD pull were good enough to make up for this lack of damage output in your everyday xp group.<br />
<br />
At the time the ultimate classes were rangers and necros. A ranger with full Rubicite and Vox scimmy could tank just as well as a warrior and virtually outdamage a whole raid party. Necros were simply a full group tightly packed into a single character.<br />
<br />
The only time in history, after release, were SKs could be seen as somewhat decent damage dealers was in the first Tiers of PoP (not an actual damage dealing class mind you, but simply a decent damage dealer, being then roughly on par with monks). Spears, BoH and SoC-SA3 could count for a good chunk of the damage output of the class. As weapons got better, the magical ouput of the SK faded in comparaison to their melee output, and the other classes using only weapons as a form of damage ouput either would catch up and surpass the SK (warriors) or simply get even further ahead (monks/rogues/rangers).<br />
<br />
The game currently is made this way :<br />

Tanks : Paladins, Shadowknights and Warriors<br />
Damage dealers : Beastlords, Berzerkers, Mages, Monks, Necromancers, Rangers, Rogues and Wizards<br />
Healers : Clerics, Druids and Shamen<br />
Support/slow/CC : Bards, Beastlords, Enchanters and Shamen<br />

As a tank, Shadowknights only fight with 2 other classes for their spot. Make them mainly damage dealers and you're going to fight with 8 other classes.<br />

Go go smart guy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Harok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">No I didn't say that we were better damage dealers in melee than warriors, in fact we were never meant to be.  I was saying that originally the concept of the SK was a character who could survive in melee but what let them at least keep pace with the damage of a warrior was the use of necro magic in conjunction with melee.  Basically we were supposed to do 3 things:<br />
<br />
1. Gimp the mob with debuffs.<br />
2. Lay on DoTs and some DD spells throughout the fight (though we got jack and shit for DD spells as it turned out).<br />
3. Use our ability to fight in close (better than casters, worse than Paladin/Warrior) to be able to last long enough until the mob died.  <br />
<br />
Theoretically that was the idea at least.  Unofrtunately anyone who's played in the beginning will now that the beginning line of magic for a SK sucked ass to the point where it was almost completely ineffective.  We were put so far down the line on spell progression that our DoTs were practically worthless compared to what were fighting at the levels we got them.  Verant didn't really begin to try to fix this until the latter days of Kunark.  And we still had to deal with the damn hybrid experience penalty to boot.<br />
<br />
Instead of being the &quot;offensive hybrid class&quot; we were supposed to be, SKs ended up being mediocre at damage.  We did little more than Paladins could which was a far cry from what we were originally envisioned to do.  Eventually though they just seemed to stop trying to make the SK an offensive hybrid and decided to make him into a defesnive hybrid.  Back in the beginning SKs were gimped tanks compared to Palladins and Warriors.  Less defense usally because our spell list wasn't designed for tanking back in the day coupled with lower HP made us less effective than those two classes.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Ninaelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Brenlo popped up a few times on the SOE board, he even said he realized there is a problem with SK tanking as far as not being up to par with the other classes, but he insisted that the answer to the problem was to &quot;retune the content.&quot; The content is just fine, the classes are screwed. even in PoP we feel it, I am the top SK in my guild (freshly ep'd) as far as hp/ac/aa goes and I'm prolly #3 overall of knights on hp, above many warriors, and yet I very rarely tank any mobs outside of tier 1 backflag mobs. for the most part warriors are doing all the tanking, what little is assigned to knights goes to the pallys. we definately need some changes made to the actual classes, retuning content is the easy way out and a temporary fix at best. on the plus side Brenlo did mention something about adding a ws/avoidance/fortitude type disc for knights, small duration/long recast time no doubt which may help a bit on raids but isn't going to go far to addressing the core issue and isn't gonna give us jack in groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Nobody officially associated with sony ever commented on/acknowledged the thread in which my disc's were discussed/proposed/supported/whatever on the SOE boards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Neherenia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I miss our old debuffing abilities.  I liked using Shroud of Hate, Shroud of Pain, and Abduction of Strength at the lower levels to fuck up a mob.  Gave me satisfaction.  Fit my idea of a Shadowknight very nicely.  We gain in strength at our foe's expense.  Slein's discs and some real debuffs (shroud of hate/pain upgrades) and I would be quite happy.  Some spell improvements and a real pet would be nice too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Look at our OoW spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Neherenia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Dark Constriction is the only one that really strikes my interest, outside perhaps the new zevfeers.  Not an impressive line-up yet.  Still, its getting better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Note that aura of hate/pain upgrades are debuffs.  You asked for debuffs.<br />
<br />
Overall our spells are actually very good so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Neherenia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">As far as I can tell from the spell data at Lucy and Alakhazams looks like more hp to attack/ac crap like the Auras.  I hope you're right and I'm wrong though Slein lol :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Humm, now that I look it is a DD/recourse - someone told me it was a debuff and I never followed up on it because frankly, I don't care.  Its impact is negligable either way.  The small DD won't really dent a mob, but our debuffs have never made a noteworthy difference either, and I highly doubt they ever will - aside from resists and slows, virtually all debuffs are... underwhelming.<br />
<br />
Just the same, our spells are looking quite good so far overall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I like the proposed changes. I would love to see where you get the 15% damage differance though. TSW wont come up with a specific number (yet) though most agree its between 5 and 12%. <br />
<br />
Knights definatly need &quot;Burst Mitigation&quot; ability so they really are better tanks than anyone but warriors.</div></div><hr />
