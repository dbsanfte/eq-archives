<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kromglon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Really isnt an sk tactic question but more of a group related. When I run a group I want to know whats up and know when people are doing stupid things. So I figure you guys know your shit here Ill ask the experts.<br />
<br />
Group 1 LDON mid 20's 1 sk (me) 2 paladins, mage, druid, shaman. Druid doesnt want to be main healer, I trust the shaman anyways close friend. So I ask the druid to be back up healer, nuker etc he doesnt have a clue because I basically get no response. Now comes to the part Im kinda scratching my head on. I dont think this is a good tactic but I could be wrong I guess.<br />
<br />
Druid is healing the shaman whos running regen and canny. Im asking my buddy wtf why is this druid always oom. The guy is apprently healing the shaman whenever he gets a bit low. So I dont know that sounds kinda messed up since the druid is always oom from putting dots on blue crap that drops in 15 seconds and healing the shaman. This was after the shaman explained to him a few times he was doing canniblize. Anyways we won, but Im not so sure about that tactic.<br />
<br />
Group 2 1 sk, 1 enc, 1 shaman, 1 paladin, 1 rogue,1 necro.<br />
<br />
Soon as the necro joins the group he goes. &quot;Oh shaman main healer? Regen me and Ill heal you over time&quot; Never found out because few went ld and the rest of us called it a night. I have no clue if thats a valid tactic. Basically just wondering if those two are bullshit or good grouping tactics.<br />
<br />
Im open to tactics and Im not about to stop in a middle of a LDON mission to question it. Just Id like to know for future reference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>yerr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1) Hope you wrote the dr00d's name down.  Avoid him/her like the plague.<br />
<br />
2) Necros get some nice HP transfer spells, sounds like they knew what they were doing.</div></div><hr />

The Necro is making himself as useful as he can be at that level.  Until level 60-65 a necro needs mobs to live for almost 90 seconds to really be effective and efficient using his mana for DoT's.  In the Early 20's he probably only has 2 spells he can realistically cast on each mob since I am assuming they are going down in around 40 seconds...the Poison DD line (thought level 24 was lowest) they added when we received our spears and of course his Lifetap.  The Lifetap is not efficient at all at that level but since it's his only other DD it's all he can do.  He is making his lifetap efficient/useful by healing the Shammie or anyone else since it only costs him 10 mana to heal 20hp/tick for 4 ticks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Smyrt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If we assume the necro was &gt;= 24 then he could be mezzing adds with Screaming Terror. Enchanters like having a backup mezzer. Snaring with Darkness would also be one of the necro's jobs. <br />
<br />
Healing the shaman and tapping the health back are good tactics, though, so I'd say the necro was doing fine, especially if he's got the research-only 24 pet and the focus spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kromglon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Alright thanksfor the good info always helpfull to understand what the other classes are doing. The druid healing like that didnt make sense to me but whatever maybe he will get the idea sometime hopefully.</div></div><hr />

I wouldn't hold out hope for the druid.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mynka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Sounds like the Dr00d was a moron...  I've noticed a lot of druids like to use DoT's in LDoN when mobs drop SO fast.  I was grouped with a druid yesterday in LDoN and he complained about not having mana the whole time, yet EVERY fight he was dropping his swarm dot on the mob.  /boggle<br />
<br />
Sounds to me like you had a competent Necro, which is an awesome asset to any group!<br />
