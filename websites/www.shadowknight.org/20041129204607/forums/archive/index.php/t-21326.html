<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Yaromov</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As I have read most of the posts people think that giving a Shadow Knight and Palidin a defensive type spell or disc seems to be the general consensous. I don't necessarily disagree with this however it seems SOE doesn't like the idea as it is yet to be implmented. A few other idea's are giving SK's life tap type shields and Pal's heal type sheilds as 65 spells. I have a new Idea.<br />
<br />
Shadow Knights as traditionally associated with hate, pain, and death a spell similar to this might be what we could use. A spell with that would deal a great deal of damage to the mob with the Shadow Knights death might me a new fix. The amount of health the Shadow Knight has, or the amount of damage delt to the Shadow Knight over time are some options.<br />
<br />
Basicly it would do this.<br />
<br />
Shadow Knight cast's &quot;Final Revenge&quot; (or whatever spell is called)<br />
<br />
Option 1:<br />
Shadow Knight Goes and tanks Mob<br />
SK's Hp: 9k buffed<br />
With the SK's death deal 9k damage to the mob.<br />
<br />
Option 2:<br />
Shadow Knight goes and tanks Mob<br />
Mob deals: X amount of Damage to Shadow Knight before death<br />
SK dies and the mob takes X amount of damage<br />
<br />
This would be very similar for Paladins but they would perhaps take no damage for 1 minute or possibly come back to life w/ full buffs and hp after they die for the first time.<br />
<br />
I would be happy with this as it would work for both group and raid encounters. Slightly different but it &quot;Might&quot; save a group/raid or become massive extra dps/dam absorbsion. I think that it would balance some of the problems that Shadow Knight's are now facing. It might not let us Tank GoD encounters but then it might fataly wound/kill the mobs and allow another tank to get on it with less health for Shadow Knights. For paladins using a bit of Tank switching and you could reduce mana use by quite a bit. I'm not posting reuse time/mana cost ect. I don't know if many would think of this as a good fix however I think that it could make use usefull and possibly required on some raids as well as group encounters. This obviously isn't a end all be all fix however I think it would help balance us out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't think Shadow Knights is about self sacrafice.  More like we could sacrafice a paladin maybe to do 10k damage that might be better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Pointless, because it doesn't actually help us tank better.  The idea is we stay alive, not that we do more damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">So the pally takes no damage for a minute, dies and is rezzed fully buffed with no effects and the SK dies and does &lt;10K damage to the mob?  <br />
<br />
That doesn't seemed balanced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Maniacles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Dude, just give me autofeign, which makes me feign instead of die on the final melee hit.  Can still die to ae's spells other stuff...but still....</div></div><hr />
