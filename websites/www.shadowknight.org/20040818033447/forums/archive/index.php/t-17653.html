<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Morgrist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My attempt to find this guy turned into a bad episode of &quot;Where's Waldo the Erudite?&quot;. I can't find him in his supposed room in the undead tower. Nor anywhere else.<br />
 <br />
Which sucks on ice, as he's the starting mob I need for my phylactery quest (no,NOT the paladin one. The new one.)...<br />
<br />
 Anyone seen him ANYWHERE down there since the revamp to Old Paineel? Respawn time(s)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Eshara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Does anyone know?<br />
<br />
I'm helping a friend get a book from Dartain and I would like to know the same.  We think hes in the basement(?) where all the heretic skeletons spawn (by the graveyard), but we've been camping there and havnt seen him once.  We arent sure if that is the right spot or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">he's MIA</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Laronx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">no, he's lost hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Bleah.  Just like Verant to fix a buggy quest by removing the starting NPC while they work on the quest and then forget to repair the quest and return the NPC. :(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Itzena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Three main theories about this now: <br />
Theory 1: Dartain The Lost is still in Old Paineel, just moved/a rare spawn/a triggered spawn.<br />
<br />
Theory 2: A different mob drops the tome now.<br />
<br />
Theory 3: Dartain has had a name-change (to, say, 'Protector of the Ruins)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Itzena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">And theory 2 was the correct one.<br />
Tome of Miragul is now dropping from Ancient Constructs in Ruins of Old Paineel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>neferaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Has anyone gotten the phylactery yet? All I am seeing so far is int casters and wis casters getting the tunic and the robe.<br />
<br />
--- from the quest description site by by KyrosKrane Sylvanblade:<br />
<br />
Before the recent revamp of The Hole, the Tome of Miragul dropped off a mob called Dartain the Lost. However, we have had multiple reports from multiple servers that the Tome now drops from An Ancient Construct; the Tome started dropping in quantity after the patch of November 5, 2003.  Here are some details on the Ancient Construct.<br />
<br />
an ancient construct - roamer, ... has a ruined construct as a ph. Both named and ph hit in the 160ish range, spells land fine, probably 10-12k or so hp, maybe as many as 20k, don't think so though. <br />
<br />
Another poster commented:<br />
<br />
When I was looking around The Hole last Friday, we had ancient constructs spawn 2 or 3 times in different parts of the city. They appear to be able to spawn in place of any ruined construct or at least any that are far enough into the city to be dark blue to 65.<br />
<br />
Some posters suggest that the book may be a drop from any named with a PH. Here is a list of wandering placeholders and their associated named mobs:<br />
<br />
Placeholder Named Mob <br />
a destroyed construct an old construct <br />
a destroyed gargoyle an old gargoyle <br />
a ruined construct an ancient construct <br />
a ruined gargoyle an ancient gargoyle <br />
<br />
If you get the Tome dropping off any of the mobs, please report it at the EQTraders threads linked above.  Do note, though, that thus far, all reported drops have come exclusively from Ancient Constructs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Itzena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">One of the tradeskill steps (the stone silk one) is currently unsolved, which is why no phylacteries yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>neferaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Quest is solved now, but the final item is a little disappointing imo (for a SK atleast). Either 2 mana and 2 health per tick or 5 health per tick but a lot of negative stats (neg 50 to HP for example). Did anyone do the book quest for a melee character? All I have seen are the int/wis caster FT4 robes/tunics.</div></div><hr />
