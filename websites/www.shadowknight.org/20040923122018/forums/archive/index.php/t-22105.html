<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Axxon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Dammit, I know this has been covered before but I can't find it.  I am looking for advice on what gems you have up in a normal xp group.  Ususally mine looks something like this:<br />
<br />
1. Life Leech<br />
2. next highest tap available.<br />
3. spear (high)<br />
4. spear (mid)<br />
5. spear (low)<br />
6. CD<br />
7. could be anything and changes based on need; usually terror until a proc or debuff runs out<br />
8. Comatose<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">xp group at lvl 65<br />
<br />
1. Clinging Darkness<br />
2. Aura of Pain<br />
3. Zevfeers Bite<br />
4. Aura of Hate<br />
5. Best Spear<br />
6. Best DoT<br />
7. Best Lifetap<br />
8. Best FD<br />
<br />
and I can't spell either<br />
I guess in earlier levels I used Torrents instead of Aura's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">1) Snare (either clinging or festering depending on if they're runners)<br />
2) Zevfeer's Bite<br />
3) Touch of Innoruuk<br />
4) Highest level Spear or Aura of Hate (depends on group makeup / buff slots)<br />
5) Fear<br />
6) Aura of Pain<br />
7) Pet haste / proc buff / CoL / Pact of hate / whatever the situation requires<br />
8) Death Peace<br />
<br />
This is all at level 65, of course.  I've found that with my mana regen is usually isn't practical to keep more than one spear spell memorized, but if I don't have any memorized at all I feel like I'm wasting mana left and right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">ToI  (100% of the time this is here)<br />
ToV (typically use this because of the horrid spear resist rates)<br />
CD/FD/Fear (whatever agro spell I feel like using)<br />
BoH (the &quot;whatever&quot; slot)<br />
Ancient ZB (100% of the time this is here)<br />
ZB (100% of the time this is here)<br />
HS (100% of the time this is here)<br />
DP (100% of the time this is here)<br />
<br />
Embracing the role of mana battery.  Yay for 3 slots to work with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Noctix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The original poster is only level 55, so I'm not sure all these level 65 spell lineups are useful to him.<br />
<br />
Level 55 is kind of a sucky place to be spellwise.  Axxon's lineup looks to be about what I used at that level.  Maybe think about rotating in ac/atk taps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Chania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">With the advent of spell loadouts, I have a number of lineups that I use:<br />
<br />
Tanking<br />
Offence<br />
Offence Healing<br />
Offence Undead<br />
Soloing<br />
Buffage<br />
CR<br />
<br />
In Tanking I have Aura of Pain with a taunt setup, Offence I load up dots/spears/taps, Offence Healing I swap in Volatis and BoD, Undead is self evident, Soloing/Buffage too, and CR has spells like Bobbing Corpse, Invis, Shadow Step, anything I could think of to get me out of a sticky, naked situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bushido32</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm 54th level and my usual spell lineup includes:<br />
<br />
1) Spear (low)<br />
2) Spear (mid)<br />
3) Spear (high)<br />
4) Situational (Dooming Darkness, Siphon Life, or Dismiss Undead)<br />
5) Blood of Pain <br />
6) Clinging Darkness <br />
7) Proc, DS, or Invis (Mental Corruption, Banshee Aura, or Gather Shadows)<br />
8) Feign Death<br />
<br />
I don't use taps unless I'm soloing and worrying about health.  I never use taps in groups unless the healer is an idiot.  I usually cast Blood of Pain early in fights.  I use Clinging for snare and agro.  I'd say 75% of my mana goes to casting spears.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Moonslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My typical raid / exp setup is as follow and I change stuff out depends on the encounter.<br />
<br />
Death Peace<br />
Harmshield<br />
Aura of Pain / Hate<br />
Zevfeer's Bite<br />
Miasmic Spear<br />
Spear of Decay<br />
Touch of Innoruuk<br />
Festering Darkness<br />
<br />
*edit* Yeah, you're going to think I'm wasting a slot on Harmshield but it's saved my ass more times than I can count.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The original poster's spell lineup looks fine for his level, though maybe I would switch out the lowest spear for Aura of Hate.  Personal preference wins out on that one.  I posted my lineup at level 65 without any Gates spells because the question was what do other SKs use for exp grouping.  For raiding, I often drop the spear and replace it with blood of hate, and I will ditch the pet buff / self buff slot for Harmshield and just rotate out other spells when I need to buff.  Harmshield has proven to be quite useful on raids, whether it be early fight mob positioning, long pulls with fast mobs, or setting myself up to be the rampage tank, all things I have been asked to do at times.  I almost never drop the lifetaps, because I like having that extra couple hundred hitpoints in an emergency if I need it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Yabyab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">1) Zevfeer's Bite (always here unless am PvPing)<br />
 2) Touch of Innoruuk (ALWAYS here)<br />
 3) Clinging Darkness (always here unless am soloing/pvping)<br />
 4) Best Spear (switch it with Touch of Volatis if am against disease resistant guys)<br />
 5) Aura of Hate (switch it with Blood of Hate if I have Full Caster group since they dont need the +ATK)<br />
 6) Aura of Pain (almost always here)<br />
 7) Mana Proc (if against guys who resist it, switch with Blood of Hate and keep Aura of Hate in slot 5)<br />
 8) Death Peace (almost always here unless I know I wont get in sticky situations)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Silvershadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well, again at 65, but a rough idea at least:<br />
1) Touch of Innoruuk (always)<br />
2) DoT of choice (Blood of Hate usually, Bond or Festering sometimes)<br />
3) Clinging (for aggro in non-mez situations, other aggro spell otherwise)<br />
4) Death Peace (always)<br />
5) Zevfeer's Bite (always)<br />
6-8) varies, usually Harmshield at 8 and self buffs/pet stuff/nuke/auras/etc in 6-7</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Crasek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I will sometimes mem the one slot cancel magic spell if I'm pulling in LDoN with an unknown chanter in group, helps with damage shields and no dot to mess up mezzes. Will also pull with it in other zones if I know I have time to land one CD on it before the slower casts.<br />
<br />
Situationally, I will mem the low level fear spell and pact of hate.<br />
<br />
Other then that, my spell line up looks similar to what others have posted.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Grarg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">1 TOI<br />

3 Fear<br />
4 Z-Byte<br />
5 T of Vitality (helps the slower [my sham] land slow)<br />
6 FD<br />
7 T or Pain (when i want some AC stealage else its a spear)<br />
8 T of Hate (When im in a heavy tank group, else its a buff)<br />
<br />
I will often swap ToH out for a second lifetap if im tanking things that are a bit tough to slow.<br />
<br />
My focus is on the ability to snare/fear and keep the mob on me so I can patch heal, pull and slow with the sham. I rarely ever single box.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Axxon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">What can I say?  Thanks very much.  This is all very useful  - not only for now but as I level.  I appreciate the time and thought you all took to post.</div></div><hr />

4)   Darkness or Fear<br />
5)   Terror (Terror works for what I need it to do.  If I am tanking in an exp group darkness and spear hold agro without casting anything else....if it's a mob I know has a lot of HPs and the fight will go longer than 30 sec I'll throw one terror in, it's all I need and I try to stay out of the habbit for fear the mob is sub 55 using fear)<br />
6)   Harmshield (raid) / AoP (exp tanking) / AoH (exp when not tanking)<br />
7)   Spear of Decay<br />
8)   Death Peace</div></div><hr />

<br />
Where are you fighting in xp groups where you'll be fighting &lt; lvl 55 mobs? If you're doing this in a non-regular xp group, you should still know whether mobs will fear or not, because fear &gt; terror in all situations where the mob won't be feared. When they are fearable, CD or CD/FD is the combo to use. Screw terrors, seriously.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Zulpel Bonstalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">1. Touch of Voltalis - Blood of Hate - Scythe of Innoruuk<br />
2. Zevfeer's Bite or a Terror on those highly disease resistant mobs ( just because I cant think of anything else to stick there.<br />
3. Spear of Plague<br />
4. Touch of Innoruuk<br />
5. Clinging or Festering Depending on runners<br />
6. Aura of Darkness - Swap out for Buffs, Pact of Hate, Shroud of Chaos, Call of Darkness<br />
7. Voice of Thule<br />
8. Death Peace<br />
<br />
I keep my spells this way because I use alt + the corresponding number to cast, and I cast the top 5 spells alot, and the bottom 3 not so often while tanking...<br />
<br />
In almost all situations I never use a terror, even to get aggro to break a mezz, because it just isnt worth the time, or the spell slot.  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />
