I am fully buffed, with haste, and I DO NOT taunt, OR cast, and I still get aggrol. Can SKs be MT when fighting a boss MOB? and jus because we are masters of aggro, why is everyone down on us? I believe if I am main Tank, and can Lock aggro, as long as cleric are doing they're job, why shouldnt I be MT? It would save alot of lives.. Please post your thought on SKs as MT when fighting boss MOBs, and how we can obtain uber tank status :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
 At 53 you should not be tanking boss mobs, nor should you later on in most cases since a warrior is a better choice for it than you. Just because you can outaggro a warrior doesn't mean you should, any tool can do that, and since you are born with ways to lose aggro fast (FD), that is what you should be doing if you gain aggro in a fight where you shouldn't be. Also notice that you are not the one who decides if you should be tanking ina  fight, your raid leader is, and if he/she says you shouldn't then you follow orders.<br />
<br />
 In some high end encounters, SKs might be the better choice for a tank, but you have a lot of leveling and AA points to do before that SK will be you.</div></div><hr />

You just can't tank that kind of thing at your level.<br />
<br />
I'd suggest you ask the more experienced members of your guild to watch you and let you know what you're doing wrong, so you can improve.<br />
<br />
A well played level 53 SK won't get aggro on raids unless you're all in the process of getting wiped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">clayith</div><div class="date">10-18-2003, 11:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A couple of other things you can do. When i find I am stealing agro, these things will end it.<br />
<br />
1. Fd.<br />
2. Turn off attack for a bit. after a few trys you will see what % you should turn Attack back on without it bothering the MT. I usually wait to attack until 96% for Warriors, this allows them to generate enought argo over time that you will not ping pong. This works best with MT's that are Warriors.<br />
3. Switch weapons. Sometime the weapons i use are a little stronger than the MT, by sitching down to a slower weapon or even to a 1hs weapon i reduce my agro. Yes it reduces your dsp but save ping pong effect vs Healers mana.<br />
<br />
As for you level vs Mob bosses, for minors one maybe. For Vindi no. You just wouldn't have enough HP's and the Healers wouldn't have enought mana, for all the CHin. Sorry Bud, no offence meant. At 62 more AC, and just under the HPsof the guys who MT Vindi for my guild, I still am glad i don't get to MT him. another 3 levels maybe.<br />

Can SKs be MT when fighting a boss MOB? <br />
With the right equipment, levels, and AA's.  Someone level 53 isn't going to meet any of those requirements yet, however.<br />
<br />
Us being &quot;masters of aggro&quot; also involves control, not just pure generation.  It is possible to control how much aggro you have, and if you choose not to do that then your guild was right in bitching you out.</div></div><hr />

From 51 to 54, I have never drawn even a look from Vindi, with max haste and a WMBS.<br />

I accept this as a given. When I 'group' with warriors and frequently on named mobs, I work with them on the aggro. We are vastly superior at 'snap' aggro and  the debuffers love that. If you are a 53 SK and want to help your guild kill vindi, I would suggest working as a partner with the MT. On INC, cast snare on the mob, while standing immediately behind the MT (so he is closer to the mob than you). If your lucky, he'll taunt it off you on his first taunt and he 'gets' SK aggro and you don't become wall art. (Note, becasue you are only expected to have aggro very briefly, don't expect heals as they will all be busy healing the MT =)</div></div><hr />

Cute idea, except Vindi rampage, so the poor little sk will be a smear on the wall fairly fast :)</div></div><hr />

 Listen and learn. Theres alot you dont know, hell theres still alot to learn at 65. I learn new shit all the time. Talk to the higher Sks or warriors or whomever  you respect, and ask them to help you.<br />
 If you get yelled at, find out what the fuck you did wrong and dont do it again. FUcking up one time is learning. Fucking up doing the same shit over and over is just stupidity.</div></div><hr />

I'm sure when you are in a group and MT you don't like those pesky tree hugging rangers and flute blowin bards stealing agro from you (and trust me if they want to they can, for a minute or two anyway). FD is your friend and if you can get the spell comotose it casts faster. <br />

<br />
First time I tanked vindi was at level 62, with no defensive AA, and it really taxed the clerics. Now, at 65 with maxed defensive AA it's a simple matter for them to keep up.<br />
<br />
As you've mentioned SK can be great tanks on many mobs up PoP tier 2 bosses (Roughly).<br />
<br />
For one reason and another I've tanked everything except for the really large hitters (Haven't had a pop at AoW yet, which i really want to do), at our level - Pre-Elemental.<br />
<br />
And on occasions, provided you have the healers to support you, SK makes an ideal tank. Even on boss mobs. But whatever happens we will always take more damage than a similarly equipped, similarly AA'd warrior. And we will always have less HP than said warrior.<br />
<br />

Good luck with the aggro management - vital skill if you want to continue progressing<br />

Warriors are better tanks than us. I accept this as a given. <br />
<br />
<br />
Im not so sure I agree with this sentiment.  As many WAR love to point out, the fact that they can take a better beating means little if they can't get the mob to hit them.  Translation?  Agro control *is* a part of tanking.  <br />
<br />
This leads us along the lines of one of his main question which was can a SHD tank a boss mob?<br />
<br />
The answer is certainly (as can a PAL).  The only *significant* difference between a WAR MT and a SHD/PAL (&quot;hybrid&quot;) MT is the use of /defensive.  That's pretty much it.  Without defensive, I would take a hybrid tank over a WAR every single time due to nothing more then better agro control, which is pretty much everything against boss mobs.<br />
<br />
Hell, its heavily debated in my guild right now between who will act as MT and that includes even WHEN /defensive is up.  A hybrid tank really allows the other DPS classes to *open-up* to a noticable degree and drop the mob faster.  The drawback, of course, is that the heals must generally come faster, as /defensive will reduce the damage received (which on most PoP boss mobs, is a scary thing).<br />
<br />
At the end of the day, WAR in my guild end up tanking most of the time, but it isn't vastly accepted as the *best* way.<br />

they go through their careers being lousy pullers and less than desirable aggro holders in short xp fights. They finally get to the high end mobs (their one chance to shine) and they see a sk their place as the MT!</div></div><hr />
