<br />
And it Begins...SoE starting to.,....<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
 Pay For Website advertising etc. related to EQ that have been taken over by IGE and Yantis. ie taking the IGE/Yantis banners away.<br />
<br />
The first of the sites that SoE has &quot;brought back into the fold&quot; is:<br />
<br />
www.eqinterface.com which up until today was being used by IGE for advertising.<br />
<br />
the final paperwork was signed yesterday and today the IGE banners are no longer at Eqinterface.<br />
<br />
SoE is going to be approaching the other sites soon to try to get them to switch from IGE to SoE for advertising dollars, etc due to the fact that smedley this. <br />
<br />
as to the Yantis sites, i am not sure since he bought the sites, however, i imagine that some sort of deal will be able to be arrange to &quot;buy&quot; the sites from him. I expect to get a call from Smedley in a week or so about Monkly-Business (well after i email him- Kudane requested that i not tell smed i know what is happening until Post him conversion, this was a &quot;secret&quot;</div></div><hr />

Ummm, the banner is still on that page.  I call shenanigans.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Belyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The only reason sites like this and other class boards exist outside of the soe servers, is most people wont tolerate their brand of censurship.  Here you can bash IGE and call yantis an evil evil horrible horrible man if you so choose, you can freely discuss why you think he is wrong, and as far as i know it wont get censored outside of what would have normally been censored preIGE.  Kinda funny that what soe is proposing could have happend here if they acted a few months sooner at the behest of the former board owner.  Soe should just try and buy IGE out and hire yantis as a VP incharge of good ideas and smart policies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>SoulVoid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You know it's kinda funny, I fought and fought to get SoE to do this a few months ago and presented them with many of these ideas that their starting now yet 4 months ago they did everything they possibly could to screw me over and backed me into a corner. All I can say to all the other sites is buyer beware, SoE, Smedley, and his cronies are not a group to be trusted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ummm, the banner is still on that page.  I call shenanigans.<br />
<br />
I'm getting an EQ Platinum banner (all expansion through God together for one price, not plat in EQ), that seems SoE-ish.  It was that way this morning too when I checked...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ashrai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'd rather have the IGE banner than a Sony one honestly. If only for the fact that as others have said: SOE could have done this ages ago. Why only now? Maybe because the survey results from the past weeks are in and there's enough people willing to pay for plat or a safe way to buy a character and their little egos are bruised that they missed a huge opportunity to monetise their content. <br />
<br />
IGE= crooks, but honest crooks. Give us money, we give you STUFF.<br />
<br />
SOE = Give us money, we will move our labor offshore so that we can pay them less and pocket more of your cash which we will then obviously use to buy private islands in the Pacific because we sure aren't using the money to pay developers to actually fix the game.</div></div><hr />
