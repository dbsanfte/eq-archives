<br />
&quot; &lt;&lt;insert druid, or wizzy name here&gt;&gt; airlines is now taking off for blah blah blah blah blah... donations accepted&quot;<br />
<br />
WTF, it wasnt even cute the first time someone said that.  If you are a druid, or wizzy, and you really need the cash.<br />
<br />
/ooc porting for donations<br />
<br />
thats all you need to do.  Even if I needed a port, and some shithead said there Airline was open for business. I would walk just out of spite.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Garila</div><div class="date">11-16-2002, 03:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My main problem is when I am paying for a port and they are fucktards taking forever memming the spell and they ask if i am ready after i have been standing there 5 minutes waiting for their dumbasses . . . then 17 seconds into the 18 second cast time they duck and say &quot;oops wrong spell&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baroyonx</div><div class="date">11-18-2002, 12:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is something worse than that, Garila....when they don't duck.  I have ended up in KoS zones because Druids or Wizards don't know what spell sends you where.<br />
<br />
Even worse is Clerics who rez you in the wrong place.  One of my personal favorites was waiting an hour at 3 am for a rez only to be rez by Katta Guards right after telling the cleric i was KoS.  Of course i had no mana so feign didn't do shit and I was back at my bind while the cleric was trying to figure out where I went.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mardark</div><div class="date">11-18-2002, 09:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really hate it when getting a port, and they are porting multiple people to multiple places.   Then this fuckwit wonders why I have 3 druids beating on me when we port in.  Asking dumb ass questions like .... &quot;Why did they attack you?&quot;  Sometimes can even get one dumb enough to heal you, then you just FD.  They then freak out, because the druids are now attacking them.<br />
<br />
I usually ask if they are doing multiple ports, and to know where they are porting to.  I try to get gather shadows up soon as I join the group, just in case.<br />
<br />
Where the hell are the gnome portable teleportation devices?  Why are the little guys slacking so bad?  We are letting them pretend to be SKs, arent we?<br />

Either you want cash up front or you don't.  If you want cash up front, it's not a donation.  If you don't want cash up front, who the hell cares if you'll take the money someone chooses to give you for whatever service you are offering.<br />
<br />
Personally, rezzing druids that die soloing in cobalt scar is a great source of cash for my cleric, so I'm not going to begrudge them the ability to get the cash to pay me to rez them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's kinda like telemarketers. <br />
<br />
This is why I get guildies or RL friends to get me. saves the bullshit. I tank for em later, they TP me now. Fair is fair.</div></div><hr />
