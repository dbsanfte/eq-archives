<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">trun</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 08:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gotta fight your way in. Or you could follow another guild in and help clear thru and make a run for pom. Altho with the dungeon crawl ntov is now, you'll have to most likely sit around waiting for the guild to kill dragons along the way. Another option is to maybe have a guild that's broken to the ex-safe hall coth one of your mages(if you have one) or all of you up. You'll need to negotiate something with them for sure.<br />
<br />
Why would you want to go to pom anyway? It's a sad sad zone.</div></div><hr />

My Guildies are anexious to go there and run around there. Dont know what they want from there. I much rather would go to Halls of Testing for some Armor Drops or Plane of Hate for a chance on a Decrepit Hide.<br />

But the risk reward just is not there.  Throne cards are almost non existant anymore.  You can make a flower in about 2 hours though, the disease one, but that is about it.</div></div><hr />
