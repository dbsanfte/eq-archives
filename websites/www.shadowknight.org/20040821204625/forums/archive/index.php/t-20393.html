<br />
Anyway I think they look really badass.. much &gt; than EQ's<br />
<br />
Here is an undeads mount<br />
http://www.blizzard.com/wow/ScreenShot.aspx?ImageIndex=2&amp;Set=55<br />
<br />
Unholy steed should be something like that, instead of lameass pony :\<br />
<br />
But I think I like the Dwarf/Gnome mounts better..<br />
http://www.blizzard.com/wow/ScreenShot.aspx?ImageIndex=1&amp;Set=56<br />
<br />
THen there are lame horses for humans.<br />
http://www.blizzard.com/wow/ScreenShot.aspx?ImageIndex=9&amp;Set=56<br />
<br />
Night Elves have their own, but no SS yet.<br />
<br />
Orcs have their wolf mounts.. kinda cool, and I assume trolls may use them also.. since there is no mention of trolls having any, and IIRC trolls live with/near the orcs.<br />
http://www.blizzard.com/wow/ScreenShot.aspx?ImageIndex=6&amp;Set=56<br />
<br />
Oh and tauren don't have mounts.. they just get to run fast when everyone else gets mounts :\<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
Anywho, I'll definatly be giving WoW a shot. Hopefully it'll at least turn out better than FFXI.. and if there is a God, it will blow EQ out of the water :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">from what ive seen the nightelves mounts look like the undead ones.<br />
<br />
man SoE needs to take some design tips from blizzard...i love that art :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Derraj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">yea but how much are mounts going to cost and how hard is it to get whatever currency is in WoW?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The Night sabers used by the night elves are listed sparately from undea mounts.  Variety is always nice.  And the humans horses look like Belgains.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Derraj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">just to add, there will be mounts for air, which is fucking awesomeHuman: Horse/Gryphon <br />
Troll: Undetermined/Wyvern <br />
Night Elf: Nightsaber/Hippogryph <br />
Orc: Wolf/Wyvern <br />
Dwarves: Ram/Gryphon <br />
Undead: Undead Steed/Giant Bat <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dregor Thule</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">A little clarity.  The air &quot;mounts&quot; are a taxi service.  You don't control them at all, they're just a means of getting from preset point A to preset point B.  It's a flight made in real time, and you can see the action going on down below you as you pass over.<br />
<br />
The regular, land based mounts are just for transportation.  No fighting on them.  That nightmare in the screenshot is actually the summoned Warlock steed, it's not race-specific at all.  The undead will be getting an undead steed for their mount (skeletal or more zombie like, I don't know!)<br />
<br />
Last I heard, trolls and gnomes were tentatively getting the wolves and battle rams respectively, but that may (and hopefully will) change to give the races more of their own identity.  They already have to use another races hometown as is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Krazix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well from what I understand the Gnomes live with the Dwarves, because their city got conquered by some evil force or something like that.. which I'm hoping means Gnomes get the rams. That would kick ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>brian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The gnomes have to live with the dwarves because they can have sex with each other.  They have compatible genitalia.  That's how I am gonna RP it anyway...<br />
<br />
Not being able to fight / dogfight on mounts is SOOOO gay.  I hope they fix that, just for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>brian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">also Midgets in WoW look kinda hot, just like Midgets IRL.<br />
