<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grimscale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a 24 lizard sk and Im having some trouble. The regen is nice but the limited hunting grounds, inability to wear plate armor,and worse xp are rough. I want to start a new sk and I was thinking either DE cause they have naturally high int and I have a lot of STR and STA equip I can twink him with, or Ogre cause of better STR and STA. So if anyone could pls point out some good and bad points of these races it would help. Also, in the end game, do all sk's do the same dmg and r equal? I mean if there was a 65 DE sk and a 65 Ogre sk with exact same weapons and equip, would one have the advantage?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">At the beginning of the game, go with whatever you want. Endgame, the only real difference is the fact that Ogres can't be stunned from the front, and Iksars have a slight AC advantage (compared to say a DE with the exact same gear). Mid-level gear for iksars can be hard, but once you get higher they are allowed to wear plate so it doesn't much matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>saeldidar si'ernmal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">choose whichever race you want. if you want a straight out brute choose ogre or troll; if you want a spellcaster who can still melee if need be then choose DE. Its up to you.<br />
<br />
(I'd choose DE)</div></div><hr />
