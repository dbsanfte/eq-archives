<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The HP Gap has gotten too large between warriors and SK's.    This is another reason the tanking gap is so large.  How can a 10k hp SK compete against a 12K hp warriors even without and defensive being in the picture?<br />
 <br />
This is taken from EQ rankings.<br />
 <br />
Currently in their database there are 68 sk's on all servers with 8500 hp or more unbuffed<br />
 <br />
There are 812 warriors listed as having 8500 hp or more.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
There are two sk's that are 9500 hp or more<br />
 <br />
There are 332 warriors with 9500 hp or more<br />
 <br />
The top warriors is 11339 hp<br />
 <br />
The top sk is 9984 hp<br />
 <br />
Do you see a bit of an unbalance here?<br />
 <br />
Seems we need a HP aa pretty bad</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Maicom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Seems the problem is not that sk's can't get to these high HP levels, but that its so much harder for them to than warriors. Also have to take into account the fact that sturdiness shows up in their magelo's, while CoL doesn't for sk's. Difference between the top warrior and the top sk is 1355 HP, factor in CoL and thats reduced to 1075.<br />
<br />
So, the difference between a top SK and a top War seems to be okay, however, the difficulty in getting to those levels as an SK seems to be much great though, as can be seen by the #'s you posted.<br />
<br />
I guess an AA might not be such a bad idea as that is something that is available to players of all levels. Perhaps one that was similar to PD(% increase from raw HP gear) as that would scale better with gear upgrades/progression, whereas ND-type HP aa's hit a ceiling relatively early on(early EP/VT)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Manslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">We get 280 more hps than they do from buffs.  The top sk you listed is getting close to 13k buffed.  The top warrior you listed is just over 14k buffed.  So the SK has roughly 92 percent of the warriors buffed hps.  I don't actually know for sure, but I'd guess that is pretty similar to what the gap has been for a long time.  So to get 92 percent of buffed hps to a 8.5k unbuffed warrior an sk would have to have 7325 unbuffed.  There are 300 such sks on eqrankings.  Also eqrankings has been wiped recently so there are many profiles of both classes that arent listed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Why do you all just look at the last post look at the numbers?  There are only two sk's with more then 8500 hp.<br />
<br />

<br />
According to Battleblade we need to be 8500 hp to off tank in GoD past KT.  This means only 68 sk's are there.  Thats less then two per server.</div></div><hr />

You want a raid role?  The raid leader has a choice of who to have off tank.  3 10000 hp warriors or 3 8000 hp Knights, which gets the raid role?<br />
<br />
Not even thinking about disc, mitigation etc.  I am only talking about GoD off tanking here so no pop input about how my guild has 6000 hp sk's off tank all day with no problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Inferna mentioned you need 8500 hp to off-tank in these high-end encounters. Not tank the bosses, just off-tank.<br />
<br />
edit: this is a problem because not enough sk's are getting the level of gear needed to perform our role's as off-tanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Arkis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">You want a raid role?  The raid leader has a choice of who to have off tank.  3 10000 hp warriors or 3 8000 hp Knights, which gets the raid role?<br />

<br />
Let's imagine we have the same hp than wars. The raidleader's choice would prolly be same considering the other factors.<br />
Also, if you can't tank effectively a mob with 8k5hp you wont tank it with 10khp. If you can't tank it with 8k5hp, that means quick heals aren't enough of healing to keep you between 1 and 8k5. If your hp tend to go to 0 with 8k5hp it will be same with 10khp (when offtanking) if your mitigation/avoidance stay the same. The difference will just be a larger margin of error or of bad luck (full round of max hits).<br />
Im not saying more hp wouldn't help, im just saying it's not the main reason of this large gap between war and sk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Manslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">3 10k warriors or an 8k knight.  That puts all 3 warriors much closer to the top warrior profile than the knight is to the top sk profile.  So the warriors are better geared.  Well of course they are going to get chosen.  The problem isn't the HP gap.  Its the mitigation gap and the lack of any worthwhile disciplines.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Howlitoezis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Inferna has a point, the disparity in numbers of warriors over 8500 versus the number of shadow knights over 8500 is amazing.

While I agree the disparity in HP between tanking classes is too large, the numbers are misleading. If there were an equal number of SKs and warriors, these figures would mean something, but without knowing the ratio of SK to warrior, we cannot get an actual percentage number, and therefore the figures mean little.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Manslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">812 warriors with 8500 unbuffed hps, 300 sks with 7325hp unbuffed.  Thats probably about the same ratio of warriors to sks in raiding guilds in general.  So it really isn't even a gear issue.  Also because CoL stacks we have 280 more hps than warriors.  So a 8220 hp sk would have the same hps as a 8.5k warrior.  There are 110 such sks on eqrankings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">812 warriors with 8500 unbuffed hps, 300 sks with 7325hp unbuffed.

<br />
Ok this again from eqrankings<br />
<br />
1494 sk's on all servers in its database<br />
<br />
3039 warriors <br />
<br />
About twice as many.  Does this account for the huge difference of 812 vs 68?  <br />
<br />
Since there is roughly twice as many sk's as warriors the figures are way out of line</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Manslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Since the very first day of EQ warriors have had more hps than SKs.  The relative gap now is likely the same or actually smaller than it was in the past.  A 7325hp sk will have the same relative buffed hps to a 8.5k warrior as a the top profiles you listed are relative to one another.  There are 300 sks with that many hps which is again probably similar to the ratio of warriors to sks in raiding guilds.  <br />
<br />
Also we gain 280 hps more than warriors do from buffs, so saying sks should have the same unbuffed hps means that we would actually have more hps than they do.<br />
<br />
Its a mitigation and discipline issue, not a hp issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Parasite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Its a mitigation and discipline issue, not a hp issue.<br />
If we had our mitigation and our disciplines, we would be more attractive for the guild to get HP gear.. the gap you speak of would be closed and there would be more than like 80 SKs with over 8,5k HP...<br />
But right now, why would the Guild give HP items to SKs if they cant use it as efficiently as Warriors do nowadays because of all the discs?.<br />
<br />
Like manslayer said.. mitigation and disc issue, not HP issue imo..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>doomslayd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">You also need to take into account that EQRankings database was recently whiped, so anyone who hasn't recently visited the site and put their magelo #'s back into the system is not listed.  Considering the fact that there are more warriors than SKs in the game, it simply makes sense that there would be a larger amount of high end equipped warriors over SKs. that and the fact that due to class appeal or simply SK versatility, many people have SKs as alts, ect and therefor don't take the time to put all their alts into EQRankings.  My main is a Bst, so considering my SK doesn't get anywhere near the kind of drops that my main does, I don't see the reason to list him in comparision with the SK mains who are much better equipped.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>scpio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">just our of curiosity what is the ratio for paladins? there should be at least double the amount of paladins then sks. take the 2 and combine that to see what &quot;knights&quot; are in ratio.<br />
<br />
there should be a differnce how much that is seems abit out of whack.<br />
<br />
its a case of theory vs practice. seems in practice warriors get the goods 1st well before anyone else even though the gear is &quot;similar but less&quot;. lol watch the answer be they raise the stats of our self buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Krushum Gudended</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">the eqrankings database being wiped is better for this, actually, it shows how many there are that actually play<br />
<br />
if you haven't updated eqrankings in 2 weeks, chances are you don't care (prolly same ratio of those that don't care in each class), or you no longer play<br />
<br />
if you really want to see the discrepancy in the number of raiding sks and warriors, take a look at innoruuk's eqrankings.  I am the number 3 sk (not time flagged, with 7250unbuffed).  The 2 higher than me are the senior sks in the Qvic plus guild.  The two below me are in a time guild that raids 3 days a week.  Now look at warriors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Given Inferna's reporting of EQranking's #'s<br />
<br />
4.5% of listed Sk's are over 8500HP as compared to 26.7% of listed warriors being over the same mark<br />
<br />
10.9% of listed Warriors have over 9500HP as compared to 0.1% of listed SK's being over 9500HP<br />
<br />
Make your own decision if you think that is right.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Manslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">A very high end warrior during velious would have about 4800 unbuffed hps, and a sk would have around 4.3k, with the buffs available at the time that puts the warrior at 6.5k and the sk at 6k, which puts the sk at about 92 percent of the warriors hps.  The ratio is also very similar during luclin etc.  The hp gap has always been the same, its the other factors that make the difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Flanders</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">You should take these figures and cross apply them with the DPS of the mobs for the era.  I think you'll find velious mobs (not Vulak or AoW becuase we havent made it to the last uber mobs of GoD) were easier to tank with the available HP pools of the time.  Also you need to consider the mitigation and avoidance gap between wars and SKs as well....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Howlitoezis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Using eqrankings and 'authentic' only at level 65, I come up with these numbers:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Howlitoezis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">A very high end warrior during velious would have about 4800 unbuffed hps, and a sk would have around 4.3k, with the buffs available at the time that puts the warrior at 6.5k and the sk at 6k, which puts the sk at about 92 percent of the warriors hps.

Actually, I think both are factors in the total equation.<br />
For instance (speaking hypothetically), if SKs had 45% more HP than warriors, a 45% mitigation disc would not be needed by SKs...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Kyfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">&quot;Authentic&quot; is meaningless. Most people who use Magelo don't bother with it as it costs money and doesn't really add anything.</div></div><hr />

The 'authentic' numbers share similar percentages to the other number set shown. Thats really not the point, in any case.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Manslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">My point was that the hp gap is the same percentage as its always been, not growing larger as was stated in the first post.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">The gap between the ultimate high end may have remained the same<br />
But look at the %'s.  The &quot;Minimum Gap&quot; (The % of HP the best possible SK can have comparde to the total HP for the best possible Warrior) seems to have kept stable with SK's at ~92% of warrior hp, but the average gap is much larger.  4.5% of listed SK's can get to the point where more than ONE QUARTER of all listed warriors can get to?  This doesn't bother you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Manslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">300 sks are at 7325+ hps out of 1500ish listed.  Thats 20 percent that are on par with the 8.5k+ warriors, not 4.5 percent.  While that is still less than 25 percent, I would think this largely has to do with some guilds gearing up their warriors first to tank boss encounters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Its a mitigation and discipline issue, not a hp issue. <br />
<br />
The difference is about where is should be at 8-10%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">The HP gap seems to be at about the same percentage it always has been at, with equal gear.  It just appears that SKs getting that equality in gear is a problem, and the reasons behind that aren't always simple ones.  Personally, I think it's just because the average warrior is more willing to play the game for extended periods of time because they are viewed as useful, where there is a perception that SKs just aren't up to snuff, and could be easily replaced with nearly any other class to the benefit of their guild.  If we had a useful role that we excelled at (ie offtanking in raids) I think you'd see things start to even out a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">It's because an SK needs to be further along than a Warrior to achieve equality.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Malheur VonRane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I think it's more about gear distribution than the actual hp disparity. I can say from my experience, that you can expect to have 3 warriors for every 1 knight that are going to be well equiped by the guild. At least in the beginning of a new expansion. When we had 10 warriors and 6 knights in the guild we had about 3 well equipped knights and 3 ok equipped knights. Even now, we have warriors getting multiple pieces of muramite armor while some knights still have none. This is not purely discrimination, a lot of factors go into this situation but there is a sense of urgency in guilds to equip their warriors quickly, and before the knights. <br />
<br />
And you dont really need 8500 hp to off tank passed KT, having healers who are on the ball and dispelling inc mobs make all the difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">It's because an SK needs to be further along than a Warrior to achieve equality.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Howlitoezis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Saying &quot;It's a mitigation problem, not an HP problem&quot; doesn't really make sense.<br />
When you get right down to it, they come out to being the same thing.<br />
<br />
Having more hitpoints means you are left with more hit points after being hit.<br />
Having more mitigation means you are left with more hit points after being hit.<br />
<br />
While the % in attainable hitpoints between warriors and SKs is not huge, the %  <br />
of warriors with near max hitpoints in comparison to SKs with near max hitpoints is quite large.</div></div><hr />

Agree. Knights with less than 8500 off tank fine all the way to Txevu.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Manslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Having better mitigation or having more hps doesn't equate to the same thing.  Heals are for a set amount so they will be more effecient on someone with higher mitigation and less hps even though a higher hp/lower mitigation person might take identical percent of their hps in damage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
20 percent of sks listed are on par with 25 percent of warriors listed.  The 5 percent difference is likely due to how guilds distribute loot.  Some guilds will gear up their warriors first so that they are better able to tank boss mobs.</div></div><hr />

According to Battleblade we need to be 8500 hp to off tank in GoD past KT.  This means only 68 sk's are there.  Thats less then two per server.<br />
<br />
Sony does things to intentionally slow down the progression through expansions.  Rathe and Aqua are the 2 obvious ones.  Making knights to be non viable tanks may have been another, just much more discrete.  And certianly one that there would be little outcry for.  The lack of hps and mitiagaion abilites of knights may have well been by design to slow progression.  What better way to slow down guilds then by making content that requires offtanking, and one group content that a knight, especially a sk wont work out for.<br />
For the most part i would say that most raid guilds have the same amount of knights as they do warriors, if not more knights.(knights = sk plus pal)  Making half the tank core obsolete, more so in the case of sks, certianly put the breaks on getting through content efficently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Based on heresay about what stats are needed to tank, in content you haven't experienced, and based on a small and unscientific sampling of magelos, you conclude that SK's have insufficient HP?<br />
<br />
Prior to the CoL changes, yes, SK's were out of balance with warriors on total buffed HP.  After CoL changes, I don't see how the 8-10% difference in HP is going to make or break anything.  After the cloak changes, I think we're fine.<br />
<br />
Our problem has little to do with hp... it's mitigation and shitty disciplines.  We can't compete with DI - 1, stuns, furious, defensive, weaponshield, stonestance, etc, etc.<br />
<br />
Even if we got parity with warriors in total buffed hp, that 1200 hitpoints could easily be gone in one swing if we don't have more tricks to avoid damage.<br />
<br />
Belyle, what you state won't slow guilds down much, they'll just stop recruiting classes that hamper them.  I doubt the current state of knight tanking is any grand conspiracy to slow guilds down while screwing us as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Rueeliar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Umm... at the end of PoP, warriors were complaining that the HP gap was only 700 points.  The introduction of their new HP AA theoretically SHOULD enhance that to 1200 hp, right?<br />

Nevermid lame focus effects,but why should a cleric get the same AC and hit points or close to Knight specific armor? I noticed this looking through not just clerics but also bards.I would suggest closing the gap between Warriors and Knights and furthering the gap between knights and other plate classes.50 hit points might not seem much,but add in a full suit of 6 pieces X 50 then add in the 500 HPs through AA's and you will see comparably equipped knights are getting boned in comparison to the other non-tanking classes.I won't even bother going in to the fact that chain classes are very close to our HPs and AC also.So we lag 1000 hit points behind warriors and rangers follow us by less than 300 or so.Yep,sounds fair to me.<br />
<br />
Edit to add.I don't mind the closeness of Warrior Hit points to knights,but having the same AC as a guy who's often sitting in the corner or playing his flute pisses me off.If they put a little more AC and hit points on the class specific gear in difference between Knights and clerics/bards I'd have no problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Rueeliar, the problem was pallies had about a 300 hp advantage they shouldn't have gotten due to focus and aotc stacking.  They rebalanced warrior HP vs this... but this put SK's out of balance with both Warrs and Pallies.  That's been fixed.<br />
<br />
Hitpoint balance is fine.  We need bonuses in other areas, but at the moment it's a waste to spend our energy complaining about the hp gap.</div></div><hr />

we will never be = in hp to a warrior and usually hover about 10% behind,  which is used in my comparison.  I dont see the huge problem.<br />

<br />
<br />
The only reason not many SKs make it to top level is because they get bored and/or sick and tired with the class' meaning of life in the game. Same with paladins.  And no, paladins are not in a better situation than us. They think they can tank better but after a couple of Uqua raids when I was laughing my ass off when they go splat, they are starting to realise it too (at least in my guild :p).<br />
<br />
Warriors always did and always will have more hp. The hp difference does not bother me. The fact that they do not bother to fix my long broken aggro spells and I to use level 15 spells for aggro does thought and so does itemization :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">Umm... at the end of PoP, warriors were complaining that the HP gap was only 700 points. The introduction of their new HP AA theoretically SHOULD enhance that to 1200 hp, right?<br />

It's a 1111 hp difference.  Between the gear difference which ends up being worth about 5% hp, and the natural difference an 8500 HP knight is the same as a 10036 hp war as far as their HP progression goes.  Looking at eqrankings thats 157 Warriors out of 2694 profiles (I excluded those under 65). In comparison there are 69 SK's out of 1270 profiles.  Thats 5.8% of Warriors and 5.4% of SK's.  Theres about the same number of SK's as Warriors at the same level of progression, unfortunatley thats inaccurate since Warriors hit the proper level of progression earlier.  So since the bar is lower for Warriors you can go through and see that there are 857 Warriors which meet the criteria or 31.81%.  When looking at it that way theres nearly 6x as many Warriors who can tank it as there are SK's if the numbers were equal, and 12x as many Warriors with class popularity.  1 SK can tank for every 12 Warriors that can.  Thats just flat out wrong.<br />
<br />
1.64 SK's per server can tank, 20.41 Warriors per server can tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Arkis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">Theres about the same number of SK's as Warriors at the same level of progression,<br />
<br />
This is not true. <br />
SK's roster is different than war's in guilds. Most of &quot;uber&quot; guilds got at least 3 times more war than SK. Among some of these ubers, many will stuff their war first. So there're definitely more wars well stuffed than SK. As said earlier, with pal it would be a bit more accurate.<br />
Finally i guess there're more SK twink than war's twink.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">Did you look at the %? 5.8 vs 5.4, the difference why so many more Warriors can do it is they don't need an equal level.  Read my post again</div></div><hr />

While that is still less than 25 percent, I would think this largely has to do with some guilds gearing up their warriors first to tank boss encounters.<br />
<br />
4.5% can get to the 8500 mark (as implicitly stated in my post)<br />
I don't care how many can get to 92% of that. <br />
I think the point is the ease of warriors to get there compared to the inability of sk's to get there.</div></div><hr />

They have the numbers, we dont.  Afterall, look at the latest patch.  They fixed an almost unused disc /shield.  But the almost always used SA3 crit problem, hasn't even been acknowledged to be a bug.  One post doesn't mean its broke, or warrant investigating, if it comes from SKs.  30 posts, claiming its broke will get it looked at and fixed ASAP if its warriors.  Afterall, they dont want them having a sit-in to get /shield fixed.  <br />
<br />
The squeaky wheel gets the grease.  Regardless of how broke other things are.<br />
<br />
The HP imbalance, shows that the knights should have received the 5% mitigation advantage over warriors, to make up for the HP differences.<br />
<br />
With the HP differences, the Knights should be put at DI-2, given a short duration, fast refresh mitigation disc.  Warriors should stay at DI-1.  The numbers actually support this needed mitigation change.  That would put the knights back to being the preferred offtanks.</div></div><hr />

We're talking more AC, more HP, more innate mitigation, etc. Now I can see the innate mitigation OR the innate HP, but both? And why should AC be any different, period?<br />
<br />
I know, I know, warriors always complain 'but its all we do is tank - we should be the best'...well that doesn't cut it; if doing nothing but one thing peigon-holes a class or makes ones feel no other should be able to do it, ask for more to do! I think problems like this are going to continue for the rest of EQ's life bc of the corners the devs are painted into in this design. IMO, the devs had a chance to equal things out for the tanks, and they blew it when they introduced the zerker class - worse mistake SoE could have made for EQ and tanking balance. They should have introduced some of the utility type abilites ( aka snare ) to the warriors, and balanced the tanks to be equal. Now if they do it, they are stepping on zerker toes...<br />

I don't remember saying we didn't need mitigation and disciplines Manslayer.

But yeah, your point is valid Inferna, .. how few sk's have been able to get to an acceptable level of hp to off tank in raids beyond KT or to be viable in exp groups and single group GoD content in KT and beyond.<br />
Well.. People found out that SKs can't tank crap OR need to have gear that surpasses compared Warrior gear by far.<br />
So why get extra work and equip SKs? Just equip warriors and you have better and more superior offtanks.. And thus... SKs were left behind in GoD and are in their Timegear + Augment HP range.. (around 8 to 8,5k HPs..)<br />
I guess thats why so few SKs have HPs reaching towards warriors.. I am not in a guild that raids KT+ tho.. only speculations here..<br />
Its all about how much gear your guild puts into their players and how much time they invest for it. They know Warriors tanke better..<br />
So they need the HPs.. not the Knights and Pallys... = Gap increases..</div></div><hr />

<br />
 <br />
<br />
Actually what he said was not pro-sk but it did give me the idea this is what he said<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't even get asked if I have Defensive up when I add tank or plow tank. Nor am I promptly replaced if I tank a named and have used it.<br />
<br />
Like many Paladins you've alternated between stating Defensive is broken and should be removed from the game and showing an obvious desire for Defensive or at least for something like it for addtanking/plow tanking.<br />
<br />
The hard truth is for a Paladin to Tank like a 10K HP unbuffed Warior, they have to be at 8500HP's unbuffed minimum - and that is pretty much what they reach with equivilant EP/PoTime/LDoN augmented equipment.<br />
<br />
But Knights like you with 7k HP's unbuffed say &quot;We don't have the tools!&quot; No sir, you don't have the AC, HP's or Avoidance to match Warriors at your progression level and it's ALL due to equipment.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't want a 9k HP Knight Tanking in a raid if if I could have a 12k HP Warrior doing it. You're right about that. But it's not because of Defensive. <br />
<br />
I've very honestly used Defensive once (1 time) plow tanking or add tanking normal adds in raids since Kyvv Heartstriker has been adjusted ( I remember because I was called to MT a named next and had to /tell the Raid Leader Defensive down). Yet, with your heals, stuns, Root, etc. you can't match me as an add tank or a plow tank - not because of Defensive, I don't use it. It's because you sir are almost 3K HP's below me in HP's and probably 200AC.<br />
<br />
Gear-up with what is available in EP/PoTime/LDoN augmented armor and the story changes quite a bit. A Knight with 2300AC, 10500HP, +10 Avoidance, and even possibly far more buffed etc. can add tank and plow tank. Rapid-fire aggro becomes a major asset.<br />
<br />
Would you use a 7K HP unbuffed Warrior to MA if a 10K HP unbuffed Warrior was available? How about if he could stun White mobs and below? I didn't think so.&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>Manslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">That would put us at 5 percent behind them at the very high end which is about where paladins were at the end of PoP.  While I certainly wouldn't mind a HP boost, not sure if there wouldn't be another outcry resulting from it though.  And the 500 hps were given to them because of Paladin buffs that allowed paladins to gain roughly 300 more hps than other classes from buffs.  Cloak stacking was changed to stack for us so because of both of these other changes.  So we already received 280hps since they have gotten the 500hp boost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">First of all a pretty good argument could be made that we should have the same HP as warriors since we have no damage or mitigation disk's.<br />
<br />
Barring that there is certainly no reason for the fact that the amount of sk's in the game that have 8500 unbuffed hp or more is less then two per server.  Something needs to be done to correct this issues or we can't possibly be off tanks in high end raid content in GoD and probably OoW</div></div><hr />

<br />
Currently on eqrankings there are 69 8500hp sks out of 1300 level 65 sks, or 5.3 percent.  114 paladins with 8500hp out of 2062, or 5.5 percent.  Thats a total of 183 knights out of 3362 for 5.4 percent.  There are 177 warriors with 10k hps out of 3188, which is 5.6 percent.  The numbers of knights that meet his criteria both in terms of total numbers and percentages are almost identical.  There happens to be nearly 2.5x as many warriors as there are sks so it would make sense that 2.5x as many warriors are capable of tanking.<br />
<br />
Adding 350hps like you proprose would mean 123 sks and 197 paladins would now meet this criteria.  Which would mean 9.5 percent of all knights would meet the criteria he stated.  Which would put knights at a 1.71 to 1 advantage per capita in terms of being able to tank using his criteria.<br />
<br />
So are you saying knights should be 71 percent more likely to be able to tank stuff than a warrior?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>Manslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">The same percentage of all sks that can tank the stuff is virtually identical to the percentage of warriors that can.  I don't see how that is bad.  There just happens to be 2.5x as many warriors.  So to make it so more sks can tank this stuff, either the bar needs to be lowered for everyone (nerf content), or skew the ratio to be hugely in favor of knights (boosting SKs).<br />
<br />
Also after reading what he said, he doesnt say that you need to have 8.5k to offtank, he said you needed 8.5k to tank like a 10k warrior.  Thats not the same thing.  If you think you have to have 10k hp warrior or a 8.5k sk to tank the stuff, you would only have 5.5 warriors per server that could tank the stuff.  Obviously this isnt the case, as is the fact that more than 2 sks a server are tanking.</div></div><hr />

Melee Part II! <br />
A new story has been added to your storybook!<br />
(...also somewhere more down...)<br />
- Warriors received an innate 5 percent increase in their ability to absorb damage. <br />
<br />
Imo the gap isn't 5%... Somehow I also remember that the first change already was 5%... <br />
<br />
Lets see...<br />
100% before these patches. (their old mitigation, I guess it was same as SK mitigation)<br />
+5% (not sure) on December 18, 2003 = 105%..<br />
+5% on March 10th, 2004 = 110.25%<br />
<br />
So the gap is actually 10,25%, not 5%.. IF the first mitigation boost was already 5%..<br />
Any confirmations?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>Manslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">That is mitigation, not hps.  I have stated that we could use a mitigation boost as well as offtanking type disciplines.  The 5 percent difference I mentioned is just in reference to HPs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>Zakton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">I would rather have a 5% increase to innate mitigation before having a HP boost.  Our mitigation changes (being a plate class) for PoP are part of what made us a viable choice to tank there.  <br />
<br />
Alternately I would like a way to have increased DPS in one group or raid setting (not for solo use) when we are not tanking.  Everyone in the group or raid has a role or is additional DPS.  Since our role is tanking I would like to have increased DPS as a backup when I am not the tank.  In my mind when your class role is filled the ultimate utility is being able to put out DPS. Warriors can fall back on that but we as knights we either tank or we don't.  Only way I can see this might be added would be a spell or maybe a clicky effect that would increase our melee DPS at cost to our mitigation/AC for a short length of time (so we couldn't solo or tank and use the DPS increase).  This way we could increase our DPS to be a viable addition to killing a mob in a fight but at the same time won't overpower us if we are the main tank.</div></div><hr />
