<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Verminus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">to make this damn scrolls drop in <br />
<br />
City of Mist (&lt;CENSORED&gt; spectral courier)<br />
Kaesora (dam*&lt;CENSORED&gt; failed Cryptraider)<br />
Mistmoore (DAM*&lt;CENSORED&gt; Librarians)<br />
<br />
and the keys in Droga (collective curses)<br />
<br />
is really a pain....<br />
<br />
help is needed, plz....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Samir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">They are all just a matter of luck and time spent camping.<br />
<br />
Just follow the guides here and the info on Alakazam's, they pretty well tell you exactly where each mob spawns. <br />
<br />
CoM was by far the worst for me - took me 14 straight hours of camping the stables and 9 couriers to get the 3 different scrolls.<br />
<br />
Kaesora and Mistmoore I got after one clearing of the PHer's.<br />
<br />
If you are really stuck for where the mobs spawn, send me a tell. I'm on Xev too and can show you where they are. I won't be on til after Easter though.<br />
<br />
Good luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ghismonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Time sinks make the baby jeebus cry...  but if you want Greenmist bad enough, you'll do it.<br />
<br />
My personal times: <br />
<br />
CoM:  10 straight hours through the night, 5 couriers.<br />
Kaesora:  Approximately 2 hours.<br />
Mistmoore:  Approximately 2 hours.  Librarian was up when I got there, ass't librarian placeholder had to be killed five or six times.<br />
<br />
Droga, now... Droga was something else.  I spent 6 hours the first day, got the bone and bone necklace in the first two hours, spent the rest of the time camped behind the penkeeper PH killing him alone.  Second day, eight more hours without stone key (but every other key known to man).  Finally, one of my guildies actually CHECKED their bank, and they had a stone key.  They thought that the stupendous machine was a real no-fail pottery wheel, not a quest combiner, and was collecting keys to use for coldain shawls.  She came down and delivered it to me.<br />
<br />
It's definately aptly named Test of Pain.  Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Samir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hehe, one of my guildmates was camping The angry goblin in Droga, when I zoned in he asked what I was doing there. When I told him he said had all the keys on him and came and gave all of them to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jabbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ghis posted exactly what happened to me in Droga.  :)  Same story almost to the letter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>nnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yep. I always thought the Lord of Pain blade was aptly named. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />
