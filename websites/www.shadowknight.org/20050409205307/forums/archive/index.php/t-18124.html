<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Arangar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">...is one groupable if you can get him single, but does anyone have any tips for the pull (unless you have a bard)?<br />
<br />
Do you clear up to his platform and fight him there? Do you try to pull him down to the arena and fight him there? Do you use the small ledge to the left (instead of the long way around to the right to his platform, with all the adds) to pull / get to him?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rhowne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There's a way to bring him down into the pit, but it does require killing the other giants on the ring that connects to his platform.  Best bet is to grab a FD class (SK's work best for this imho), and aggro him - go around to the right side of the ring (if you're facing the platform in the middle) and from there you have to just work it.<br />
<br />
FD when he runs too far around the ring.  Move closer to the ledge before he gets to you and after he's run past you.  Pull back when he's near you on the ledge.  You have to &quot;feel&quot; it, though - but it is very possible to bring him down into the pit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Arangar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks,<br />
<br />
Would have to be a damn high dps group to 1 group him then? Killing all the giants around the ledge and pull him before repops? What would another startegy be for one grouping? Corner him just down his platform and hope to get no wall adds?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Doubt he is one groupable but if u want to try work your way around the ledge killing fast as respawn is fast.  <br />
<br />
When u get to the platform wait for the one next to him to move away or FD pull him away.<br />
<br />
Levitate and push Thunderclap off the platform. Jump down and  make sure u fight in the middle or u will get respawn from the top.<br />
<br />
His DPS is high and he is hard to slow so bet your healers will be Oom before he is dead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Arangar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks again ;)<br />
<br />
So...on a slightly different topic - If I were to try and 1 group one of the tower mobs in BoT - which one would be easiest to try?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Walil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I ended up tanking Thunderclap for about 3/4ths of the fight last night. Had a perfect single pull but our warrior dropped at 90% due to lag. I grabbed aggro and tanked until he was at 15% but then he landed a proc + a few solid hits all at once for about 3500 damage. There isn't a need to clear the ramp giants, just takes some practice with his pull. I really doubt he is a single group encounter for anyone yet. <br />
<br />
The easiest to tank is definatly chaos wind but due to his g flux + stun I doubt he's a one group affair either. Your best bet might be the ice giant. He puts out solid damage, and has a 600 aoe mana drain but at least you can hide your healers from it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rhowne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">A group of guildies took out the Air tower boss with one group.  In any case, I highly recommend taking a competant enchanter along to use a charmed giant to up your DPS.<br />
<br />
Water tower named would be about the same difficulty - just invis/paci your way up to his room and a single group can get to him in no time.<br />
<br />
Sand is a short tower, but Skygge's make for super rough going.  Lightning respawns are very fast considering the distance and number of mobs to kill.  I have no doubt someone will single group each BoT tower, but for Sand and Lightning you won't be able to do it if you're looking to hit those named for gear upgrades (unless it's for an alt).<br />
<br />
18 skilled people can hit all 4 Towers with a fair amount of ease.  The number can drop to 12 depending on classes and gear.  Less than that and Sand/Lightning become very difficult unless you have a high percentage of healers and charmers present.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>cauchy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Auliffe Chaoswind is pretty easy, we did him with 2 ntov level groups.  I've heard from several people the water tower guy is one groupable too, but I've never had the experience of doing him single group style.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Iferna, I've done all BoT minis with 1 group.  Bard/Rogue/Me/Paladin/Cleric/Clericbot</div></div><hr />

Iferna, I've done all BoT minis with 1 group.  Bard/Rogue/Me/Paladin/Cleric/Clericbot  <br />
<br />
I have also, and most of us were in ornate/ST gear at the time.<br />
<br />
we had shm/me/pally/cleric/warrior/enc <br />
<br />
is fun to try if its late night raids are over and your bored,  and theres not a huge consequence to failing seeing as theres a graveyard in all pop zones :)<br />
<br />
you can pacify around the room and pull him...im pretty sure <br />
<br />
if your facing his platform, he should take off to the right side and jump off 1/4 way around the catwalk when you tag him.  then just burn him down in the middle of the room.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Then why say you doubt hes 1 groupable?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Makkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">been on raids to keel him 15-20 times. never pulled him, have seen good and bad pulls..<br />
<br />
usually what happens is, giants around him are harm or pac'd, puller tries to focus him to run in 1 spot and he eventually warps down<br />
<br />
or he starts summoning ppl cuz rangers tend to shoot arrows at everything :P if you lev the person who's getting summoned he wanders down to the middle much easier<br />
<br />
hope that helps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ghismonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">One grouped all the BOT minis except Kuanbyr so far.  Not exactly normal group make-up though.<br />
<br />
Me (sk), mage, enchanter, enchanter, cleric, druid.<br />
<br />
We usually pacify our way UP to the bosses (if pacify is resisted, mez/gtf out of the way, mem wipe), but have never actually attempted to pacify the rim mobs for the Brynju pull.  Fear of resists and a shitload of adds, since they'd be pathing back through mobs who's pacify wore off a long time ago... but anyway!<br />
<br />
I don't know about DPS in your groups, but with the DPS of three charmed elementals we can kill the respawns without worry.  <br />
<br />
To single pull them from the pit, tag whichever and get close to the rim in the pit.  Run with the giant as he paths back and forth, FD if they get close to another giant.  Do not let them enter the tunnel.  Eventually they'll have enough aggro built up that they'll warp or jump off the rim instead of running toward the tunnel.  With each mob that you clear, the next pull is easier because you have more room to let them path back and forth and build aggro without having to FD as they get close to other giants.<br />
<br />
Easiest one for our group has definately been Icestorm, and Chaoswind a close second.  Still working on the strat for Hailstorm.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">We've usually cleared the giants on the ring, then tapped thunderclap.  Puller jumps down into the pit.... MT plinks him with arrows, and eventually he falls.<br />
<br />
Did get that one time he didn't fall, pathed off to god knows where, and showed up in camp with 2 krigers.  That was interesting when we weren't ready for it... necro dotted the fookers so they couldn't be mezzed... but that's another story</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Well any was I said I doubt he is one groupable but knowing someone would post the duo'ed him. I  don't think he is one groupable for the normal equipped people.  Maybe for you with your ubber gear and HP.  For me I am the highest hp and aa SK in my guild and I only have 8168 hp with Virtue, BSS and Focus and about 1580 ac buffed.  I have 392 aa which helps.  I was able to almost finish him off when the warrior went down at the start of one fight.  I got him to about 3 percent when the healers went Oom and this was with about 12 people.<br />
<br />
Maybe a single group with some charmed giants could do it.<br />
<br />
The reason I said I didnt think he was single groupable and I have done him prob 6 times, is that he puts out a lot of damage and his proc is bad and also rampages.  So I figure the healers would be oom before you could kill him if you could keep the ma up.<br />
<br />
A single group with a ton of damage like some charmed giants might be able to do enough DPS to take him down fast enough.</div></div><hr />
