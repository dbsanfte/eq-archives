Darkquark certainly was... That thread was well worth it just for his reactions.  <br />
<br />
<br />
From a recent thread:<br />
Enjoyed these boards since the begining tho, and you guys are a great bunch.  I'm sure that it will continue to be so and that the game itself will continue to improve; well, it would improve faster if DQ would get off the testing server, I used to wonder how some of the assinine things got past test until I read a few of his posts...there really should be an IQ requirement to play there.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Darilius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Rofl. I'm glad I'm offensive enough to warrant the infamous butter comment.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for Dalren, I quite agree. Dalren is a fucktard, who is often hated by his fellow classmates. However, if you ask him, he will probably say that you either love him or hate him or some of that stupid shit about being like Stern or whatever. I often want to just say outright: Dalren, you are a complete and utter dipshit. But, alas, different board, different rules, so I cannot.<br />
<br />
As for MY comments...what? Again, different boards, different rules. Simply put: you operate with slightly less restrictive code of conduct here. You can't argue with me that if, say, Kebsis showed up on the mage board and started going off about his shit and Keeval and Brael with the butter talk, that they wouldn't get banned in a short space of time.<br />
<br />
And, yeah, I play a shadowknight, too. My main may be a 70 magician, but my next highest character is a 59 shadowknight.</div></div><hr />

I've not met many mages that are worth spending any time with whatsoever -- basically only two in all my time in EQ, the vast majority are worthless.<br />
<br />
Most are mages because they're as selfish as shadowknights but are lazy to boot -- they want the pet to do all the work.  Some of the biggest douchebags I know from EQ are mages.  <br />
