(http://www.xanga.com/home.aspx?user=mormoncalichick) <br />
<br />
the fact that she is a mormon and posts quotes from the bible on her site made me laugh harder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tuco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">just knowing that hes drinken it makes me sad <br />
<br />
Mormon chicks have to be the biggest whores out there, I LOVE ALL OF THEM. (trust me I know,grew up in a mormon neighborhood in CA).  You can play chicks like this one so bad you'll think your on a Bass Fishing Show....&quot;watch her jump in the boat billy&quot;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>BRÆDOWN™</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">wasn't that originally on the something awful forums?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Derraj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">holy fucking shit, that was awesome...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>nnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm all about honesty and what not, but some things are probably best kept OFF the internet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Oagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Damn, and we sometimes flame that people spend too much time playing this game.  These people really need lives.  The mormon bitch weblog is pure fucking lame.  I wanted to flame her guestbook, but I didn't want to go through the bother of registering just to do it.  <br />
<br />
Bitch needs to learn how to spell.  <br />
<br />
Heh, Mormon girls....<br />
<br />
Deflowered a few in my time, as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Toothfairy_TP</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Its a way for her to talk about things to people while still being anonymous..\<br />
 And alot of people are nosy, so they read it. I guess its like watching the real world for some people..<br />
<br />
  I did read some of it and think that if thats the worst of her problems shes damn lucky. She hasnt discovered things like ..pregnant...divorced....rent..drug problems..layoffs..<br />
<br />
So her biggest problem is &quot;This guy I like drinks sometimes&quot; <br />
How fucking sheltered is that ? When I was 13 everyone I knew smoked pot and drank and that was 17 years ago.<br />
 People that grow up sheltered like that are just not equipped to deal with the big bad world..<br />
<br />
 Yah her blog sucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Derok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">When I read the title of this post, I thought this was something about livejournals... where Troubled Teens Post Problems on the Internet.  Always a good read and remember kids:  Down the Road not Across the Street.</div></div><hr />
