<br />
I read that I needed the newbie Khukri and if I am supposed to do that quest first how am I supposed to obtain the Khukri?<br />
<br />
Thanks for taking time to answer my question.</div></div><hr />

You proc it 52 or so times, hand in what you get, and you'll get your newbie khukri. 2) Do it the easy way, get your faction up, and when you're ready to start the quest, make a newbie Iksar SK. Log him in, turn in the newbie khukri, log in your main SK, and hand in the rest of the first part of the quest. Now you're on your way. And yes, you must finish all 7 (? I think its 7, i forget.....) of the khukris before you can start on the actual Greenmist.</div></div><hr />

If you can, get a group in veksar (or just go and buy weapons from people there, i got most of mine free when they find out its for faction) to get your faction high enough with guards, then explorer knives all the way.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zakton</div><div class="date">07-07-2004, 03:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did the knives until the legion was warmly and then switch over to killing forsaken iksars in FoB and turning in the MM snout rings to the warrior guildmaster.  Killing the forsaken and the MM snout rings raised all my factions.  Be sure to raise your necro faction, Brood of Kotsiz (however it is spelled) because there is a necro standing in the SK guild.  ONce he agros the whole hall does and you will dead quick.   Crusaders won't talk to you about the quests unless you are warmly.  I have gotten up to indifferent and plan use to iksar potion to get it up enough for quests.</div></div><hr />
