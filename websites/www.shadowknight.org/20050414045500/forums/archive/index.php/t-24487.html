<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mrbad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been playing my sk for years....yet I lack pvp skills...First Question...What the hell do they give us darken for if it is resisted 9 times out of 10....second....What order of spells do I do....this is my usual line up...Darken....Aystiole....Heat Blood.....and slam away with my Black Bastard sword...and bash em to interrupt em...and ideas...comments...would be appreciated...btw...all my resists are above 150...MR is 220...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I really wish thi board had a search function so people could search for this stuff since it's been talked about before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>senor sperro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i've pvped my whole eq career.. so i know a thing or two..<br />
<br />
don't use dark too many times, unless you got a whole group trying to kill a bard.  a couple tries on darkness and then your good.  if your going up against a higher lvl player with better gear than their MR is probably too high, even if u dispell em..<br />
<br />
pumice is your friend, for about 20pp you can get 5 charges of nullify magic with 3 second casting.  thats two buff slots each 3 seconds so u might get lucky and catch a few keys buffs.  this is why insta-clicks are godly in pvp.  jboots, grim aura earring, and the 8th coldain ring are nice insta-clicks.<br />
<br />
i dont know what lvl you are but you seem low lvl.. in my spell slots i always have lifetap, dark, some dot like ignite blood or blood of hate, FD, our 2 buff cancel magic, aura of darkness, and lich or whatever<br />
<br />
anyways gotta go, ill type more later maybe..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mrbad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">So what about heat blood and cascading darkness...and the three spears...that is what I load up.....These other spells u speak of might be PoP spells...where I turn in Ethereal parchments in for them....I  have worked PoD for months and have yet to see one drop off of the pile of bile or any other mob that Alaka says drops it....Doesn't Nullify Magic or Cancel magic work as good as Pumie?   I load those spells as well.... Send more info if you can plz...ty...Btw ..I am above 60 so maybe you can suggest some other spells other than Aura of Darkness....Ignite Blood and Blood of Hate...and why don't I have these spells...do they sell in POK Library...will look later....any info is appreciated...Thanks...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>GorranVZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Stacking your buffs right is really important too.  Certain debuffs/dots will overwrite buffs so you can quickly dispell them if you have your order right.  Like for example, Malos overwrites bobbing corpse and many different dots overwrite aura of battle.  <br />
<br />
The best is to put 2 crap buffs in your top slots and then proceed with your normal buffs.  When you engage in pvp, click the top 2 buffs so they are open for any dots/debuffs they might cast, then dispell them right away.<br />
<br />
Aura of darkness is a great spell to cast in pvp because all debuffs have a 50% increased effectiveness in pvp.  Assuming you're on a pvp server, from what I understand all spells with recourses don't work in pvp on blue servers.  I would ditch the cascading darkness and go with engulfing darkness, it's lower mana and cast time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mrbad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">This is good to know...One thing I noticed too...is the fact that some of these characters on EQ are so dam uber...I have played my character for 4yrs now...I am trying to compete with some of these guys...attributes are plus 300...resists above 300...focus effects on pratically every item...that is insane...where do they get these incredible advantages...Legends?....do they buy them with real money from a website ...curious to know...Like your character Gorran....how does one get so uber?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>GorranVZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I wouldn't consider my character 'uber'.  Check out www.eqrankings.com for some insane profiles.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mrbad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">So...how does one get so uber....I just dont see anyone having 16 hours a day......7 days a week.....and doing this without anything else....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>senor sperro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">people get uber by playing alot... thats it plain and simple<br />
<br />
in pvp, i used to use clinging darkness to save mana.. im not sure how long it lasts in pvp but i used it cuz it cost me only 15 mana and bards like to resists that shiat<br />
<br />
spears are ghey, dont use them they are a waste of time~it is better to use spells that have negative resists modifiers like blood of hate, ignite blood, and all those other blood spells we got out there<br />
<br />
as for those uber people with 300+ resists, get ur aaxp horse so u can run..theres no shame in running sometimes<br />
<br />
gorran put it right on stacking buffs correctly, put virtue and c3 last of all so that it has the least chance of getting dispelled<br />
<br />
and theres always strategies on certain classes: like buying cure potions for shamans and necros... those 10charge ones that cure disease and cure poision(seperate ones)<br />
<br />
against druids go all FR, when they dot you just dispell it<br />
<br />
and pumice is so much better than our cancel magic because it has a cast time of 3 seconds compared to our 5 seconds and it has insta recast~in other words u can click it again right after it was used~no waiting to recast!<br />
<br />
on enchanters im not sure about it but i think if u dot urself ( like with disease cloud) it can break their mez, its fun but i still get my ass kicked by them all the time (they dispell all ur buffs most of the time)<br />
<br />
one important thing is to always check the zone and remember peoples class so that you will know who u might be fighting soon :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shadowsoal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">vs. an enchanter or a bard the dot must be dealing negative hp, so if your hp regeneration  standing is 37 or less and you have pact of hate, disease cloud will work (if you can get your regen to be -1 or more with pact + disease cloud it will break mez),  when you look at my magelo, you see my base regen is too high, that I can't disease cloud myself to break chanter mez, and most other dots we have either don't last long enough to be worth it, or deal too much damage to us, dotting yourself is a good tactic in the low end, but not in the high end.<br />
<br />
generally vs. a chanter, they will mez you strip you of every buff tash you defbuff you move max range, nuke you, rezmez you etc.  gonna wanna start w/ a pet and REALLY hard dps, key to beating a chanter is beating the living christ out of them fast, put dots on them, use bash wisely.<br />
<br />
a key to winning pvp is playing your opponent, if your playing a Tacvi geared person, then darkness + aystol line is totally useless, if your fighting someone who is bazaar geared may consider using them.<br />
<br />
person spell setup<br />
1) best lifetap<br />
2) 2nd best lifetap<br />
3) best poison based dot<br />
4) best fire based dot<br />
5) shadowstep<br />
6) best spear<br />
7) 2nd best poison based dot<br />
8) 2nd best disease based dot<br />
9) 2nd best spear<br />
<br />
use your discs wisely, don't burn Harm Touch till you know its going to kill them, use leech curse when your low on hp and mana, soul shield is used when your fightinging a melee and he pops disc and you can't get outa range, or a mage/shaman etc. casts swarm pet on you.<br />
<br />
kiting your opponent is a good idea, sure fire way to beat any warrior monk rogue berserker, is to get up on that pony, and run your tail off, stop, put a dot on them, run more, its slow, its painful, but they will die</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>GorranVZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Heh chanters are easy to kill if you can get your dots to land.  Put your lich in the very last buff spot and start casting the shit out of DoTs.  Their rune won't block DoT damage so just stack them up.  Dark Constriction might be a shitty PvE DoT, but with aura of darkness stuck I seem to land it quite a lot.  Another trick that I don't think has been fixed yet is the cloak line of spells will block the druid Hand of Ro debuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shadowsoal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">no AoDarkness on blue servers, best thing we have is tash stick, more user friendly w/ bandolier now</div></div><hr />
