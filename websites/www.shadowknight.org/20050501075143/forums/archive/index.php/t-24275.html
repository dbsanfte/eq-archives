<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shadowsoal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">idk, FT4 w/ 3700 mana, could prolly try to solo in HoH, zone in, there is a field to your left, go in there summon a pet buff up, YOU WILL NEED CRACK, make sure a pet is up, FD split the two guards at the front, pull one into the green graveyard area, keep it snared, kite around perimeter, use your most mana efficient dotys, if you find you have extra mana, add another dot, you don't have a huge manapool or large mana regen, this may be slow, but its decent solo at 62 especially when you get the hang of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Oagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yep, aggro kiting in HoH, letting skinny and your dots do the work.  You might also try Droga.  Nukers are kinda nasty, but the melees are gimps.</div></div><hr />

start at the east end of the zone and/or the drop down area from nurga zone until you get the hang of it.  no room for kiting until some have been cleared.  some gate. do what you can for resists.  west end of nurga is not horrible either.  also, tons of other good places already suggested on these boards - suggest you use search.</div></div><hr />

Heh, I've done a decent amount of soloing in droga at various points... Always considered the casters to be the &quot;relax and take a break&quot; mobs though, and the melee's the annoying ones.  ;)  Not that anything in droga is particularly hard - stuff hits for like... low 200's max and doesn't have a lot of HP.  Pretty good XP for how easy the stuff is.  <br />
<br />
You should be able to toe-to-toe in droga - there are three areas in the zone of different level ranges that should cover 60-70.  Many pulls come single, those that don't can be pet pulled using your normal pet until you get the 68 pet, at which point you'd have to swap out.  FD pulling works too if you're good at managing casters.</div></div><hr />
