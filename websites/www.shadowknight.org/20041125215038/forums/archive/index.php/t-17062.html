<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>DConquest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was thinking today, fixing Leech Touch would be soo easy.  Just make it crit every time like Super HT with SCF.  1500 is almost what I get on Touch of Inny crits.  3k is actually worth using if you find yourself next on the MT list, Rampage, or healer is oom / late during a fight with a nasty AoE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kizzestra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You can or at least should conceivably be able to do a 6k self heal if you crit the damage and heal portions of Leech Touch for maximum effect. Asking for a no-fail 3k heal is overboard imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>DConquest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's not overpowering imo because it's a 72 - 36 min ability and 3k is far from a complete heal ( 50 - 30 percent of most SKs buffed hp ), you give up the chance to use Super HT, and it's not targetable like Paladin CH ( self only ).    You might get a 6k crit, but that would be very rare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kizzestra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Use Leech Curse and Leech Touch and you can get most of your hps back no prob. No reason to give us yet another ability that everyone will cry about and get nerfed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Drakonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Actually I agree with Darkc... haven't even bought Leech Touch after talking to another SK who said it's the most useless AA points he's ever spent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>DConquest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I agree Leech Curse and Leech Touch is more than enough to heal on encounters before Elementals, but when mobs start smacking you for 2929 + a pop and have 1500 - 3k AoEs...  you need something to stay alive long enough for Clerics to transition to you in an emergency situation.   Especially in a guild like mine that doesn't have many Warriors and Knights usually end up on Rampage duty.</div></div><hr />
