<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">With the changes in Bind Wound (you can now BW while sitting), and the ability to BW up to 70% of health, the First Aid AA is not that bad. (Not the best you can use your AA's on, but still, not bad.)<br />
<br />
With First Aid 3 you can bind wound up to 100%...not bad when you have a lich spell on and want to &quot;top off&quot; your health, or trying to recover from a Rezz while the healer meditates.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">First Aid is one of those AA's I didn't put high on my must-have list, mostly because I didn't bind wound at all while I was levelling up.  Being able to bind while sitting was a nice change, I remember that patch message, but I wonder though if we can bind wound while feigned?  I'd imagine not, but if we could then it'd move waaay up my list.<br />
<br />
Heh, bind wound (8) and archery (11) are my only unmaxed non-tradeskill skills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have it, I'll try it feigned. I doubt it works. The reason i got it was I sometimes duo'd with a mage in Akheva and often there was downtime while he healed. This was before Zev's, Dark Empathy wasn't cutting it. Pretty crappy AA in the grand scheme of things, maybe it would have been good in its present iteration 3 years ago.</div></div><hr />
