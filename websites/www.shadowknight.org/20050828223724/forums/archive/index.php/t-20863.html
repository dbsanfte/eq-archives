<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Prylos</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 12:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">From all the posts that I have read it talks about it being great for iksars. Is there even a difference? The sword looks great and has good stats, but I dont see how it would serve an Iksar any better than another race of SK. If theres something you know that I dont please explain( and theres probabaly alot hehe)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Naelyan</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 12:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mostly because if you're non-iksar, you have to do faction work for anywhere from about a week to over a month (which is what it took me, mostly because i took a 3 week break from EQ during my 5 week factioning). If you're an iksar, you get to skip all of that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Prylos</div><div class="date">03-31-2004, 07:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah, I see, but doesnt it make it that much better when you finally get it?</div></div><hr />

use iksar illusion potions, save a whole LOT of time</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Naelyan</div><div class="date">04-01-2004, 03:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">you still need to do some faction, even with potions, and for some of us, we actually like to do things the proper way instead of cheating our way around it.<br />
<br />
To answer your question though Prylos, no, being iksar doesn't have any effect on the weapon itself, or the quest for that matter, once you have the required faction.</div></div><hr />
