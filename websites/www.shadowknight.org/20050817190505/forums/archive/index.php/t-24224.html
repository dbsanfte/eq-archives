<br />
I have a general EQtoolbox map, but it doesn't show too much.<br />
On my server no one ever seems to camp the cold side, not sure why.  We have three basic camps that everyone seems to hunt at:<br />
Stairs, at the first landing of the stairs<br />
Statue, all the way up to the top of the stairs, at the statue or in the West room<br />
RS<br />
<br />
I can tank here and other places, but often I am a group's puller or even puller and tank.  I am expected from my group to have knowledge of the name's PHs, respawn timing etc.  If I don't know a place I try and ask around and do some exploring, however, with this expansion, even months into it, I still find many people just dont know.  I hate not knowing every spawn in this zone this far into it.<br />
<br />
Please feel free to share your info or provide a link to a better map, whatever you can tell would be great.  details please!!</div></div><hr />

Ice side = Roamers' paradise. <br />
<br />
Add to this that the Ice mobs have annoying procs and casts like neverending mezzes or stuns, you'll have the answer to the question &quot;Why is everybody heading upstairs. <br />
<br />
Then you'll notice that the drops dowstairs are nearly total crap compared to the Fire side. Except for the 20 AC &quot;Ore of stone strengh&quot; or the Form of defense 1 Urn (if you don't have the upgrade), I don't see any item worth it for a melee at the level needed to get down there and fight efficiently. Shoulders with 17 ac, 1HB weapon with crappy ratio, 2HS sword with an even worse ratio, +1 cold damage aug to list a few. All crap ! <br />
<br />
Fire : +70 hps aug x 4, +65 hps aug x 4, Celestial lorica, +4 dom (2Hweaps only) aug, +25 AC aug x 4 and a few more jewels are dropping in this side of the zone. You got your winner !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eggborn</div><div class="date">02-12-2005, 08:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the ice explanation.  Now how about a guide for pulling the camps?<br />
<br />
I will start with what I know:<br />
<br />
Statue:<br />
Run all the way upstairs invis.  Before each landing, con the mobs you see.  If one can see you hold or evac till it paths away then continue to camp. <br />
<br />
If the named isn't up, set up on the right ledge in the west room.  When rdy, aggro the mob in the center.  It is a PH for a named.  Once it dies start timer for 19.5 mins and begin my tagging the mobs single with spells or arrows in the large room.  Be sure to pull the mob in the center of the room to the East, as it is a PH too.  Before your West room camp spawns, get everyone on the ledge.  A bard is great to have to help avoid the charm if the named chooses to do so.  Anyone who leaves the ledge will have aggro on the mob when it spawns in the center of the room.<br />
<br />
Now, the stairs:<br />
<br />
I pulled the hallway up to the first right, and then the first room to the left. I tried to clear down to the next room on the right.  Should I have gone straight instead?  Should I pull the first hallway beyond the first right?  Is the named on the map at the end room on the right hallway one to pull for xp/loot?  What are the PH's?  I never got a named for the three hours I was there, so I think maybe I did it incorrectly. No one else knew the PH's while I was on.  HELP please.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Menon Lifeblight</div><div class="date">02-12-2005, 09:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ice side is pretty trivial if you have a mezzer with the high-level mezz.  Until then, it's...challenging.  There are no safe spots.  The one-minute stun/mezz that mobs cast on you can be removed with RC.  The AE stun isn't as bad as it sounds.  I kinda like ice side, just because it's a little different.  Plenty of named to choose from, and no competition.<br />
<br />
For stairs camp, there are four PHs you want to pull.<br />
<br />
Up the stairs, then right, there is an aneuk on the left-hand side of the room.  He comes solo.  PH for Aneuk Painwringer.<br />
<br />
Right, then first left from camp there is a room with 3 mobs.  One is an ikaav.  PH for for Ikaav Neuromancer.  All mobs in this room are single pulls.<br />
<br />
Right, then second left from camp there is a room with a commanded chimera on the right side.  PH for Companion Prefect.  Comes solo.<br />
<br />
Right, then right, there is a pyrilen in the middle of a large round room.  PH for Pyrilen Something (too early to remember stuff).  Wait for dogs to path away, pull the trash mob to his left first, and then single pull.<br />
<br />
You'll need semi-decent DPS and not much AFK time to get all four PHs in a 19-minute span.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eggborn</div><div class="date">02-12-2005, 10:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">nice thanks.<br />
<br />
Can you also help with the ice side?  I know a monk and enchanter who often group together who I think would go for this.  Where are some names here?  Do you keep moving ldon style since there are no safe spots?<br />
<br />
Upgrades are nice, but many of us, including me are looking for runes.  I have needed one more greater for AE taunt for months now, driving me nuts, and have not seen a glowing or ancient yet.<br />
<br />
Where to go in the ice side with my chanter friend?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Siilvir</div><div class="date">02-14-2005, 03:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For Fire pull everything, and you will find the nameds. That is the best way to learn it. Two fast killing groups can probably kill almost all of the named (four or so for each camp). Three even moderately good groups can for sure. Fire side is snoresville, except for one camp.<br />
<br />
Downstairs is where the fun is. Almost every large room has a named, plus several of the roamers are also PH's. Again kill everything and you will learn what you need to do. Ice is so much more exciting, and you really need to stay on top of the timers if you are chain pulling three rooms and 4-5 roamers.<br />
<br />
Loot wise, they both have something to offer (as noted above), but Fire has more. The RvR is off and the loot tables should have been reversed.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravilicus</div><div class="date">02-15-2005, 10:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Riftseeker's Beastiary (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?zone=265) <br />
<br />
The stairs leading up to fire side is definitely the easiest camp, and there is really only one wandering mob you need to deal with.  Clearing the PHs as described above you can get the Molten Metal Bracer (Channeler Pyren), Celestial Lorica (Companion Prefect), +65 Hp augs (Companion Prefect, sadly occupy same slots as LDoN AC augs), a fire DD proc augment (Ruiner Isaka), and spell runes.  If your group doesn't have the highest DPS and clearing everything repeatedly is too much, you can still manage to pull the Companion Prefect (or PH) single right over Pyrilen mobs without them assisting by using a pet and/or Circlet.<br />
<br />
Heading up the stairs all the way to statue will bring you to a camp with two easilly pullable named; the Researcher and Summoner (located in the middle of the round rooms adjacent to statue main room).  They drops runes, one has +70 Hp aug, one has +70 mana aug.  Sadly, they can charm, which is a hassle.  If your group can handle alot of clearing, it is also possible to pull the Pyrilen Riftseeker PH (or Balancer Relik, same room) all the way back to statue camp but this again is a mob that charms and is a tough, longish pull in an area with lots of wandering mobs.  Riftseeker drops 25 AC augs, however, so is worth camping all by itself.  Statue camp is typically farmed most often for the glowing and greater runes.<br />
<br />
Ice does seem to have more wanderers, but there are places you can safely camp once you have cleared though a bit.  Like the fire side, I find the first flight of stairs to be the safest, easiest camp, but pulling phs back to the camp is a long pull.  From here I have been able to grab Mistwalker (drops ring and shield) and Girplan Shardtender (drops 20 AC aug).  The Discordling Shardmender PH (drops a belt) is also around here somewhere.  Again, using pet and circlet will allow you to pull non-Gelidran PH mobs (Girplans, Ferans, or Discordlings) without the Gelidrans assisting.  This will save you alot of work once you get the hang of it.  Doing this I usually don't even bother clearing the wandering Gelidrans, so long as they don't see invis.  I haven't worked my way in far enough to get to the Girplan Stonesinger camp, but the chalice is worth farming if you lack a Form of Endurance clicky.</div></div><hr />

I pretty much know where every other named is in the zone, but I haven't found that one.  I realize it drops caster stuff, but casters need loot too.  My guess is that it is in the following room:  If you take the main hallway until you get to the side passage that goes directly north (it loops around back south towards the Girplan Stonesinger), there are 2 rooms that branch off to the east.  The northernmost room has 3 discordlings in it.  That is my guess, but I've never seen the named (probably partly due to it not being pulled often).<br />
<br />
Now that I peruse Allakhazam's, I realize that I also have no idea where the Gelidran Frostformer is.  He drops ass so I don't really care much, but if he is near something else and might drop a rune, could be handy to know.  I'm going to guess he is maybe in that lower left room (SW) that shows '??' on my map.<br />

On a different note - I have roamed around the entire ice basement - there is absolutely no safe spot - except for the king room.  And since even regular mobs have that ice stun/mez - there is never any reason to go into the basement except for a particular piece of loot.<br />

The one I'm missing now is the Discordling Shardmender.  Again, I don't need his loot at all, but it bugs me to have one missing from my map.  The things I have read say he is a roamer, in ice side.  I ran all over on a friends rogue, and not once did I see a roaming discordling downstairs or upstairs.  The *only* place I see one is on the main floor, in the &quot;ice theme&quot; rooms.  A discordling surveyor pathed from the room right next to the stairs down, across the next room, and stopped in front of the third room, which is the next exit to the main zone in room.  Is that him?<br />
<br />
Furthermore, does anyone else find it strange that there are literally dozens of mobs on the main level, and none of them (with the possible exception of that discordling) are ph's for named?  Are those just supposed to be for groups to xp on or something?  I have to assume with the months that have gone by since release someone would have found if there were any named there, even if just from server resets.</div></div><hr />

Hmm, then he's been missing for awhile now on Brell.  I know I've actually killed that named once, because the melee belt rotted, but a bard was pulling that time, and it was over a month ago.  With the recent pathing screwups in MPG I guess I shouldn't be surprised though.  Kuroun (the guy that drops plate pants) and his 2 buddies have been gone completely for weeks.  Stormer was in the middle of a passageway near Blind Hunter, and Sentinel Siofat is up somewhere, just can't be found.  And one time Companion Prefect's ph was completely unpullable, he would warp away to somewhere else and never reach you, and if you tried to stand there and melee him he'd summon you under the world.  Even though he was standing right on his spot when unaggro.  So I guess it is possible there is a discordling roamer somewhere I won't find until a patch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As far as the Discordling Shardmender guy - I can confirm on 3/28/5 that he still spawns - his ph is one of the two discordlings that roam basically around the entire center portion of the basement.<br />
<br />
If you camp in the loopey passageway north/east of the AC20 droppin Girplan guy - both discordlings will roam right through your camp.  I am guessing either one can spawn as the named guy.<br />
<br />
Its a nice camp if you time those 2 little fuckers.  They roam very fast and have a tendency to show up when you least expect them.   The girplan guy can be pulled solo just by standing near him.<br />

(Why is everything miniature I wonder).<br />

As best I can tell - you have to actually take damage from the lich form for it to break mez.  I havent tried using dark temptation..that is a good idea tho.<br />

But when I have druid regen on...mez didn't break....or at least it lasted so long I panicked and clicked it off.  If so dark temptation wont do more damage then my worn regen. (so it wont work)<br />

As an aside - I been trying to camp Mistwalker for the ring and shield...what a crummy camp - like 8 statics and 4 roamers all near his tiny room - anyone find any tricks to get to this guy.</div></div><hr />

You just have to keep a close watch on the clock to know when wanderers are due to respawn and be ready for them.<br />
<br />
I've always started by clearing fromt he very first corner in Ice, to be sure to clear out wanderers before setting up camp down there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravilicus</div><div class="date">04-08-2005, 08:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I pull Mistwalker to the first flight of stairs leading down to the Ice side from the zone in.<br />
<br />
Pull any see invis wanderers/statics along the way, then place a pet at the entrance to the round room where Mistwalker spawn.  Go around the corner to the stairway leading back to camp and use F9 to do a quick check for wandering Gelidrans.  Gelidrans don't assist the other creature model mobs, but they will proximity aggro so look out for them.  What I do is pretarget Mistwalker, sacrifice my pet to aggro him and his buddies in the room (Girplan and Taskfiend model mobs), try to land snare on him and / or FD before getting beat down.  If I manage to get him split then I Rule #1 and head back to camp with him snared in tow.  I refresh snare on him to build aggro and keep him stuck to me in case I get aggro from something along the way back somehow and that's it.<br />
<br />
I haven't got the shield yet but I've got the ring, and it is pretty handy if you don't have Qvic arms, Time BP, or Ikkinz Legs, etc.<br />
<br />
Mistwalker is a challenge to pull unless you just clear the whole area and specifically camp him.  It is a fun challenge though and if you practice at it you'll be able to get him or his PH singled regularly without even having to clear a single wanderer.  However, if you are going to go through all this trouble, make sure you are clearing the PH for the Girplan Shardtender.  Having four 20 AC augs &gt; the Ring and Shield that Mistwalker drops.</div></div><hr />

For me it is easier than clearing all the mobs and worrying about respawn or wanderers during a fight with a named.  Once I kill the one Gelidran spawn on the stairway, that gives me 20 minutes to work the Girplan and/or Mistwalker PH spawns.<br />

The key is that Gelidrans don't assist the other mobs unless you are visible.</div></div><hr />
