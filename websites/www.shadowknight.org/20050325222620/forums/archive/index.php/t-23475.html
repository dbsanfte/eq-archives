<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>yadaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">im sure alot of people knows this but o well<br />
<br />
ok so i was in the bazaar arena running around<br />
saw a Bazaar guard<br />
<br />
theres 3 prisoners on the west side and a locked gate that used to be open on the east side of the arena, that lead to the secret room<br />
<br />
Hail, a Bazaar guard (conned yellow to 53)<br />
<br />
a Bazaar guard says 'Please do not agitate the prisoners. I am here to keep the peace.'<br />
<br />
and there are 3 prisoners behind him, each in their own cell<br />
<br />
Hail, a prisoner<br />
<br />
a prisoner leans forward and whispers, 'Psst, you'll never get the guards here to budge. They don't make deals, don't take bribes and they are much too careful to cath by suprise. If you promise to help me, I can tell you [where to find the keys].'<br />
<br />
What keys<br />
<br />
a prisoner nods and continues to whisper, 'Before we were brought to these cells, we were held in Katta briefly. I bet you'd find a keys to these blasted cages and another key to our shackles there, and the best part is that the guards are much more careless... Are you with me? [Do you understand]?'<br />
<br />
I understand<br />
<br />
a prisoner says 'Lift the keys, kill them, whatever. I don't care. Just do it quickly and do it quietly. Don't know how much longer before they move us to a new location. This may be our only chance to escape.'<br />
<br />
<br />
