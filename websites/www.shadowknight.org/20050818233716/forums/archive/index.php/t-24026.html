<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ephyr</div><div class="date">01-14-2005, 04:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Our EP level guild is looking at doing Pyrique Redwing, I'm researching strategy....found this as the most useful post on alla's and thought i would post it here and ask a few questions if anyone has already done her...<br />
<br />
from Alla's<br />
<br />
- SPOILER - <br />
------------------------------------------------- <br />
<br />
Theory: <br />
The &quot;real&quot; version, which in essence is a fake, is transfering your damage to an invisible Pyrique Redwing. Once you kill the invisible form the real Pyrique Redwing will reappear. <br />
<br />
How it's done: <br />
Setup your group in the Tower just before hers. Kill the 4-5 mobs inhabiting the tower and setup camp. Finish any last minute buffs. <br />
<br />
The first part is very easy. Have your MA pull her out of her tower. She quads for 900s, nothing else. Healers use quick heals to keep the MA up, as she will despawn after getting her down to 75%. <br />
<br />
She will then disappear and 6 shadows of her will spawn back in here tower. Just a side note: dont aggro the shadows until you are ready to begin..5 of them are &quot;fakes&quot; and cast a 1500dmg single target nuke, and they will proceed to nuke anyone who gains aggro during your prep time. <br />
<br />
Now you will need 6 tanks for this encounter. Give each tank a shadow to tank, and give each tank a cleric/healer. I recommend putting back up healers on each tank as well (see why later). <br />
<br />
As you engage the 6 different shadows 5 of them will hit for 100-200s or less and nuke for 1500. The 6th shadow is the &quot;real&quot; version that hits for 900 damage. <br />
<br />
Therefore, as tanks gain aggro, the one who has the &quot;real&quot; version needs to call engage for the rest of the raid and the rest of the raid will /assist said tank..and engage on the &quot;real&quot; version. <br />
<br />
All backup healers (Druids) will then switch from healing the other 5 tanks (clerics will remain on their appointed tanks regardless), and will proceed to dps the &quot;real&quot; version. NOTE: IF you are the backup healer and your tank has the &quot;real&quot; version, continue to heal with the appointed cleric, as you dont want the tank to die. <br />
<br />
Here comes the confusing part. After hitting on the &quot;real&quot; version for a few seconds all 6 shadows will shimmmer and reappear. This is normal, but it will appear as you arent gaining any ground...read further. <br />
<br />
In all actuality you are gaining ground, as the invisible version is being hurt...you just dont know that. <br />
<br />
Rinse and repeat: Have the tank that is tanking the &quot;real&quot; version call engage and go from there. <br />
<br />
You will do this about 10-20 times, depending on your dps, and eventually the real Pyrique Redwing will reappear at 100%. Healers fast heal the MA and proceed to give her a dirt nap.<br />
<br />
<br />
Questions:<br />
<br />
1.  When the versions shimmer and the hard hitting one moves...do the mobs need to be retargeted, or do each of the 6 stay targeted by the folks that have them currently targeted?<br />
<br />
2.  When the versions shimmer and the hard hitting one moves...do the mobs need to be reslowed/debuffed? or do they stay slowed? or do just the ones that changed need to be reslowed/debuffed?<br />
<br />
3.  can anyone confirm the max hits of 900ish for main and 200ish for the shadow versions? and can anyone confirm that this is non-defensive?<br />
<br />
4. when you are hitting on the mobs...does their HP bar move at all? and does the switch happen at a certain hp point on main mob? trying to figure out if you can call that the switch is goiong to happen so folks can be ready...<br />
<br />
thansk for your help and of you who have done this event...any feedback is appreciated...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zedlepln</div><div class="date">01-17-2005, 09:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. they need to be retargetted; it's a bitch too.<br />
<br />
2a. yes<br />
2b. no<br />
2c. all 5 reset at the same time<br />
<br />
3. yes, not defensive.<br />
<br />
4. mob hp bar moves, yes, hopefully you move the DPS classes to the real version, but all 5 have their own hp bar....I don't know of any trick to know when the reset will occur, but it all happens pretty quickly.<br />
<br />
Having tanks get agro and quickly call whether they have the real version so you can quickly put DPS on that one seems to be the biggest challenge. The first few seconds after a reset when the AE fires and you dont know who has the real version seems to be the most vulnerable.<br />
<br />
Overall a fun encounter.</div></div><hr />

QUOTE]<br />
<br />
Did i miss something about an AE?<br />
<br />
I was aware that each of the shadow versions cast a 1500 dd proc every 5 seconds....is there an AE as well that is not listed on Alla's?<br />
<br />
and follow up question on targeting...as i understand it from your feedback....when the real mob moves...it does so by all the mobs &quot;shimmering&quot; or something...no actual movement....so while you need to retarget...if the 6 mobs are spread out with a tank on each...you should be able to reclick/f8 on the mob right in front of you rather than moving to a mob somewhere else?<br />
<br />
thanks again for your info...<br />

<br />
Its not an AE, but they do have a tendency to all nuke the same tank it seems.  Its as if they share the same initial agro list and they all nuke the first person that gets agro.</div></div><hr />
