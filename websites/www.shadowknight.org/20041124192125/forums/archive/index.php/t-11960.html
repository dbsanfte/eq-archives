<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nostradomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a few suggestions for PoP flags that I would like to see implemented.  <br />
<br />
First off they need to make the planar projections last longer, I would say minimum should be 30 minutes.  The guild I am in on Sol Ro killed Grummus and right at end of fight I HTed the him for 7848 which he didnt like too much, and he turned and killed me right at the last second of the fight.  Upon recieving a rez I crashed to desktop and I know that bug has been around since pop was released.  Then upon trying to log back in I had that dang syncro bug and could not log on.  It is no longer possible to get a world kick from chat room which compounds the problem.<br />
<br />
Second is reimplementing the world kick to chat room.  This covers many situations and not just PoP flags.  That sycro bug affects everyone and there are many times that you need to be kicked in on large raid type situations for loot, expedience for killing the mob, or otm calls to prevent a bad situation from becoming worse.<br />
<br />
Third Sony needs to accually reply to petitions and take care of their customers when someone suffers from bugs they havent gotten around to fixing.  I petitioned the situation regarding Grummus and did not recieve a reply.  That is bad customer relations and piss poor management.<br />
<br />
Fourth Sony needs to fix some of these crash bugs and the syncro bug that prevent people from logging back on.<br />
<br />
Fifth Sony needs to reexamine this flag and key system and alternate routes to advance in the planes.  It is simply not good enough to only allow advancement through mob killing and not questing.  Yes you can progress to certain planes via quest atm but if you wish to get flagged beyond those planes to the elemental planes you MUST kill those mobs. <br />
<br />
The VT key quest may be long and alot to do doing one key quest that is long but one group and partially soloable with dozens of keys and flags that require from a group to raid force to do is just wrong in all aspects of the game.  I have been on quite a few raids to these events and have missed getting CoD and Tactics flags for one stupid reason or another and nearly the entire guild has these flags.  At some point soon the guild will move on and I will be stuck and not able to raid with the guild.  Even with the new implementation of being able to group with raid and enter some zone in PoP without a flag.  CoD does not seem to apply to those rules as our guild tryed to do that one day.  <br />
<br />
Its time that Sony stop putting in key quest and flag events to progress or enter zones PERIOD!  I will be highly disappointed if there are any such implemented with the next expansion.   I enjoy EQ and the content in PoP.  I have had no problem up till this point keeping up with our guild on keys and flags.  The frustration I am having trying to get flagged is beyond what I am able to express here.  I have given 3 friends access to log on my character to attend events duel boxing me for flag and yet last night none of them were on to do so when the guild killed Behemoth last night.  I am willing to tag along with other guilds and even pay to get a flag for the zones needed and still the flags evade me.   <br />
<br />
So I appeal to this forum for support and some insight into this matter.  What suggestions do you have and what are your opinions of the flag system and all the keys required for PoP?</div></div><hr />

the key quest for CoD is also one-groupable.  i have two of the four parts just from experience grouping with friends a few times, and two of the other people that i grouped with have their entire key.  the only problem is that if a lot of people tried to go this route it would take forever because everyone would be competing for the same four semi-rare spawns.<br />

<br />
did you have the minimum number of people in your raid to allow carry-ons?  i think you have to have 30 flagged people before this rule kicks in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nostradomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes, CoD does not appear to be one of the zones that you can do that with.  The guild officers made sure to have the minimum requirements and tryed all sorts of ways to make it work at just trying to get one person in to see if we could do it.  <br />
<br />
As far as questing for the CoD flag, that I can do but it will not allow me to progress further in the planes.  Which means we still have to kill Grummus and get flagged to reach the elemental planes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Daeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">umm you might not have to just key .<br />
<br />
get caprin key kill ber get his flag grummus flag is just for entrance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Keyan Aubaine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">CoD works just fine to zone in with the 85% rule.<br />
<br />
Bert is a key and not a flag, therefore it doesn't apply.</div></div><hr />
