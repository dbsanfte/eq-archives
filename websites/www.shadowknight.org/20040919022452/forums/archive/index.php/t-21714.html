Does anyone know whether it gives a 15% chance to channel through each hit, or 15% no matter how many mobs are hitting you?<br />
<br />
I wondered about it the other day when I channeled a successful FD at about 5% hps with a huge train of blue con trash mobs hitting on me.<br />
<br />
Most likely just a very lucky fluke but it made me wonder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Silku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've managed to channel through 4 or 5 hard ldon style mobs recently with just rank 1 of this.  I try to watch for the burt break (when mobs aren't hitting) to start my cast.  I couldn't do it often at all before taking rank 1, but with it I can do it almost every time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have a theory that theres only one roll against channeling through getting hit.  I've been interupted 4-5 times with one mob on me, and channeled first time with 10-12 mobs.  Push movement is a whole different story.<br />
<br />
Anyways, the AA helps channeling in some form, I pull alot, so I bought it immediately after tanking/scf/sa sets.</div></div><hr />
