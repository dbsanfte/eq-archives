<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ghosteater</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ok been looking for teydar and have checked illia's but no one has posted a loc for him in qeynos sewers. please if someone could mention the loc of his spot or whether hes a rare spawn or such would be big help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ziagwa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Qeynos Catacombs (http://eqatlas.com/qeynoscatacombsmap.html)<br />
<br />
He can be found at 8c on the map, hope that helps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Covi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">easiest way to get to him is to go through the Arena by the Warrior's Gm and then follow the trail of bones on the floor leading through a false wall to zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brildayr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ziagwa = wrong.  real close, but wrong.<br />
<br />
I know, I just handed in my hide, enchanted bar and spine yesterday.<br />
<br />
using same map, west of 8c, and just a hair east of 8a/8b.   <br />
<br />
In the next room east of 8a/8b on the south wall.  He spawns next to the cleric spell merchant, female (erudite or human, can't remember what race she is).<br />
<br />
Look at the pic in Allakhazam of Teydar.  Notice the red wall on the right side of the pic.  That pic was taken while facing south (actually, SW) while standing in the room just east of 8a/8b.</div></div><hr />
