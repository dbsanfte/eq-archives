<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kowl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My guild raided the Hole last night so that I could get the fights I needed there for my epic out of the way. The orginal plan was for us to kill Kyrenna and then for me to leave the Hole, do the turn in with Marl Kastane and go back in the Hole to finish off Gholnor. Well before the raid I thought I would run some seals since I hadn't turned in the dusty tome and I wanted my faction to alright for turn in later. Well I already had a Seal of Kastane on me from earlier so I just ran to Paineel to do the hide/turn in trick. I get there and Gerot Kastane is not in his ussual spot. I look around a little thinking maybe he aggroed somebody and got pulled away from his spot or something like that. He wasn't in Paineel. I petitioned a GM and they said they couldn't spawn him. He seemed to think the recent patch might have screwed him upp and said it would probably take another patch to fix it. <br />
I figured that I could still do the raid and just do the ole hide/turn in trick with Marl Kastane and still get Gholnor. I ran over to Kerra Island to check on Marl and she was missing also. I contacted another GM and got the same response from them. I sent in a bug report on both of them.<br />
This was on the Kane Bayle server by the way. Just thought anybody that was at this part of their epic would like to know about this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Talonmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">All of our epic mobs (except the random pop ones--- drakes, mimics, rhazar) are a 3 day spawn from server reset.<br />
<br />
There was no bug here.<br />
<br />
If you did it yesterday, it had not been 3 days from the server reset and our quest mobs had not spawned yet.<br />
<br />
Caradon should not have been up either, unless they changed him in the hole revamp.</div></div><hr />
