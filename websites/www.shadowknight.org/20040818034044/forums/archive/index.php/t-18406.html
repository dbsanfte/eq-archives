<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vezax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ive been trying the past couple weeks to try and solo her and nothing seems to be working.  Her guards are tied to her agro so even if i snare pull solo her guards add even when im out of their agro radius.  And another problem is when i do clear the guards, my down time is too long between guards to get a good attempt at her solo.<br />
<br />
Just to give you a rough estimate of my gear 1300 ac, 4900 hp, 20 worn atk, 100+ in all resists, primal, 61% self haste, a GSo4W and i do have 7k HT.<br />
<br />
If anybody has soloed her post revamp can you let me know here or PM?  I would get people to help but shes been spawining at weird times and people arent on =\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tantrissa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have about the same gear/stats as you, yet I don't really think I could 2-box her.  I've killed her by 2-boxing with a cleric MANY times since the revamp and I always imagined it would be too hard for me to solo.  It's possible, but I would guess unlikely.<br />
<br />
One thing I do think I can explain though is why you think her guards are tied to her.  They aren't.  If you are looking into her room, there are 2 golems on the left, 2 golems on the right, and she is in the center.  However, there is a roaming undead mob that walks along the right side of the room, behind the golems.  This is in addition to the 2 roamers that path all the way through her room and the hallway that precedes it, which of course you have to kill first.  Since he's not a static mob, you probably still had aggro on the roamer while you had snare/fd pulled drusella.  And of course the undead roamer will bring the golems in the room with him.  So I guess you should kill that roamer as well (unless for some reason you can use our undead pacify on him... I think he's much too high for it to stick though)<br />
<br />
Anyway, late response, but hopefully useful to somebody....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Yaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I am a 65 Dread Lord on Xegony server and was doing my Chardok quests shortly after the Halls of Betrayal zone had come out since faction was now easily obtained.  Got Skargus on a server pop and did my turn in for the ring.  Now it was time to get the Urn so I could get my Cords.  I checked on Drusella but she had already got jumped.  Later on that day I took a rogue friend to Howling Stones to open the doors for me.  I flopped all the way back to her room.  Using discretion in a few areas, I had to fight or ITU through rough parts.  the rogue assisted in small fights.  There were also a couple times I had to /q out in safe areas.  Areas that were clear of mobs under normal circumstances, to avoid LARGE trains and casters (much H8 for caster mobs while flopping).  <br />
  After about 30 minutes or so, we made it to her room.  There were a couple times on the way I had to just lay there, AFK, and regen for a while.  Once we got to her room I put up ITU and regenned to full.  I waited for the 2 roamers to path away then buffed up, only had self buffs, then went ITU again and logged there for the next 3 days.<br />
     When I came back 3 days later she wasn't up yet, so while I waited for her to pop I started soloing the 2 roamers. After I downed the 2nd roamer I heard her casting in the next room so I used my Thurg Breastplate for little 100  HP heals til I got to full.  My pet was already out so I refreshed all my buffs and his.  I used at the time, Cloak of Akheva, Banshee Aura (realize now how retarded I was I coulda clicked my Chardok Ring for a greater Damage Shield), Mental Corruption, Pact of Hate, Frostreaver's Blessing, and Grim Aura.  I had out my pet and had him buffed with Augmentation of Death and gave him 2 weapons I got from the roamers.<br />
     The strat was easily executed.  I snared Drusella Sathir with Festering Darkness, she came running right out at me instead of casting at me.  I Feigned Death as she came out of her door, away from her guard's spawn points.  Once they reset I stood back up and she came at me.  Her guards didn't come to her aid and the named was even up. She hit around 350 ish max.  She melee'd about as much as she cast.  I set my pet up behind her so that he'd be hitting her in the more vulnerable back area.  I made sure that her pet stayed in my front as it is easier to dodge, parry attacks from the front.  I started off by casting Blood of Hate on her, then would lifetap every time Touch of Volatis and Zeefver's Bite would pop back up.  Nuked her with Deny Undead when I wasn't lifetapping between weapon delays.  I HT'd her when she was at 70 percent for 7704 and it got her to 2 percent, then finished her off with my nukes and melee.  She hurts, she might have beat me, but luckily she still has wuss HP.  I ended the battle with 20 percent HP. at that time my self buffed HP was 5770.  I looted my urn quick, sat around for about 5 minutes, then gated out with Thurgadin gate potion since it was the fastest gate cast I had at the time.  On my last 2 seconds of casting, a roamer spawned, wow I beat respawn by about 5 minutes.  So you have about 20 minutes to kill her after you kill the roamers, use them wisely.  But the fight with her is fairly fast if you have your HT AA's done.  AA's I recommend you have done before this fight are Spell Casting Fury 3, Unholy Touch 3, Theft of Life, Pet Discipline, and the Combat Avoidance and Durability AA's certainly don't hurt, and have an Improved Damage item too so that you have HUGE HT.<br />
     If anyone was wondering, yes I also looted the mirror and now have 3 mirror MQ's available on Xegony for around 5 K each if anyone would like one send me a tell in game.  The Acid Etched Girdle rotted as it is No Drop, and there was no one else in zone to give it to.<br />
     So that's it in a nutshell, hope it was informative.  Use this info wisely.</div></div><hr />
