<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Saknar</div><div class="date">07-04-2002, 10:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I had my first duel yesterday as a Shadowknight.  I have only dueled one other time in my eq expierence and that was with my enchanter.  I am level 40 and I dueled a level 39 BL friend of mine.  Of course he was talking trash so several people wanted to watch.  We both agreed not to use DOT's to avoid and exp death, so that eliminated fear snaring for me.  Each of us were only self buffed.  Soon as he hit duel I opened with a harm touch of course his pet was hitting me but the damage was very minimal.  He started running from me trying to kite me and let his pet hit me so I stopped and feared his pet.  Well he wanted no part of that and ran with his pet.  This continued till I life tapped him and beat him down to 1 red bub and he gave up.  Later he was telling another one of my buddies that i cheated because I feared his pet and he was worried about adds.  Well we were in DL near KC.  He claims that I should have just straight up meleed with him but he tried to kite me.  Is fearing in Duels on a blue server generally acceptable?  Anyway just though I would share my experience with the Beastlords.  Oh by the way my MR is only about 35 and ver few of his spells stuck for some reason.  Oh btw I dueled soley his pet today and it was fully buffed.  The pet took about 250 hps from me before I killed it.  I was fighitng a face to face battle no fear, snare, or DOT's.  I did use my ac str and att taps but no lifetap.  It was pretty funny he was not happy.</div></div><hr />

Grats on killing a panzy little beastlord! Just be sure to pumace his buffs (Sow, ect..) and save the HT for the kill shot (If you want to kill him). :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lucard</div><div class="date">07-12-2002, 02:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a personal thought.  I never ever open with HT.  I always finish with it.  I do this for a few reasons.<br />
1: You dont want to blow your HT on a rune type spell.<br />
2: You want to see how the balance of the duel is going before blowing you wad.<br />
3: It makes them start to wonder if you dont have it up when you dont HT right away.  Then when they get lazy and think you dont have it, POP.<br />
<br />
Not saying anything bad about anyone elses HT tactics, thats just what I like to do.  I win most duels and never even need the HT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ciliz Scalebladez</div><div class="date">07-17-2002, 09:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, you're right ~ never start with an HT.<br />
<br />
If you're going to fight a class that can get another pet up for no mana it's only obvious they're going to try and kite you with the pet.  Best thing you can do is to have a 10-charge of SoW on you for the fight, and bury that about 5-8 buffs deep so it's not dispelled.  He's going to travel at SoW speeds, and if you don't you're in for a lot of running or a pretty one-sided fight.<br />
<br />
Also, cast clinging darkness on teh pet until it sticks, then chase your beastlord around.<br />
<br />
BTW, can you seriously fear other players in /d'uels on blue servers?  I personally don't use fear other than if someone's in the zone that I know will send a pet and take off, but for mana conservation purposes I'd prolly just land a clinging and take off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shayl</div><div class="date">07-17-2002, 11:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fear and charm don't work on players on red servers, but I think they still do for duels on blue servers.  No, it's not &quot;cheating&quot;, any more than strafing is.  I'm surprised he didn't blind you with FoL, beastlords get that one pretty young.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">yuggoth</div><div class="date">07-17-2002, 12:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some people will start whining when they lose to an SK that you'cheated' by not straight meleeing them.... these people are known as 'sore losers'.  It's a duel... you followed the rules agreed on... you won, end of story.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ciliz Scalebladez</div><div class="date">07-17-2002, 01:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">See I don't understand the whole cheating thing and rules agreed on ~ I mean it's a duel, you do everything you can to win....if Verant didn't want you strafing, you wouldn't strafe or something would have been done to nerf it.<br />
<br />
SK's are NOT a straight melee melee class, so why and the hell would you stand and straight melee?  I mean seriously, it'd be like, &quot;ready, go&quot;<br />
<br />
/attack on<br />
<br />
and that's pretty much teh extent of the fight.  Do you judge skill on that as well?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Saknar</div><div class="date">07-18-2002, 08:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for replies gusy helped me out a lot.  Oh btw I would be more than happy to go toe to toe with him and his pet but he wouldn't.  He just kept running away.  With my 2hs I can hit around 120 so he wouldn't last long.  <br />
<br />
Thanks guys</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ciliz Scalebladez</div><div class="date">07-19-2002, 11:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd almost be willing to say that a beastlord would out melee us straight up like that?  I mean that pet is pretty pimp coupled with bard-like melee is a lot of hits, and depending on positioning a lot of interrupts on tapping ~<br />
<br />
I'd still joust him...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenadar W'Vern</div><div class="date">07-30-2002, 06:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If your chasing him around dark his pet first so it cant keep up with you.  Or take it to a corner, beat it down to half then dark it and go find him.  Don't kill it as he will run off an try to summon another...  You could also buy SoW potions or get JBoots and out run the pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ciliz Scalebladez</div><div class="date">07-30-2002, 11:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dark and Fear have about the same chance of landing, do one of the two to the pet and chase him down SoW'd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glitched</div><div class="date">08-02-2002, 01:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm a 35 sk and i dueled a 35 bst lord yesterday.. quite a easy duel.<br />
<br />
Not even 2 seconds after the fight started, i feared his pet. Once his most valuable asset is gone, i just straight up melee/life tap'd him till one bulb *didn't play till death* by the time he would've died.. his pet wandered back. I believe I used a little over half my mana and lost a total of about a bulb of health, now can you imagine how easy a killing blow with a ht would've been? I think there a joke class to duel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chuklez</div><div class="date">08-02-2002, 02:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just have one question... why didn't you just kill the punk outright? =)  &quot;Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't see you giving up.. whoops, my bad...&quot; <br />
<br />
It's good to be evil..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glitched</div><div class="date">08-02-2002, 03:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hahaha, i would've if he wasn't one of my good friends</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baraxul</div><div class="date">08-27-2002, 12:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Beastlords definitely weren't made with PvP in mind, all these suggestions are great, and I just have a little to add:<br />
<br />
There are three types of beastlords you can duel:<br />
<br />
Type One: &quot;Oh no he snared/feared my pet.  OH NO DAMAGE!! RUN!!!&quot;  This type dies within minutes.  You know what to do ;)<br />
<br />
Type Two: &quot;Well, if he snares my pet, I should just stand still and toe-to-toe him.  My pet will catch up and we can pwn.&quot;  This type is a pain in the ass, but a laughable one, best to snare the pet, definitely sow, and joust them since most BSTs will prefer to stick to you and dual wield all over you.<br />
<br />
Type Three: &quot;I'm going to Flash of Light you and then circle strafe around you while my pet chases you around since you will undoubtedly be running around like a beheaded chicken.&quot; This is a pain in the ass.  The only thing i can really think to do is eliminate the risk of them casting, i.e. fear kite them.  And to do that, unless i want to keep fear on both them and their warder, I sow myself with a little potion and let them run feared at full speed while i snare their pet.<br />
<br />
<br />
Type Zero: &quot;WTF? r u calling me a idiot?&quot; <br />
&lt;font color=yellow&gt;Beastlord_04 has challenged you to a duel to the death!&lt;/font&gt;<br />
&lt;font color=red&gt;Beastlord_04 regards you indifferently -- what would you like your tombstone to say?&lt;/font&gt;<br />
<br />
Anyone got any more pointers? I like this almost as much as the bard thread :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Amphitryon</div><div class="date">09-23-2002, 08:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wouldnt discount a BL as automatically easy to beat in a duel..especially if they are ready for you..specially the high lvl BLs (and if they know how to PvP)<br />
<br />
remeber they can resist buff their pets AND of course the pets use the resists of their master. if that BL has resists worth anything..fear wont stick and the pet will be gnawing your ass off.  (and of course all those DD procs going off in your face)<br />
<br />
and at many stages of the BLs life  the pet is the same lvl as the BL himself. Also dont forget the BL can S*L*O*W..which is bad news for your dmg output. The BL can also buff a lot of his own resists making life tougher for you. and he has a sow and his HP+Mana regen spell<br />
<br />
The Sks advantage is that the BLs, heals arent worth spit and they have generally low AC and their HPs arent that great. the BL is a hybrid so his mana pool isnt great either so using your mana tap could force him into straight melee sooner. <br />
<br />
so get in his face fast..if you have good resists you nullify a lot of his defenses..and id burn HT quickly on him..use the unholy aura too. and lifetap him between attacks<br />
be mindful of the pet though..dont let the pet sit there and attack you in the back..make sure you postion yourself so both the BL and the pet are in front (so you can parry/riposte)<br />
<br />
if he gets slow to stick on you, yer in trouble though (lvl 60 BL has 50% slow and they can 40% haste themselves and their pet)..at this stage counting on fear is a bad idea<br />
<br />
oh yea dont forget..Fear cant be cast on PCs on any server anymore ..besides having high resists make fear a undependable solution at best</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Satsujinma</div><div class="date">09-29-2002, 09:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i dont even bother snaring the pet i just pumice pet and then fear it once the pet is out of the way, i would then just joust him lift-tap in between and save HT for the end. instead of using a tap i may test out the mr of the guy with a darkness, if darkness lands i then cast cascading and boil blood 1800 in dots and with me hitting for 200 avg. and life taping not many bst or pet classes can hold out for long.</div></div><hr />
