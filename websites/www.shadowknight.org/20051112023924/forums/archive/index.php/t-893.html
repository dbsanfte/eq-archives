I'm really wanting to eventually hit 200int  :_)<br />
Also wouldn't mind more suggestions on my current equip since i've upgraded a bit recently.  Just click the pic for my magelo :_)</div></div><hr />

Pretty rare load from LadyM (or is that Jorleag? cant remember, they die almost at the same time anyway) it seems. Might also add that all the casters are willing to bite and kill for this item. I wish you luck if you really want to eventually get this as you shoulder item.<br />
<br />
Everything else is definitly &quot;very&quot; obtainable and only the collar may be hard (but still a reasonable goal if you can be part of a guild going to PoA on a regular basis for epics and the likes).<br />
<br />
I hope you like Kael Arena =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BrindalayShadowlace</div><div class="date">04-19-2002, 11:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe, i LOVE kael,  hehe.  I've been on 3 kael raids with my guild and gotten 2 plate drops and the silvery belt out of 'em.  :_)<br />
It's just fun to do something with a guild with all the solo'in i usually do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dracsoul</div><div class="date">04-19-2002, 11:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok well from some one who is a mana freak... I have over 2K mana.<br />
<br />
You need 2 new earings and 2 new rings.<br />
<br />
Earings:<br />
Look for an Ivanya's hoop or do the quest.<br />
Get a Black Saphire Earing for the other slot.<br />
<br />
Rings:<br />
Try to get a Shadial Bandit ring.<br />
Also try for a Knoted turtle bone ring.<br />
<br />
Gloves:<br />
If you spend a LOT of time in Keal you may get thunder eched.. very nice. Nother option id CC Guantlets, pritty common out of VL 20 ac hp and mana (forget details).<br />
<br />
Other wise you have pritty good stuff. Your gona hate gitting rid of your crusty and will need to realy look at the lost sta/hp from that when you upgrade. Try to get/keep 2K hp but boost that ac over 900 asap, and shoot for 1K soon, your on the right track.<br />
<br />
For the stats of the earing/rings I mentioned click my sig/name.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: Blah ok fine I just read your post and looked ya want list: DUMP the 6 ac 65 hp rings!!!!!! See above. For your BP, helm, bracer and legs, PoG is slightly better and SK only... just keep PoG in mind and go as often as posible, make friends with a guild that kills Tunare.<br />
<br />
Cloak ya got a good one there &amp; you'll get just stay in Keal.<br />
<br />
Gloves see post above abought CC gauntlets/thunder eched, Dark runed is junk (sucks I know).<br />
<br />
Sholders: Dam nice, I personaly have never seen em drop tho =/  Farm pp or hit up the hole and shoot for IGS.<br />
<br />
Neck: PoA is long and drawn out. Go raid Naggy, get the 7 ac 13 int/wis neck item off the FG leading to him, it's nice also (I use it and have it on 2 sk's)... see my sig.<br />
<br />
Sheild: /em hugs his sheild NO you can't have....<br />
<br />
Rings: DUMP the rings!!!  I say that?<br />
<br />
<br />
TRUST me there is something to be said abought 2K+ hp 2K+ mana and 1K+ AC!!!!!   With those minor changes you'll get there soon.</div></div><hr />

If by some wild chance i do manage to get everything on my wish list i'll have more mana than hp ( won't that be wild for a non-caster ).<br />
And by the way where does that shadel ring drop anyway,  seen a lot of higher lvls with it.</div></div><hr />

That ring drops in FG on the moon, one every hr or so, I spent all day up there and every grp member got one and we let one rot =/  BUT that was 2 months ago VI may have nerfed it.<br />
<br />
Yar I run around 2200 Mana and 2400 hp... I lub my mana~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BrindalayShadowlace</div><div class="date">04-20-2002, 12:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe,  well it's nice to see i'm not alone in being an int whore  ;-)<br />
I just solo way too much to run out of mana in the middle of a kite :_)   But that wish list is just made up of stuff i kinda scrapped through of thing that i have actually heard of and what i might be able to reasonably ( or unreasonably ) get.<br />
I just wanna get to 200int so i can go up to some casters and go HAHA i'm smarter than you  ;-P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Byttorr Ebonknight</div><div class="date">04-20-2002, 03:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The sphinx eye amulet's really not that hard. All of the components for it dropped in one weekend-long PoA raid. Had three of the no-drop small sapphires (the no-drop components are considered the rarest PoA quest parts IIRC) drop, and I was the only SK there. Now I just need to get the sphinx eye opal off my friend who fell off with it (lol), and port up to actually do the quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Blackeagle Dwimmerlaik</div><div class="date">04-20-2002, 04:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">a couple comments...<br />
<br />
I'd say 6/65 ring over turtlebone... hps are more important than mana even if you solo a lot, imho...<br />
<br />
unfortunately, dark runed gauntlets really do suck.. compare them to the warrior equivalent.. then send a /feedback to VI about the bullshit sk/pally vs warrior velious armor.. don't get me started again :P<br />
<br />
instead go for blood runed gauntlets.. they're infinitely better than dorf quest.. and even a lot better than skyshrine or kael quest gaunts... still worse than warrior thurg gaunts, but at least it's not a joke in comparrison.  drops off of either kerdelb or bledrek in velk's castle, but I forget which.. if you can do kael arena you can probably handle velk's castle<br />
<br />
next, try to get a sword of pain to replace that noctivigant blade... drops fairly often in the pit in velk's, may take some leveling up to get groups down there, but they rot fairly often, people may let you loot it, especially if you have a group of guildies doing exp down there... you lose some int and dex, but you pick up some ac and 50 mana, and the effect is very useful<br />
<br />
after that, get a good 2 hander... as your 2 handers get bigger and bigger damage bonuses they blow 1 handers out of the water more and more... most decent 2 handers will match or outperform even the best 1 handers as far as damage output... this is especially important for you since you say you solo a lot</div></div><hr />

Getting int/mana items over hp/ac items is really dumb. <br />
<br />
A good balance of all of them makes a good shadowknight.  Calling someone dumb doesn't.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can solo just fine without 200int or a billion + mana items btw. And gear doesn't make a good shadowknight, how you play does.</div></div><hr />

200int would keep in line with my necro disguise with my shainai's nightie and frost covered tome  :_)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BrindalayShadowlace</div><div class="date">04-20-2002, 11:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I definitly agree with the regen part,  but with the current prices of any type of regen items i'd rather have too much mana so i don't run out  :_)</div></div><hr />

LOL sorry but got something last night I thought you would like to see Brindalay.<br />
<br />
12AC 15Int 6 all saves all/all Bracer.<br />
<br />
Check my sig, 2500 mana!!!!! You will not be smarter than me! ;) <br />
<br />
I bought it from some guy in EC, so no info where it comes from, I'll go look tho, thought you would be intrested.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CanizMortem</div><div class="date">05-03-2002, 02:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dracsoul you are my hero!  Man, what sort of resources do you have at your disposal?<br />
<br />
I tell you that a big mana pool is a great thing!  I got the luck of getting Kodiaks in Chardok the other night, and I've been using it to solo toe to toe against the zone-in mobs.<br />
<br />
I start out with Steelskin up, then after getting hit to over 300 damage I lifeleech. Then I just ride it out Spirit Tapping until they are dead.  With the right location, and a big enough mana pool, you can solo some pretty tough mobs.  And if they hit too hard, fear kite.  I'm using this to max out my defense for level 56.<br />
<br />
I really love the feeling of draining them down to nothing and ending the fight at over 75% health going tow to toe.  Ahhhhhh!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BrindalayShadowlace</div><div class="date">05-03-2002, 04:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought those bracer things dropped in umbral plains,  i'm not entirely sure until i go check but i think that's right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bunboy</div><div class="date">05-03-2002, 09:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry but even for soloing mana still shouldn't be your first priority.  Do you know how little mana you use when you solo?  When you get deadly temptation or the CoB proccing sword from yelinak you will NEVER run out of mana.  You can use dooming darkness and panic the dead and never run out of mana against undead.  For live stuff use BE Gaunts and invoke fear and you won't lose mana.  This is WITHOUT AA.  Even without those mana regen spells or sword I use almost NO mana.  The more ATK, Haste, AC, and Regen you have the less mana you have to use.  With a fungi, I'll tank the last few rounds of combat.  Hp's regen back next fear kite.  More ATK = faster kills = less mana used.  And truthfully are u really gonna solo ALL the time?  How do you expect to get that kael gear?  You can farm armor in kael with 1 group.  And guess what?  lotta times you are gonna be the FD Puller AND the best tank there.  Guess what you need for FD pulling?  HP's and AC.<br />
<br />
If you REALLY wanna be mana conservative go for BE boots.  6second cast time of fear.  Pull with darkness run back, do fear from max range, thats totally manaless fear kiting.  <br />
<br />
With FT items, Deathly Temptation, Yelinak Sword, or AA skills your mana regen will be off the hook, considering for soloing we use DoTS.  We're not about total mana pool.  Very subtle difference.  Aim for mana regen not for mana pool.  Go Solo in Burning woods at your level, use blood ember gauntlets and undead fear (which one depends on your level), it used to take me about 1/3 of a bubble of mana to kill a mob.  If it takes you 1/4 thats grea but guess what, you kill more mobs but you also med longer.  It takes me less time to kill 1 mob, i don't kill as many mobs, but then again, I don't have to med as long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BrindalayShadowlace</div><div class="date">05-03-2002, 09:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's all nice and dandy,  but right now i don't have any of those things,  a guild capable of those things,  or the plat to buy such things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xaphan</div><div class="date">05-04-2002, 12:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Silver Chains are off Jor.  We've had them drop off, I'd say, 1 in every 3.  They're uncommon but they do drop.<br />
<br />
As far as getting +INT, you can also get things like Electrum BS Earrings, which are ac2 35hp 25mana I believe.  Mana and INT, when mixed, make a good balance for your mana pool.<br />
<br />
I have 200+ INT no matter what I'm wielding, and it's not something I regret.  Being able to keep myself above 80% HP for most endgame fights takes the strain off my group's cleric.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kiztent</div><div class="date">05-06-2002, 02:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm pretty impressed you managed to solo the mob that dropped the corroded bracer at 51.<br />
<br />
I know I use a boat load of mana dooming/invoking fear when I solo, so I'm not anti-int, but AC is my king.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krazaak</div><div class="date">05-06-2002, 03:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Huge mana pools don't really do much to help your soloing efficiency, but they certainly determine how big a mob you can take down.<br />
<br />
I generally only fear-kite now when I'm taking down stuff in the 51-55 range and even then I only do it for part of the fights.  For sheer efficiency, you never want to be sitting with your HP or MANA bar full while the other refills.<br />
<br />
So long as you gear yourself towards your play style, you should do fine.</div></div><hr />
