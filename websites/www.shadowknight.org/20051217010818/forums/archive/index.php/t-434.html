<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paradox</div><div class="date">04-04-2002, 02:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just wanted to post about my first duel I had the other day.  I have few friends on EQ, and the ones I have are all 55+ and off doing guild stuff. So, usually, I am off adventuring and learning on my own.<br />
<br />
I was sitting in HighPass Keep the other day looking for a group.  At the time, I was a 27 DE SK and this 29 VahShir BeastLord asks if I want to duel.  I ask if he wants to use pets... &quot;of course&quot; he says.  I stand up, summon a skele and put a weapon on it.  Hit the 'pet guard me' macro and accepted his duel.<br />
<br />
He sicks his kitty cat on me and gets an initial hit in on me.  I fear his pet and my skele is on him like white on rice.  I kick off the HT, disease cloud, engulfing darkness, siphon strength and lifetap while I'm swinging and bashing the hell out of him.  His pet comes back and starts in on me doing minimal damage.  I take a glance at the life bars and notice I'm a bubble under full and he's got 2 going on 1.5 life left.  He was attacking my pet still!  LOL! My skele drops so he finially turns on me.  I ignore his pet and keep swinging, bashing and lifetapping.  He got down to one health and tried to kick off a heal on himself - HOW FUTILE!  *BASH* And his heal was interrupted.  I actually gained 0.5 bubbles of life back from him from lifetaps.  At the end, I was down 2.5 bubbles of life.  He died and comes back to get his stuff.<br />
<br />
&quot;Were you buffed?&quot; he asked.  &quot;Only with the spells my class has and my gear.  Nothing extra.&quot; I reply.  &quot;Damn, I'll think twice about dueling a SK again.  I thought I would be able to beat you, especially being two levels below me.  You owned my ass.  Good duel&quot; he said.  &quot;Thank YOU&quot; I reply.<br />
<br />
I love bragging rights, especially when afterwards, I noticed that almost everyone in HighPass Keep came up to watch the fight.  A friend watching says that someone set out a shout or ooc message saying a 27 SK was dueling a 29 beastlord and was barely taking any damage.<br />
<br />
I have no problems finding groups now in HighPass Keep.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smiiley</div><div class="date">04-04-2002, 03:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A long time ago... I had an Ogre SK called Crakbonz.<br />
<br />
I was sitting at Neriak, resting from a beatin I took from something (can't remember) and this little guy comes up. A naked drow.<br />
<br />
&quot;You got anything for me? Plz????&quot;<br />
<br />
I stand up and roleplay.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wut joo wants? Booger? Earwax? me gots lots of dat stuff....&quot;<br />
<br />
He stands there for a minute, typing.<br />
<br />
&quot;No dude mean do you have weapon or money or something for me. Plz? You have some armor.  Give me your spare.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhh... You wants da beggin? I see... hold on...&quot;<br />
<br />
I inspect him and drop the stoopid talk for a sec.<br />
<br />
A /who showed him as a lvl 1 cleric.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhhh I see the problem... you are brand new. See you are what's called a newbie. Your **supposed** to be broke bud. You have to work for goodies. Just go mem your spells and beat on some things and you'll get some money. Also, maybe try to roleplay if your're gonna ask for things next tine. People don't like beggars... especially out of character beggars. Have fun ;-)&quot;<br />
<br />
I sit down and /bleed  and /em farts again... once more in the throws of Ogre drolliness<br />
<br />
&quot;So can I have some S%#$ or what man?&quot;<br />
<br />
At this point I stand up and say<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure. Me gib joo gudies... But me is too high fer gibbin goodies. Dere is a ting in da game... it is special command called &quot;DONATE&quot;. If you wants me to gib you goodie, you haffs to use dis command.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok how?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Joo gotta target me... just clicks on me. Den type /d    /d fer donate.&quot;<br />
<br />
/snicker<br />
<br />
<br />
And he does.<br />
<br />
I hit him with a lvl 10 harmtouch and insta kill him. THe spam for the duel hit my screen before my damage message or before his body actually settled into it's death animation. <br />
<br />
What can I say? <br />
<br />
SK= evil<br />
<br />
<br />
boogers &gt; beggars</div></div><hr />

<br />
Got to love your first Kill~<br />
<br />
Next time save your HT for the end, but other wise good moves, and good job fearing the pet off. AND very nice job timing the Bashes, it's amazing how usfule they are on casters.<br />
<br />
I hate all them dam Kitty cat's, all I can think of is &quot;Kitty at my feet and I wana to KICK it~&quot;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paradox</div><div class="date">04-04-2002, 05:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks everyone!<br />
<br />
Good suggestion on the HT for later on.  I guess I was in the rush from the adrenaline in my first duel that I wanted to do as much damage as possible to him as soon as I could to startle him.<br />
<br />
hehehehe<br />
<br />
I love my SK - can't wait until I get more dangerous.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dedbrain</div><div class="date">04-05-2002, 12:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dueling is great, grats on the duel(s) fellow SKs.  I have a 52 ogre SK that recently had to duel some guildmates to show them .  <br />
First was a 49 Shaman..  Throw on the resist gear and hope they can't stick a slow to you.  I feared her pet right away because it was just annoying and Harm Touched just to scare her (took her down to about half health).  She tried to to do some major dot damage but I resisted, only one stuck.  I was down to 50% health and 40 mana but she was completely oom.  I went in for the kill but couldn't get a darkness to stick so I started to chase.  Well of course SoW was up for her so I try to cancel magic about 800 times.. never got to that dang SoW.  My pet was already dead and it was basically just me chasing her around.  Finally got that darkness to stick and it was pretty much instant death for her.   But beware, pretty rough duel.  Especially when you watch your hps drop by 1k in a min.  <br />
<br />
Second was a mage..fear the pet and darkness.  I didn't even bother to fear the mage, she was already running trying to get safe distance to cast a DD.<br />
<br />
About 8 swings with with my 2hander and she dropped like a fly.<br />
However, if a mage initiates the duel and sends their pet in.. the earth pet can cause problems. <br />
<br />
Dueled a 52 wiz once recently as well.  Resist gear, pet, darkness = I win.  They will try to snare or root you 300 times while you chase them.  Lost one bub of health and they were dead.  No need to cast fear, they are already scared when you resist the roots and snares and start heading towards them grinning.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taelnia</div><div class="date">04-05-2002, 01:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My first duel was against a monk 6 levels higher than me(I was 41, he was 47).  MY HT was not up, and he used mend during the fight.  We started combat and about 6 minutes later it was over with me the victor :)<br />
<br />
I had about 1.5 bubbles of life left and i did not use a pet or HT during the battle.<br />
<br />
A few guildmates were watching and betting on the monk... I rather surprised them ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nocifer Deathblade</div><div class="date">04-05-2002, 08:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Grats. :) SK against BST no match cuz without a pet, BST is gimped.  SK without pet, SK still strong and deadly. Just keep BST pet feared at all the time then BST will die horrible. Good thing that BST pet has low MR at all the time as it seems so fear is best weapon against BST. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Apocalisse</div><div class="date">04-05-2002, 10:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep good work! remember, pet could be feared easy, so if u fight a magician a necro or a beastlord first step is to fear the pet so u have open field to fast finish the duel =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fubartic</div><div class="date">04-05-2002, 12:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">in a duel against a pet class, ignore the pet and kill the caster. bash when they cast and kill them fast. the pet dies when the caster does.<br />
<br />
grats on your kill tho ^_^ PVP is fun cause shadow knights are so evil in it</div></div><hr />

<br />
