<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello,<br />
<br />
I have a question. I seems can't find info on search to find specific answer.<br />
<br />
I looked at lucy and little confused by it. I KNOW that our lifetap DD spells will be focused by 35%<br />
<br />
I have a question. Will it also affect Bond of Inruku cuz its caterogized as lifetap AND detriemental?<br />
<br />
What about Harm touch cuz embrace said that it affects instant spells too and HT is instant.. <br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Marruk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm not the best at using Lucy, but I believe it will not effect Bond of Inruku as the focus effect only works on Instant spells, and BoI is a DoT.  <br />
<br />
I'm guessing it will effect HT, but I am less confident in that statement than I am about Bond of Inruku.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Elkar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It won't affect HT as it's not a lifetap.  Do you mean Leech Touch?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xanathol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Increase Spell Damage by 35%<br />
2: 	Limit: Max Level(70)<br />
3: 	Limit: Instant spells only<br />
4: 	Limit: Spell Type(Detrimental only)<br />
5: 	Limit: Target(Lifetap allowed)<br />
<br />
No, doesn't affect Bonds. Dunno on LT - don't have the AA to test it, though lately I've had some healers AFK unannouced on me and is forcing me to rethink it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Marruk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It won't affect HT as it's not a lifetap.  Do you mean Leech Touch?<br />
It says  Limit: Target(Lifetap allowed) and not  Limit: Target(Lifetap only).<br />
Like I said, I'm not the best at using Lucy, but doesn't that mean it affects all DD, lifetaps and otherwise?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>VengerMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">it only affects Lifetaps (casted, not proc'd), and does not stack with Improved Damage 4.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Darkmourn D`Estrellas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It says  Limit: Target(Lifetap allowed) and not  Limit: Target(Lifetap only).<br />
Like I said, I'm not the best at using Lucy, but doesn't that mean it affects all DD, lifetaps and otherwise?<br />
<br />
That means it is lifetap only.  Fire only nukes say Limit: Target (Fire allowed), Cold says cold allowed, etc.  And likewise when it says &quot;hitpoints allowed&quot; that means only a spell that does damage.  It's kind of screwy, because Fury of Solusek actually says &quot;detrimental only&quot; when you would think it would say &quot;detrimental allowed&quot; but half the stuff in the game makes little sense anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Marruk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks for the clarification... Lucy confuses the hell out of my sometimes (read: frequently!).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I think they call it lucy because it has some 'splaining to do.</div></div><hr />

It does work on lifetap procs off weapons that have a proc that is the same spell we can cast ourself. Such as Spirit tap. it has to be a spell we can mem, and high enough level.<br />
<br />
<br />
     -Torahdane</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>VengerMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">aye Torahdane, but you cant aug the weapon with Spirit Tap.  does the effect work if the epic is simply in inventory as well?  or is there an aug out there with a castable lifetap as it's proc that i have never heard of?  unless i'm mistaken, the best lifetap augs out there have Vampire Kiss as their effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Nytmare Bloodrose</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Has to be equipped for the focus to take effect. The effect unfortunatly doesn't focus leech touch, which is kinda crappy considering Leechtouch is a lifetap, and effects all of our Lifetap nukes up to level 70. Been getting rather consistant 3k crit heals with Touch of Inkru and epic.</div></div><hr />
