<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>bastardlunatic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">its a pain in the ass when you have casting mobs on you.  So much easier to just FD again rather than stand and then reFD</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grumoor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I would imagine that it would suck even more to accidentally hit FD more than once while this &quot;autostand feature&quot; was enabled.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Belyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you hit a spell that wasnt refreshed yet, you did not stand.  Also if you didnt like it for what ever reason you could have turned it off in options.  Its usefulness went far beyond the circlet of shadows.  Besides you have always been able to stand from FD and get off circlet before kos mobs notice you.</div></div><hr />

Saddly, this is the best upgrade we have had in a long time learn to use it(if we get it back).<br />
<br />
how the fuck is this an upgrade?<br />
do you only have one finger or something? even if you only have one finger i'm sure you could press stand and any other spell in succession quick enough that its not going to make a differnce. mobs only agro once every 6 seconds, so this makes basically no difference whether you instantaneously cast the spell or you take half a second to cast it.<br />
i guess its the &quot;best upgrade&quot; we've gotten for those of us who are incapable of pressing 2 buttons in quick succession.<br />
<br />
<br />
having autostand from FD enabled always, when you get blinded by a mob that's beating on you and need to feign, you can't just spam FD... you'll keep standing up.<br />

alter your FD hotkey to have the first line as /stand. or are you too fucking lazy to do that too?<br />
<br />
<br />
as well as not having to time standing up and #1(yes I am lazy)<br />
<br />
press hide first, then you can stand and click your circlet of shadow whenever the hell you want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Grumoor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">why dont they make it a toggle option?<br />

So you couldn't toggle this on/off afterall?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Downside to this is when spamming your hotkey it is all too easy to stand up before your recast time on FD is up<br />
 <br />
press hide first, then you can stand and click your circlet of shadow whenever the hell you want. <br />
<br />
Cause hide is oh so fucking reliable  :P<br />
<br />
/agree Belyle it really is a shame.  Hopefully when they reimplement it it will be bound to the toggle for casting while sitting, so that it wont wreck the game for these poor dogmatic maladaptive individuals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">No autostand from FD please.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So check before standing up, takes about 3 seconds. Any SK by 60 should have long ago learn how to check while FD'd.<br />

<br />
It's same thing as insulting someone who likes soft chair while you like hard chair. Both serves same function.. Sit.. <br />
<br />
Best solution to meet any people's preference seems to be toggle so everyone will be happy. :)</div></div><hr />

Remove any see invis effects on you and try to target yourself. If you can hide failed, if you can't hide worked.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>doomslayd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I've never had this ability work, as far as checking hide by yourself.  Whether or not you have a see invis items makes no difference, as many times you will disappear to yourself (w/o see invis) or have the () around your name as if you were invis, but to anyone else looking at you, as well as the mobs, you are perfectly visible.  About the only class with reliable hide skill is rogue.  Other than that it's hit and miss as to whether or not you are really hiding or it just shows you are untill you stand back up and reaggro. Don't insult others when you obviously don't know how hide works either. <br />
<br />
CoS from FD was nice.  I agree however that it should not come back in it's previous form, allow it to toggle if you want to autostand from FD, that way the people who don't want it for reasons stated above aren't upset about it.<br />

<br />
I don't mind an autostand when casting feature, so long as I can turn the stupid thing off.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You need to type /targ yourname to check if you are actually hidden (Make sure you remove all see invis buffs/equipment or this won't work). You will always disappear when you click hide but if you use the /targ command, you will only be able to target yourself if hide failed, you will get no target if hide was successful.</div></div><hr />

Other that being blinded, which if you failed your FD would not matter anyway, why would you not want this. I have seen no down side and it is has been faster for me to use when I fail.<br />

Sithanator, so im gonna click of my see invis buffs, take off 3-4 peices of armor, hit hide, type /targ Fur , lose target if im targetable and rehide/lose target untill sucessfully hidden, stand, and finaly #1 to become invisible... oooh baby that is so much more effecient than hitting #1 while fd for the same effect...what was I thinking...Sithanator will you be my new mentor?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually no, you're going to stand and hit #1 for the exact damn same effect.  Hiding before standing is completely pointless if you have instant invis.  <br />
<br />
Also, you bitch about losing target in that hide scenario.  You do know about the previous target function right?</div></div><hr />

 Show me a sk who standing and #1 has never failed for, and I will show you a liar. Also your scrutinizing of my scrutinizing Sithanator's (bad)Hide arguement falls short, as it is still a whole lot more tedious.<br />
ok im out this is becoming pointless</div></div><hr />

i guess he never figured out how to use circlet of shadow before they implemented the autostand on cast.</div></div><hr />

Guess I'm a liar then.  In any situation where it should have worked for me (no see invis mobs, all aggro dumped etc) it has.  Every single one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Drynnious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">It's Easy. Click on the mob and hit con. If its indifferent, you're hidden, if it's not, then the hide failed. Taking off buffs and equipment is ridiculous.</div></div><hr />

Your FD at the time ... mobs will be indiff to you already. Pass that pipe I want some, must be good shit your on</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Chania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">I used the hide trick before there was a circlet. Its also useful on a CR when you're naked and don't have it with you, or you just plain don't have one, not every SK had the luck/cash to get one.<br />

As for Autocast on FD, the dangers outweigh the small convinience IMO.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Khat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Why even bother with a poll at all?<br />
Just make it a toggle and both sides are happy.<br />
It isn't rocket science, why would they even bother asking such a question when all they have to do is implement the obvious?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Sithanator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Hey jack ass, I didn't bring up the issue of hiding while FD'd. I just pointed out you how you can tell if it worked or not. But since you lack the brain power to understand this whole of why auto stand is bad. Your just looking at it from one lazy fucks point of view. Did you note how someone earlier pointed that npcs check on a tic. This is nice thing to know when trying to aggro be it running past see invis mobs, stand up and clicking your CoS. Once you understand this, it take very little efford to stand up and hit your CoS without getting aggro.<br />

<br />
I think I understand what some perceive as the problem with autostand, and I disagree with the significance of it.  DP has a cast time of 1.5 seconds, it has a recast of 4 seconds, together that is 5.5 seconds of spamming your FD key(ok a lil less depending on your hotkey), or spell gem before it is even *possible* to stand up via autostand. Even if you do stand up from overspamming your FD key, you stand up and FD.  When you are blind, you can hear when you FD, you can hear when you are stunned. Yes I might be lazy at times, but so are people who dont use all of their relevant senses to play the game. Turn off the Brittney Spears mp3 collection and pay some attention to the game. if my numbers are wrong cut me some slack im at work and its late.</div></div><hr />
