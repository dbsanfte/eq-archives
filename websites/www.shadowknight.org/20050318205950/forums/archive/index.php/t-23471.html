But I've heard theres a quest you can do in order to bypass Innoruuk's Curse and going straight to the epic 1.5.  Have searched all over for it but can't find anything on it.  Anybody care to fill me in? <br />

<br />
Actually, I don't know what I was thinking about in my other post. Daywalka had the right idea; use search or read a little, it'll go a lot farther than asking for things that anyone with a grade five reading comprehension level can find out. Fuck you and the ship you rode in on. With butter.</div></div><hr />

No need to get so pissed at this.  it happens all the time and it will happen again, tired of guys cussing on this forum and talking about masturbation (the fuck is that?), so i'm gonna diss the guys that dissed bludrain. You guys seriously have to stop bitching about making an accident posts, I see it everwhere. Shut the fuck up!  Just say it and they will realize their mistake and correct it sooner or later. I hate it how 99% of the people online pretend to be tough by cussing shit on the internet. oh, in an attempt to stop the masturbation comments guess what...YOU DO IT TOO!!!   :eek:  Now as I was saying, please...SHUT THE FUCK UP<br />

No, it fucking doesn't.  Fuck you.  It's not about being tough.  Rather, it's a non-exceptance of this bull-shit entitled attitude that people fucking get when they're anonymous.  &quot;Oh goody, people can't see who I am so they need to take care of me and answer whatever I ask without any effort from me.&quot;  <br />

Yes a slacker is a lazy person, no on misunderstood that but you.<br />

Any slacker knows that it's less work to use search than it is to deal with us.  Therefore if you were a slacker you would have used search.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">We're the pathetic ones because you asked for information that was right in front of your face and we said &quot;you fucking idiot it's right in front of your face.<br />

<br />
It's the same thing here.  The guy who can't fucking see the information is the pathetic one, not the ones who laugh at his lame ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>BludrainHalovex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Ok genius, tell me what forum says &quot;How to skip the first epic&quot; and I'll consider you as having half a brain.  Yes I fucking know it tells you how in the epic 1.5 quest.  But thats for another quest... fucking idiot.  Yes I say that again... your a fucking idiot.  Now do the world a favor and shut the fuck up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Would it have been so hard to just use the search button and enter the words &quot;skip epic&quot; to see what pops up?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Wyrdlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">See, your problem is that you aren't thinking in terms of goals and progress, the way quests are typically described here.<br />
<br />
Your goal isn't to &quot;skip epic 1&quot;, if it was, Congratulations! You've already managed to skip Epic 1 since it's come out, and you can continue to skip it for as long as you'd like!  You can skip Epic 1 for an eternity by doing absolutely nothing at all.  In fact, people who don't even play shadowknights, hell, people who don't even PLAY EVERQUEST are right now happily skipping getting Epic 1 without even thinking about it!<br />
<br />
No, what you really what to know is, &quot;How can I begin Epic 1.5&quot;.  I'd even go so far as to say that if you didn't have a clue where to find THAT information, you wouldn't have even thought you needed the first epic to begin with.  It doesn't take rocket science to figure out what you REALLY want is to do Epic 1.5, so what you really need to DO is look for something called, and stay with me here, this is where it gets tricky, &quot;Walkthrough&quot;.  If you had read that thread, you'd see they covered this several times.  Something else you could have done would have been to only merely skimmed down to the bottom of the first post and clicked on the linked that leads to a walkthrough where how to begin without epic 1.0 is labelled in bright yellow letters.<br />
<br />
In other words, and I mean this very kindly, it'd really help if you'd learn to fucking read, got your dick out of your hand, and used both of your little tiny brains to figure out what the hell it is you really want before you spout of your mouth.  Also, when people aren't nice to you, you could ask yourself, &quot;Are they mean because they are cock sucking bastards, or are they mean because they can't stand cock sucking bastards and I'm using my teeth when I should be carefully sucking cock?&quot;<br />
<br />
See, dumbass, (You don't mind if I call you dumbass, do you?) what you really need to learn to succeed in life is to quit while you are ahead.  When someone posted it was in the walkthrough, you should have reread the walkthrough thread, and if you couldn't come up with the information by then, perhaps you could have gone to a website like Allakhazams and actually looking for the god damn information.  If that doesn't float your boat, you should have realized that YOU are the dumb ass asking for help here, fucking act like it.  When the first reply to you said it's in the walkthrough, if you are too fucking stoned or stupid to find the information by reading that thread then you should have gotten your damn thumb out of your ass, bent low to the ground, and politely asked where in that thread it was.<br />
<br />
Remember this rule for the rest of your life, and remember it well. When you are lost and asking for directions, don't argue with the person giving them.  You are the one that's lost, not them.<br />
<br />
<br />
Finally, after that helpful advice, I'll tell you where you could have found the information.  Not that I have a great deal of confidence in your promise to shut the hell up.  The first post where I directly see the information you need in the walkthrough thread is more of a hint and occurs: http://www.shadowknight.org/forums/showpost.php?p=295286&amp;postcount=25<br />
After that, some people wanted more information which is understandable, so it was clarified: http://www.shadowknight.org/forums/showpost.php?p=295376&amp;postcount=33<br />
But look elsewhere really isn't that helpful, so someone drew you a fucking picture: http://www.shadowknight.org/forums/showpost.php?p=295830&amp;postcount=47<br />
Then, if that wasn't kind enough, there's a god damn checklist: http://www.shadowknight.org/forums/showpost.php?p=298691&amp;postcount=59<br />
<br />
But don't feel too alone, there is another dumb ass, just like you, who after going through those posts still managed to ask what you needed to do.  Maybe you just need some more positive reinforcement.  I DO believe you could have found this information if you look, because you may be a dumbass, but you still might not be a COMPLETE dumbass.  So good luck, and good searching!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>BludrainHalovex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Obviously you dont fucking get it, the quest... is done... and its over with.  I've looked at at least 4 different walkthoughs, none of which mentioned bypassing the first epic.  And guess what!  The quest is completed!  And maybe I'm out of your range of thinking that now &quot;skipping epic 1&quot; makes a fucking difference, hell I dunno, I'm not a psychologist.  I would have been EXTREMELY happy with the first 2 responses.  But then more and more had to try to satisfy their degenerating ego by talking shit because I only come to this forum when (a) I have a question, or the new reason now (b) that I want to feel smarter by talking to people who, instead of playing, talk shit for months on end about things that ended long ago, and add their homosexual thoughts hidden in insults.  Again, I'm no psychologist, so I'm not going to judge you thus far.  <br />
<br />
Now, and do try to keep up, try to pretend you have even a small attention span... I found the quest the night the first posts were made... and finished the quest the next day...  the words &quot;three posts down&quot; was all I needed.  I haven't played in over half a year and haven't used this website in around 2 years... And had I known the walkthroughs here included what I needed like the others I've read did not, I wouldn't of had to ask, and I would still be thinking every person who posted on this thread still had some sort of IQ rather than being a bunch of sexually frustrated losers who have nothing better to do than make themselves feel like people give a shit about their opinions because they can't get laid or get beat up by schoolyard bullies (hell I've heard a lot of excuses on these forums).  The fact is, nobody gives a shit about your opinions, some of us come here for one thing... facts.  And it occurs to me, that ONE FUCKING POST ON THIS ENTIRE THREAD... gave even remote facts.  And I thank you for that.  But the reality is thats all I wanna hear.  I don't wanna hear dick and ass every other sentence, I'm sorry.  I don't give a shit about ANYTHING else you have to say, frankly, its uneeded.  I do appreciate the facts given, and I thank those who did give me facts.  But I still stick to what I said... when this thread had any meaning.  Fuck you for the attitude. <br />
<br />
So... dumbass... (am I getting too nostalgic for you?)...before you decide to open your mouth, please remember, nobody gives a flying fuck what your opinions are, so do us all a favor and shut the fuck up and give the whole thing a rest.  Dont worry, maybe you can still get a shiny gold star for effort after a week of useless opinions and comments and accept that the goal of the original post was met, and I have no use for your pitiful comments any longer.  Go, play, get laid, look at porn, whatever.  Just shut the fuck up before you lower the intelligence of the rest of us =)  Its hard, but I know you can do it!<br />
<br />
<br />
**Dumbed down for you**<br />
Got what I needed here last week, done with you, talk about dicks and asses somewhere else or we all get as fucking stupid as you.  (ah damn that still looks like a lot of words...)</div></div><hr />

And Blud, you still missed the point of my whole post, including, apparently, where I linked the information directly for you. [I] The answer isn't always in the walkthrough, read the whole thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>BludrainHalovex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">I did read the walkthrough part, and I do appreciate that you posted that.  But the fact that people are still pissing and moaning about something that should have ended a week ago does in fact irritate the hell out of me.  Its starting to get sad.<br />

This will in fact be my last post, seeing as how now this bullshit is cutting into too much of my own time and I refuse to belittle my own intelligence by continuing this.  Good luck to you all to whatever bullshit ventures you decide to go on.  Personally I have better things to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Shurlock</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">Actually this thread WOULD have ended a week ago if you hadn't kept responding to people ripping you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Wyrdlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">The thing you have to remember Blud is that this board is like a junior high boy with a baby brother.  It isn't funny until he starts to squeal, but once he does, the louder he yells, the funnier it gets.</div></div><hr />
