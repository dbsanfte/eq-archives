<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>smoses799</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">anyone have any suggestions on how to solo her?  I figured that i would kite her but found out that she is unsnareable... so i got her to 65% before i ate it...  So, anyone have any suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Varrius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I did her with like one group, was way overkill.  Why not just get a couple of friends to help?<br />
<br />
Anyhow, if you insist on soloing her, well ...I'm not sure you will be able to.  I thought I remembered her summoning.. if not, I suppose it's possible even if you can't snare her.  <br />
<br />
I doubt there are any SK's, certainly not many if there are, that can go toe to toe with her with no support.  So, your only option is to try and kite if you insist on soloing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Leflion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I would agree.  Just get a few friends together and fight her toe to toe.  If you want to try and solo, I would probalby suggest having run 5 or SoE, then load up all your dots, Bond of Death included and just kite her up and down that area by the hedge til either she dies or you die.  It will be a long fight so make sure you have as much mana regen as possible.  Save your HT and your Leech disc for when you run out of mana.</div></div><hr />
