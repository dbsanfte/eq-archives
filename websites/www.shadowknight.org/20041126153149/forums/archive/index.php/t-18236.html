<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sabrosia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I'm totally confused as to what I'm supposed to do.  I have 'a spiritual key' (none/none - diety: cazic thule)<br />
<br />
I understand I'm supposed to loot a jail key which is dropped off some treasure chest?  Where are these located in the hole?<br />
<br />
I'm up to the point where I have to kill the Pally / Cleric combo...<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help (and any other insights for other stuff I'm going to be facing down the road, would be great appreciated...)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Krushum Gudended</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">3 mimics (think they were renamed 'a chest') spawn beyond a fake wall in the bank in the old city.<br />
<br />
You want 'a cell key.'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sabrosia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks!   <br />
<br />
The fake wall is near where Kindle and all the 'epic' mobs were moved now correct?  (right near the hallway leading to Jaleil?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sabrosia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Actually more question about the hole:  How rare of a spawn is Ghost of Glohnor?  I'd hate to take a raid force down to him only to find out he's not up....  Specially since they made the mobs in that are so rough....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Krushum Gudended</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">the fake wall is still in the bank basement afaik, which is in the city, but closer to the docks than the tunnel<br />
<br />
no clue on the 2nd question, undead tower is a bad bad place with just a botted shammy and a monk with a botted cleric</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aoninie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Glohnor has been up everytime I've been in The Hole. And don't forget, you can't get him till you do the turn-in in Kerra. What I did was make sure I had a porter and a Mage in my group. After the Caradon thing I evaced to zone entrance, ran out and did the turn-in on Kerra. Got the Shroud then went back to the Hole (I had my own Key). Once in the Hole the Mage CoHed me back to the group. During the time I was doing this out Shaman was leading the raid to kill Kindle. Once Kindle was down I led the raid to Glohnor and we kicked his boney ass. Two deaths with 3 group raid (one was mine). Make sure you clear the front courtyard and the one where Glohnor spawns. He was on the left side for me but from what I gather he can spawn on either. He was laying in a coffin and before we bothered clearing the mage reconned with eye of zomm to locate him. Kill fast and furious as the respawns are fast in the courtyards. Go melee heavy as everything in this area is pretty resistant. On the ramp leading to the final tower casters will tent to want to stay on the top. Get them to the center as they will get wanderers and respawns up top. A good puller is a must or you will get alot of adds.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Drakang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think he is always up now.  Although wait 72 hours after patch to make sure.   If caradon is up Glohnor should be.  <br />
<br />
Remember don't fight both Caradon and Kryena. You can but why bother.  Give the key to Caradon and then run back up the stairs  and FD.  Have forces at the bottom of the drop off.  Caradon will path back to the jail.  Kryena will stay at your body.  When Caradon is gone have somebody pull Kryena and kill.  You can stand up and hope Caradon forgot or /q out and come back.  Loot Kryenna trans out get shroud and run back to group or get CoTH.<br />
<br />
The only problem with Kryena is she is fairly magic resistant so mostly a melee fight and she runs at the end (walks slow really) but couldn't snare her.  Same for Glohnor the mummy.  If Glohnor gets back out to where you left mobs up or they have repopped it will get nasty.  Otherwise easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Aoninie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">We got tired of waiting for Caradon to walk off after FD so we just wacked em both. One thing I forgot. Once you turn the shroud in the mummy will come running for you. No need to track or look for it. I did the turn in on the right side, moved to the center coutyard and he was already comin for me from the left side.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Azaryl LVeldrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You can always make a halfling rogue (choose Brell as a deity) and get him down to the hole...sneak/hide your way down to the crypt area where Glohnor spawns and check on him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kyrkii Sa'Kyttn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Not since the revamp Azaryl, now only a SoS rogue can navigate safely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sabrosia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Got the key last night (finally)   :)   - Went back up to the front, and no Cardon  :(  - He still spawns in the same spot, right?<br />
<br />
I also see immune to magic - is this truly immune - even lures won't work?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Aoninie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I couldn't land any spells but not sure if anyone else did. He still spawns in the same room that it says on the eq atlas map. The cell has no door and there was an elemental in it with him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sabrosia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Argh - I haven't seen him in a week now...<br />
<br />
*sigh* - You don't have to talk to Lhranc in CoM first do you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>TamikaFV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Just FYI I've killed Caradon, Kyrenna and Glohnor recently on Firiona Vie.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Drakang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Don't have to do any other parts first.  3 days after a server up before he is usually up and 3 or 5 days if killed.  That is why I encourage not killing him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Talastius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Well Sabrosia,<br />
<br />
I was just down there and he is up as of two hours ago. If I had seen this earlier I would have tried to get in touch with you. Had half of Prime down there getting my key and tome and I am sure some of us would have been able to help you with Caradon. Heck some of them wanted to do it for me then, but I still haven't completed the Corrupted Ghoulbane and didn't want to risk screwing up faction or having to get another key.<br />
<br />
Anyway, when the time comes let me know and some of Prime and I may be able to help as long as there are no lighties involved. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Aoninie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">You get no faction hit for killing Caradon. I did it and am still working on the damn Hide, curse you SOI!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kyrkii Sa'Kyttn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Did Caradon/Kyrenna last night, very easy fight.  65 war/cle/enc/rng and me 58 sk.  Don't see why people kill Caradon when he's such an elementary split, and really doesn't take long at all to return to his cell.  We did the fight on the stairs right before you enter the jail.  Caradon took maybe 45s to decide to leave.<br />
<br />
PLEASE for the love of all that's evil, don't kill him!  So many times I've tried to get something together to do that part only to find that some moron ganked him just hours earlier.<br />
<br />
See that spell, called Feign Death/Comatose/Death Peace?  Please use it, be patient, and help out your fellow sk's!<br />
<br />
Btw for anyone wondering, your cell key poofs on turn in so be sure you can kill Kyrenna on your first try.  Guides say she spawns in &quot;the jail&quot; and rushes you, but now at least, she spawns right next to Caradon in his cell and they both whack you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Buurp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">edit: had asked if Caradon spawns in same spot, but search is my friend and i found further posts saying yes, still in Jail area.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>BetrayerofHope</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Just killed them both about 2 days ago on Bertoxx. <br />
 We were in the Hole doing a guild chantys mob, when I convinced guild to go ahead and waste those 2.<br />
 Our force consisted of major over-kill, I tanked Kyrenna, a second SK who was tagging along held Caradon in place, he was 65, I'm 66, we had no problems what so ever.<br />
 No casters in guild informed me they were being resisted, Kyrenna went down like a prom date, and Caradon as well.<br />
 I am by no means uber in any sense, a few GoD drops, and mostly crappy ornate, and a piece or 2 from OoW. I do not believe either mob is totally magic resistant, but I've been wrong before.<br />
