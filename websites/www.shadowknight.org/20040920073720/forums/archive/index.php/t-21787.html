 Hello shadow knights,<br />
<br />
The Community team is looking to set up a correspondent for each class.  We would like to give you the opportunity to let us know if you think this is something you would be interested in doing.  The class correspondents would be responsible for helping the Community team collect information about the class to pass along to the development team.  This could range from bugs found, class balance issues, or general questions about the class.<br />
<br />
If this sounds like something you would enjoy doing and you have a good feel for how your class works please send me a PM with your character’s name, the server you play on, the level of your main character, the name of your guild and its web page address (if applicable), the names of any other EQ fan sites you regularly post on and the handle you use on those EQ fan sites.  Please also give a brief description on why you would like to be your class’s correspondent.<br />
<br />
Thanks!!<br />

Here's what you can do. Go send a PM to Kytherea telling her that you don't want some random tard given the job, but insist that it be a community leader, Brael or Slein Jinn, from Shadowknight.org. If she gets a few hundred PMs to that effect, hopefully she will listen.<br />

There is also the issue where he vanished for a long time and allowed the forums he was &quot;moderating&quot; to not be so. /Pass</div></div><hr />

We'll have a druid representative then....anyway they should know that the SK representative will fear-kite the developers until they get what they want.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Mallce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Brael is awesome when it comes to knowing end game, gear, ect. As knowlegeable as he is, he has admitted that SJ has made him change his mind on some of our issues.<br />
<br />
I think SJ tries to see the game through the eyes of all players (causal, hardcore, raiders, non-raiders, ect.). My vote would be for SJ.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Noctix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Not that anyone asked for my vote but assuming he's willing to do it, I'd nominate SJ.  I feel he has the best grasp of what is needed by all SKs, whether they be casual or hardcore, raider or non-raider, old school or newbie.<br />
<br />
Brael would be my second choice, second only because his posts don't display the same understanding of the current state of SKs at the lower end of spectrum as SJ.<br />
<br />
I don't feel that anyone other than SJ or Brael has shown the right combination of knowledge and time/dedication that would be required to get our needs voiced to SOE.<br />
<br />
I will PM my opinions as well.</div></div><hr />

If, pending acceptance, someone from SOE will make my account on their boards work right, I can do it.  <br />

And yes, Struzor, I was asleep - I'm nocturnal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">The thread was posted up there a few days ago, I sent them a PM saying I would do it if no one else whos decent volunteered but I'm kinda skeptical of it bringing about any change.<br />
<br />
What they need to do is take the top few choices and let the community vote on them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Chania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Whoever it finally is, the key is not to give their own opinion, but to reflect what the majority of SK's want.

IMO of course.</div></div><hr />

<br />
either case , PM sent to support either one of these two without any concerns that they would do what they could for the betterment of the class , would listen to others views and perhaps as importantly not go off on some idea that would over balance us</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Kahntun Derstand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">Brael, Siilvir, and SJ would be a fantastic representative.<br />

<br />
  To be honest, this is a two part game and brael/SJ may be the best overall candidates, but I would like to see both a high end raid SK and a more casual SK that is perhaps newer to the game....this would give a better overall representation of the class at various levels of play.<br />

<br />
We understand it, we would just like to divert the innevitable choice of unknown_sk_423 by SOE without a clue on what we need, so we are voting here to make a push for a knowledgable representative before they recruit soem jackass that doesnt know anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Askeer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">SK class rep should obviously be me !<br />
<br />
:p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">I'd mostly like to see a class rep that has a good handle on the SK role and issues with regard to the newest and most challenging content. Although there are concerns that SKs will have at all levels, I think that it is most important to have someone who is experiencing first hand the encounters where our raid and group roles and viability are most likely to suffer breakdowns.<br />
<br />
I know that alot of casual players don't feel that their concerns would be voiced by a higher end representative, but casual play balance is not essentially a class specific issue. SKs who have played through most of the availible content are in the best position to judge the longterm concerns of the class as a whole. I don't think that the larger picture of our class and its concerns or limitations can truly be evaluated even at my stage of the game. It is always the newest and least tested content that usually causes havoc for our class.<br />
<br />
Brael has experienced a larger percentage of the game content and is most likely to be in a position to see problems as they arise-- he layed out the problems with the SK role in the Ikkinz trials very early on, and he'll be in a position to evaluate future problems before many of us face them. In addition, I think he keeps his composure better than most people here, and has a good sense of what changes are both necessary and realistic. It is important for us to have a representative that can make observations and raise concerns while the devs are still willing to tune new content, otherwise it is too little too late.</div></div><hr />

In fact, I am more in demand then any warrior and most plaladins it would seem (from a pre-EP XP standpoint).  The only problem I can see is the innate HP bonus that warriors get (though allowing BSS to stack with our cloak line was a move in the right direction &lt;though not a fix&gt;).  Of course as I work my way into the EP's I am noticing the disadvantage for not having any form of defensive disc., but the difference is minor at this point.<br />

  The point of this ramble - Brael is in the best position to fix our current problems...the effects of which should trickle down and bolster us more casual/newer SK's, regardless if we truly need it at my level or not.<br />

Heh, thanks for not dragging me into an argument about this.<br />
<br />
I think you're getting a point that alot of early PoP progression players don't want to hear-- namely, you're doing so much better at your level than we ever were.<br />
<br />
There really wasnt alot of good gear around and availible to L 50 to 60 SKs...Kael arena armor was badass (imagine that for a minute), and you never saw Ornate for sale in the bazaar. A WMBS or a Windblade could run you 50k or so...<br />
<br />
I understand that LDoN mobs were tuned at all levels to match the gear that the players can acquire now, and I'm glad to see how much better the game experience of more casual players has become over the last year. But I really hope that the more casual and early progression players here can trust in the fact that higher end SKs here went through the same content that you are working on now-- and we were probably huge gimps when we did.</div></div><hr />

I don't think this is relavent to choosing a class correspondant.  Even if you think casual/low end SKs don't need any help right now, that doesn't mean they never will.  Choosing a representative who only pays attention to current problems with the high end raiding game would be extremely short-sighted.</div></div><hr />

Some high enders only see thier own issues and think lower levels are whining because even if they are not a terribly useful  group member at that level, they still have it better than the high enders did when they were back at those levels.</div></div><hr />

Most high end people compare curent midlevel SKs to themselves at prior content then midlevel SK's to other current midlevel classes. Thats a huge flaw. Brael is guilty of that himself. Still doesn't mean he isn't one of the better choices for a rep.</div></div><hr />

Bear in mind that, even aside from the discussions on this board, most of the names being mentioned talk to other SK's/eachother regularly.  <br />
<br />
I personally have 5 or 6 other SK's on my AIM buddy list and keep in touch with a couple more via e-mail.  I would be very surprised if the same could not be said for the other names being thrown around.  <br />
<br />
Important decisions will almost invariably be discussed in similar fasion to how I generally discuss important posts (unless we end up with a nobody rep or someone with a personal agenda, but I really don't see that happening) and likely put before the community in many cases.  Having someone who is articulate &amp; devoted to the wellbeing of the game as a whole is arguably at least as important as someone with a good grasp of the issues.  <br />
<br />
As for my part, it may or may not be relivant - if it's decided that the consensus wants me to do the job, I will to the best of my abilities provided I am able, but it's that last bit I'm having trouble with ATM... still can't seem to log in on the SOE boards.  It'll log me in, but leave me not logged in.  Deleting cookies/cashe doesn't help.  Making a new account didn't help either.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My only fear is that we would get one of the vocal SK's that is more concerned with there not being too many SK's, and as a result push suggestions that will only help a couple of SK's, versus the whole class. I know we've all seen posts at times from SK's complaining about how many SK's there are, or talking about how it's nice to only have a couple of SK's in a guild.<br />
<br />
I'm also scared by the SK's that go off on a tangent on what they think is best for the class, and then cannot defend that position to the community. Or worse, don't even try to defend it. Those are the ones that really scare me. <br />

I personally think SJ is too confrontational sometimes and that won't go over well with SoE, or with people trying to communicate ideas to him. On the other hand Brael usually concerns himself mostly with just the high end game and shows little thought for the non-raiders, lower level SK.<br />
<br />
So both would need to adjust a bit. I doubt SOE will pick either though, I think the key is to have someone who can communicate well, and be able to really understand the SK community...not necessary understand all the SK issues...but being able to understand the community, then take the issues and pass them on to SOE.</div></div><hr />

Its probably better to have first hand experience when confronting the endgame issues, since quite a bit of lower end content can easily be sumed up and related to said representative as there is a much larger player base in that area, and could be fixed as a side effect of engame issues (aka mitigation, disciplines ad infinitum).</div></div><hr />

There are two different types of players, Casual/non raider and Hardcore/raider<br />

Both see different aspects and flaws of the game, both have different gripes, I Feel SoE should bring two types of people from all classes, just to get a feel.

But hey, what do I know, I haven't reached end game with my SK, for all I know the issues are all exactly the same, just different levels.<br />

I think there advantages either way, whether you have one rep from each class or 2-3.  None of them have anything to do with the level of play of the reps, however.  <br />
<br />
The advantages?  Potentially productive intraclass discussions and the reps can &quot;check&quot; eachother to be sure the community is well represented.  <br />
<br />
Disadvantges?  Potential to present a non-unified front, potential for a decrease in the &quot;signal:noise ratio&quot; or whatever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u114"><b>Chayde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p114">Yep yep, it isn't really an uber vs casual thing, but many people say there are problems at both levels. Granted I don't see any problems at my level, I do what I do, and I am okay at doing it.<br />
<br />
I think anyone who raids, also spends time exp grinding, so they too know about any issues that the un-uber raiders go through.<br />
<br />
A rep should go in there going &quot;We want blue shoes&quot; not &quot;I think some of us rather have blue sneakers&quot; <br />
<br />
If there are two, both of them could say &quot;We want, and NEED blue boots&quot; and it might get us somewhere. <br />
(until they argue that they should be hightops rather than pennyloafers)<br />
then we get no where again.<br />

Maybe who ever they pick, can get ICQ, AIM, or any other instant messanger, and while they are talking to the devs, they can IM some of the other SKs and get a general opinion...

I'd say that's a given - I have 6 SK's on my buddy list and I'd be quite surprised if others weren't much the same.  I expect much (but hopefully not all) of it won't be real time chat either - there'll likely be time to consult the boards on particularly important matters.
