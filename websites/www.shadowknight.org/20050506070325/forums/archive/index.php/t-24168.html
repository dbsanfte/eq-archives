<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>vilesoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">For watercooling, try to avoid the fancy-ass kits you see from thermaltake, cooler bastard, and the like.  Koolance is iffy, some stand by them, but I see them for the most part as iffy on the quality dept.<br />
<br />
Here are a few good companies for parts<br />
<br />
www.swiftnets.com -- Swiftech, my personal fave...pricey, but damn good<br />
<br />
www.dangerden.com -- Danger Den, very nice stuff for overclockers<br />
<br />
www.dtekcustoms.com -- DTek, best low buck radiator IMO, and decent stuff all around.<br />
<br />
www.snt-systems.com -- US seller of Aqua-Computer, the rolls-royce of quiet watercooling....and pricey as a rolls too, but who can beat watercooled power supplies? :D<br />
<br />
for accessories, parts, etc. (retailers)<br />
<br />
www.sidewindercomputers.com<br />
<br />
www.highspeedpc.com -- These guys have some nice vibration dampers for the Eheim brand water pumps, it really quiets them down, especially the Eheim 1250.<br />
<br />
As far as how to do it, it's all plumbing...just with flexible tubes. Key here is to have enough flowrate to support the cooling you desire.  There is lots of math involved here, bug me if you have to on this.<br />
<br />
Questions are, how many components you want to cool, and is this for overclocking or quiet.  Also what case is it going into, and are you willing to modify the case in any way (including cutting large holes, etc)?  This will all help in component reccomendations.<br />
<br />
BTW motherboard will have a huge impact on what CPU block to use....if it doesnt have the four mounting holes and is just a lugged socket, you have very few choices.  Fortunately an athlon 64 as far as I know all the boards have this mount, or have a way to convert the clipping mechanism to a 4-hole mount.</div></div><hr />

Damn now it's cheap enough to put in my next rig, since I found out SLI is nowherrre near as nice as it was hyped out to be.  NVidia dropped the fucking ball this time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here is my setup, using swiftech blocks, a D-tek radiator with dual shrouds and fans, a bay-res (dont get the acrylic ones, they suck), and an eheim 1250 pump with relay.<br />
<br />
The Eheim pump is nice but fucking huge.  I would go with a swiftech pump if I had to do it over again.<br />
<br />
It was made to endure hot rooms and run quiet while at it.<br />
<br />
The fan/rad assy is held to the front of the case with some huge-ass philiips head screws..the threads cut into the aluminum frame of the fans, making for a very secure connection.<br />
<br />
I'm a huge fan of the evercool aluminum frame fans for that reason, their frames are rigid and strong enough to be used as structural elements if needed.  Plus they aren't very costly either, at about $12 a fan.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kruggan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Forgive the question, but what on earth are you guys doing that requires that type of cooling?  Is it overclocking alone or is it something else?  I've never overclocked, and my playing experience is just fine.  I've never had overheating issues for any other reason.  Just wondering if I'm missing something.  Even in the summer with air conditioning set at 70 degrees, I've never had an overheating issue. <br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

And if he lives in a hot area. the room temp might jump up to about 80-90 degrees in the day time.  Add about +50 degrees on top of that for your OEM heatsink and fan. So he would be hitting in the 150 degree range fairly easy, which is too hot to be safe.</div></div><hr />

What kind of Vid Card ya got? AGP or PCI Express x16. And do you have ECC or non-ecc ram?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>kharan_zechts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Its a agp vid card. I never overclock my cpu. I dont know why it gets so hot in here, I have an air conditioner right next to the comp but its one of those big ones you put in the window and I cant have it on all the time due to the rising electric bill.<br />
<br />
Maybe its because I live in an old house.. I dont know but the beginning of every summer if I play games like eq for a long time shit starts to overheat.<br />
<br />
Not sure on the ram, that'll depend on what kind of MB I get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>KlaoofQuell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I recommend this mobo for ya. and a fan aimed right at your case. <br />
<br />
ASUS Mobo (http://www.newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=13-131-464&amp;depa=0) <br />
<br />
Water cooling is a pain, and alot of mobos don't like it when you don't have a fan. The air cooler I showed you will cool just about anything, is a hell of alot easier to install, and does not run the risk of turning your computer into a recreation of a hairdryer falling into a bathtub. Unless you are outdoors in the Arizona sun, this thing will cool perfectly. Also, put up reflective or tinting material over your windows. Will lower your electric bill by not letting infrared and ultraviolet radiation in. Who wants to play in a sun-lit room? Notice how pale everyone that plays EQ is? There is a reason for it.<br />
<br />
Also, know what it is like in a hot room with no ac. Last summer, ac broke and I had to aim a cheapy walmart fan at my open case to keep it from overheating.<br />
<br />
Also recommend getting a Harddrive fan, and a PCI slot fan to cool your vidcard.</div></div><hr />

ditto, my old bedroom got up to 115 regularly in summer....yay for uninsulated plaster walled houses in california in which the walls get sunlight sun-up to sundown.<br />
<br />
Plus I'm a noise freak....I like my rooms quiet enough that I can enjoy my music without the drone of fans in the room.<br />

Watercooling achieved both.</div></div><hr />

well if you need an ac unit on it, something is VERY wrong.  as much specs on the case and hardware will help with finding the best cooling for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jovec</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">AMDs tend to run a lot cooler than Intel CPUs as they require much less power under load.  If your only experience is with Intel CPUs, you probably don't need to go with watercooling for AMD, especially at stock clocks.  It sounds like you also want to have your case unobstructed (nothing on the sides, don't sit it on carpet) and make sure you have ample intake and exhaust (i.e. airflow) through the case.  Keep any dust screens clean too (dust, pet hair, etc can restrict airflow).  Go with rounded IDE (or SATA) cables and keep them from bunching up around the main air circulation path inside the case.  As for noise,  low noise/zero noise fans seem to be rage these days.<br />
<br />
As for KlaoofQuell's comment on the P4EE &quot;smokin&quot; on two instances, current HT tech doesn't help as much as you'd like (if that is what he had in mind) since HT P4 CPUs share a single set of execution units.  Next gen stuff should move to complete dual cores on a single die.<br />
<br />
AMDs top end isn't cheap, but generally, especially as you step down a little, the price vs. performance ratio goes strongly in favor of AMD for gaming (current benchmarks show AMD with a healthy lead regardless of price).  Of course, the need to upgrade mobo and ram factor into pricing.   Personally, I'm stuck with the p4 route, but I will likely move to AMD when my next upgrade requires all three pieces to be replaced.<br />
<br />
And vilesoul, what game disappointed you with Nvidia SLI?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>KlaoofQuell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">AMD's do run *slightly cooler* now (1 or 2 Degrees C), knew that. My big thing with AMD is Mobos. The companies that make them take too many short cuts and they don't have the nice features that Intel supporting mobos have. Also, AMD mobos tend to all be micro atx, and I like to have 5 pci slots instead of 3. Also seems impossible to find a 4 dimm slot AMD mobo that is not outrageously expensive. <br />
<br />
I am fixing my comp as I have the cash, and already bought the 2.4 800 fsb P4 Socket 478 and ASRock Via chipset. Cheap, but I am on a shoestring budget. All I need now is Ram and Case. Going with the Asiapro 450w silver case, and Rosewill 512 meg DDR400. Latency on it according to newegg is 3, but it is actually 2.5. Think it is pretty decent for a 59 dollar stick of RAM. Might at some point by the Mushkin Hi-performance dual pack 1 gig that they have for 120ish, with a latency of 2, and heatspreaders.<br />
<br />
Quick question about dual channel mode... would I have to take the rosewill ram out completely for dual channel mode to work, or just stick in in an unshared slot?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>vilesoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The problem with SLI is the driver has to be coded for that game's engine for it to work, so you will see NO gain in EQ2, EQ, WoW, VtM:bloodlines, and a whole slew of games.

Basically NVidia has their head too far up their asses to utilize the technology they got from the 3DFX acquisition, or just bought them as an anti-competitive move.  Either way that move pretty much killed my intent to buy their gurrent gen products, I'll just stick with ATI this time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
unless your board supports asymmetrical ram setups in dual-channel, you might have to have that stick of 512 sit around, or just save it to build a second rig in the future.  <br />
<br />
BTW heatspreaders on ram are pretty much just cosmetic flair, the packaging of the IC is the weakness on those chips when overclocking, as it's too insulative to promote heat transfer fast enough for a sink to be of any benefit.<br />
<br />
<br />
Check out the DFI Lan-Party NFII-ultra 400 motherboard if you want to see a nice AMD board, it's full ATX, has loads of PCI slots, dual 10/100 network cards, four USB ports on the back panel alone, and 4 more on teh board, firewire, dual-channel DDR, PATA-raid (including a weird &quot;1.5&quot; mode), and a single SATA port.  Basically the board kicks much ass.  It's not a 4 dimm slot board though.</div></div><hr />

AFR = alternare frame rendering<br />
SFR = Split frame rendering<br />
<br />
Games that have effects that rely on having the previous frame on-screen (or more correctly, in video memory) and overlaying it cannot use AFR.  Try each to check for any graphical errors and to see which gives better performance.  If you are CPU bound SLI can actually slow down the framerate, so push the resolutions up for maximum gains. You probably won't see any improvement in EQ1 since even at 16x12 it's probably CPU limited.  If you knew the previous, then oh well, but just thought I'd point it out in case you didn't.<br />

Bah, the only place the intel is gonna have a chance of catching the amd is if he's running two instances of application software like word or photoshop.  The AMD's have consistently outran the intels in gaming for the last year and a half.<br />
<br />
Most importantly, the intels have been suffering from heat problems since they went to that long ass pipe structure.  Used to be, the AMDs ran significantly hotter, but not anymore.  Just a few months ago Intel ditched an entire line of mobility chips because they couldn't cure the heat problems.<br />
<br />
Get the 64 3700+ instead, its cheaper than the 64fx and the intel suggested.<br />
http://www.newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=19-103-464&amp;depa=1<br />
and it will run just a hair slower than the 64FX.  Everyone has been way impressed with this cpu.  Of course the big question, when will they come out with the FX version, hehe.</div></div><hr />

After a while you can get some good results.  It's just a matter of learning what to look for in hardware when buying it, then when the time comes that its not as fast as it was, OC the fuck out of it.  It takes time, and heat ouput and power consumotion increases are linear with your OC, so at the least it's predictable.  Overclock a 2ghz chip to 2.4ghz and it will put out the same heat and have the same power consumtion as a 2.4ghz chip.  Performance will most likely be the same as well, this has to do with chipmakers using the exat same core, if the architeccture is the same, pretty much the chip is the same, just some bridges at various points were either closed or opened to tell the chip to run at one specific speed.  Now going beyond what the fastest of that chip can do, that can get interesting :)</div></div><hr />
