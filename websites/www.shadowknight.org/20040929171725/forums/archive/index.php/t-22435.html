<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Stryph</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sounds more like a bard Fade upgrade</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Can't say for sure at this point (and note that the list we currently see is certainly not complete anyway) but I would tend to think it's at least the beginnings of an SK ability.  <br />
<br />
The name certainly doesn't point to it being a bard ability, and an upgrade to FD is something we've been bitching about for some time now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I can't see it as an upgrade to Fading Memories, simply for the fact that with Fading Memories you can fade and keep running your ass away; would it really be an upgrade if you had to fall to the ground and be stationary for it to work? This is monk/shadowknight, for sure. Then again, knowing SOE, it'll be monk/necromancer, and we'll get it once enough expansions come out that we're level 90.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not true. :)  Did you know that SK got death peace FIRST and necro didn't even get it at 60. Necros whined for it for long time and we whined for harmshield so we gave those spells to each other.. Now we each have HS and DP.. Based on that history/pattern in that special case, SK should get it first before necro. :D But frankly, we both should get it equally anyway to avoid very same whinefest by necros. History would repeat itself..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Leafweir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ah, but if we got it first, then we could trade it for Necro res at a later date. I sorta like the idea of history repeating itself. =)</div></div><hr />

Leafweir got my vote</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Krushum Gudended</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">the way its set up is as an aa ability... death peace might still be our normal fd</div></div><hr />

I would sell Brael into slavery (wait he might enjoy that) in order to make sure this happens. As long as you don't need 16,435,621 aa's in order for it to work..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The fact that it is instant and has no mana cost unfortunately screams monk to me.  Either that, or it's monks screaming about us getting it.  Either way, screaming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Mnayar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Look at the raw data.<br />
<br />
Skill = Innate.<br />
<br />
It's a skill or an AA so will mean it goes to monks more than likely.  Cause no way in HELL would SoE give us a FD better than monks, nope they'd rather give us the reach around while fucking us up the ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Since when did they start giving reach-arounds?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Don't count your reach arround before their grabbed<br />
<br />
I'm guessing it will cost 20 aa and have a prereq of Impoves Innate Wis 2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kahntun Derstand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The fact that it has death in the name obviously points to a SK or Necro ability.

<br />
Yeah, because Monks don't have Feign Death or anything like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Parasite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Yeah, because Monks don't have Feign Death or anything like that.<br />
Yeah, and I guess thats why it could become an AA ability for both monks and SKs.. For monks so they have an insta aggro wipe to compete with bards, and for SKs so they have a fast cast FD, not the stand_still_for_1_second_then_cast__FD_for_1_sec shit which is outdated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Noctix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Yeah, because Monks don't have Feign Death or anything like that.<br />
Since when did need have anything to do with SOE's decision making process?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just use ...both!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">While I'll be ecstatic if we get Imitate Death, I'll operate under the assumptiong that it's a monk ability so as to not be horribly upset when we don't get it.  So I'll either be right, and not really pissed, or I'll be wrong, and be happy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Vaclav</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Skill: Innate means nothing - look at some of your own classes AA's etc and you'll see plenty of them are Skill: Innate as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What?  My response was directed at Kahntun Derstand, who said that this should be for us because it has death in the name and necros don't need a new FD.<br />
<br />
Don't hold your breath on this one, doubt SKs will get it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">6813: 31080 Imitate Death<br />
6814: 31081 This ability allows the monk to execute a perfect feign death that causes every creature to forget about them immediately.<br />
<br />
<br />
Taken from Graffes (http://www.graffe.com/forums/showthread.php?t=21073)<br />
<br />
This is all I see for us <br />
<br />
6885: 31312 Touch of the Cursed<br />
6886: 31313 This ability grants the shadowknight a chance to drain the life of his opponent any time he makes a melee attack.<br />
6887: 31314 <br />
6888: 31315 <br />
6889: 31324 Spiritual Corrosion<br />
6890: 31325 This ability further increases the damage of the lifetaps that result from shadowknight self buffs.<br />
6891: 31326 <br />
6892: 31327 <br />
6893: 31336 Soul Thief<br />
6894: 31337 This ability further increases the chance that the healing effect of your lifetaps will provide an exceptional amount of healing.<br />
<br />
<br />
Looksl like an innate version of SoC, increased ToL, and increased SA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Kemora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Wow look at all that awesome AA we're getting!<br />
<br />
Oh.. wait. We're getting a pile of shit =o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Something tells me we're getting more than 3 aa's.<br />
<br />
And none of those look bad, they're just not... game changing or anything.  Innate chance to proc a lifetap is kinda a slick idea actually.  Actual usefulness will depend on frequency.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I don't think the FD upgrade is for us.  Checking things over on that graffe's thread, most class aa's are listed together with other class aa's.  The FD AA is listed with very monkish sounding aa's.<br />
<br />
Still reading... these seem to be necro aa's:<br />
<br />
837: 31148 Death Peace<br />
6838: 31149 This ability gives you an additional way to feign death.<br />
6839: 31150 Death<br />
6840: 31151 Peace<br />
6841: 31156 Army of the Dead<br />
6842: 31157 This ability calls up to five shades of nearby corpses back to life to serve the necromancer. The soulless abominations will mindlessly fight the target until called back to the afterlife some time later. The shades summoned by the first rank of this ability serve for 60 seconds, and each increasing rank adds 15 additional seconds.<br />
<br />
Not sure who these belong to, but *hopefully* all tank classes, or at least knights:<br />
<br />
6849: 31196 Steadfast Will<br />
6850: 31197 This ability grants a chance to endure what would otherwise be a stunning blow, from any angle, without being stunned.<br />
6851: 31198<br />
6852: 31199<br />
6853: 31208 Shield Block<br />
6854: 31209 This ability grants you the chance to fully block an attack when using a shield. Increased ranks improve the chance to block attacks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I don't think the FD upgrade is for us.<br />
<br />
Two posts above yours is the answer to this thought. It specifically says monk.<br />
<br />
Something tells me we're getting more than 3 aa's.<br />
<br />
We are getting more then 3, but those were the only ones that looked specific to our class. There are generic ones listed as well (increasing spell gems by 1, increasing stat caps, increasing number of buffs, etc) <br />
<br />
while those will most certainly affect us.. they are for all of the other classes as well I would think.<br />
<br />
Hey I just noticed it says registered user.. did the post counts get reset or something?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Looksl like an innate version of SoC, increased ToL, and increased SA<br />
<br />
That pleases me.  That pleases me greatly.  Now we just need SCFM/FoM, change of GoD+ item focus effects, upgrade to death peace, and a mitigation upgrade and Im content.</div></div><hr />
