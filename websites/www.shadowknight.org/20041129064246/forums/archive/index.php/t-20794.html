for Pally, Holy Skin. All heals to the Pally does equal damage to the attacker for X seconds, re-use time X minutes.<br />

Interesting concepts, the Pally one is especially unique...but these aren't exactly realistic solutions-- things haven't gotten that out of balance against us yet, lol. And on the weaponshield/leechcurse disc-- if you'd be riposting everything, then you wouldn't need the tap healing really...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Holy Skin = Make the pally have as much HP as possible, let them get the Holy hell get beat out of them by making sure not to slow the mob and have every healer possible just healing the pally while the pally chain casts stun to hold ago?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">May need heals for spells that are being cast on you, directional spells, single target spells, procs the mob can do.<br />
<br />
I was trying to think of something that would be like WS, but make sense for Knights.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Radahsam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I actually had a cleric suggest to me the use of a spell to solve the mitigation problems.  What she suggested was a reverse healing DS, similar to the cleric MoK.  It would be cast by  the SK on the mob we're tanking.  It would then provide a huge heal every time the mob hits us.<br />
<br />
Now I realize the problems with this.  FIrst, it's not true mitigation.  But, it is tied to the MOB HITTING US, rather than us hitting the mob, so it effectively be mitigation.<br />
<br />
Another problem was that her suggestion included a fixed healing amount.  This does not scale with encounter difficulty, and I pointed it out to her.  If you tuned the healing amount for GoD mobs (let's say 350-500 HP healed per hit or something really crazy like that), then you would make SKs far far FAR more effective at tanking pre-GoD bosses, especially ones that have gimp DPS output.  In many cases, knights would then tank much better than a warrior with 50% mitigation (using defensive).  I explained that....cough....wouldn't go over well.<br />
<br />
Of course, the spell could be modified to change the amount of healing provided based on the mob's hits (i.e. a percentage healed).  Ultimately, that is just defensive in another form.  And while it has some neat role-playing aspects (spell vs. disc), it won't really change the basic suggestion to give us a defensive ability.<br />
<br />
All in all, I would much prefer that they just retune GoD single group encounters for 2 groups instead, giving us a mini-raid role that we can be happy with.  What I would then prefer to see are the addition of some knight disciplines that are truly unique to our class and hybrid nature.  I don't want to be a warrior, but I do want to be able to tank single-group stuff.  And what I want for disciplines and abilities are things that are truly &quot;SK&quot; in nature.  Maybe an ultra-uber damage shield discipline.  Or a rez disc that we could use to save a raid or group from a wipe.  I'm sure I could think of others that would not be too overpowering.  But the point would be to make things unique to our class and not even mix them up with identical Pally disciplines.</div></div><hr />
