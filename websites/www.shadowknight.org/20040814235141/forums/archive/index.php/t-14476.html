<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>sinjionsk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">/BUMP...cause i was looking for it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>sinjionsk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well i got my Urn today....trying to duplicate what the previous said in his pull post it didnt exactly go down like that.<br />
<br />
I camped a 65 Rogue from my guild inside of HS and waited, through her eyes i saw everything happening around me.  At about 3:30pm cst my time Drusella spawned and started walking around like a good pile of bones.<br />
<br />
Immediately i hit the OT port in PoK and took off across the grass as fast as our death steed takes us.<br />
<br />
Into HS i went, some guildies kind enough to camp there the night before heard my call as they were on twinks ( so as not to be able to buff me ) logged in.  Upon arriving to HS the buffs rained down....Virtue, F7, Boar, VoQ, VQ, Ferine.<br />
<br />
The 2 East golems were pulled....dead within seconds.  Already sowed i DMF'd myself and made the unusually difficult sprint across ....i say unusal cause for whatever reason it took me 6 tries to get across.  Finally at the top of the east there was one more golem to kill, snared and deaded.<br />
<br />
To my unknown knowledge in the room across from Drusella a 61 necro had camped out previously and through the eyes of the frozen rogue i watched as teh eye came in.  The eye stared at the rogue for a few seconds and asked me if i was in there for a reason?....( no jackass, i come to this zone all the time ) ....I replied yes i was there for Drusella and he responded with well you have 2 minutes to take her before i do ....<br />
<br />
I easily made it around to teh necro without him seeing me as all the mobs on the way were undead.<br />
<br />
The necro said to my rogue one last time you have 30 seconds to engage or you lose your window.<br />
<br />
Thats when i said to him with my SK....&quot;I am really daring you to take my mob&quot;.....stunned by being snuck up on the necro took a few steps back, then asked what i was doing there....i replied that the rogue was mine, Drusella was mine, and do NOT ever tell me when i am to engage a mob....puzzled the necro had no clue what to do ....<br />
<br />
All guns blazing i shot into Drusella's room, cloaked with my Circlet of Shadow ...lept out of the shadows and exploded in a fit of rage.  Not caring what was hitting me from behind Drusella took a horrific HT that droped her HP's down over halfway.  Spears, and melee shots finished off the kill, and within 30 seconds Drusella was dead and i was FD'd on top of the corpse.<br />
<br />
I waited for the golems to reset bent down grabbed my Urn, The Greenmist Mirror, and AoN that she dropped and FD'd again.<br />
<br />
Nothing aggroed in the hallway so i stood up and shot out of the zone as fast as i came in.<br />
<br />
The turn in for the Spirit Wracked Cords was down about an hour later.  <br />
<br />
Regardless of being Elemental flagged or not....this is still a very nice item, 100 HP's, Aura of Battle, and Sta on a wrist item...very nice....ill be pleased with it and wont change it out till i have my other BoB ( which this replaced ) gone....<br />
<br />
I advise doing this quest...a wrist item like this is not easily gotten...<br />
<br />
just my 2 CP's<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>sinjionsk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">oh btw....my HT which normally does between 7.4 - and 7.9k only hit her for 6.8k....i am assuming she has a Steelskin shield on her</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ok, so you leapfrogged someone that was ahead of you and ganked a mob for an item far weaker than what you can get on a guild raid?  The only reason you got the time window was because the necro was resepecting your rogue's position ... way to take advantage of that.  Really classy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>sinjionsk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">you consider leapfrogging when i told the necro that i was already running my SK back?....yeah sounds like a leapfrog to me...</div></div><hr />
