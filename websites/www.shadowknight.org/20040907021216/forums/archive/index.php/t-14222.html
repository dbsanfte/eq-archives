<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Evansec</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just quit daoc, which I've played since release, and have just startd EQ. I have several friends from town that play it and have recommended it. Right now, I have a lvl 14 shaman, but I'm more of a duel box gamer. It's funner and more challenging for me to run two chars at oncew, rather then just one. Basically right now, it's my shaman, and my friends shaman, so a total of two shamans. This is his 4th-5th-teen** char so he's well associayed with char roles and what not, but I wanted to get a litle more feedback from you people that play SK's as mains. I want to make an Sk because of the fact that they are a jack-of-all-trades sort of char. That's what I played in daoc, AO, and UO, and I'm comfy playin those type of chars. Just so you understand this, I won't be &quot;botting&quot; one char and primarily using the other, I play both chars quite well, of course it's going to take me time to get to that level, as I'm 100% new to the game.<br />
<br />
Now to the point of my post, My friend is making a shaman because it's the one thing he doesn't have that he wants, I'm making one because on paper, it looks better to me group support wise then a druid, mainly due to haste/slows. Now I want to make an SK as I have stated. My friend keeps telling me to go troll, because I'll get 2 types of damage, slam and slash/pierce if I choose to go one of those other then crush. Do I understand that correctly? I personally wanted to go gnome for role play reasons, but then on paper they are comparable to DE's and lack a good deal as far as Stam goes compared to troll's and to me, if a SK is to take any sort of a beating, He will need to have some sort of decent HP pool, so Troll just seems more logical. Can anyone help me out hear, all thoughts are appreciated, and if you think I'd be better off making a diff char then an SK to box with the shaman duo, please let me know what the clas is and why you think it'd suit my style more. <br />
<br />
Thanks for everyone's time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">you will find many posts related to the race to choose, and watch out because you will get flamed but...<br />
<br />
I found that the way to go is Ogre if you want to tank with your shaman slowing. Ogres cannot be stunned from the front by melee, which I found more advantageous then the Troll regen.<br />
<br />
And they have the best HP and STA. However, they are dummer then a box of rocks (low int) so find some items to help them out in that area.<br />
<br />
If you want to solo more without you shaman, then think about the higher int of a DE or a gnome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Evansec</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'll assuredly be playing my shaman along side the SK. As I said, two chars at once presents more challenge for me, therfor making it more fun and enjoyable. I don't mind getting flamed either, I'm 100% nub to EQ, I'm going to ask retarded questions, but the more info I learn, the better. i've read the forums for over two days now, trying to get a jist of what race would be best, and that's what I'm trying to figure out, I more or less udnerstood what the one post said about the advantages/drawbacks to each class, I was more or less hoping to get a response from the different people who chose the different races,a nd why they did. Role play reasons? End game reasons? Things like this. If I did something wrong, please flame me ;) I'll be sure to learn from my mistake's. I plan to make myself a regular, trial by error is often a better teacher then listening of someone elses past ( this has been proven stupid on many points, but it has been proven success on many others ;) )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>asguth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have played almost every sk race to at least 40 and personally I have come to 2 favorites which are ogre and troll. <br />
<br />
Troll Pros<br />
<br />
Regen which will equal if not exceed over time the discrepency in hps between ogre and troll. However when fighting in pon or other planes that are hitting you for 250 plus natural regen does not play that big a role as having a good healer. There are times however where sometimes one is forced to fd in the middle of a horde of mobs like exiting crystal caverns and if you dont have friends on to give you a friendly evac as a troll regen really helps alot. At lower levels as well regen helps so much with getting through those beginning levels.<br />
<br />
Another pro is the good agi starting stats decent dex and sta. I personally love dex. <br />
I have a troll that i put all the points into int which while is nice for soloing if you use mana efficient spells shouldnt matter too much at least at the level that im at 45. <br />
I can solo even con ravishing dolvargs with kei of coarse and i never have to sit and med. Kinda funny sometimes you see people follow ya  while your fear kiting waiting for ya to get a resist ! Even if you get a resist however if your good you can easily recover. High int will help you for pulling when you just dont have time to med and your mana pool begins to dwindle. Also when you solo if you get an add or two if you fear fd then get up to agro wipe the feared one this can be very helpful. Int will help all of this greatly. <br />
<br />
Troll cons<br />
<br />
Trolls are kinda big and can be very cumbersome if you are in zones like CT and you dont have a shrinker you might not be the most welcome person around hehe. <br />
<br />
Exp is so damn slow........... after 50 with my troll beast at 55 he solos very quickly but his exp does not seem to want to move. Ex after hunting for a night in JPF doing blues at 53 in 1 kei i was gaining 1 and a half yellows which is nasty no medding no waiting for pops just constant killing only pausing to buff pet every hour or so. TSK should solo a bit slower unless you find a fear friendly zone. <br />
<br />
Fire Resist mobs that use fire spells are gonna get ya good if you dont have good resist stuff and if your new with little plat you proly wont be able to find good stuff besides a rune boned fork.<br />
<br />
Im sure theres more but thats all i can think of ATM for troll. <br />
<br />
Ogre Pros I had put most of my points into dex except 5 into agi. Kinda of a test that lasted 42 levels and i very much enjoy. at 90 base dex and my very non uber equip i have close to 127 dex and i proc a very good ammount fat boy just luvs to proc. <br />
<br />
Of coarse the str and sta is very important. I believe that if you have over 210 str you will get lots of very high hits. if you barely exceed the 200 mark inbetween 200 and 210 I tend to see a major differernce in avg damage which is very important to me.<br />
 <br />
Since I am not high enough I do not know how sta will affect my high end hps although hp calcs should help ya with that. \<br />
<br />
Very good starting resists not much to add to that they are just good.<br />
<br />
No frontal Stun = awsome for casting during fights although my troll doesnt get stunned much either. If you can pull backwards tho it can be very helpful once you learn how to. <br />
<br />
Ogre cons<br />
<br />
Ya your really fat and for pvp this sucks fattys are easy targets. <br />
<br />
Your also really fat for certian areas and will not be wanted sometimes if there are no shrinkers.<br />
<br />
Your fatness will also hurt your chances with the ladies. <br />
<br />
Other than that i love my ogre.<br />
<br />
The thing i stress tho is that when someone creates a character they create them with level 65 in mind when the majority of the time your not gonna be 65 so think how your going to play this char. Are you soloing if so go iksar troll IMHO. If your grouping and want to be MT then do ogre or troll. And if you are into just looking good be a female de sk hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Calamity_Daemon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">All I can say is that this board is not newbie friendly. I just made an ogre shaman and he's at lvl 5 and I am waiting for his mana to regen at lizzie camps. I say that you choose a troll or ogre. The xp pen sux sometimes but just look around it. Regen is nice from levels 1-30 i have found and not really very useful but as SKs dont really SHINE until lvls 30+ then it helps you get to the point of greatness easier...sort of. Before Grobb was taken Innothule was actually a REALLY nice newbie area and you could geat to level 10-12 pretty easy and with its insta access to the Guks it was a great hub zone. BUT...damn sony made it so that you have to live with the dirty inkies. I hate Nektulos. It makes me sick (its actually a looooooong story) but its so...same. If I were you just pick ogre or troll. Whichever you like most.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Those two posts will tell you most of what you need to know on the subject of race.<br />
<br />
And I wouldn't say we're not friendly to newbies as much as we're not too friendly to the arrogant and the willfully ignorant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Csar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you going to truly be dual boxing these toons then I would go with ogre.  My only thing I didn't like about the race is the huge size.  If you have a shammy that will be no problem as shammies get shrink spells.  I play a gnome though because I like the race.  The only drawback that I can see at this point is getting stunned and my low strgth and stamina.  Both the later can be taken care of with gear.  Being stunned though is something I have learned to play with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Evansec</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well my sham is 14 and the SK is 14 as well now, I don't get a ton of playing time due to work related issues, but I have friends helping me out and telling me where to hunt. It's been pretty fun so far, having the pet ( a living, walking dot) is pretty darn nice too ~~. I went troll sk, and now wish I had gone ogre just because of the stun issues. being a noobie, having to learn to deal with that stun is a pain right now. I like my choices thought and em having a blast. My shaman is a kitty. I play on FV so role playing the two is a blast ~ Thanks for the personal insite a few of you gave ~~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jobrill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You know, I don't get all the people who yell about stun. I have never played an Ogre, and I have never really been bothered by stun. I get stunned maybe once a battle, and I recover pretty easy, and It's usually never long enough for me to lose aggro or anything. I think if you stopped pining for no stun and just played, you'd do a lot better.<br />
<br />
Oh well, I've been thinking of twinking an Ogre BL (Got one at 6 now), maybe playing him will make me see the light, or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Korekil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have never once lost aggro due to stun. I have died due to a stun while casting a spell, but as stuns actually move you a bit, an ogre would die in the same place as his spell would be interrupted.<br />
Personally I love my Iksar, love the look, rp and history of it. I love the fact that I am almost the rarest race/class combo on my server - anytime I do a /who all Iksar shadow I see 7 people or less. I love regen and having an AC higher than most other people with similar gear. I know I can tank well, cast well and solo well. Ogres ad Trolls will tank better, Dark Elves and Erudites solo and cast better, but hey.<br />
At the end of the day though, all races have their strengths and weaknesses Your choice is just down to what appeals to you, you've already made your mind up you just wanted to express your opinion :) You're not wrong to do that, hope you enjoy it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Evansec</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">As I stated.. I'm a noobie, so right now the stun thing is annoying. If I were pining away about stun, I'd have to be making repetitive postings about it, and have played for some time. Neither of which I have done. Right now it's annoying, by next week, I'll have out grown it. Just wanted to clear that up for you a tid bit ~~</div></div><hr />
