You have all suceeded in my departure. Congradulations. Throw a party, because I know that must give you endless amounts of joy, since nothing else outside of the computer screen does that for you.  <br />
<br />

Oh well I hate this forum anyway. You're all a bunch of worthless assholes. <br />

The bottom end of society, that the rest of society wants nothing to do with.  You're all an infestation to the human race. The lowest of the low. The most worthless pieces of scum breathing. None of you deserve the oxygen you breathe.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Francosis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well this isn't necessarily as much of a political discussion as it is one created from spite...<br />
