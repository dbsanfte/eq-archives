What is the toughest thing you SK's have ever killed?  I have heard of some killing high lvl ratmen in DN using pet kiting.  Also in your own opinion, do you think that we are the best to go solo in a dungeon?  I know that shamans can kill WW dragons and bards can solo Gore and all but they suck indoors and we are good indoors.  Is it possible to go solo in PoH, PoF and go solo on FGs?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seriously, I heard stories about Naggy being soloed by a lvl 60 SK before the lvl cap, but thought it was just crap :P<br />
Is it really possible to solo Gore and WW dragons? Cuz I really dont think so...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Uglugg Bloodsbane</div><div class="date">03-25-2002, 03:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ive seen Gore soloed by a Bard once, took her a LONG time (I leveled from just into 41 to 42 by the time she was done).<br />
<br />
And Ive heard of WW Drags being soloed by Shamans (Have no idea how the hell they do that).<br />
<br />
The hardest thing Ive ever soloed was a Sand Giant in the Oasis at 35, don't know if thats a great example or not but something I am very proud of. Revenge is sweet!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jice Virago</div><div class="date">03-25-2002, 04:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fire Giants in SOLB-  These take forever to kill, and even then its still a close fight (you need to toe to toe most of them) and Skarlon is just too hard hitting to solo.  The rest are all doable if you have a LOT of mana and are very careful.  The Wizards are easy because they waste time nuking (chuckle).<br />
<br />
Amy Knights (and other mobs) in Fear-  Fear kitable and an outdoor zone means easy solo, provided your mana holds out.  This is a case where the crappy pathing in Fear works to your advantage.  I did this while my guild was CRing from a bad Temple pull.<br />
<br />
Horses in POG- Getting bored waiting for a CR after an attempt on Ali went south, I fear kited one of the white horses for amusement.  This was extremely easy (I dont think POG mobs have as many HP as Fear mobs on average)<br />
<br />
Krups in Sebilis-  If you pull with Dispell to knock down their haste and SoW, these guys are doable (but not the most efficient solo target), especially the wizards.  Basically, Dot the snot out of it and then chain tap while your DS, DoTs, and mele wittle em down.  If you screw up and lose health too fast, fall back on Leechtouch and HT to pull your ass out of the fire.<br />
<br />
For the Record, Yeldamra can be soloed in WW and it was done by an SK on test server.  Hes level 52, has no AE,  Snareable, Fearable, and has the weakest mele and HP of any WW dragon. He actually drops some ok stuff too.  If your mana pool can hold out and keep him feared, hes a pushover, provided you dont get any adds.<br />
<br />
PS- My gear, while good, is not what I would term &quot;uber&quot; for a level 60 SK (Full SS, Soul Defiler/Relkos, COF) and I would expect the real big guns to be able to solo harder mobs at less risk, especially with the advent of focus items and AA points.  The lynchpin to soloing is manapool, however.  IF you run out of mana before the mob dies, then you lose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Railz8</div><div class="date">03-25-2002, 04:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For those who want to know how shamans solo WW dragons, they buff up, then malo and slow dragon, and torpor them selfs and just let their dots eat em away.  Once shamans can slow things and get torpor off they can tank fairly well.  I have seen a bard solo Gore just took..... I think a little under 3 hours.  Cool how SK's can solo well, but bad thing is we mainly rely on fear kiting.  Oh, would it be possible to solo Skarlon if you were able to get space to fear kite?</div></div><hr />

I thought about it, but in the end decided it's more pain than it's worth...<br />
<br />
my plan, since he regens so slowly was to bind in the zone (so I only zoned when dying, not from the rez), get an epic'd cleric to sit where I pulled lhranc over to, then pop unholy aura, HT him, swing once or twice and die... get clicked... HT, die... click, ht, die, etc...  1501 a pop... my biggest concern was that he would resist the HT and then I'd be screwed with lhranc spawned and just me and a cleric in the zone :P  Then about 3 days before I killed lhranc they patched it so that NPCs healed themselves with lifetap procs... so that would have made my plan a LOT harder...<br />
<br />
still.. it would have been pretty damned cool to solo my final epic boss... only 16k hps... I figure I'd have to die about a dozen times, but could do it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Blackeagle Dwimmerlaik</div><div class="date">03-25-2002, 05:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">oh, hardest thing I HAVE solo'd I would say was actually 4 things... I was in chardok and moving down to the observer area and teaming with a shammy.. the shammy got himself killed, but slowed 2 mobs, I think a reanimated partisan and a di`zok partisan...but he'd been cann'ing down and then got killed when the partisan HTd him... I had both of them hitting me and I started killing them, but then the observer PH spawned... so I switched to him and killed him, then took out the partisan, but before it died, some other dark blue sarnak of some sort spawned, so after I finished the partisan, I killed that, and finally finished off the reanimated partisan... when it was over I'd blown HT, leechcurse and all my mana and had half a bub of health left... but I won :)  then dragged the shammy's body up to the zone and got him rezzed... I couldn't believe I'd lived</div></div><hr />

are you sure you didn't see a bard kiting the dragon for his/her guild to kill?<br />
dunno i just want to settle whether i can indulge in some domestic taunting or not hehe</div></div><hr />

They charm kite her.  Send something after her, grab a new thing etc, etc.  I helped a bard once doing it by bringing swarms of mobs near him, same with a few others.  Slowly it works, very slowly.</div></div><hr />

I can't remember the details, but a bard was trying to solo tantor but ran out of mobs to charm to send at him. Then on another try, he ran tantor past a dragon and the dragon aggrod and bit it. He dragged tantor over to kland once and kland smoked tantor. The mobs that died were lootable for him I believe. Like I said, I'm really not too sure about the details, but it's pretty much a bug.</div></div><hr />

Hmm.. Yeah that was the toughest thing I've solo'd so far at lvl 33.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Groobash</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 02:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I see a lot of claims of people soloing this or that...but in the end they almost always cough up that they used a bug, ploit, or they were buffed to the teeth by other classes. Solo = you and your own buffs/abilities/weapons. No outside crack, speed, buffs etc. <br />
<br />
Solo, the toughtest thing I have whacked is a dual wielding dorf in icewell...tough little boogers.<br />
<br />
I tried Yeldema...dunno how anyone could solo her cuz she summons. Even being 60 she resisted fear often, and the moment she's unfeared she summons you and whacks you for 250-300 a shot while you're trying to refear her. After trying, I'm pretty skeptical that the stories of shamans soloing her are true, at least in her current version. /shrug</div></div><hr />

As for myself, highest mob I think I soloed was just skyfire mobs :) (that are supposed to be up to lvl 51)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Simu</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 08:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am still trying to understand this post interest.<br />
<br />
Soloing is based on you gear, and little about your skill. While I could solo mature Wurm like mob with Simu at 58 and with crappy gear, I can in the same time solo some Troopers in Kael with a 56 SK char that has some NToV gear. Dont tell me it's BS, I just did it and it has few to do with Skill... Very few (compare a 30/35 weapon, 27% haste 140 INT with someone 2 lvl lower with a 40% haste, 46 44 weapon and 180+ INT...).<br />
<br />
So maybe just posting your gear, and assuming you have half an idea about how playing your SK, should be enough to guess what you could solo or not.<br />
<br />
I dont want to be rude, but I am just a little fed up with the &quot;Rooh Rahh cheer Me&quot; thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brael</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 08:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your absolutely right, soloing (fear kiting) is based upon your gear... or more specifically 2 aspects of your gearL damage output and mana pool, there is alittle bit of skill involved but for the most part its all about having the dps to kill the mob before your mana runs out.  This isnt to say its all based on gear as there are some more things you can do to solo the mob aside from cast darkness/fear and hit it... this is where timing/spell selection/playstyle come in, but yes, its still based more upon gear than skill<br />
<br />
then again, what in EQ isnt based largely on gear?<br />
<br />
<br />
hmm... answered alot in this thread and never answered the main question... theres been alot of &quot;hard&quot; mobs ive soloed since I cant think of what truly was the hardest im going to go with Venificus Grieg</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jice Virago</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 10:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ive seen plenty of SKs with superior gear to myself who suck at soloing.  There are a lot of subtleties to even fear kiting that escape a lot of people, due to laziness, inexperience, or general incompetance.  Good example is do you wait for Cascading Darkness to wear off before recasting or do you have it timed so you resnare just as its about to run out?  Do you study the pathing and move your mob to a safe location to kite it?  The seasoned soloer takes these for granted but a lot of up and commers to the class don't consider these things.<br />
<br />
But I will agree soloing a mob toe to toe is a lot more gear dependant than skill dependant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RandomKayan</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 11:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anyone who says he didn't get flattened like a pancake the first few times he soloed is a liar.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes soloing isn't rocket science and yes gear does help, nevertheless PanCakes are still a dime a dozen on any Norranthian night.</div></div><hr />
