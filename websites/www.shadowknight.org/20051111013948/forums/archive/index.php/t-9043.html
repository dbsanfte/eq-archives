<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rezzbagg</div><div class="date">12-07-2002, 12:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well basically, I got another account and put my cleric on it. He is level 35 and my sk is level 55. What I was wondering is if anyone can give me some tips on pl'ing him. Particularly where to do it, and good tactics for doing it in the quickest way. Thanks in advance =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Skek</div><div class="date">12-07-2002, 12:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK clerics are difficult to level most of the time due to the lack of their offensive power.<br />
<br />
My best suggestion would be to play them properly until he/she gets lvl 45 or so and then just duo them with your sk.  If you don't fancy grouping i would suggest sticking to undead mobs such as specs, or frogs in dead side lower guk.  That way you get the best offensive power for your mana.  If you do this, use your sk to pull... that way you get singles and can jump in if things all go horrendously bad.<br />
<br />
Stick to old world mobs rather than going to an expansion zone.   Old world mobs have far fewer hp and hit for far less.  High turnover of mobs=big xp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aaoogaa Soulhunter</div><div class="date">12-07-2002, 01:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You only need to level the cleric to 37 or 38 level and he/she will be able to group with you.  Then it is easy.  Just go to your normal exp spot and watch the exp fly.  Right now my shaman gets 1 yellow for every blue in 55 for my sk.  She is dinging every yellow of 55 exp for me.<br />
<br />
Go out with your SK and pull a mob that will turn and try to run when you beat it down enough.  Then once the mob turns FD.  Then have your cleric cast atone 2 or 3 times on the mob and kill it with your cleric.  Effective cleric PL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wilambik</div><div class="date">12-12-2002, 04:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's a PITA, but it can be done.<br />
<br />
Clerics get a mem-blur spell called Atone.  Normally takes two casts to fully kill a mob.<br />
<br />
Have SK pull mob in, kill it down to a sliver of life.  Cleric roots mob.<br />
<br />
SK FD's<br />
<br />
Cleric Atones twice.<br />
<br />
Cleric Nukes mob to death.<br />
<br />
Trust me, it sux.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aaoogaa Soulhunter</div><div class="date">12-13-2002, 11:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Um yeah what I said.  Anyway don't use root use the SK snare on mobs that will run.  That way they just stand there while the cleric beats on them or nukes em.  No damage to the cleric and much less worry of the root breaking.  The exp is fine because you can kill mobs close to your level and fairly fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rezzbagg</div><div class="date">01-05-2003, 08:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This advice was good, and it worked for me for a bit, but it was still a hassle. After expirimenting a bit I found an even better way. I was just beating stuff with til it would run, and then I would zone, letting cleric finish it and get all the xp himself. There are 3 or 4 zones at their level ranges with good xp near the zonline, so he raised rather quickly. I only needed a few levels before cleric could get xp groupedx with sk, and now it is flying. Thanks for your tips.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarkQuark</div><div class="date">01-07-2003, 01:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have this exact situation... Well of course the after affect is my SK is now 62 just about and the cleric is near 55.  <br />
<br />
Once the cleric can group with you and hits 39 ( He can CH) it's all over but the crying.  Velks is an excellent spot even Sol B till he gets to low 40's.  The only worth of the cleric in this situation will be his buffing and healin powers.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rotarr Rok'Vodarna</div><div class="date">01-07-2003, 07:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have the opposite problem.  I don't want to de-rail this thread and put it on another track, but I am going to try anyway.  My topic could be the same as this one.<br />
<br />
My cleric is 52, and my SK is 45.  I used retribution and atone a few times to help my SK get from late 20's to 37, but I always tried to group when I could.  With a cleric as the higher character I am having a problem finding zones that the SK can handle yet still get my cleric some exp.<br />
<br />
Recently I went to Jagged Pine and found the Gnolls too tough for my SK to handle.  The Bats in SolB are too risky due to trains and adds, the Basilisks in Jagged Pine are often lt blue now.  Most outdoor zones like DSP seem to draw adds to my cleric (those damn shroom trains!), and cause me to FD and the cleric to gate or zone.  <br />
<br />
No DL, please, I have done so much time there it seems like a prison.  I even did the Yeti cave in DL for a bit, but I killed them too fast and sat around waiting too long for the respawn.  (Good problem to have I guess.)  And they should be getting lt. blue by now anyway.  I did the plaguebones near the spires (fear kiting) for a bit, but exp just seemed to go so slow.<br />
<br />
I know solo exp goes slow, but I am so use to grouping, and I have been so unable to find groups outside DL around KC, that it is making me insane (ok I was already insane, but it sounds good).<br />
<br />
Does anyone have advice on where to hunt at this point?  Once my SK hits 46, I plan on finally being able to go find a guild or Alliance group in PoP, but for now, I can't find a group, so I am stuck 2-boxing, and for comparitively sucky exp at that.<br />
<br />
I can't afford to keep buying SoW potions to keep my SK pulling the mobs, so indoor or spawns close to safe spots are a plus.  I just keep staring at the EQAtlas hunting guide looking at the levels, and the only thing that sticks out as a place I want to go is the Grey.  I just wish I had the plat for EB items.<br />
<br />
So, let me hear it, is anyone willing to help a guy trying to change his main from a cleric to a SK find a place to hunt?  Am I just too picky?  Do I just suck so bad that I might as well quit?  Come-on, let me have it, flames and all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SuDanger68</div><div class="date">01-08-2003, 01:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I leveled my Sk and my Cleric to 51 in CoM. First do entrance MObs then do temple area. if your cleric is 52 you wont have prob to single pull at least all mobs that are outside. <br />
<br />
the ones inside the Temple you will get 3 or 4 with cleric.<br />
<br />
Also pull first left plateau then the walkway inside then right plateau.<br />
<br />
YOu get much more xp if you only buff, heal nad pull with cleric and have him not grouped ;)<br />
<br />
Edit: Best in there is that you can cast CH 5 or 6 times and wont agro. And no mob runs ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rotarr Rok'Vodarna</div><div class="date">01-08-2003, 04:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah, CoM.  Thank you for the info.  The fact they do not run, and that CH's don't get the agro just put CoM on my next spot to visit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kanekra Soulreaver</div><div class="date">01-08-2003, 04:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">lower guk would be a good place for the 45 sk and 52 cleric .. all that undead would be good xp .. also could do that skelly camp in DL near the wizzy spires if you can ever get it .. my sk was 50 and my cleric was 40 when I went there and the xp really came fast .. just stand back and cast and they come single every time .. they only add if you get in meele range .. its a whole lot easier to PL a sk over a cleric, so I just kept the grouped most the time and by the time I got to 56, the cleric was at 54 ..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AXAZE</div><div class="date">01-10-2003, 11:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Try Burning Woods. Skyfire is ok too maybe a bit too much at 45. CoM starts to green about 47ish iirc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SuDanger68</div><div class="date">01-10-2003, 05:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Entrance in CoM greens out at 47. Temple and area in front of locked door has Darkblue until 51. then light blues start to trickle in there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rotarr Rok'Vodarna</div><div class="date">01-10-2003, 07:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the input, and my appologies to Rezzbagg for derailing his thread.<br />
<br />
I will most likely visit CoM, Guk, and then be set moving into the planes with my SK.<br />
<br />
Right now however, I am busy PLing my friend's Necro to 30 (so he can group with me), so I won't get back to leveling until next week.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rezzbagg</div><div class="date">01-11-2003, 11:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Np on the derail, I got the info I needed, glad the thread could help someone else out.:)  You may also want to try Scarlet Desert, there shoud be plenty of stuff there you can both get xp for.</div></div><hr />
