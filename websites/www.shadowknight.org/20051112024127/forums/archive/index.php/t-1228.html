Had a brief argument with some super twinks from another guild who kept pulling mobs through the library to fight them out front instead of moving through and fighting further in, but that didn't last long.<br />
<br />
After being in the Library for 2 minutes, the Failed Crypt Raider spawned and I had my final scroll. Woohoo!<br />
<br />
We had the guild's 54 chanter come down with us to as he needed the Spectral Librarian, but the bastage never spawned.  We will go back for him though. :)<br />
<br />
Now I need to get into Droga and make the Tome.  Greenmist, here I come. ;)<br />

<br />
First time I saw him I was down there solo, on my first trip in, and I was merely scouting.  Caution prevailed and I didn't try to solo him in unfamiliar territory.<br />
<br />
Next 2 camps I was grouped with folks already inside that were PL'ing alts.  Lots of Librarians, no raider in probably 6-8 hours worth of camping.<br />
<br />
Finally one day I logged in and made a pass through and the raider was up...  I waited for him to wander out by the fountain, pulled him between the damn healer skellies over to the wall to the left of the fountain and fought him there.  Had to burn HT at just the right time when a healer wandered by and started making life hell, and then fight the healer too, but I pulled it off :)  (solo at level 51)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shasz</div><div class="date">05-01-2002, 11:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I remember him being light blue to me...  Maybe I was only 50 when I did him.  At the time most stuff was light blue, an occasional librarian or other named was blue and about 1/4 were green.<br />
<br />
Either way, its not that the crypt raider is hard, the layout with 4 wandering skeletal warders that will heal anything nearby is the problem.  Those warders are a pain in the ass all by themselves, let alone as an add.  It only takes a good duo high 40s or more to keep the area clear enough, but at 50/51 I wasn't able to keep it all clear enough solo, and had to finesse it :)</div></div><hr />

What about the spectreal Couriers and the librarian/assist librarian? I'm 35, wondering if I could get a group of the same levels and camp the pages. <br />

Spectral Courier in CoM<br />
Dark Blue at 45, highest mob was around 42ish<br />
I got lucky at 45th and went with a guild monkie that was 51 that needed 1 page to drop.  The path to the stables was clear cause he had been pulling it all day long with a 52 Shaman and a 40? warrior. <br />
After 3 hours, I had 2 scrolls and the Monk and I both needed the same 3rd scroll.  It finally dropped 4 spawns later, another 2 hours, and he got it.<br />
A week later a RL bud and I went to CoM to try to get his pieces for the Shaman epic, and hopefully my last CoM scroll.  The guild monkie was working on AA points at the entry and helped us with the Stables. 5 hours later, the Shaman had his epic drops and I had the last CoM scroll.<br />
<br />
Mistmoore Librarian and the Assistant<br />
Both were Light Blue (teal)...  high 20s/30ish<br />
Remember Mistmoore has 2 spawn cycles.<br />
Day = Living (invis will get you everywhere)<br />
Night = Undead and Living mix (can't get too far with just one)<br />
So travel in the day hours in-game.<br />
<br />
The assistant is in a room with a red conopy over the bed near the throne room.  The PH / Assist spawns directly in front of it and a Gargoyle spawns in the right corner as you enter.<br />
At 40ish, I went in invis and smacked the PH, started my timer and took out the Gargoyle.  The mob in the adjacent room agroed and I had to FD for 11 minutes while it stood over me. It left and I hid/med/healed for the next 10 minutes (yep, 25-26 minute timer) and the Assist popped 2 cycles later.<br />
<br />
The Librarian is in the Library, upper tier.  2 other mobs spawn there on the lower level as you enter.  The room is incredably small.  Be sure to pull from the upper landing, to the right of the door as you enter or you will get the 3 mobs from the adjacent room.  If the 3 mobs are casters, wait until the night/day cycles and hope you get all melees. :)<br />
I took out the PH and the Lib. spawned 25ish minutes later.<br />
I had a 49 druid with me and only lived cause of him. :)<br />
<br />
Here is another solution you can try.... I hope you live ;)<br />
This requires SoW or Wolf Form, and regen....<br />
1) Shout to the zone you are pulling out the castle main floor to the zone. ;)<br />
2) Tag the PH/ Lib. of your choice and run to the top of the ramp near the zone and look down the ramp... KEEP THE PH TARGETED<br />
3) When your train arrives at the lake, cast FD<br />
4) The mobs will all hang out for a few minutes, maybe 10... this is why you want a regen up so you can heal more while feigned<br />
5) When they thin out, or the PH starts to move, stand up and cast Darkness on it<br />
6) FD again<br />
7) The rest will wander back before the PH and you can kill it at your leisure<br />
<br />
This isn't fool proof, but worked when I got the Lute off the Gypsy for the Bard quest armor when I helped someone get it.<br />
