Maybe old news to some of you, but the stuff seems to respawn pretty quick (like 20-30 minutes? I didn't time it.)<br />
<br />
Easy solo at 65, ridiculously easy.  A group of mid 50's could wipe the area around zone in easily.<br />
<br />
Looks like they really did make the shit pretty common.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Valicar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Aye.. that's the hard part.. &quot;Oh.. who wants to come to fear with me?  And who wants to be the DT person?&quot;<br />
<br />
Its easier to find a person to take a DT then to get them to go to fear.<br />

Just keep plugging away I was up there for 5 days straight at least 10 hours a day after the patch. Was very sick of hate. 160 drakes later, 50 since the patch. Logged in, ran around zone in area till I found one drake up , killed it and boom got my hide.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Pincer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">god, myst be nice.  90+ hours spent up there, and at least 15 after the patch, and I have still to see it &gt;:(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grimskayle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Last night, got a stone, and took that NPC in PoT up to Hate to see if anyone was killing. Saw a drake near zone in, pulled it, BAM, had hide. Is super common now. <br />

Taken out about 60 drakes since the patch, no hide.  Respawn was actually slowed down with the changes to droprate and is now about 50 mins.  And yes, you can massacre the first half of the zone at level 65, decent exp too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nazgaull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Raided JUST the Tier 1 section of Hate with my Guild the other night, on the Bertoxxulous Server... <br />
<br />
We saw 4 Hides drop in 3 hours time... <br />
<br />
We had 3 SK's in our Guild attending and each got a Hide... and 1 Hide rotted... <br />
<br />
We also saw 3 Staff of Elemental Mastery: Earth.. all rotted.. all in 3 hours... <br />
<br />
We only went up for some Marsinger drops... never saw any of that stuff though...<br />
<br />
Also...<br />
Respawn was actually slowed down with the changes to droprate and is now about 50 mins.  <br />
Respawn rate for us was about 10 - 15 minutes...<br />
<br />
We saw a total of 6 Drakes in the whole 3 hour time... 4 out of 6 dropped the Hide.</div></div><hr />

Do it yourself ... clear the mobs around the Golems and then ask people to come and help you kill them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>BucMan55</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">8th Drake had a hide for me.  Soloed 3 of them one night with monk, no hide, logged in next day and got in group for an hour and a half.  First drake of the day dropped the shield, so brang SK up for that, then last drake dropped hide(got the group to avoid logging by saying I saw a drake but had to clear a couple mobs first)....<br />
<br />
Also had an elemental mastery: earth drop.....</div></div><hr />
