<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">heh k so bought the ft1 slot 7 aug for 760 now i have like 40 pts left available... im at ft7 now. One of my next goals is to get the FT2 aug for my boots. K need to grind about umm 800 more pts guk to unlock that though. Debating maybe picking up the scythe of inny on the way to unlocking guk maybe say doing rujarkan for abit getting say 660 there buying scyth then going back and doing the 800 pts i need in guk? Bah late and kinda coming out wrong...guess i'll leave it at how valuable do you guys think the scythe is? worth stopping for before i grind 800 pts in guk or should i just keep saving the pts for the ft2 aug? Hope wasn't too hard to understand it is late atm for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">actually i think im gonna grind for abit in takish or rujarkan to either buy my bst his pet aug or his slaves hidden orb(15/19 h2h), he atm has like 1500 pts just sitting there but nothing decent unlocked to spend on. <br />
<br />
Cleric has a brand new ft2 aug'd guk bp (had mr and didn't want to grind more pts in ef/tak atm) and bulwark of vie so is left with like 90 available atm. Unlocking tak opens up blessing of reverence which i would find useful on raids or GRC. So atm thinking of spending time in takish anyways grinding for abit to get the extra pts i would of needed for the ft2 aug. <br />
<br />
Think scythe of inny will make a bigger impact on my ability to do guk dungeons? or will ft2 make a bigger impact if a slower one on my ability to do all dungeons? hehe confusing again maybe but still late :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kalderic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">considering you're doin a lot of LDoN adventures, i'd get the scythe before the ft augment.<br />
<br />
just my 2 cc<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Aye, scythe rocks for LDON runs. Like Kalderic said, if you in for lots of LDONS, buy scythe first. When I got LDON, first thing I went for was scythe of Inny. It is very good mana efficient dd spell and can work with lesser scythe or deny undead to increase your spell dps if you have high FT and has bard+druid+bst in group to support your increased mana flow for nice dps increase in group. If you have poor FT, you still find scythe attractive cuz its a better replacement over deny for nearly same mana for about same dps (30 min vs 20 min for more dmg but ended up giving about same dps but cheaper mana per min frame for same damage). For high FT SK, they can use 2 undead dd spells back-to-back to go around long cast time barrier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Although I'm sure the scythes do 'rock', IMO I don't feel they rock enough to displace a piece of Mir armour or half a piece of Tak armour or a nice purchased augment.<br />
<br />
What I mean is, your gear, your ft, etc. will be working for you all the time while you are tanking; whereas your scythes will only be used on undead (although admittedly doing ~40% more damage than Deny Undead).  If you are happy with the gear that you have and have no weak spots that could be improved by getting some Tak gear first, then by all means a scythe may be the best option.  <br />
<br />
(I've earned 19k ap so far and have no intention of getting my undead nuke until I have about 30k ap and have all the stuff I want first).<br />
<br />
Edit: adding that I'm not disagreeing directly, I think SoI is a great undead nuke.  I just can't justify getting it for *me* while I have gear that needs upgrading first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'd get the Scythe of Innoruuk, too.  It's the one thing you CAN'T get outside of LDON.  You can get other good gear, flowing thought, etc., outside of LDON.  But you can't get the spells anywhere else.<br />
<br />
-Bolas</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Xanathol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">IMO, it all depends. Depends on your gear, guild, and future goals. If you are in a raiding guild, doing luclin -&gt; PoP, then FT gear should come in a reasonable time. If not, then you may not see FT gear for quite a while, and depending on your normal play, the Scythe may be best put on hold. You've got FT7, so you should be pretty good in FT, but, on to my next point...<br />
<br />
Group makeup - for instance, my 'normal' group at this time consists of a ranger, rogue, wizard, shaman, cleric, and myself. So that's DPS, DPS, DPS, slower, healer, tank. Average mob lifespan in LDoN is 30 seconds. Sure, with Scythe I could up my personal DPS, but the benefit to the group is next to null in comparision. FT is more important in that scenario, as there is only ghetto CC, so using my mana to heal myself at times is more important than an occassional nuke, as the cleric may have to heal multiple group members.<br />
<br />
It really depends on your play, what you plan on doing in the near future, and your common group make up. There is no blanket wrong or right choice, just the best choice for you and your group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>DConquest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you plan on doing a lot of LDoN runs, the Scythe is much more worth it than any aug you can get.   MC + Scythe / Deny Undead or Spear of Decay, makes for a lot of fast killing.  Everything else only adds to your relative power as your gear keeps getting better and better.  <br />
<br />
That's why I would recommend getting both your best LDoN spells ( Call of Darkness, Scythe )1st before pursuing gear upgrades / augs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>aress</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">get scythe first.  Have fun with it, and the points will come in.  Then max FT, if you are not in a raiding guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">:P Bolas do you see what guild im in now, heh im not getting any upgrades for atleast 2months of hard raiding which my guild isnt doing yet heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hmmm... have I been that wrong in my thinking?  Perhaps I will re-assess the scythe(s) again.  If so many peeps agree that the scythes should come before armour upgrades, I must have missed something.<br />
<br />
FWIW, I'm on more or less the last Tak piece I plan to get (other than augmentations and weapon), so perhaps after that is a good a time as any to get SoI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Pretecf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Tak does not have the undead of the other LDoNs.  If you focus there, I can see why you it is lower on your priority list.  However, the comment regarding the fact that is available nowhere else has a lot of merit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Saveaux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Bah Dhantes now you have me questioning the order that I get the scythe at =P</div></div><hr />
