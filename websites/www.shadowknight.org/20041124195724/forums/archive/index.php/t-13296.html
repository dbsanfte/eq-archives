<br />
2) sk pet swarm, would be multi tiered, 3 lvls. Lvl 3 summons 3 lvl 61, mini spec pets that do nothing but /shield you<br />
<br />
Thought this would be a fun thread, post your ideas</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Drakonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">As far as swarm pets go, I'd be happier if they changed the swarm weapon so that it procs 3 mini skeletons for 20 seconds each proc... would be more of a real &quot;swarm&quot; then...<br />
<br />
AA wise I dunno... maybe an AA version of Cloak of Luclin that actually gives more HPs than BSS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Drynnious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">GS aa <br />

<br />
The 2h aa's to work for all weapons. (i.e. work for 1handers :P)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>synnoira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yes if we had a pet AA (Brael suggested one eons ago i think) i'd totally want a mafia pets thing. Lots of little skeletons. I'd like the damage swarm i think, that's more in keeping with the way our spell abilities have been shaped. Rogue pet via AA would be nice <br />
<br />
As another idea...<br />
<br />
Bane of Life<br />
<br />
Reduces timer of the discipline Leechcurse by 11 minutes with each point. 5 points total at 3 AA's a point.<br />
<br />
Unholy Wickedness<br />
<br />
Reduces timer on the discipline Unholy Aura to 36 minutes. In line with points for Touch of the Wicked.<br />
<br />
And also now that i think of it, this would be popular...<br />
<br />
Master of Terror<br />
<br />
Makes the shadowknight's fear spell effect mobs up to level 63. <br />
<br />
Of course just getting fury of magic would make folk happy too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Trysbrina67</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">A beefed up and Mass effect Zevs Bite, with SoWood reuse time would be pretty cool.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also would be nice to see a FD improving AA, as well as a !stun AA.<br />
<br />
And as mentioned above the pet AAs, and fury of magic are a must imo.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Keyan Aubaine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">On to something more realistic...<br />
<br />
Out of the two you mentioned my favorite would be the swarm pet, mostly for RP reasons, i don't exactly see what in our class would be leading to such a skill. As far as game mechanics as concerned, since neither would bring more than a situational thing, i would rather have something i can use to help push mobs where we want them, or increase a little our burst DPS with the swarm pets, than add to our ranged combat because i don't exactly see what it would bring (other than a slightly higher DPS when we cannot fight in melee obviously).<br />
<br />
Personally i'm even more fond now than ever of the death peace AA that never went past the luclin beta, the number of our spells that cannot be swapped in due to long recast (harmshield, zevfeer's bite, the spear line, the voice line) vampirizes our spell slots quickly.<br />
Swapping in DoTs or buffs is not an issue, but these take up to 10 minutes to load after the moment we mem them, which makes it required to keep them up permanently or not at all.<br />
A death peace AA would allow us to free up that valuable spell slot to fit one more of them, and since it would keep the same mana cost and cast time, it wouldn't modify the balance for agro control/pulling (the 100 mana of DP is about irrelevant anyway these days).<br />
A VERY important bonus would be to totally remove the &quot;spell recovery time not met yet&quot; issues with death peace, at this point i consider this bug to be most likely a part of EQ in a permanent way, and DP moved to an AA button would at least make it recovery time-proof, and would take away a lot of frustrating deaths.<br />
Additionally this AA is already coded in the game and wouldn't require much work at all.<br />
<br />
I don't think allowing us to have two timers for IHT and leech touch would be a good thing, it would open the door for much higher burst dps which imo is not something that would benefit the game (we are already ahead of any other class in that area).<br />
On the other hand maybe changing IHT so it's a default 7200 with or without the discipline unholyaura would be more interesting, it would remove a good part of the nightmare of timing the disc and the skill since both have different refresh times and are most of the time used together (since the discipline doesn't affect leech touch). It would make the discipline effectively irrelevant at level 65, but honestly i don't think that will be an issue, and is way worth removing the timing difficulties.<br />
<br />
The AA version of cloak of luclin wouldn't be bad at all, giving it the exact stats BSS+CoR have would make it worth using over other classes buffs. The issue though is that it's a level 65 spell (ok the worst one of the bunch, but still), and it would be hard to justify it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jupke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">How about an AA that reduces the recast on our nukes, 5 points, 1AA 5-10% less recast time on spears/zev bite/harmshield etc.<br />
<br />
An added duration AA for leechcurse, 3AA, increasing cost. first 5% added duration and 5% healing per hit, second 10% and third 15%.<br />
<br />
Oh and i would loooove swarm pets :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Mordeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Pet / Pet swarm idea doesn't appeal to me personally, but:<br />
<br />
1) AA button DP<br />
<br />
2) Love the thought of unlinking IHT and UA<br />
<br />
3) I think an aa instant invis vs undead much like the ranger insta camo would be good.<br />
<br />
4) If melee from horseback was more manageable I think an AA that granted increased attack rating while fighting on a horse would be a very cool addition for both Sks and Paladins. <br />
Make it 3 tiers trainable between 61-65. Not entirely sure what appropriate bonuses and point costs would be.<br />
<br />
EDIT: A bit of spacing is your friend :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Darkenesis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Unholy Drogmar, or whatever those damn lizards are called... :p  Should be tied into the Unholy Steed AA though.<br />
<br />
But I'd say maybe an improvement to Mastery of the Past or something... Something to go up to maybe level 62 spells.  Or at least maybe turn down the fizzle rate on our spells... Fizzling a Zbite 5 times in a row is just ridiculous!<br />
<br />
And also... One I was thinking of recently... A way to add lure resist properties to our disease spells!  So fucking annoying for a mob to be disease resistant and totally fuck SKs over... On jords in BoT, I only really use like 3 spells.  Everything else I would use in combat don't even stick, and it's really REALLY annoying.<br />
<br />
Think it would be cool to have an AA to pimp out Zbite... Maybe a mod to the recourse so we can up the hp/mana recourse (kind of like Soul Abrasion for our Shrouds)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Blackeagle Dwimmerlaik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">an AA that increases our proc rate (for both weapon and imbued procs)<br />
<br />

<br />
fury of magic<br />
<br />
spell casting mastery (in addition to us getting specializations up to 50, with none going over it)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>lorddaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">an AA that does +1-5 bane damage to whatever weapon we wield.<br />

<br />
I'd like a squire, more for the roleplay.  Make him fairly useless and give him to pali's too.<br />
<br />
I'd like something that moved mobs.  Bards get a mez that pulls mobs, i'd like something like that.  Say an aa, that has a fairly short range, with the result of , &quot;a dumbass mob has been summoned by the sk.&quot;  <br />
<br />
just leave my fear spells alone</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>synnoira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'd forgotten about the Deathpeace hotkey skill. It would certainly be very useful if it went live.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kalendrox Grimblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I think my favorite out of all of these would be to beef up Zevfeers.<br />
3 levels<br />
<br />
first level: +25% HP and Mana<br />
Second Level: +50% HP and mana<br />
Third Level: +100% HP and Mana<br />
<br />
Final spell would be group 400hp 200 mana tap.<br />
<br />
An easier way to do this would be to link Zevfeers with Soul Abrasion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jobrill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Ok, REALISTICALLY:<br />

3. Soul Steal: Makes Regular HT Life Leech. Requires all other HT skills maxed. <br />
<br />

<br />
4. Shadow Master: Grants Instant cast perma-Invis like Ranger/Druid Camo ability<br />

If we gave that to a class that has more AC, more HP, and better mitigation...who do you think would be doing all the pulling on raids. I do enough pulling as it is, and if I was made a primary puller I would go nuts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Keyan Aubaine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Reading comprehension is a good thing, DP hotkey would have both a mana cost and cast time as all of us already said.</div></div><hr />

Could be either a 3 lvl skill allowing you to stick invoke fear on mobs (like finishing blow skill), or a hotkey triggered skill like fading memorie - strong root, with a reasonably short recast time.<br />
<br />
_&quot;Something that makes your mana usefull&quot;:<br />
With new buffs and ft items, I hardly manage to burn my mana on mobs, and am almost perma fm in raids even with 3 spears loaded.<br />
I would like some aa allowing us to use a big chunk of mana to &quot;do something usefull&quot;.<br />
I have not anything clear in mind, but I would like to finish boss fights oom for a change.<br />
I wouldnt mind if the mana cost was insane, just want to burn mana.<br />
It could be some strong dot ala mb-lb, a short duration powerfull pet with some nice undead-ghost look, a phat ac-atk-dot lure debuff, a huge aggro spell allowing you to pass good aggro to mt via ae taunt, some big lure based darkness, a short duration lifetap proc buff (100 base / 300 with SA?)...<br />
<br />
_an instant cast inviz (with maybe some low mana cost)<br />
<br />
_the death peace hotkey<br />
<br />
_Fury of magic, ok i'm not sure if we &quot;should&quot; get it as hybrids, but this an aa skill I would love to get</div></div><hr />

<br />
Getting Flurry would kick ass but i doubt it'd happen - I think it would be my favorite AA if it did tho.  Its both usefull DPS increase &amp; its got eye-candy effect.  <br />
<br />
I DON'T want any more HT AAs - we've got a shitload as it is &amp; our HT is very nicely balanced: don't need to go fucking that up.  <br />
<br />
Something to give at least a limited degree of specilization for casting skills - fizzling pisses me off.  <br />
<br />
Arbaal's pet AA ideas would certainly be fun but not overly usefull.  I like the pet that nukes idea tho.</div></div><hr />

I got ft 14, and 20% mana conserve, only time i have FM on raids is when A) no mobs in camp B) i am afk, eiher we are not playing the same class, or you dont know how to play the class =P<br />
<br />
You have Spears, Taps, Dots, torrents, the list goes on, that alone should keep u OOM, if spears are not keeping your mana low enuf, switch to taps, they eat mana fast, and can be chained easier due to lower recast which gives higher dps (also taps agro less).<br />
<br />
As far as fear, let it go VI will not give us fear back, it would over power us too much compared to other melees(who cant solo at all), we can still solo via agro kiting, be happy they havent nerfed that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Jupke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">More idea's they should make us an AA to make zev's bite have a benifical AE. That way we could tap mana for the whole raid :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Inquestion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">How about an AA that beefs ALL our taps?<br />
<br />
Something like a 5 tier pop AA that costs like 2/2/2/2/2..<br />
<br />
Would increase the damage (and healing) of single target taps (maybe including self procs too)... possibly something like 4%, 8%, 12%, 16% 20%.<br />
<br />
Maybe our insta invis AA could add a little more than a CoS... invis, see invis, lev and better runspeed, maybe... could have some sort of undead illusion for cosmetic value as well.<br />
<br />
I still want a fast reuse AA (5 minuteish) that will work as like a MGB tap. Press the button, tap, and it gives an AoE effect.  It would be great for raiding, and probably not too overpowered or anything either.<br />
<br />
That's about all I can think of, all the ideas are good so far, keep em coming.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Urgokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">26.5k dmg would be insane, neat but insane.  Though some kind AA to mirror the Pally &quot;I sacrifice myself for the good of the raid as i'm all goody goody and stuff&quot; AA would be neat.  <br />
<br />
Since I don't see healing as our kind of thing, dishing out more damage is probably along the correct train of though but the question would be how much.  Maybe something that just stacks another multiplier to HT so when your are low on health the raid is looking like its going to shit and you are probably going to die anyway why not let us dish out that last act of defiance and nail the mob for some serious damage.  Who knows maybe nailing that mob for somewhere in the neighborhood for 15k max damage would get its attention enough to prevent a total wipe.<br />
<br />
/shrug just my thoughts...one question though is the pally one a rezable death?  If it is something like this wouldn't be too out of line</div></div><hr />

First of all a resonably buffed sk would be more like 8k hp 5k mana, second of all Mazzic D'Vainn sujjested the formula to be hp plus mana divided by 2, not multiplied, so thats about 6.5k damage, (in other word a second HT)<br />
<br />
IMO this skill is not such a good idea.  The reason i say that is it highly promoted zerging, something imo needs to be discouraged not promoted.  And in any case i would hope that in most any situation over the course of a 5 min fight the sk can amount to more than 6.5k damage via spell +melee instead of just blowing himself up.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>TheDarkness</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">ok, well one thing to consider in all this is the ranger class atm. the rangers are evn saying they do too much damage. a ranger in my new guild ( old guild disbanned...been around since beta too! :( ) with AM1 crits for 1k+ a lot....AM3 is gonna make him sick. and that's not even with true shot on.<br />
<br />
anyhow, point being, I am curious to see what, if anything, they are planning to do about melee damage &amp; mitigation, per the update on the live site. IMO, I think a reduced recast time on HT with the discplines, etc, would be a balanced idea, seeing the damage rangers are doing, and the fact shammies can throw out AA pets at 61 for an avg of 2k of damage on the mob. shammies, you lucky dogs...no pun intended...<br />
<br />
anyhow, can we get some kinda of petition going? I knwo the fear petition fell on its face, but I would like to see if sought after again...we could recommend:<br />
<br />
1. fear for 55+ XP mobs<br />
2. DP AA hotkey, as suggested many times before<br />
3. AA for the pet swarm<br />
<br />
I would like to add in the lower reuse time on HT &amp; disciplines, OR moving the level that we get the current reuse time AA from 65 to 59, the same level rangers get AM. The latter would probably be the best 'middle of the road' suggestion on HT.</div></div><hr />
