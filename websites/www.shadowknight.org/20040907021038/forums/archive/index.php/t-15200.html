<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dethroned</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I joined a Fear raid last night, that was a total wipe from the get go.  A big train was created at the start of the raid, which killed everyone except a couple of us who used FD, including myself.  I stood up after it looked like things were clear, and Fright DT me for 20000 damage.  People kept running solo back into the zone (even though they were told not to) which meant trains kept reforming ... ok it was nasty, and a GM ended up coming to help, after about 3 hours of corpses stacking on top of each other.  Much of it was the fault of people going in and training their mobs to the so-called &quot;safe spot&quot; (on the hill when you turn left after zoning in), and also partly was the fault of simple inexperience with doing a Fear raid.  Personally it was only my second time in the zone.  <br />
<br />
So I was wondering if anyone has suggestions on breaking into Fear.  Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Talonmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Breaking fear is one of those things that is best done with less, not more people.<br />
<br />
First, send in a monk / sk / Necro to FD at the portal and let you know when the portal area is relatively clear.  <br />
<br />
Once clear, 1 group zones in and runs for the west wall.  This group should all be invis (most mobs in the zone in area will see through it but you never know).  This group should have a wizard, chanter, cleric and 3 serious tank like MoFo's.<br />
<br />
They kill as many mobs as possible then port out when the inevitable train gets too big for the chanter to handle.  Hopefully they kill 5-10 mobs.  Rinse and repeat until the mobs in that area of the zone come in ones and twos rather than 5's and 10's.  <br />
<br />
After one or two cycles the second group should be able to come in.  Once again they come in invis and run to west wall.  HOWEVER if they get aggro on zone in they stay and die.  <br />
<br />
Before you know it you have a flawless Fear break.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Theres a 'bug' (yes, I know its not a bug, but its too absurd to be considered intentional) with FD'ing when the golems are up.  If you have agro on something and FD it off, *do not* get up without either killing that mob or /q'ing out.  The chain agro is insane in that zone.  You can almost guarantee that any mob that paths back near the middle of the zone will pass agro to the nearest golem and will DT you immediately.  When you do break in, remember that you need to bring your pulls or abort it completely with /q.<br />
<br />
But yah, that break in should be fine if your raid force is not ready to take about 12 mobs.  Having someone at the portal calling when its clear is the key no matter how you choose to do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gopx101</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If 30 people just zone into Fear expecting to survive---You will not, you WILL wipe.<br />
<br />
Biggest rule in fear breakin after the single group has cleared the path to safe spot is---If you get agro upon zoning in and going to safe spot, DO NOT train the camp, just die.  Someone will get your corpse and rez you.  If you see mobs on the way to the safe spot, you probably went the wrong way---STOP and ask for help.<br />
<br />
I Completely agree on break in single group tactics except for 1 thing.  If you have a high lvl Chanter and enough DPS from 3 or so melee, you shouldn't have to zone out and repeat the process.  We raided fear on the Tribulal two nights ago for a Shaman epic piece and 1 group had no problem clearing the way to the safe point.  <br />
<br />
At one point, the chanter had 7 mobs mezzed but the melee killed them fast enough before problems arose.  Once the path is clear, the raid leader should call the rest of the groups in one group at a time, fully inviz'd of course.  Each group waits until the entire previous group is at the hill.<br />
<br />
<br />
Golems go down in about a minute then the fun begins.  Every time I've done this, about 10-15 mobs suddenly show up in the golem camp and wreak havoc.  This is the time when you tell your clerics to camp and FD'ers to FD.  I've never found a good way to control these adds.<br />
<br />
Maybe having an additional group or two waiting at the bottom of the Golem hill to take these would help(But who has that many extra groups)--Not us....<br />
<br />
Done properly you should only get two DT's including the first one.<br />
<br />
IMPORTANT NOTE!!.  MAKE SURE the Shaman or whoever needs to loot something dropped from the golem or Iksar child has LOOT rights BEFORE the fight.  You will not be able to give rights after the mob is dead and everyone will most likely die shortly after the fight is over and may not be able to get back and loot.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Makkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Sending in fd-ers would be safer I guess, but not everyone has that many on a fear raid, and wanderers roam around the zoneine anyway.<br />
<br />
We usually send in 1 group, MT/cler/fd-ers (who pretty much all have good DPS anyway) - then when the get to wall we just start sending in one or two groups at a time; if you get aggro, usually you have to just stand there and die, depending on the size of the train. We usually have 4+ ench and enough clerics to split tank quite a few mobs anyway..<br />
<br />
I have cleaned up a few wiped fear raids solo on my necro; if people don't zone in and just wait, the ent clears up eventually. A lot of times 1 person can do what a group would wipe on.<br />
<br />
Here's a trick; start hammering alt+# where # is your fd slot - in my case alt-8 before you are fully logged in. EQ actually has you in the world before you can see/move etc - but using that kb shortcut will have you fd'd before you can do anything else. It's the same way that you die sometimes before you're able to move/see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">our necro usually just goes into fear to solo, so if the golems are up she knows clears most of it and send us a msg in /gu to let us know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shintou Shinai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">First Fear raid I ever led had a close to flawless break in, only two deaths.<br />
<br />
Had about 30 or so people, and I sent them in basically in two groups. Party one and two each had a bad ass enchanter, 3,4,5 were mostly Melee and extras, I guess.<br />
<br />
Bascially, its all about the Enchanters. I always send in two, maybe a third would be useful in a situation. If you can keep the Mobs Mezzed you can survive and break in nice and clean. Don't send everyone in at once, send them in one or two parties at a time so a huge mass isn't getting seen by the see invis mobs.<br />
<br />
Don't argo anything there, let THEM argo you. Let the Enchatners work their thing and follow the MT's targets, should be fine and flawless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>zruky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I just went to fear 2 days ago, and we didnt have any trouble.  I was one of only about 7 deaths later on in the raid, because i volunteered to take the opening DT's from Fright and Dread.<br />
<br />
What worked for us is we sent in one of our 61 necros to break the zone.  He solo'd for about 3 hours, and cleared the west camp no problem.  Smoothest fear break ever, many said.  No mobs, no deaths, no problems.  There's a guide on some site for necros 53+ being able to solo fear a bit, when i find it, I'll link it for help.<br />
<br />
P.s.  We only had 21 people for the raid, took down all the Golems (including enraged golem), Wraith of Shissar, and two trains consisting of the entire temple.  We did Dread with 18 people.<br />
<br />
BTW... Won the Soul Leech my first time in fear as one of 3 sks.  Cant even start me epic for 2 lvls, and the chick who rolled 2nd highest just needs that piece to finish up.  Damn, i'm lucky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sapper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You lucky little bastage - lvl 63 SK on A Ro been trying to finish that damn quest forever - all i need to to finish the epic is that dorp and I know that if someone not of lvl to even start the quest took that away from me on a fear raid i would be one pissed person.  I am in no way saying she is better than you nor anything of the sort.  All I am saying is I think you should have passed.  Maybe once you start the epic and that drop you have sits in the bank for a year while you chase your hide and blade of abogation you will understand her frustration.  Do i think im better than another SK that is on a fear raid?  nope - however if they just need that to finish i think that speaks for itself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>yuggoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Easiest Fear break I ever saw was the time we zoned in about 45 minutes after a server reset... and the zone was empty ;P  We got everyone in camp, then asked a GM to pop the zone... was way cool.  Of course, having a 65 chanter along these days makes it pretty trivial.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>zruky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">hey sapper, I just rolled for shits and giggles.  not my fault i won, and thats what the /random function is for.  I could have let her loot, then wait my ass of trying to get another one like you, but i chose not to.  I won, fair and square, so quit your bitching.  At least she was a good sport about it.  Now all i gotta do is wade through all the punks sending me tells to MQ it for them...fucking slackers.  Anyways, I'm now one level away from being able to start the quest, and i've got all the stuff for the first couple parts of the quest.<br />
<br />
<br />
p.s. Yuggoth's break in &gt; our break in.  I agree, zoning in after a server reset and asking a GM to repop the zone would be damn cool.</div></div><hr />
