<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mehatesu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ive been researching a bit about both, I have a 52 Barn warrior, and a 45 SK Knight.  Both are fairly close in levels and I enjoy playing them both equaly as well..well, maybe not equally.  I like my SK for his spells, the FD mostly, and the invis and ability to thus far get aggro.. I also like my Barb for his skills and his ability to MT..Once we get cable internet up and running in our barracks while Im deployed to sunny Okinawa I want to devote my time to one or the other.. If you faced this same dilema which would you choose and why.  Ive noticed my warrior gets asked more frequently to group then my SK. :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dkhar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">So, basically you are mocking the SK class right... that was the point of this post ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ashrai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You'll probably get quite a few &quot;if you have to ask, then just play the Warrior&quot;. If you enjoy versatility, keep at your SK, trust me there will be some very rough patches but when you get up in levels you'll feel like a monster. Sure you won't be MTing like a Warrior will but the times you DO, you'll feel even better about it.<br />
<br />
When you get into your 50s you'll start to notice people preferring an SK over a Warrior since that's when a lot of the newer players start exping in PoP and the chanters will love your agro. My alt's a low 50's chanter and it's literally like walking on eggshells on tashes and slows with a Warrior MA in pickup groups. <br />
<br />
Once you get through your 50's, it's on to the 60s where you'll see power increases constantly. Also when your Warrior doesn't get a group he can't go off and solo. Your SK can. <br />
<br />
Neither of your toons has really &quot;come into its own&quot; yet so you may want to play them both up a bit more then make the decision. If you like the glory of MTing big mobs then maybe that's going to appeal to you more than the versatility of an SK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mehatesu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Uh 1..I wasnt mocking the Sk's...2. Thanks Ashrai, I think I will keep plugging away at my SK, I love the fact he can FD, and Invis..But, yeah, I also like the idea of being able to MT the big mobs.  I know my gear needs a big work up, but thats in the works..my cousin has about 500k plat and is quiting EQ and has hinted at dumping the loot on me.  Oh I cant wait..he he he...Anways, once again, thanks for the help.</div></div><hr />

Sk's can tank, solo, pull and like you said invis and fd :cool: Ive never seen much of a choice between the 2 classes to be honest ;). Ohh btw you come on an Sk board asking what class do we preffer  :confused:  Ummmm.. i think you should play a warrior. :D</div></div><hr />

(and the consensus seems to be it will only get worse with oow)<br />
<br />
<br />
I sort of see War / Enc / Clr  as the SoE devs &quot;darling&quot; classes.   SKs and Zerks fighting it out to be the ultimate gimp class.  And the rest somewhere in between the two extreemes.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Interesting story (at least interesting to me). Here is our &quot;normal&quot; ldon lineup...<br />
<br />
65 SK<br />
65 Paladin<br />
65 Beastlord<br />
65 Druid (once in a while a cleric here, friend swaps in either class)<br />
64 Ranger<br />
58 (almost 59 now) mage.<br />
<br />
We pretty much complete ldons in about 45 minutes with little threat, I pull and the pally tanks...unless I bring back 2, so we just split tank.<br />
<br />
Well, yesterday I overpromised too many people could join and had an extra warrior join the group and I removed myself so the group was<br />
<br />
65 Warrior<br />
65 Paladin<br />
65 Beastlord<br />
65 Cleric<br />
64 Ranger<br />
58 mage<br />
<br />
Guess what, they failed the mission (regular strength LDON, a collect I think). They could not get single pulls and said they commonly had 4 or 5 mobs in camp at one time. <br />
<br />
They said afterward they missed my ability to pull, my ability to self heal when  I was tanking, and my zefeers bite for some extra mana regeneration. <br />
<br />
Where am I going with this story? If all you want to do is tank, then absolutely make a warrior. If you want to be able to play multiple roles (tank, pull, etc.) keep playing your SK. True, your ability to mitigate damage is significantly less, but your value to the group may be better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">2 classes in that group (without you) can single pull LDoN's.  Had they been doing their jobs your story would be much different.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I have to agree with Brael someone didn't know what they were doing. If you want to see any end game content go with the warrior.  Soloing is stupid once you get in your 60's its too slow.  <br />
<br />
SK's are now pretty much a useless class in the end game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">true, they &quot;should&quot; have been able to pull. However, in our guild SKs are starting to get the reputation as pullers, even moreso then monks or bards.<br />
<br />
We are pre-elemental so we can tank also, but are seen as pullers and secondary tanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Eggborn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">SK:<br />
<br />
Very useful and fun with some normal struggles until 65.<br />
<br />
Soloing gets harder at 65 if you want to see the xp fly like it did in your 50's.  Not gonna happen.  It's either very slow kills with downtime inbetween, or lots of kills for little xp.  Personally, I fnd ldon grouping low xp as well, but the most fun.  I almost always make my own groups.  If you do easy missions, you dont even need much of a healer if any.  <br />
<br />
You definately have to carve a place out for yourself if you want to do anything on a raid.<br />
<br />
By the time you get to the elementals and above, you are mostly gonna be &quot;dps,&quot; but your dps is low.  I am hoping for a fix SOON!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>shaneez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Brael will have us fixed in no time. Go with SK!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Aye Definitely something wrong with someone in that group that failed. It shoud be very easy.<br />
<br />
My set-up for Normal 2 nights ago was:<br />
65 SK (me)<br />
65 RNG<br />
65 BST<br />
65 DRU<br />
65 MAG<br />
65 PAL<br />
<br />
(NOTE: no CLR here!)<br />
<br />
Guess what? Pal didn't EVEN have chance to TANK or pull.. I pull AND tank cuz of my mean-ass DS (82 with mage DS). I just TRAIN 3-5 (Pal usually takes 4th-5th ones) to me and I switch target non-stop after landing darkness-terror on each fast and switch to keep all mobs to myself. Oh yes, I told BST NOT to slow.. BST just blast off the bat instead of slowing that surely speed up killing time. My DS surely chewed those train down fast. We usually do 30 collection within 30 min time frame. We are NOT even EP or time geared. Some of us are VT geared. Yes, Pal there felt useless cuz his DS wasn't enuf to make a killing so he was put back in back-up tanking for excessive adds but his real usefulness is group heals. Mage loved to AE in that train. :) That is WHY I wished for AE taunt spell to make my train pull job easier instead having to switch target everytime. ;)<br />
<br />
I bet that warrior you mentioned got a train and he DIDN'T even switch target to keep aggro on him. He just picked one and stayed with it whole way (I notice that common tanks tend to do that) and adds went out to kill healers assuming that no one else bothered to take on adds. If pal got an add, sounds like he let other adds to healers. That's tanks' fault for not keeping mobs to themselves. I think that was the main problem. Just a simple strategy change then that group would do it easy. Strategy means alot in group settings. :)<br />
<br />
I did have various mix of classes in normal LDON group even very odd set-up and we do fine as long as tank+healer team-work do their job well.</div></div><hr />

IM only here for six months and were just now getting cable internet in our barracks for E-5 and above and I wanted to make the most of it.  We work 6 days a week 12-15 hour days and Id rather be able to get a quick group and not waste a bunch of time LFG.  I will probably go with the SK, his gear is decent, and my cousing just quit EQ, his 65 shaman time geared just wasnt cutting it for him, is giving me 200k..I may look into getting some ornate for my sk then who knows...<br />

To get an idea of what class you really want to play, evaluate your friends that you play with.  YOUR abilites alone should not dictate what you are able to do.<br />

LMAO.  I was going to reply in almost the same exact manner.<br />
<br />
I utterly laugh when fools say, &quot;Go re-roll a WAR&quot; as if it's very easy to get into the same position you were just prior to re-rolling as a different class.  Not to mention, of course, how frustrated your guild will be with all the loot that your class (in this case, SHD) has received up to date.<br />
<br />
It is NOT an easy thing to change classes.  If it was, I would have re-rolled a WAR as soon as they got their upgrades and SHD/PAL got jack shit.<br />

I've come to realize that the people who complain are the ones who love the class greatly.  They just hate to see what has been done to it out of thier control and hate to have all thier work and building of the character go to waste.</div></div><hr />

Amen to that.<br />
<br />
I was going on 15 months of straight EQ, grinding the shit out of my SK, and finally quit two weeks ago. It just got that bad with SKs in my guild pushing through GoD, I couldn't stand seeing all my hard work and time spent being laughed at.<br />
<br />
I will never endure the bitch that is grinding, flagging, gearing, AA'ing on another toon ever again. My SK got fucked, I got fucked.<br />
<br />
Back to the topic, play the warrior if you're looking to get into end game stuff. If not, then the SK will suit you well.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">As I've said 500,000 times before, being sufficient at our role is not enough.  We need to be desirable in a given niche.  The traditional and logical niche for SK's (along with paladins) is offtanking.  Can we offtank currently?  Yes.  Does that make us balanced?  No.  While we're sufficient for the job, we lack the tools to excell in our role.  Many SK's successfully fill a raid role, but it generally boils down to one reason: Our guilds cannot recruit enough of the classes that fill the role better.  <br />
<br />
I'll admit that's a bit of a narrow overview, but its sufficient to make my point without having to re-explain things I've covered innumerable times in the past.</div></div><hr />

SKs are a highly versitile, multi-functioned class, largely based on self sufficiency.  Can you tank?  descent, but not as well as other classes designed solely for it.  Can you pull?  yes, but not as well as classes designed solely for it.  can you do good DPS?  yes, but not as much as classes designed solely for it. <br />
<br />
see a trend?  WOW !!!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
I never asked to be the best at any one thing when I created my SK... I simply wanted the ability to do more than mash taunt and hit autoattack.  Maybe you should take a step back, evaluate what you really want to be, and reroll a class designed for that purpose.</div></div><hr />

that would make things fair right?  worth it for us to mitigate 3% more dmg with a stun or whatever?  <br />
<br />
yeah brilliant fucking idea.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not everything can be resolved via &quot;class balancing.&quot;  classes werent meant to be in perfect harmony.  Most classes were designed with a specific purpose.  Unfortunatly for YOU, yours wasn't.  deal with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">Whats an SK's primary role?<br />
Are SK's viable in their primary role at all levels of gameplay?<br />
<br />
The correct answers to those two questions are tanks and no.  There you go.  Btw Envoy class specialization isn't the way to balance EQ then you have situations like Clerics and Warriors (note, the 2 biggest problems in EQ) although Clerics are hardly specialists</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">Its easy to have the perspective when you're still primarily raiding PoP.  We rocked then, to the point of being overpowered.<br />
<br />
No one is asking to be the best or even equal.  We're wanting to be viable.  Continually get dropped in 1-2 rounds from GoD raid trash, watch the paladins and warriors tank it effortlessly, and come back with your opinion on how balanced we are.<br />
<br />
Can you tank?  no.  not the appropriate answer for a tank class.<br />
Can you pull? some of us can.<br />
Can you DPS?  no, nor should we.<br />

Ok, now list all 16 of those roles and how you can make encounters where its all required.  Now you get class specialization thats balanced.<br />

As much as I want to call you a fucking idiot for that comment, I'm going to refrain momentarily.  Name what other abilities we have that warrant us tanking worse than the other 2 tank classes.  The only thing theres a case for is tanking worse than Warriors and thats only because their class isn't blurred so they have to be better than the other 2 tanks by alot (hi balance problem).  If you say our DPS means we should tank worse, do Paladins take a tanking hit because they can cast Root, low level lulls, or Brells?  No.  Thats what our DPS is equilavent to.  Our pulling isn't so insanely powerful it's bardlike, so thats not an excuse to tank worse than Paladins.  So what are these amazing other special abilities that we've been granted that warrant us tanking worse, I'm waiting to hear them.</div></div><hr />

I highly doubt it's designed for SK's to be the 3rd best tanks seeing as how we weren't up until oh... the first day of PoP, and not by a big enough margin to be worth complaining about until the first day of GoD.<br />
<br />
can a pally or warrior pull at all..? really? (granted some SKs suck at pulling too..)<br />
Paladins pull fine so do Warriors, last I checked those 2 classes can make as races which get sneak as well.  Hi natural pulling skill.  All pulling is, is controlled training of mobs to a camp anyone can do that.  Lull/sneak make that easier, FD is an escape tool for when you screw up and deserve to have died.  My guilds done a few raids where I'm being lazy and a War or Pal pulls really pulling isn't anything special until you get to something specifically designed to be split with FD/FM (which most exp camps aren't, infact if you're FD pulling in an exp group your group should kick you for slowing them down).<br />
<br />
or dot kite a mob with a pet..?<br />
You can't be serious about kiting a mob with a level 41 pet whacking it behind us as factoring into our raid/higher end group balance... I'm not even responding to that.<br />
<br />
or solo even remotely effeciently past lvl 60 mobs..?<br />
My guilds Warriors outsolo me in HoH I've competed with them before, they can sustain a higher kill rate/hour.  Since you bring up soloing post 60, thats a place people solo it's perfectly valid.  Also, last I checked casters didn't have a limit placed on their power by their soloing abilities.</div></div><hr />

SK's will Never achieve any form of balance if we focus on pulling. There are 6 other classes that are situationally better pullers than SK's. We'll never gain enough utility through pulling when 6 other classes can already perform that task adequately...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Merf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">As I've said 500,000 times before, being sufficient at our role is not enough.  We need to be desirable in a given niche.  The traditional and logical niche for SK's (along with paladins) is offtanking.  Can we offtank currently?  Yes.  Does that make us balanced?  No.  While we're sufficient for the job, we lack the tools to excell in our role.  Many SK's successfully fill a raid role, but it generally boils down to one reason: Our guilds cannot recruit enough of the classes that fill the role better.  <br />
<br />
I'll admit that's a bit of a narrow overview, but its sufficient to make my point without having to re-explain things I've covered innumerable times in the past.<br />
<br />
So here are the things that SK's can do from a raid perspective:<br />
<br />
1.  Offtank.<br />
<br />
2.  Pull.<br />
<br />
3.  Scout.<br />
<br />
4.  Survive raid wipes to help recover.<br />
<br />
5.  Summon corpses to help raids recover.<br />
<br />
6.  Lock aggro on a trained or otherwise loose (MA is daid...) mob virtually instantly to improve the porters chance to get off a succor or the clerics to camp.<br />
<br />
Here is what a Warrior can do:<br />
<br />
1.  tank just about anything with the appropriate support.<br />
<br />
Pick your poison.<br />
<br />
Yes, there is a character class that can do virtually everything the SK can do and frequently a little bit better.<br />
<br />
No, there is no other character class that combines all of the things an SK can do.<br />
<br />
You could have the same arguments about playing a Cleric or a Druid.  A Druid cannot function well as a main healer in the raid under the most trying circumstances.<br />
<br />
That doesn't stop Druids from being a blast to play and very effective in the endgame as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, I don't know what it's like on your server.  On Bertoxxolous versatility is back in vogue because you're so likely to be short classes on various raids.<br />
<br />
As to surviving the higher level content in GoD, that really comes down to HP, AC, BoV and defensive with the first two required and either of the second two also needed.  Boss mobs require both defensive and BoV.<br />
<br />
So what?<br />
<br />
To suggest that Sk's should be able tank ALL content effectively requires one of two essential shifts in the current paradigm:<br />
<br />
1.  Warriors become useless because they are just SK's minus the spells.<br />
<br />
2.  All high level content becomes a pushover for Warriors to tank because it has been nerfed to the point that any Plate melee can tank it.<br />
<br />
Neither of those shifts would be good for the game at this point.<br />
<br />
So SK's need to deal with the fact that there are a handful of mobs in the higher zones that they cannot effectively tank, and Warriors will continue to deal with the fact that as soon as the crowd around them is gone they are useless.<br />
<br />
That's the trade-off.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually #4 was kind of along the lines of: FD until aggro is cleared, drag the Mage's corpse to the Cleric, and begin the process of restarting the raid in place.  Of course if the Mage fell through the world at death and didn't land -10,000 feet below you, it's awfully handy to be able to summon his corpse for the Cleric as opposed to waiting for the nearly extinct customer service rep...<br />
<br />
As opposed to the Warrior's option of lying there dead, pondering his GY recovery and rez.<br />
<br />
Raids do not normally end on wipes unless the only melees present are incapable of contributing to a recovery.<br />
<br />
Lemme see, the scouting Warrior...  Well, that sounds like 5 mobs incoming to me or of course if he's lucky an SK might be there to summon corpse.<br />
<br />
A Warrior pulling...  Well might get a little bit luckier there, that'd only be 3 mobs incoming on a good pull.  Unless of course you meant the Warrior tagging off of a Monk or SK pull, which can't really be called pulling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">Isn't a normal raid pull three or more mobs these days anyway?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
This has been addressed in a dozen different ways in the class balance forum.  See specifics there.  No one has asked to be on the level of warriors.<br />
<br />
Its not a handful of mobs.  Its virtually everything in GoD raid zones.  The gap is absolutely huge between SKs and the other two tank classes.  This too has been run into the ground in the past couple months.  I'll just say that after seeing first hand how SKs perform as tanks in contrast to the other two classes on even trivial content like Ikki raids, I don't see how anyone can think there isnt a huge problem.<br />
<br />
Fact remains that our primary role is tank.  Tank class ... we tank stuff.  Everything else is secondary to that and thus should not be a factor in determining if we should have the tools to perform our primary role.  I don't want to hear another word about FD, snare, summon corpse, etc while discussing the ability to pick up raid trash and live long enough to be healed.<br />
<br />
If someone can tell me I'm undergeared for the content, I'll accept that Im the problem and not the class.</div></div><hr />

<br />
pallies sure can mitigate tons of that dmg with .5 sec stuns...<br />
realistically, the gap between pallies and SKs tanking wise was very much closed up when the stacking issues of our cloak line was resolved.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">1. Offtank. <br />
<br />
That's the one that counts.<br />
<br />
2. Pull. <br />
<br />
Highly secondary.  Sure we can do it, but so can almost any class if the player behind it is good.  We're exceeded by monks and bards on the specialty pulls anyway.  Our pulling ability is more or less akin to pally buffs, roots, group heals, etc. - not tanking.  <br />
<br />
3. Scout. <br />
<br />
Not really any more than anyone else.  Any important scouting will be done by a rogue - they're the only ones with the tools to excell at that.  Our only advantage over the other classes is that we have a get out of jail free card for if we fuck up in one of the few instances where scouting is both important and doable by something short of a rogue (or at least a halfling - innate sneak).  <br />
<br />
4. Survive raid wipes to help recover. <br />
<br />
So we can survive a raid wipe (maybe - chances are we got 1-2 rounded trying to get FD off though) - whoopty friggin do, it's not like we can really add anything to the recovery process.  This is the realm of the necro - they have rez and mana-free corpse summon, we have... nothing special.  <br />
<br />
5. Summon corpses to help raids recover. <br />
<br />
Yeah, that really constitutes a raid role.  &quot;Lets bring along an SK so that if we fuck up and die, he can summon our corpses!&quot;  &quot;Wait, necros can do that too, and they can do it mana-free, and there are graveyards in alot of zones, and rogues can drag corpses.  Oh well.&quot;<br />
<br />
6. Lock aggro on a trained or otherwise loose (MA is daid...) mob virtually instantly to improve the porters chance to get off a succor or the clerics to camp. <br />
<br />
We don't have a melee immunity discipline - warriors, along with all of the DPS melees are superior to us at this.  Even pallys are better than us for anything stunnable.  The ability to lock aggro means jack shit when you die two seconds later.  <br />
<br />
Here is what a Warrior can do:<br />
<br />
1. tank just about anything with the appropriate support. <br />
<br />
And out-damage SK's if not tanking.  <br />
<br />
pallies sure can mitigate tons of that dmg with .5 sec stuns...<br />
realistically, the gap between pallies and SKs tanking wise was very much closed up when the stacking issues of our cloak line was resolved. <br />
<br />
Not entirely, and it's going to be flung wide open (further than ever) with the OoW stuns.  Pally stuns are a serious problem that needs to be addressed.</div></div><hr />

If you don't like the fact the SKs can't tank high-end content as well as the Warriors or Paladins, then theres nothing you can do about it by crying like a 2-year old girl here. <br />

Warriors made out pretty well with all their bitching.</div></div><hr />

super duper uber pet that quads for 100s? hi necro.<br />
<br />
Late? Yes, but I thought I might aswell point out that we are part necro and part warrior, why shouldnt we have that? I havrdly ever bring out my pet unless I'm soloing, Jebartick01 sucks balls in groups, especially when I'm asked to pull. I think a mini defensive disc would be a great &quot;utility&quot;, since we are a &quot;utility&quot; class.<br />

Added DPS, almost guaranteed single pulls unless your XP spot is somewhere in KT and even then Goner can pull for ya if hes buffed.~<br />

Oh.. and @ Vincente:<br />
Bye, hf in WoW~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u92"><b>Crimson Tears</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p92">I read a post by Crimson in the TSW outhouse about a raid gone bad. Warriors went down, the 4 SK's stepped up and died immediately, and the raid was then saved by 3 rangers who held until a warrior was hot rezzed. Crimson pointed out heavy tanks &gt; lightanks &gt; medium tanks doesn't make sense, and rangers are a DPS class anyway.<br />

And I thought I was the only one who  my explanation made sense to.   :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

That we give up on tanking anything over a blue con and that we as SoE for more utility.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have no idea what TSW suggests as an alternative.<br />
<br />
This is my short list:<br />
<br />
1. Make FD goddamn work ALL the time if you get it off and the spell does not fail.  I am so pissed off at the FD's that work and are then erased by a spell landing.  Total bullshit.  And it makes FD useless against a multi-caster pull most of the time.<br />
<br />
2.  We should have an AA that gives Gather Shadows and Improved Invisibility vs Undead the SoS effect for live and undead respectively.  Rogues would still outscout us because SoS covers both in one, not to mention sneak/hide has no timer.<br />
<br />
The tanking is not going to be up to par with Warriors regardless of what we do.  What would be useful would be for some of our abilities that are broken (like the FD caster thing) were fixed and if some of them that work okay (like Invis) were enhanced to become more valuable without completely stepping on another classes toes.<br />
<br />
I have a 65 Rogue and I would not mind at all if SK's abilities to scout were somewhat improved.<br />
<br />
If you have Warrior envy you're screwed because the only way to get over that is to make a Warrior.</div></div><hr />
