<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nixpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">While playing with my magelo profile I stumbled over the HoT quest items.<br />
<br />
I quit EQ just before my guild back then hit HoT and returned 2 months before PoP was released. Thus Ive never tried to fight Doze and didnt think of the quests till now.<br />
<br />
Have any of you guys tried doze lately and if so how many did you need to take him out? <br />
<br />
The group Id be trying Dozekar with consist of me, rog, nec, cle, shm and bard all lvl 65. Gearwise I guess Im the best equipped of the group (not that it says alot ehe) but the rest are not that far behind.<br />
<br />
Ive looked at Alakalala... and someone claimed to have 3 boxed him. Guess thats possible with Time gear but my friends and I are not exactly time geared.<br />
<br />
Any help, tips and tricks are most appriciated :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mathas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">That group should be fine.  It's a long enough fight that the necro and shaman will shine with their dots, especially if the bard has Call of the Muse.  Between HoS and Malos(inia), it shouldn't be too hard to get slow to stick... and from there, he's easy.<br />
<br />
Just make sure you, and as many people as possible, have an insta-click buff in the first slot.  If I remember right, his ae has a single-buff dispell component.</div></div><hr />
