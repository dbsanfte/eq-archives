However I couldn't get Luclin to run properly with this card so I went out and bought a GeForce Card for $129. and I ran fine for couple years until I built a new PC.<br />
<br />
To my suprise there are still people trying to make that Voodoo 3 card I gave up on during Luclin work in GoD.  For years they have put up with bad performance trying to make an obsolete card work.<br />

<br />
You can build an excellent system (http://anandtech.com/guides/showdoc.html?i=2001) that will handle just about anything you want, kicking the crap out of any Dell, for $505 - and that's including a $95 copy of windows which you might not need ;)  Anyone can put together the 5 parts and give themselves a better, cheaper system.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Wienaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Ah yes, I forgot, the thousand dollars I figure I have spent on this game over the last four years really doesn't mean anything except that I've put more into this game already than any other I have ever played.  This company originally, so far as I knew, planned to have EQ2 out by now, as I saw it, I figured I would continue playing Everquest happily as one of the few who couldn't upgrade to the new GAMES, not those that couldn't play anything because I couldn't upgrade to what I'm currently playing.  I think the thing that frustrates me the most was the fact that they KNEW they were fooling a lot of people (I wasn't fooled, because I had a few problems with GoD and talked to a tech about it right after it came out)  evidenced by the fact that less than a week before they release this new graphics engine they start trying to get people to buy a year's subscription.  They took quite a few people by the balls and drug them around, getting them to subscribe for a year only to tell them that, o, well we have your money, too bad, upgrade your computer or let your acct sit dormant.  The discounted one year subscription had timing that was way too fishy, and they have already had people post on Tech Support forums that I saw before it got deleted saying they were going to sue if it didn't get fixed.  Me? I'm just a bit pissed off, I know more than likely nothing will ever come of it, but that doesn't keep me from thinking this whole situation is bullshit</div></div><hr />

they are a company that exists only to make money.  They do not care if you have fun as long as you give more money.  Buyer beware, STFU.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Why even post here?  Twenty years back there was no internet (well, a rudimentarty one) and you had to buy the technology that allowed you to view &amp; use it.  Which must have pissed you off tremendously as well...  Seriously man why not just move to Amish (Omish?) country.  You can shoe horses and such, at least you'll have no internet boards to whine to when a 100 year old shoe wears down &amp; needs to be replaced.<br />
<br />
Sorry to be so harsh, I know it must be frustrating to not be able to log in - but that's nobody's fault but your own, TBH.  Get a shitty console system if you don't have or want to have the most rudimentary knowledge of computers.<br />
<br />
Edit: You'd be hard pressed to find someone that hates Sony/SOE as much as I do.  Even I can't blame them for keeping their game up to date though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
BTW Sony said as much as 3-4 months back that the move to dx9 would prevent a small number of people from playing EQ and they struck a deal to provide a discount on certain cards from a certain company (the prices even post-discount sucked though, www.newegg.com has better prices and awesome customer service to boot).<br />
<br />
Why can't you play anyway?  Just low framerates, or you can't log in at all?  You DID install dx9 (www.microsoft.com), right?  Sony only nagged us all to death about it, but I know people who had no idea regardless, just proves the old adage &quot;half of all people are of below average intelligence&quot;...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Wienaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Intel integrated chipsets can't be replaced, they are part of the motherboard...when I log in, all I have is the normal UI with a grey screen, and I crash out every five minutes.  It would be barely possible for me to play, at least a little, if I didn't crash every five minutes on top of everything else.  SoE, after I pumped all the cash into them I have, is requiring that I buy a new computer for a game that in 3-6 mos probably will stop even getting patched but infrequently, whether they admit it or not (EQ2 is gonna be their new baby, and anyone who can move on to it and don't go to WoW will be there within a few months)  With this patch they effectively make EQ DoA in 3-6 mos, whereas before they could have kept a game around for the Intel chipsets and not lost the business of thousands of customers (and yes it is thousands, SoE themselves admit that over 1 pct of their customer base uses Intel cards, 1 pct of 400,000=2000 people, tho I can almost guarantee there are more)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Edit: Don't just buy a $10 pci graphics card, Sony should foot that bill for you.  Actually they should know what you use and send you one free of cost without you even asking :rolleyes:  They should pay your parents' mortgage too.  If you don't know how to disable onboard graphics and can't figure it out (or, as in your case, won't, as whining like a baby is a much better course of action, right?) you have no business using a computer anyway.  I have a friend whose IQ drops by at least 75 points when he gets within 5 feet of a computer and even he managed to do that.</div></div><hr />

EQ1 is getting a facelift, yeah.  New &amp; more efficient engine, phase 1 of which was implemented yesterday.  Requires dx9 and a graphics card/chipset that wasn't made 10 years ago...</div></div><hr />

EQ is a COMPUTER GAME....not a fucking console game.<br />
<br />
The big part of computer games is often, expansions require increased systme requirements....so if you are part of a constatnly expanded/updeated game (like....EQ!)...you are going to have to upgrade sooner or later.<br />
<br />
If you don't know how to tinker with the innards of a PC...LEARN IT!  That way you can upgrade your system with little trouble if any, and possibly save some money as opposed to buying a new dell every 2-3years.<br />
<br />
I try to anticipate upgrades.  I put aside about $20 a month aside for internal hardware upgrades...like motherboard, cpu, ram, vidcard...  $20/mo is not hard to pull off...shit people pay more than that just to see late night tittes on pay-per-view.</div></div><hr />

I have done tech support for the past 5 years for an outsourcing company.  NO I AM NOT IN INDIA.  I am in illinois where we speak the american version of the english language.  I dont really know what the fuck they are trying to speak sometimes.  Anyhow back to the subject.  On one of my accounts I support Nvidia based GPUs.  I am constantly having to listen to people like you who just got their shiny new video board amagigger from the 24 hour walmart at 3 oclock in the fucking morning.  These people like to go on for 20 minutes about how we are a shitty company because he couldnt get his new PCI5200 256 MB video card to install.  Then they tell you about their dog and how their emachines is such a great computer and how he upgraded his memory all by himself so he knows what hes doing with these things.  I stupidly ask if they botherd to disable the onboard v/c?  And they always say well someone should have told me to do that.  You tell them that is the first thing in the install guide but they just say oh I didnt know what they meant by that so I skipped it.  So you walk them through the whole process and they restart to a black screen.  Then you realize you are becoming ifected with retardation from this customer and somehow thought they would be intelligent enouph to plug the fucking monitor into the new card.  Anyway to anyone in this forum &quot;I am presently only aware of one&quot; that is one of these customers, read a fucking book.  Go to school.  Read the news.  Try and fix something yourself first before calling me.  I am not your personal therapist I am a darwinist.  I personally think you should not be allowed to survive, and without government intervention and humanitarian aid you would not survive.  So dont bother me with your problems because I, fortunately, was blessed with a decent line of genes as well as enouph mental fortitude to be a self sufficient person who is more than capable of simple functions.  This is not something to be proud of mind you.  This is a requirement for life on earth.  Unfortunately the loop-hole known as human compassion lets you survive.  <br />

I only watched star treck enouph growing up to know that if Spock were in charge, you would be fed to the livestock.<br />

LEARN about what it is you need to do and then follow up with actually doin it. Research is very easy to do on the internet. I am not a search nazi but I bet you could search for a new video card for under $100, then search to figure out how to disable your integrated video (NEVER BUY INTEGRATED VIDEO unless you are playing duck hunt) and I bet with all the focus you put into bitching you might even be able to figure out how to install the new card you should have bought 3yrs ago. <br />
