hehe, wonder what was the problem with the way it was? <br />
<br />
Why change what worked, right?<br />
<br />
but obviously it didn't work (I think) or else they wouldn't have changed it (I hope)<br />
<br />
This is awful.... Usually I stay all day here, reading crap, and today I been avoiding the place, it's an eyesore... I am so not good with change. Change=bad......... I am one of those people who shrivel up and die when something changes =o)</div></div><hr />

It is Chayda.<br />
<br />
When I changed servers, they forced me to change names.<br />
<br />
<br />
And I don't feel like changing it =o)</div></div><hr />

It looks much better today than it did yesterday. <br />
<br />
I am getting used to all the little quirks, like the PM box being different. <br />
<br />
renaming everything so the templates match up is a pain in the ass, suprised it went as quick as it did.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: I am a registered user! So personal, I feel loved!<br />
=o) I liked member better... or what was I...... hmmm.... yeah I was a member, probably, I don't contribute, but I wanna belong damnit!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Rothund</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">So it is Chayda or it was Chayda?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Hopefully it's currently Chayde, cause that definately sounds better... If it's Chayda, you just spoiled my fa... oops?  Did I let that out?   :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Chayde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Okay, sorry this name thing was even noticed... heh.<br />
<br />
What happened was, when I changed servers, they added an X to the back of my name, so it became Chaydex. Which was okay, until the guild decided it looked like &quot;Tampex, Kotex...&quot;(I know I am fueling your fire here, but let me finish before you dig into me...) So, I giggled along with them, because it sure was funny as hell, then, the bright guild leader (/snicker) put up the public note of &quot;Bloody good&quot; Even though this was hillarious I decided to change her name, after all, when there is an X behind your name, you get a free name change. <br />
<br />
And with the cleric named Delyla, being changed to Delylax, the guild had a field day talking about how it looked like exlax, and the guild leader put the public note as &quot;over night relief&quot;  LOL LOL!<br />
<br />
So, I put in the petition, and never got a response for a whole day, and logged off...  The next day had to repetition, and this time I had work to go to, so I placed up my 64 cleric with an AFK message. &quot;Please change this name First to last choices are:  Dremei, Tannah, Tamara (cleric) and Chaydex if you can to Chaydee, Chayden, Shayde, Shaydee, Chayda, Chaide, Sheyd &quot;... <br />
<br />
<br />
It wasn't my first choice.   <br />
And, I still refer to her as Chayde, 'cause I just liked that name.<br />
Don't know why they couldn't get me Chayde, I never see anyone with that name on.<br />
<br />
<br />
Laugh away, it's what I'm here for...<br />
<br />
LOL</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I also have Chayed that I made when I first started on the Brell server, but when Chayde actually got moved over, I stopped playing her. I  also have Chaye which all of these are SKs because I didn't like Chaydex... <br />
<br />
At least it isn't PortaPotty like some one has on the BS server.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Doesn't it mean the same thing? <br />
Chaym sounds just so much more like a female name than Bukkake does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Derraj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">well came on me and bukkake on me are abit different I think, I think came on me means one person and bukkake means acoule a guys... not sure though, need some confirmation plz</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Zero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Bukkake actually in its original form means &quot;splash&quot; in a non-nasty way, as in Fresh bukkake soup! Yes, there is an actual dish called bukkake soup.<br />
<br />
But yes, for the average citizen, Bukkake = many men chayming.<br />
<br />
But I suppose Chaym Onme could mean anything.<br />
<br />
Elephant Chaymedonme would be a good name.<br />
<br />
And dye all your armor white. (actually the closest eq lets you get, that lame grey color)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well I find that her black lace ones are the nicest - comfortable and sexy, while the material breathes. :p <br />
<br />
So Chayde your Mom buys them for you? Looks like I have to meet her. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Chayde's mom = MILF?</div></div><hr />

Maybe, maybe not.<br />
<br />
Just interested in her selection criteria for Chayde's panties :p</div></div><hr />
