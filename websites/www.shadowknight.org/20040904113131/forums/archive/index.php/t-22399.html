There are some spoilers in there, but I read am anyway cause I don't mind knowing the hair-thin plot, hell, it gives me more time to check out the effects.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>EQ=TehDev1l! is BAD</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">that was the single worst movie EVER, it had about 5 minutes of plot-talk, and everything else was special effects and like half-wit battle scenes.<br />
<br />
and the ending has to be the worst ending ever, a aborted fetus could have thought up a better ending/plot/movie</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">An aborted fetus is also quite a few steps up the ladder from what you are, so fuckoff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>EQ=TehDev1l! is BAD</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">hey naelan, knock knock</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm curious... who's there?<br />

(This time, lets try and spell more than 75% of your message properly too, just for fun!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rukgut</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">From what people have told me, the choppy fight scenes were very distracting.  Hopefully AVP2 will learn from the mistakes made in the first one.  Sure the dialogue might have been weak, but who goes to AVP for the witty banter?   :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>EQ=TehDev1l! is BAD</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">go fuck yourself</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Goddamit, you made me post three times in this fucking thread for &quot;go fuck yourself&quot;. You really are a useless sack of shit. I wish AIDS upon you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>vilesoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">this thread makes me wish i had 8 more hands, so i could give it 10 thumbs down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>EQ=TehDev1l! is BAD</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">from one of my friends who i saw it with:<br />
 &quot;it was so bad that i would rather lick the asphault in front of the movie theater for 1hour 27 minutes than c it&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;the concept of this movie was drawn on the backside of a denny's mat with a crayon set&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;this movie is so unbelievably bad i would rather poke my eyes out with singing hot pokers than see it again&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;that movie was so absolutley atrocious, they should pay u to see it&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;i want to kill myself for paying 9.50 to see that garbage&quot;<br />
<br />
so after deciding that movie was nowhere neer worth our while we decided to go to customer service and get out money back, it wasnt open so we came back saturday and ranted about how terrible that movie was and suggesting it to be a crime against nature, they finnaly gave us free movie passes, so we went and saw napoleon dynamite which was funny as hell........yet we still felt ripped off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>BRÆDOWN™</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">your such a cheap bastard irl</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>BRÆDOWN™</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">in real life you sad fuck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>derakolwtf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">napolean dynamite funny? the preview for that made me swear i would commit suicide before willfully watching it...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Dark Lord John Denver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Napolean Dynamite was the best movie of the summer and Aliens vs. Predator was pretty much the worst movie ever made in the history of all time. Anyone who likes this movie is seriously a fucking retarded freak. It was so bad, the ending literally gave me diarhea. Seriously. I'm literally serious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Darkalen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Manos - Hand of fate<br />
<br />
Worst Movie Ever.<br />
<br />
But now I have no reason to see something that may come close.  At least I saw Manos on MST3K so it was funny.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>nezzka is bad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">avp  :( <br />

But most threads make me wish that, really.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, 'Manos - Hand of Fate' was definitely the worst movie in all of history.  And the MST3K episode about it was funny as hell.</div></div><hr />
