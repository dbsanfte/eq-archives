<br />
If so, I would like to request the &quot;Warriors stole my mojo&quot; be moved as it has long past the point of being about most anything belonging in the armory.<br />
<br />
Thank you,</div></div><hr />

<br />
It isn't in the wrong area.  You just want to flame it as if it were in the Flame On section.<br />
<br />
Start your own thread and flame away.....Wait you have already done that 3 times......<br />
<br />
My thread is a discussion on equipment.  Sure it got sidetracked when we started talking about the relative uses of a fungi tunic but it is primarily a thread on equipment and specifically how tanking down with a fungi and staying lower level has advantages.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Savoline</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">your thread stopped being about equipment on page 2.<br />
<br />
since then it has been how you are right and everyone else, SKs with 10 times your experience and probably IQ too, being wrong.<br />
<br />
IMO all of that thread should get moved here + your posting rights should be restricted to this sub forum as well, because you are far too dangerous to be given free speech on this board.</div></div><hr />

Its your stone-wall stance that you're taking on the issue that has made it break 1k in replies.</div></div><hr />

I admire your honesty.<br />

If I was totally wrong I would be harmless.<br />

Maybe once he realizes post count in the flame section means squat, and it won't help his standing, and that if one of the mods notices he is only posting to up post count, they will lower his numbers to newbie status, that maybe, just maybe, he will stop doing childish stuff like that.<br />

<br />
He's already gotten over 400 posts in his own thread in the armory alone by putting up to 5 replies in a row, bucause he can't figure out how to reply to and  quote from multiples posts in a single post.   <br />
<br />
That and even your assumption over-estimated his cognative ability.<br />

The only way he could get less respect would be if he was born on x-mas eve, then everyone would claim that their presents were for both x-mas and his birthday but it would still just be a used gum wrapper.</div></div><hr />
