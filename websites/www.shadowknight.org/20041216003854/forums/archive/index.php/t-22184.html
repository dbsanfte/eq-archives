<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Any tips on the fastest way to raise ring of scale faction?  AOE in castle mistmoore?  Or kill Venril Sathir?  Or ?<br />
<br />
-Bolas</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Envoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">get a wizard or cleric friend to AE with you... you go and pull every damn mob in mistmoore, then pull them to the wizard or cleric, and they AE it dead.<br />
<br />
will take days of doing this, and the faction hits are pretty small, but its the only real feasable way to raise RoS faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Here's my thoughts.  You can kill 4000 mobs to raise faction 4000 points... or you can kill 8 big mobs that each give 500 point faction hits.  I'm wondering if Venril Sathir is a big mob that gives a faction hit larger than 1 point.  Same with the bards like Travis Two-Tone and so on.  AOE in Mistmoore quicker in terms of hours spent?  Or 8 Venril Sathir kills quicker?<br />
<br />
For Claws of Veeshan faction, killing the Avatar of War is a HUGE faction hit and is MUCH faster than killing individual giants.<br />
<br />
But with Mistmoore right there, and the ability to pull HUGE trains... it does sound fun to try to aoe it down with like-minded people interested in faction with ring of scale.  Maybe I'll give that a shot first, for kicks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ravenar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The only bad thing I think you will see here is that Sony has made MM a good XP zones for low levels.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Chania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The King in Kaladim used to give a HUGE RoS faction boost, I killed him 3-4 times back in the day and maxed RoS. Unfortunately, this has been nerfed, and now AE MM seems to be the best bet :( My conundrum is that I would like to fix my VS faction without destroying RoS, doesn't seem feasible tho :(</div></div><hr />

  There used to be greenie elfs in VP (don't know post revamp), can kill brood dragons as well as do the Sarnak Bezerker whip quest in OT(will need to pull/charm turn in mob till not kos)</div></div><hr />

I like the idea of killing bards in High Keep, I&quot;ll have to do that some.  Bards are almost as much fun to kill as paladins.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Zero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">There is a mob where you can afk and let your pet kill him after he engages you for constant +RoS hits. Took me 15 cumulative hours of afk time to go from scowling-ally. PM me for name/zone.<br />
<br />
(Its green, hits for 40, 1000hp, pet kills it before I lose 1%)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I killed King Kazom Stormhammer a dozen times -- no noticeable change in RoS faction.  Looks like that was indeed nerfed.<br />
<br />
I know of two or three mobs that are green con and 12 min or so spawns -- various bards -- that give RoS faction hits.  I'll send ya a PM to see which one you have in mind.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>kharan_zechts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Aeing in mistmoore is really the only way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Astrakan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Dumb question, but assuming you pull the huge trains, and the wizard AoEs<br />
away, will you actually receive a faction hit for just pulling them?  Or would<br />
you still need to hit each one, once, with something.<br />
<br />
As far as I can tell, just them whacking you, with or without DS, will not<br />
give you a faction hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">wizard?<br />
<br />
I usually use regal band of bathezid, kilva's skin of flame, reflective orb of energy, talisman of vah kerrath, and intense hatred, pull the train on myself, and hit wave of enfeeblement, then follow it up with word of spirit, and curse at sony for not giving us the continuation of the word of spirit line that necros have.  If only I had coral hilted tulwar...  84 ds self-buffed, 2k+ ac = you can solo aoe mistmoore.  Easier with a weapon that procs aoe I'd guess.<br />
<br />
Seriously though... the one time I've partnered with a magician, they used bangle of disease warding and click it on me so that any faction hit that I took (from stuff dying on the way in to damage shield -- 107 ds with mage spell hehe) they get also.  The reverse would also be true -- if you partner with a wizard, buff them with something so that you get the same faction hits as they do.  Click your bangle on them as they aoe to make sure that you get all faction hits.  Or do your wave of enfeeblement spell to make sure you're on all the aggro lists.<br />

<br />
South Karana, at the fountain thing, Vhalen Nostrolo, green con bard, 1000hp, hits for 50's or something. 6 minute repsawn, go see where he spawns and just stand right on top of him. I out regen'd the damage he did to me by far in the time it took for next respawn. I dont recommend doing this without at least level 55 though.<br />
<br />
Took me 150~ roughly kills. (15 hours) to go from scowling to ally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">there's also dimlore stormhammer in the minotaur caves. haven't tried it but i'm pretty sure you could afk there at 64 with pet up safely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I tried Dimlore Stormhammer.  He didn't work at level 65.  Why?  He was TOO GREEN and wouldn't aggro a level 65, even if you were KOS.  He's too scared to attack someone that much higher level.<br />

-Bolas</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Airamwu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Thanks for the info Zero.   After 15 hours with roughly 150 kills I am now ally to ring of scale ;)  Very easy compared to the long hours i was dreading doing inside castle mistmoore.  By the way aside from giving + faction to ros he also gives + faction to mistmoore.  When word gets out this will probably be nerfed just like the dagger faction quest in kunark for greenmist.   <br />
<br />
<br />
PS I found myself with warmly faction against the bard so i had to kill him a few times so i would be kos.  Also, if you find someone in the camp you can still get faction by casting something on the player ie DS/buff/see invis.   I had a fellow sk configure his macro keys to spam me with clicky ds using his gamepad while he was afk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Spam you with clicky ds?  What item has right click damage shield that can be cast on other players?  Gauntlets of Burning Embers is the only one I know of, is there another?<br />

<br />
Too lazy to look it up right now, but Ragefire drops some arms, with a tiny mage DS/fire resist on them. Castable on others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Valdeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">For those planning to do bards I just finished max ally and here's how it timed out for me (from max kos).<br />

12 kills to get kos to Vhalen Nostrolo.  28 hours was not max and at 35 hours it was so somewhere in that range.</div></div><hr />

<br />
from max KOS ring of Scale to Max ally ring of scale...took me between 30 and 40 hours of afk pet farming...<br />
<br />
dont know more exactly casue my computer connection fizzled one night while i was sleeping...and i maxxed in the middle of the last night of doing this...<br />
<br />
as others have indicated...had to spend an hour or so killing bard to get to the point where he would attack me....then just parked and went afk...<br />
<br />
thanks again for pointing out this option in earlier in the post...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Shadowsoal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I afk camped this fool for close to 28 hours, took me 244 kills to go form max KoS to max ally, going to assume he was nerfed a bit (I did this partly before the ninja nerf on some faction mobs and partly after)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Bumluk Rayrspaun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">260 kills, all post nerf.  Not max ally, but high enough to get quests from Hoshkar and Silverwing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Bleuw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">The week before the VP upgrade, I cleared VP with a few guys and know for sure my faction was max KoS RoS when I learned about the new quests.<br />
<br />
Solution?  AFK pet factioning.<br />
<br />
Your 64 pet is level 41 and with mage summoned items and weapons will be able to solo any of the 6 to 10 spawns in MM without buffs or haste.  If you have a stable connection you can simply stand in an out of the way location MM before going to sleep at night with low risk of trains.  The mobs will agro on you when they spawn and then your pet will kill them.  Maxing RoS faction was longer than any other faction I've ever done this with - took 7 days of afk pet factioning to get max ally RoS this way.  Getting ally Chardok from max kos took only about five days standing outside Droga.  Getting highest possible Cabalis faction (including Iksar necro faction) for Greenmist only took about 4 days.  This is just something very easy to do when you aren't doing something else on your character.  I've completed a few of the VP quests now, the effort was very much worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Yes I know Brael hates post bumping.<br />
<br />
If your going to AE MM for faction I highly suggest you do it in the very near future. :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Lynxal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">At least if they up the mobs faction work won't be a total waste of 10-15 hours and you could take a group.  Assuming of course that they give 10 times the faction when the mobs get their increase.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>smoses799</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">anyone know how long the bard in SK takes to max Maymong Mistmoor faction?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Droogan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">I just came back from a 6 mo. break, previous to which we used to do VP for fun (a few clearings, several PD kills).  In this time, I am sure my RoS faction was pitiful, save for several king of kaladim kills.  I also was max kos to MM.<br />
<br />
That being said, I did the AFK faction in SK, and I would venture to say I was max ally to MM after 8-10 hours of factioning (no definitive grasp on the time frame).  The RoS part took much longer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Bageeta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Took about 18 hours total.  No idea where I started though.  RoS maxed before MM for me though, I happened to be goofing around on my other accounts, and was too lazy to log out after RoS was maxxed.<br />
