<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">1. Knight tanking is too far behind Warriors and too close to non tanking classes. (currently being evaluated) <br />
<br />
2. SK's are supposed to be tied as the 2nd best tank but have the lowest damage avoidence of all melee classes. (currently being evaluated)<br />
<br />
3. SK spellbook needs to scale to evolving content better. (currently being evaluated)<br />
<br />
4. It is currently too tough for us to channel spells. (currently being evaluated)<br />
<br />
5. Deathpeace is no longer sufficent as an FD tool. (currently being evaluated)<br />
<br />
6. Our spell based aggro needs fixed and designed to scale. (currently being evaluated)<br />
<br />
7. Knight DPS while not meant to be the highest should be higher than Bards. Far more progressed SK's can be KS'ed by Bards with ease from sheer lack of DPS on our part. (currently being evaluated)<br />
<br />
8. A method to reduce damage allowing us to compete with Paladin stuns (currently being evaluated)<br />
<br />
9. An upgrade to Leech Touch, it provides less of a HP swing, cannot be focused, cannot be disced, costs more AA, and prevents us from using our other HT to use. (no change planned at this time) - most likley would be an upgrade in a future expansion<br />
<br />
10. Removal/Refund of SCS or a toggle added to it. (currently being evaluated)<br />
<br />
Ky<br />
<br />
~~I'm crunchy and taste good with butter~~ <br />
<br />
SCS is being evaluated and leech touch upgrade/changes maybe making it to a future expansion</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">they'll sleep on it =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">No news is sort of good news here, seeing how the Ranger list got something like 4 or 5 prompt &quot;Nada&quot; responses to their top 10.<br />
<br />
One &quot;we agree, making changes on Test&quot; would be nice to see here though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">So in place of #9 I'm guessing what people want in there is res?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">So in place of #9 I'm guessing what people want in there is res?<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah, that one will be a quick kill. No change expected until expansion 2007 and level 100.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tropics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">So in place of #9 I'm guessing what people want in there is res?<br />
<br />
No. I would rather they change HT AA points to be non-activated therefore making Leechcurse take affect on all HT's and allow us to use UA to up the damage. Thererfore a SK can HT for 8k+ and it heals.<br />
<br />
I was gone a long time but I am 65 now and messing around playing catch up on flags/AA's, I dont think res is the way to go with our class. I know we could FD and save raids ressing clerics, I understand the use it would bring, I dont like the RP affect of it and never understood a necro ressing people so that arguement of &quot;well they do it and they are our parent class&quot; does not wash with me either. Raising the dead as a pet /= ressing.<br />
<br />
Otherwise 1 and 2 seem redundant albeit true.<br />
3 is bang on.<br />
4 is false.<br />
5 is true in that DP should never &quot;Tropics falls to the ground&quot;.<br />
6 makes me laugh, terror line is a joke compared to chaining Clinging Darkness still for agro, and costs WAY more mana. These terror lines were put in to replace the Disease Cloud screw job, they are no replacement at all. Is it so hard to make a 1 second cast time spell that costs 20-30 mana hits a mob for 5 dmg and 5 dmg per a second for 30 seconds and does as much agro as DC did?<br />
7 Yeah, our DPS has always sucked. Back 3 years ago most SK's wanted back to a more offensive role as was explained in the original SK writings by Verant. Now here we are today and SK's are pigeon holed as tanks. SoE will see this as wanting to have our cake and eat it too. I still get sick when I swing and miss a mob 3 rounds in a row, and it is green.<br />
8 Talked about this last thread, not getting into it here beyond saying I want a SK specific fix in this area, I dont want stuns or defensive, I want soemthing unique that fits our class description as killers, not saviours.<br />
9 as I said above, make the leechtouch AA inate so that you can disc and hit the huge HT and it heals.<br />
10 who the hell spent AA's on this anyhow? Hello? McFly?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rueeliar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I would still prefer for them to re-evaluate Unholy Aura.  Why do we need a disc to maximize our &quot;class defining ability?&quot;  We already pay AA to do this.  We have an AA to shorten the HT timer, but it doesn't shorten the disc timer.  Maximizing Touch of the Wicked sticks us with a HT that refreshes every 36 minutes, but is rather sad in damage every other use.<br />
<br />
I only mention it because historically, they have given us crap for Harm Touch time and time again, no matter how vocal we were about &quot;no more HT AA's please.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Svartrot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If it's not autolinked into unholy touch, Unholy aura should bump all nukes as much as it does HT for its duration.<br />
<br />
Actually, make that all damage, including melee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Skvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">this was an update ? oh yeah they added a vague comment about upgrade maybe sometime in the future, and added yet another 'being evaluated' <br />
<br />
Where is the update on being evaluated. I have this feeling SOE are stinging us along until after the release of oow :/<br />
<br />
Yes Brael , rez deserves in shot at also being put down as 'being evaluated'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">In place of #9 we want &quot;necro spell convergence as a level 66 shd spell to go live with OoW&quot;.<br />
<br />
-Bolas</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Samir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Just put in whatever you want Brael. The whole list is just becoming a joke. After reading some of the other lists other classes have it is obvious that the Devs do not intend to really do anything about these issues at the present time.   <br />
I am sure they are glad to have you as a scapegoat for the sk community when nothing gets changed. No doubt at present there is a flurry of activity trying to get OoW at least 10% finished before it's upcoming release.<br />
Maybe when another 10000 people cancel their accounts after the next expansion stuff-up, then they will address some of the issues in the hope of getting people to resubscribe.<br />
Did we really expect anything more?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kazh The Grim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Don't put in anything.  Assuming they are actually going to do anything with our lists (unlikely) there's not point in distracting from our real issues with purely wish list items like necro rez.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>DrakainShadescale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Sony has given us an excellent example of an inefficient and counter productive manage technique - regular updates with no sign of progress.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">That doesn't do any good Kazh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Shriva</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">&quot;Currently being evaluated&quot;---these guys sound like they've worked for the government.  Actually, that's a slap in the face to government employees.<br />
<br />
As far as #9 goes, please put Necro Rez in there so we can get the &quot;LOL, No change planned at this time&quot; out of the way to make room for something else, quickly.   (I'm not saying it wouldn't be nice to have, but I don't realistically think I'll be seeing that in my lifetime.)<br />
<br />
I guess you could always put #9-Request currently being evaluated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Skvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I guess you could always put #9-Request currently being evaluated.<br />
<br />
<br />
ooooooo now that idea rocks ! Sadly I cant see SOE posting that as one of our top 10 :(<br />
<br />
Maybe every single class that has got nothing but 'being evaluated' should enter it as one of their top 10 for a 2 week period ... even SOE might get the picture then</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sithanator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">A great replacement would be one about focus that we currently find on are gear. Since they ignored the general request for items to be looked at, let at least see if they will take at that one aspect.<br />
Later<br />
Sith</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Synapticus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">They can't even address any ONE of those issues, what makes you think they can handle 10 of them?  Its been about a month or so since this running list started, how much change have we seen?  Nothing has changed.  All the spells are the same.  All of our skill caps are the same.  All of out disc are the same.  <br />
The only thing they did was up the regen on Replenishment and  increase DS duration.  And oh yeah, fixed the warrior shielding bug.  They havent even gotten around to fixing the SCF + SA bug they so tactfully implemented.  Nothing in their actions, on live, on test, or in communications have led me to believe that they will make even corrective changes.  <br />
I guess I'm lucky I'm a casual player that XPs on trivial content =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Well after reading all the class lists and seeing what the comments are I have noticed a few things<br />
<br />
1.  The things that they say are likely to be implemented in current expansions are things that they already have that they are asking for some small improvement to, heals, buff durtations etc<br />
<br />
2. Things that a broke that need to be fixed<br />
<br />
3.  Things that were nerfed and are being reversed, Monk mitigation<br />
<br />
4.  Things that are being not considered, things the class currently does not have or is an ability of another class.<br />
<br />
<br />
So what I am thinking is things that are major changes or are outside of gains or fixing in what we currently have are probably not going to happen or will take a very long time to occur<br />
<br />
Also seems like giving specific suggestions seems to work better then saying fix this.  (Easier to have someoone else do the work)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Mr. Self Destruction</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">&quot;#9-Request currently being evaluated&quot;<br />
<br />
Heh, I agree. Put that. That way, the seriousness that we have for the list can match SoE's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Vindarius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Well, I've followed many of these threads about class balancing issues and commend a lot of peeps for their good suggestions. I am gonna bring up another issue related to class balance albeit not tanking, per se. I recently grouped with a Pally in an LDoN out of EF. He talked about spending 18 aa that helps him deal out tons of damage to undead. Sure 'nuff when we started, he was doing crits for upwards of 6k (no exaggeration) on skellies, at least once per fight, sometimes twice. I checked out Pally aa's and saw the Slay Undead and figure that must be the one. I'm not even close to doing a HT for that high, let alone a melee crit. With only 63 aa - mostly in defensives - I am not aware of anything the SK can do in melee or spell dd that comes close with that frequency (ok, if I'm wrong on this, I plead ignorance!).  Does this seem a tad out of balance to anyone else? Should that be addressed?</div></div><hr />

slay undead only works out to being a 20% increase in melee damage vs undead. considering how much undead content there is, and this is the only time they get that improvement, its definitely not something that should be nerfed. <br />
<br />
paladins are actually asking for improvements to their undead damage output.<br />
<br />
i read some of the other class boards too...<br />
bards want their melee DPS upgraded, better mitigation, and taunt =0<br />
<br />
clerics are complaining about our recourses too:<br />
Move short duration buffs to the song window, i.e. Yaulp, HOTs, Mind Wrack Between Rangers spamming their attack buffs and sk/necros using their recourse taps, &quot;buff management&quot; means clicking off 5 crap buffs every other minute. (no change planned at this time)</div></div><hr />

The funny part is taunt is being currently evalutated for bards</div></div><hr />

There is an interesting comparison for tanking of many different classes by the way (didn't see it linked here yet but I might have missed it).<br />
Some excerpts:<br />
So if we look at this we see that warrior &gt; monk &gt; Paladin &gt; shadow knight &gt; ranger &gt; rogue &gt; beast &gt; cleric &gt; shaman &gt; druid.<br />
<br />
This is for a Valorian guard by the way. Even without defensive the difference in damage between pal/SK and warr is already very high (though they didn't have the same AC, it was quite close between pal/warr). Especially if you compare it to the difference between SK/Pal and for example clerics.<br />
<br />
The best idea for fixing #1 and fixing the entire game I saw so far is giving warriors, paladins and SK's all a higher mitigation, and lowering the mitigation of the discs a lot. So:<br />
Warr: 35% mitigation, adds 15% from disc defensive (and change evasive accordingly as well).<br />
SK/Pal: 30% mitigation, no disc.<br />
All others: keep the same, 0% mitigation bonus though monks have their evasion bonus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Those parses are so old, also it DOESNT show a difference between War/Pal/SK due to the absolutely massive AC differences, and thus gear differences.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>neferaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">True, even then it was already more significant than I thought it would be though. Really hope something is done on the #1 from this list. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Istar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">If nothing you find seriouse to put in, Here is some ideas may or may not like. More of on the class defineing roll.<br />
<br />
1. Upgrade or better Undead control spell aka, Lull, single Target mezz. Duration charm?.  Our lvl 60 class name is gravelord but ironically at that lvl can't realy do much of anything to undead unless it con green. would be happy to have more versatility to undead at same level. I view paladins more the ones who can do the banish/high damage to undead, where as we control them more.<br />
<br />
2. personal summon corpse spell.<br />
<br />
thats about what i can think of for now..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Synapticus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Istar, that does nothing to address our class balance issues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">some choices<br />
<br />
1) Innate Unholy Aura<br />
2) Self Imbued Procs fire before weapon or augment procs<br />
3) Necro Rez<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
4) Fix our Soul Abrasion Crit issue (maybe we should start adding bugs to our top 10 list.  :rolleyes: )<br />
<br />
In regards to the self imbued procs, people said this has already been asked....I didn't think we asked for that specifically.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>neferaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Some things being evaluated on other classes are atleast ironic (example beastlord<br />
&quot;2. Increased skill cap on weapon skills<br />
Currently being evaluated&quot;)<br />
To quote Gobgob frum Grob...<br />
&quot;CURRENTLY BEING EVALUATED&quot;<br />
 What a coincidence - SO IS MY EQ SUBSCRIPTION !<br />
<br />
Some issues that are currently on the list are clearly bugs, like SCS, and should be fixed regardless of balancing. A necro like essence emerald res would be a good suggestion to take its place imo.<br />
<br />
I don't see any other important issues other than the ones already mentioned (especially #1).<br />
<br />
Fun factor wise though for undead spells I'd always wanted a 50% undead slow (similar to the level 24 enchanter spell but for undead like necros can) or a castable charm (I think that is beguile undead, level 34 nec spell with a level limit of 45 or so which sticks on undead dire charmable mobs, but it costs mana and can break at unexpected moments). Those suggestions probably would not make it and are certainly not essential. Then again there are not many powerful undead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Istar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Our Utility if far from being balanced from what it once was, and to our counterpart class. The only points we are putting to the devs are those relateing to tanking. Which as you can see we are being ignored on, Or do you need to have this stuff sit here for another month to see ?<br />
<br />
<br />
another point to show we are being ignored is no real response to these connecting each other if implemented:<br />
<br />
<br />
3. SK spellbook needs to scale to evolving content better. (currently being evaluated)<br />
<br />
6. Our spell based aggro needs fixed and designed to scale. (currently being evaluated)<br />
<br />
8. A method to reduce damage allowing us to compete with Paladin stuns (currently being evaluated)<br />
<br />
We are effectivly asking for, Our HP taps to be scaled, Along with our Aggro to be fixed. on top we are looking for a stun. This all to paladin's what ? paladins low stun spell?  They would of atleast made mention on this if they where truly looking into what we where putting up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Rueeliar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Not quite about their low stuns.  It's about the fact that three paladins can essentially prevent most level 65 or under mobs from dealing damage at all unless they are entirely immune to stuns unless they are monstrously resistant, and that a single paladin can keep a mob stunned by chaining two 4s stuns and a 10s stun.<br />
<br />
Cast first 4s stun.  2.2 seconds later, spell gems refresh and second 4s stun is cast, landing approximately 3.5s after the first (1s casting time and latency delay).  2.2s later, gems refresh and cast the 10s stun.  2s casting time, assume 4.5s total since last stun was cast.  We're now up to 8s since first stun was cast, and 4s left until first 4s stun refreshes, with 6s left on the mob being stunned from 10s stun.  That means that by the time the 10s stun wears off, both 4s stuns will be up, and the mob will have had .5s of time unstunned (one combat round plus Bash/Kick).  Assuming zero resists, the mob will get virtually no opportunity to deal damage at all.  Realistically, it is fair to assume at least a fifty percent resist rate, which still leaves the mob's active time reduced dramatically.<br />
<br />
That a better explanation?<br />
<br />
Edit:  That is theoretical ideal, unlikely to happen.  HoS and/or Tash will help it along alot, though.  In addition, it is the benefit of mitigating at exactly the same time as building aggro, while our spells that are considered to mitigate (taps) are low aggro, thus aggro must be built first before we can try to mitigate, leaving us at base mitigation when aggro needs to be solidified the most.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe they could call it like Soul Abrasion2 ... and maybe they could wait a while and then break functionality of half the AA's associated with it in some lame patch to make sure that it rains 90% of the time in every zone - even indoor ones and that snakes punch instead of kick and then refuse/forget/ignore fixing it.</div></div><hr />
