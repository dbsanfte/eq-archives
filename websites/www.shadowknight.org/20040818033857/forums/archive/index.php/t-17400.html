<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>wWanda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is it possible to solo her at lvl 64 ? Havent been there since they upgraded the zone.   My plan was to harmshield, run, FD, and quit out to clear aggro  then just camp outside her chamber till I can repeatedly beat her down.  <br />
     Unbuffed Im at 3850 HPs and 1185 ac.   Do I have what it takes to kill the two roaming mobs outside her lair,  then med up enough to kill her before they respawn?  Heck not even sure if I can land dark on her.  Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Krazaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Maybe possible, but definitely very difficult.<br />
<br />
The run to the prep spot is very dangerous.  If you do make it there and FD, you'll have to regen HP/mana while FD, then /q to clear all the aggro.<br />
<br />
Two roamers pass through that area, you should be able to take either individually so long as you regen up before you /q.<br />
<br />
Drusella herself can be snared and you'll need to use that to split her.  Five other mobs spawn in her room and you'll have to be especially careful when FD splitting her to not have FD broken by her casting.  Fortunately, most if not all of the adds are non-casters.  There's a chance of one of the adds being a named, which does hit significantly harder, adding to the difficulty.<br />

Fully buffed, you might be able to pull it off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Baeltor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Few other notes, a disc HT eats a nice chunk of her hp up. My bashes interupted alot of her spells as well. Her melee and spells were not that harsh, she does tend to proc a tap a fair amount so you'll have to hit her hard and fast lest she wears you down. Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I solo'd her 7 times before she dropped the Urn. I was 65, sometimes buffed, sometimes no. Was much harder unbuffed.</div></div><hr />
