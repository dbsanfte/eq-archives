 thx for the help )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Paynreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You can probably solo the fairy queen on the first island, she drops it too (but not always).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mahb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm at fairy Ise right now. Cleared it for the 3rd time. It is 100% lvl 65 doable. Magelo is down atm so I cant post it, but I cant see with a full spell book and decent bazaar gear you cant take her out. I have hardly any aa's also.  Best of luck to all who needs her. <br />
ps- the thing about her poping with the BOA after a patch was unfortunatly not true in my case, take it with a grain of salt.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vaelenu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think I read the respawn up there has been reduced to 4 hours now? Also the sword is visible when she is carrying it. So pick a day or weekend when you don't have commitments, get a port up to Air, gank the fairy princess, check back in 4 hours time, etc etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mahb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yup the re-spawn is 4 hr's on all of them. This is day three she's droped a paly neck, a shammy stien x's 3 ,and some other stuff a bud of mine has looted. We are staggering our log-in to make sure every 4hr's someone is up there.  Word of advice on the princess Stack her up with Dot's ( BOH,Ignite, and asystol) cast your pet ( the killer willow wisp ) and load healing spells. She gives you 2-3 easy fights in a row, but on that 3rd-4th fight that wench cowboy's up every time. I didn't take her seriously one time, I only had selfbuffs on no fd up 2 taps and zephers + attk/ac self buffs and 2 spear spells up, and by the end of it I had 30% hp used my leech curce, 0 manna, and when she got to 1% that princess strung together a string of 250 hp dam/ hit that had me thinking I wasn't going to make it. LOL<br />
<br />
 Not as boaring as I thought, but one long arse camp thats for sure. I hope this helps<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>kilst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You should be able to solo it no problems. I go up there every now and again to check for the BoA, mostly just before I log. I only have 5.4K unbuffed, throw on CoL and get your pet out (I dont need to do it but it helps) start off with Bond of Death and just lifetap, don't bother with spears or any other DoT's unless your plentiful in mana. Fight doesn't last too long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mahb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I dont have CoL yet just CoA, I cant speak on the diff between them. With like 4k+ mana w/o kie and 6k hp that wench takes me down to 20% every fight. I get the pet up, hit her with asystol &amp; BoH then BoD and attack. I ac and attk debuff her and just tap and refresh after that.<br />
<br />
 She's consistently hitting over 200 per hit and her dot lands with all resists between 100-150. I'm useing the poW pet wepon and for some reason I dont think it's hitting the same up here, and it hasn't proc't once up in sky. Ave hit is 90-150 with it and its 35/24 ( something like that) so it's baffaling. On the brightside our pet doesn't seem to be nerft down , as I read in other posts, it hits 50's-60's with some in the 30's &amp; 80's.<br />
 Week 1 is in the books ... Tons of haste no-drop belts, shammy stiens, wizzy bracers, but not 1 BoA.  4 hr cycle is definitly confermed.<br />
<br />
 ....I'll keep you posted, wish me a drop from the Gods !!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just saw this and it struck me as odd...... doesn't our pet hit for 55 maximum? Or am I fucked in the head?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Mahb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">No your sain my bro , I didn't account for bst buffage. I'm up there part time with a 65 bst, and wrote that up pritty late at night. Sorry if that messed anyone up. 55 is on the money with only aug.<br />
<br />
 New day No BoA as of yet, Looks like it rogue haste belt day though !  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>kilst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Bah, if your getting down to 20% hps, should probably use Leechcurse if your not doing so now. After Leechcurse HT the bish.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Renaey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Dont sweat it dude, im mainly bazaar geared with some Ornate/Luclin drops, and soloed up there np, i have like 7200hp raid buffed and 78 AA's 6 unspent.<br />
<br />
Should be np for you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Lugdug Studthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">There's no reason you should be going down to 20% each fight.  I have 5500 or so unbuffed, and I would end every fight at 80% or so.  Do you have ToI?  I had ToI/ToV/BoD going at all times sure I ran out of mana by the end of the fight, but with a 4 hour respawn you don't have much to worry about  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Mahb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I got ND3 ,Com Stab 3 ,Com Agil 3, TOL,regen3,and some other stuff not good enough to remember. http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=65828  I finnaly got my megalo up.<br />
<br />
 Well I've forgotten how long I've been up at poSky now  :rolleyes:   From my time there I can say that the princess has definitly gotten harder. I checked with my lvl 65 bst friend and he says the same thing, definitly tuffer. She's hitting almost 250 constant now as of 2 patches ago. She's gone through every haste belt, every spell drop, and even that wieght of the gods drop and no BoA. She's landing her peuny dot like 80% of the time with all my saves over 100.<br />
<br />
 The tapping strat has made the kill somewhat easier, but I have to mix in ignite and asystol. She still has a bad ass temper though. Here's what happened on my 2nd to last kill.<br />
 I had her down to 5 % hp I was at 48% ( noticed I was under 50%) all of a sudden that wench pitched a hissy fit and whaled on me untill I was 8%. I was sweating big time ! My poW pet wepon still hits for 65-80 up there no pet proc still eather it might be worth it to just load up a 1hd and shield. I digress  ,, Well when I saw I was at 8% I got pritty tight, but I didn't want to waste an ht on a dead mob. I hit Leech curce, but not much good comes out of it when your hitting under 100 and when I looked my timer was almost done and I was at 7% and the wench was at 2% ! As soon as LC wore out she went nutz again and thank god I just hit HT and said screw it because I ended up with 3% hp. So to make a long story short, she took me down from 48% to 3% in the time it took me to whipout her 5%. That is just screwed up if you want my 2cp.<br />
<br />
 On the positive tip I think I am going tto use a tap 1st attitude with her and save mana for dots when she gets to 10% ,maybe 20%. Sky should not be this hard ! I took out the CS water dragon solo with much less problems than I have this creature  :confused:  In all it seems you get 2-3 easy kills off her then 2 back to back nail bitters. I hope this is just a problem I am haveing and that this nightmare can be of use to you all as you get to getting your BoA's. Camping her as a way of getting the BoA is definitly NOT the moost expiditious way to get that BoA IMHO. <br />
<br />
  OH and in 2 patches that I went up there, She DID NOT HAVE the BoA up, as has been said in prior posts. I know for a fact I was the 1st one up there cuz I waited out the patches each time. after todays patch she was holding the SK haste belt ( at least it's good for tribute !!  :rolleyes:  ;) <br />
<br />
 Hope this helps, tomarrow I'm getting a FG and clearing the whole bloody enchilada  gerrrr</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Renaey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Does she enrage? i dont remember heh.. could it be possible you missed the message?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Mahb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">she doesn't enrage but it sure feels that way LOL patch up today so I'm loggin in wish me luck !!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Mahb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I tip my hate to the enterpizing player ( I hope it was an SK) that took down the princess 5 min after the patch  :o   it'd be cool to know if she actually dropped it, cuz I will be pissed after killing her 2 strait patches and getting white gloves and a pally haste belt of all things  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>nezzka is bad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">yea thats cool its definantly tuff sometimes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Medcor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">myself 65 SK and a 65 shammy slowing, plus both our pets handled her fine and I had about 7k hp. She was cake..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Mahb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Sorry for the delay ,tons of work and dear ol francis had to blow my way  :mad: <br />
 The princess is extreamly Doable with 2 lvl65's anyclass. Now as for soloing her she has Definitly been getting harder. Since I started this camp like 1 month ago !!  :eek:  :o  She was cake. I'ld take her down with only self buffs and no disc or ht. The 65 bst I have up there also had an easy time of it. Now I've gone from needing full buffage to also haveing to /disc and HT, with my last attempt jumping off with 8% b/c I had already used HT and LC wasn't restoring my health b/c my wepon wasn't hitting for shiza. ( mind you it's the PoW pet swarm wep)<br />
<br />
 No clue whats going on with her, this has turned into a tuff solo camp. Her spells are landing constintly, she's dbl and trip hitting in the 200's, and although she's not suposed to flurry she got me from 40% hp to 9% in the time it took me to kill of her 5 % hp she had left. Now yha there WAS NO flurry text from her, but she could of atleast had a /Fairy Princess breaks a nail and goes premadonna on yha arse, because eraseing 31% hp in 5% hp's time is nothing short of an arse whooping.<br />
<br />
 I had hopes that all the loot you'ld get up there could be turned in for tribute, but alass tribute master gave Nothing for them, and all the haste belts went to the trash. Not even the drops help you up there !!!!<br />
<br />
 I'm thinking ,as soon as I can get some friends on-line, to get a full group of 65's up there and levle the whole thing. Do you all think a full group of 65's can clear all of PoSky ?  Supposidly by the time you get to the last island you should get at least 1 abo drop, right ?<br />
<br />
 Thx all and I hope this camp log helps someone  :cool:</div></div><hr />
