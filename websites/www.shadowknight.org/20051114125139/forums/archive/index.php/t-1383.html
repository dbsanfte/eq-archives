<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rurounin</div><div class="date">05-05-2002, 12:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">very quick small question.  Can you hand in the bonechips in stacks of 20 x 4 at once and still get the same hits as just handing them in 4 by 4 ?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ariakhis</div><div class="date">05-05-2002, 03:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you had in stacks of 20 you'll only get the faction for the first 4 in each stack.<br />
Stick to handing them in stacks of 4 =)<br />
Good luck!!<br />

<br />
How many bone chips am I looking at to get from barely apprehensive to aimable?<br />
<br />
Anyone have a general ballpark idea? <br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

Maybe I worded the above post poorly.<br />
<br />
I've already turned in a TON of bone chips, but I honestly have no clue how many.  I turned in a bunch 10 months ago..  then quit EQ for a while, and recently turned in a bunch more.<br />
<br />
I'm curious if anyone know's the scope of how many bones it takes to get from app. to aimable.  I'm told it goes a lot quicker once  you're  up to app.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chingachgook</div><div class="date">05-06-2002, 11:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Unfortunately, Azariah, I am still a little behind you in chips.  But i have been keeping track of the chips i turn in.  This isnt 100% accurate since i have also done a few rings and torches, but here is where i am now.<br />
<br />
203 Stacks (Approx 4060 Chips - Quest Completed 1015 times)<br />
<br />
After all that, My factions were the following<br />
<br />
Warrior - LegionOfCabilis (Troopers) - Warmly (Capped)<br />
Shaman - ScaledMystics - Indifferent<br />
ShadowKnights - CrusadersOfGreenmist (Crusaders) - Dubious<br />
Monks - Swifttails - Indifferent<br />
Necros - Brood of Kotiz - Threatening (Been Killing Bandits in WW)<br />
Merchants - CabilisResidents - Scowls<br />
<br />
I found this on the web about faction<br />
<br />
Neg 800 and lower: scowls rdy to attack <br />
Neg 800 to Neg 500: threat <br />
Neg 500 to Neg 100: dubious <br />
Neg 100 to 0: Apprehensive <br />
0 to 100: Indifferent <br />
100 to 200: amiable <br />
200-500: kindly <br />
500-800: warmly <br />
<br />
So if you just got your SK faction to apprehensive, you need to get another 200 pts to get to amiable, or about 800 chips.<br />
<br />
It also looks to me, they started the SK faction starts about 200pts lower then the shaman and monk factions<br />
<br />
My question is, do we have to care about the CabilisResidents faction?  I really could care less about banking in cabilis, I am really just interested in the SK quests and ultimately, Greenmist.<br />
