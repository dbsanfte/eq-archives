When they finished filming the ad the people who made it noticed something moving along the side of the car, like a ghostly white mist. The ad was never put on TV because the unexplained ghostly phenomenon frightened the production team out of their wits.<br />
<br />
Watch it and about halfway look and you will see the white mist crossing in front of the car then following it along the road... Spooky!<br />
<br />
Turn your sound on (you can hear a crackling noise when the mist appears), then click here to watch the movie.&quot;<br />

Good one.<br />
It did remind me of the one internet spooky picture that made me screem.  It was supposed to be a black and white picture of a room in a haunted house and the directions said stare at the mirror above the chair and after 10 seconds you'd see a ghost (or something along those lines).  Of course 10 seconds later this nasty ghost thing flies out of the wall towards the viewer.  I yelped like a puppy who had his tail stepped on.<br />
<br />
EDIT: I know the difference between Tale and Tail</div></div><hr />

That was nothing compared to that other site where it told you to look for the ghost in the haunted house. lol The ghost jumped out and screemed and my boyfriend's neice went running for the hills. Poor thing. We found her crying in the living room with her mom. I felt so bad.</div></div><hr />

Her younger sister watched it too and she was 8 and it didn't scare her that bad. I learned that she's the sensative one in the family. But if I had known that... I wouldn't have showed her that. I'm not that mean. lol</div></div><hr />
