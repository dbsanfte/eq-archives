It's all part of the plan!<br />
<br />
Step 1: Terrorists attack America <br />
Step 2: Bush uses flimsy allegations of hidden caches of weapons of mass destruction and completely baseless links to terrorist attack on America to send us to war with Iraq <br />
Step 3: Iraq loses comically short war and U.S. troops occupy the country <br />
Step 4: Bush realizes he forgot to figure out a plan for rebuilding Iraq after the war, fumbles around while more American soldiers die at the hands of Iraqi guerillas <br />
Step 5: American soldiers get fed up with the situation and take out their frustrations by completely humiliating Iraqi prisoners <br />
Step 6: Terrorists want to attack America</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Androsulach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Grim, to the best of the world's knowledge, Saddam had WMDs and had jerked around the UN Weapons Inspectors so much in the last 13 years, that they were convinced something was up and that they weren't sure if Iraq still had WMDs or not.  The flimsy part involves the alledged attempt to procure weapons grade uranium in Africa and the report being false.<br />

But the radicals have been targetting America for the last decade.  I don't really understand what put the bug up Osama's ass, but he's been pissed at us for a long time.  And to think, we helped the Afghans kick the Soviets out by funnelling cash and weapons to them, using Osama as a conduit.</div></div><hr />
