Ok, all you high end people that are spring loaded to the bitching position about the end game, what do YOU think it SHOULD be?<br />
<br />
The &quot;Sony hates me so they screwed up the end game as a personal attack on me&quot; whine is more than a bit old.  So, what would the end game be if YOU made the decisions?<br />
<br />
Also, since it is so bad, and the game is such &quot;teh suck&quot;, and Sony has such a personal hate-on for you, why do you keep playing and paying?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kyfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You, sir, are a fucking idiot. Your post merely displays your profound ignorance and stupidity.<br />
<br />
The people upset are people who have liked the game and have spent untold hours developing characters. Now these characters have no great use. So they are agitating to bring back class balance so their characters can contribute again as they have in the past. They do not wish to play another class. Also, it isn't as if you can just go *poooooof* and somehow have a end-Time + LDON/GoD character to replace your current one.<br />
<br />
So kindly stfu until you get a clue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ogrukk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">No, Kyfe, you sir are a retard.  My post was not asking what class they would rather play, and it was not about being able to poof a new char to Time+ levels.   It was about how Time+ content would be structured if the Time+ leveled reader had the opportunity to influence that.<br />
<br />
If you are too busy to read the three sentances I actually wrote, how do you find time to respond to imaginary posts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Elkar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">No fucktard, your post was a flame toward Time+ characters.  Don't show up, rant at them, then try to pretend your post was a question about what they thought the content should be.<br />
<br />
It was an uneducated, ignorant blast at Time+ players.<br />
<br />
I'm not Time+, and I can see that as easily as I spotted your mis-spelling of &quot;Sentance&quot; (So much for reading three &quot;sentances&quot; before spouting off, eh?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Short answer:<br />
<br />
There are 4 roles in a typical group: tank, healer, slower, DPS<br />
<br />
SKs can't tank in GoD because defensive is required.<br />
SKs can't heal with a 30 hp/cast heal.<br />
SKs can't slow because they have no slow spells.<br />
SKs DPS is significantly lower than a number of other classes which means if SKs fill a DPS slot, they do so badly.<br />
<br />
So what do SKs do in GoD?<br />
<br />
The balance of the SK class opinion is that SKs ought to be tanks, which means that (1) we need defensive or (2) mobs need to be changed so that they don't require defensive, but aren't trivial with defensive or are toned to the point that rangers can tank.</div></div><hr />

Try paying a subscription fee for 62 months only to be told that your class is as powerful as it is going to get.<br />
<br />
I'm double boxing my friend's Wizard now so I can contribute.  He easily does 10 times the damage I do, if not more, and I have more mana than he does.<br />
<br />
Just about every class in this game, given a week, some platinum, and a lot of playing time will be way more beneficial to a raid than we are, and that is seriously messed up.<br />
<br />
You don't honestly think that all of these &quot;uber&quot; veterans that post here are stupid whiners, do you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">So, what would the end game be if YOU made the decisions?<br />
<br />
Answered a million times in a hundred threads.<br />
<br />
why do you keep playing and paying?<br />
<br />
Progressing with my friends, even though I dont do much but help out the monks, is fun.  The other SK is the raid leader, so he's not going anywhere.<br />
<br />
Did we really need a new thread for this?</div></div><hr />

I don't think I've ever seen him post on these boards, but im jealous.  <br />
<br />
Because he usually posts in Spells &amp; Skills, Combat and Tactics, Armory, etc.  not sure I've seen him post in flames before.  hence why he's unfamiliar to you.<br />
<br />
He's usually typing silly jokes and occasionally real information.  In fact he seems likeable, but if they made him a Mod there must be something wrong with him besides the fact that everytime I see his name next to a post I get a song from rathergood going through my head &quot;thinking about your axe wound thinking about your gash been thinking about your axe wound thinking about your gash...&quot;</div></div><hr />

my comment of &quot;just noticed his mod status&quot; wasn't meant as &quot;I just this second noticed&quot; but more along the lines of &quot;I commented on welcoming him to hell, because I was aware of his mod status&quot;</div></div><hr />
