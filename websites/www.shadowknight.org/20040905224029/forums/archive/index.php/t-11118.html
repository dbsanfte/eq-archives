<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nlaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First off, I would like to agree that picking a race that you like is the only way to go. That said, something has been annoying since reading these good ole race debates.<br />
<br />
<br />
This point is the Ogre ability of not being stunned from the front, now I hear all your arguements about hardly ever getting stunned from teh front, and yes in a solo experiance grind, or even in some group situations you wont get stunned much.<br />
<br />
Why this ability is so much more then iksar AC, iksar/troll regen and the alleged intelligence factor of the &quot;smarter&quot; races (this I laugh at because while having decent int, most of those races have to use their points to raise stam, agil or even str because it is so low.) is this when you get more then one mob on you the stuns start to add up, a lot. Try tanking 3 mobs and see how much that &quot;stuns don't bother me much at all&quot; attitude changes when your vertually perma stunned. This is why most high end guilds like ogres for MT and even MA is because high end mobs WILL stun you if you are not immune. <br />
<br />
So that's my opinion on the subject and I am sure we will get a ton of info from all your naysayers about how worthless not being stunned from the front is.</div></div><hr />

The lowered frequency of stuns comes very much in handy when trying to take on yellow and red con mobs alone.

EXACTLY.  Thank you for posted essentially what I have stated before.  They need to make that an AA ability for SKs like they have for WAR.  Getting stunned 4,000 consequtive times is one of the most ANNOYING things in the entire game.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nlaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">That needs to remain an ogre only ability, duplicating that for all the other races just wouldnt be fair at all. Otherwise aside from picking Ogre or Troll for the looks why would you bother to pick them if you planned on going end game? <br />
<br />
Giving any other race that ability through AA's is just absurd there is no reason they deserve it and would essentially make picking an ogre and taking that 15% xp penalty just not worth it. As is now there really isnt any reason to pick troll other then looks since its regen can be duplicated with AAs. Only iksar and ogre remain the only two races to have a unique unattainable racial bonus.<br />
<br />
<br />
Like I said before if you want to not be chain stunned then make an ogre, otherwise just play the race and leave the real tanking to us Ogres.</div></div><hr />

But to add something usefull to the thread :p<br />
<br />
Yeah, the not being stunable from ogres is not bad. Being permastunned sucks when trying to Fd. But i rather have the Troll regen for downtimes, and you all know you gonna have some. I just like the fact i regen at least twices as fast as ogres do when sitting and medding up for the next kill. So what if i die cause i am permastunned, only means i had a sucky pull. If i keep dieing cause 3 mobs are hitting on me every time i pull. I delete my SK and go play a assling dr00d :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nlaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You missed my point, but why bother people only read and comprehend what they want to comprehend.<br />
<br />
I am not saying this ability is better worse or whatever, but having people always downplay it makes me angry.<br />
<br />
It is as good as regen, or ac bonus I dont know how many times ive channeled through multiple bashes because normally I would have been stunned if I was another race and been droped out of casting.<br />
<br />
Also I find it helpful for those fights when its close to the wire chain life tapping and not being stunned comes in handy.<br />
<br />
But like I said in my original post in which many people lost the meaning is that it really shines on raids and also in situations when your fighting multiple mobs, NOT HOWEVER WHEN YOUR ARE SOLO XPING PULLING ONE MOB AT A TIME.<br />
<br />
But again your will gather what you will and make a post about whatever you want even if it misses the point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jupke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Soooooo saying i like troll regen better makes me bash your thread ? funny, cause no matter what you say i will still like troll regen better, hell even if they made ogres uber SK's starting with 200 str/sta/int i would still make a troll.<br />

like i said, take the stick an beat on the old dead cow like all other threads somebody says i like this cause of so and so, and if somebody else says yeah but i like this cause of so the first person starts getting mad cause they are disagreeing and dont see their point.<br />
<br />
The point is, it doesn't matter, there are 1000000000 threads about it, all saying the same thing and i thought my reply was not even a thread bashing, but if you want one, i can provide. Please dont ask one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For that I agree that regen is better, but I have a nasty xp penalty and wouldnt want 5% more just to have some advantage that is essentually worthless end game. <br />

I said make whatever race you feel comfortable with, but quit bashing my racial ability because your jealous of it.</div></div><hr />

What I'm sick of is anyone and everyone of any class race combo trying to trump themselves up like they are better then other possible combo's they all have their benefits and drawbacks.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Lunaticfringesk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">&quot;Giving any other race that ability through AA's is just absurd there is no reason they deserve it and would essentially make picking an ogre and taking that 15% xp penalty just not worth it.

<br />
<br />
Given the fact that I vastly agree with almost everything you have said about *this* ogre ability, I am almost shocked that you would type something so dubious.<br />
<br />
It makes terrific sense to allow other races to get that ability, even if just to reduce the number of frontal stuns, rather then take it all away completely (ala ogre).<br />
<br />
The argument stated above is completely incorrect.  There would still be a reason to play an ogre, in a manner very similar to choosing an IKS or TRL.  The *nuts and bolts* of having a innate ability in the first place is the primary driver of the xp penalty.  Trolls/Iksar with regen and ogres with un-stunnable from front are those innate abilities that are very nice to be *born* with (I also factor in starting stats, as that surely plays a role too, but probably a roll that is pale in comparision to the abilities listed above).<br />
<br />
For instance, if there were 3 levels, say JUST LIKE Stalwart Endurance (&quot;SE&quot;) for warriors, that cost 2, 4, and 6 aa to get, that is 12 aa's that can be spent elsewhere that the ogre wouldnt have to spend time acquiring (granted, SE relates to stunning blows from any angle, not jsut the front, but the point remains the same).  So, tell me, would that be an advantage for the ogre?<br />
<br />
Furthermore, the comment that there is no reason to pick a troll for its regen ability is equally foolish.  Just because another race can duplicate it doesnt mean, but any stretch of the imagination, that they can perform it as well.  AA regen STACKS with innate regen.  All things equal, a race that has innate regen (ie. troll, iksar) will always be ahead of a race that doesnt have it.<br />
<br />
The more I think about it, the more I laugh.  This is happening all over the game, across races and even classes for that matter.  Combat fury allows non-warriors to have crit hits similar to warriors.  So, by the *logic* listed above, there wouldnt be any reason to pick a warrior.  /boggle (and, oh by the way, all things equal, a warrior will always have a higher percentage to crit than a non-warrior class)<br />
<br />
Also, ANY warrior race can acquire stalwart endurance.  So, I ask you, why cant an SK?<br />
<br />
There is no question in my mind that we should be given access to that aa.  I can guarantee you there are many non-ogre SKs out there who would jump at it in an instant.<br />
<br />
And yes, there would still be PLENTY of reason to play an ogre, regardless of whether that ability was offered to other races or not.<br />

So that's my opinion on the subject and I am sure we will get a ton of info from all your naysayers about how worthless not being stunned from the front is.  <br />
I don't think it's worthless, I think it's a very nice ability to have.  I just think some people place too much stock in its value.<br />
<br />
If I'm being attacked by three mobs at once?  Sure, in such a situation it would be great, since it would give me a better chance to channel an FD, since that would be about the only way to survive.  How often do I wind up tanking three mobs at once?  If I wind up pulling three mobs on a raid, there are a couple things that can happen:<br />
<br />
- some form of CC, be it root parking or split tanking or stuns/mezzes, so I wind up dealing with one mob at a time.<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
- as soon as someone lands a heal to deal with the fact that I'm being smacked by three mobs, the two that I am not directly attacking jump the healer, and we wipe.<br />
<br />
So I'm not sure how being unstunnable from the front is all that great on overpulls. :)<br />
<br />
It's a nice ability to have, and I think it would be good to have it as an AA ability, much as regen and 2H bash can be attained via AA.  It just isn't something that I'd choose over something like regen or looks when considering an SK race.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ogres got by far the coolest model upgrade with Luclin.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Nlaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">First off I would love to thank Jobril for his orginal post, not like thats not used by him on every race discussion thread. <br />
<br />
Now on to Akeikyl my intention was not saying something makes or breaks a sk by what racial ability they get. The whole point is all you non ogres are always just saying &quot;not being stunnable is nice but its not that big of a deal.&quot;, when in fact it is a very nice ability. I honestly don't care who picks what race, I like my ogre and they DO have the best luclin model upgrade in my eyes. (Only reason I made one, cause doughboy ogre of the old world never appealed to me.)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now my good man Lunaticfringesk, I totally agree with what you said, and shamelessly admit my comment may have been a bit to harsh. I do know that no matter how much regen any non iksar or troll gets they will never equal that of their troll/iksar friends/enemies. But my point and maybe I did not make it clear was if they did give the unstunnable from the front to the other races via an AA, then there HAS to be some upgrade for an Ogre as well. If a human gets regen he still does not regen like a troll or iksar does with the same AA. Now how do you propose giving other races unstnnability from the front while maintaining ogres an advatage over their other racial counterparts?<br />
<br />
My suggestion is to allow all races to get unstunnability from the front while allowing Ogres to get an AA upgrade that allows them not to be stunned period. (minus spell effects, and item effects of course... or maybe those too!! omg jk)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Jobrill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Actually, I've only used it twice, and you can't tell me that minus some embellishment, that's about how every race post eventually goes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
This isnt true.  You still get stunned from the front with the illusion on.  There were even guildmates telling me, AS I HAVE THE OGRE ILLUSION ON AND AM GETTING STUNNED FROM THE FRONT, &quot;No, you dont get stunned with the illusion on.&quot;  /boggle<br />
At least on the Xev server I can promise you that...<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;But my point and maybe I did not make it clear was if they did give the unstunnable from the front to the other races via an AA, then there HAS to be some upgrade for an Ogre as well.

Now how do you propose giving other races unstnnability from the front while maintaining ogres an advatage over their other racial counterparts?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
I hear what you are saying.  Perhaps the correct way to do it is to have it be just like Stalwart Endurance, that being, it vastly reduces the chance of being stunned (from any angle), but doesnt eliminate it altogether (like orges have from the front).  That might make it still interesting for ogres to get, while allowing other races to reduce the chance of getting stunned (which is, IMO, one of the most irritating things in the entire game)<br />
<br />
The orge will always have the advantage.  He was born with it and, if he is primarily concerned with frontal stuns, he would never have to worry about wasting any AAs to get it, while the other races would.  If he was concerned about being stunned from all sides, he would still have the edge, as he *cant* be stunned from the front, while other races still could (just at a far less chance).  <br />
<br />
Not sure what the answer is, but if WAR get that AA ability, I sure as heck think SK/PLD should.<br />

This arguement can be made for any racial advantages. example: &quot;The whole point is all you non Iksars are always just saying &quot;Extra Regen and AC bonus is nice but its not that big of a deal.&quot;, when in fact it is a very nice ability.&quot; Please note how I didn't list any of my Racial advantages or disadvantages in my original post.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Deslegrate</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I have an Ogre SK.  He is currently lvl 11, made him yesterday night.  I can't imagine not having no stun from front anymore.  Even at low levels it was annoying in CB with 3 adds, and lots of stun messages.  Now I just ignore it and plow them all without slowing down.  (based on a lvl 12 dE sk that i had before).<br />
<br />
On the Racial Abilities, I definately agree no stun from front should not be considered, not even lesser % to get stunned.  There would just be no reason to play ogre at all.  Little better stats then troll, but troll regen would completely sway the choice, if that was an AA.  Even with Fungi + AAXP regens to equal troll regen or close to it, Trolls can still use Fungi and AAXP regens too.  Thats the reason they allow that.  But the no/reduced stun is just not a good idea at all.<br />
<br />
They would definately need to add another aspect to the Ogre to even it out, seeing as that AAXP would have little to no benefit to the ogre.  Easier pulling sure, but if your running that far on a pull as to where its a problem in a dungeon with no sow/speed enhancement/run3, then thats not really a stun from the back problem as a logistics problem with your camp/runspeed.<br />
<br />
Not sure what the other benefit they would add to ogres would be, possibly allow them to wield a 2hs (Sword, Axe, Blunt, Piercer) one handed.  Not like in d2 where the dmg changes to compensate, but just straight up.  Not dual wield either, just one handed, so they can use a shield as well.  Afterall they are so big and strong, would imagine they could steadily wield something a Gnome SK can two handed, one handed.  That might be lil overpowered though considering some of the really good stats on some shields.  Either that or some other ability noone has mentioned yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Akeikyl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">How the hell do you come out thinking they would need to add something else to the Ogre's if they gave other races the ability to be stunned less? This is the mentality that has plagued class/race balancing for to long.  Undoubtedy if they gave other races the ability to be stunned less it would be through AA's and thus require lvl 60 or greater and a boatload of AA's. Well there goes all the reason to play a Ogre because after 60 levels and countless AA's other races can get stunned X% less of the time OMG!~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Lunaticfringesk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">/agree with Akeikyl.  <br />
<br />
It makes absolutely no sense to NOT allow SK/PLD to get that AA ability.<br />
<br />
Race has nothing to do with it in Verant's mind at the moment.  WAR can get SE, but SK/PLD cannot.  Someone is going to have to draw me a diagram as to how that makes any sense...<br />
<br />
Luna</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Deslegrate</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Actually it makes perfect sense.  I fail to see your counter point other then a rant.  Both of you actually.  Nonsense.<br />
<br />
You do not take unique abilities away from classes without compensating.   How would trolls/Ikky's be worth the EXP penalty if they were removed from all regen items as useable?  I'd imagine they would be rather pointless to play, based on EXP penalty for nothing speacial.<br />
<br />
That's like saying Trolls/Ikky's gain 5-6hp regen more any given time but for that they cannot use the any 5, 10, 15hp regen items, while other classes can.  And ontop of that you gain a 20% exp penalty.  Thats nonsense.  Ogre do nothing that other classes can't, their stats are great for melee yes, but like people have mentioned after a decent time investment most classes can compensate to a degree. <br />
<br />
So in short, you make no sense.  The only way you would even remotely make any sense is if you argued that while adding this AA ability, you would in turn Remove the EXP penalty or add another ability.  I think you need to learn a little simple risk/reward theory.  Why take an exp penalty as an Ogre if your stats are only a little lower as a troll (easily compensated by equip still) and trolls gain regen, while you gain an ability that you can gain as a troll with AAXP later on?  Its not good business unless your looking at an RP standpoint where you have your heart set on being a big Ogre, in which case this doesn't really apply anyway.  <br />
<br />
You sound like you want to both have your cake and eat it too.  You do not want the exp penalty of the ogre, or you want the exp penalty + the Regen from trolls/iksars and you also want the ability that the ogres gain from the exp penalty.  Even with all your AAXP regens your still not touching an ikky or Troll, espeacially if you both play hard regen (fungi, regen ring etc...)  You'll be out regened by a decent enough margin to warrant the 20% penalty they suffer.  What does an Ogre gain by losing its sole bonus, to aquire a skill that is very valuable and cannot be gained any other way?  Nothing.  <br />
<br />
So please enlighten me, I enjoy reading your nonsense on this subject.  Better yet lets just give an AA ability that allows any race to gain No Stun From Front and Full Iksar/Troll Regen.  That way people who choose to suffer an EXP penalty for the speacial ability of those races, get the shaft, while others get to enjoy that nice no exp penalty that they have, but after a point can farm for a few days or a week and gain those nice abilities. <br />
<br />
----edited part----<br />
Forgot to comment on the Warrior ability.  Warriors are -THE- tanks. They should have all sorts of tankable bonus's AA's at thier disposal.  SK's/Pal are not ONLY good for tanking.  Sure they do it good, but they can do many other things then just tank.  All warriors really do is tank.  Barring a handfull of extremely well equipped warriors, who can do many other things, but in 99% of their eq experience they will be tanks.  So based on the model that the warrior is there to tank, this makes perfect sense.  Why not allow a class that is there pretty much just to tank, to gain an ability like that?  Makes alot of sense to me.  The benefit of being an Ogre warrior over a Troll as a war is still there.  Regen as a main tank really won't matter much.  When your quaded for such high amounts of dmg, the regen is negligable.  Warriors dont fear kite, or solo, so the regen doesnt really help with their down time.(yes some wars can solo in some places, but lets just say in general they do not solo like a SK or even a pal vsUD).  Therefore the benefit is much less in regen over the no frontal stun +superior melee stats which allow more flexibility (unless in high end guild) with what gear you wear.  Perhaps you want to go hard dex/agi for procs and def skills.  As an ogre you can get your STA/STR max with less +str/sta gear.  Leaving more room for those other stats.  So there are still advantages.<br />
<br />
So yes, there is logic behind it.  There is no logic behind adding such a skill for SK's, seeing as Regen is much more usefull to SK's, therefore the switch off isn't so simple, as with Warriors.  So again I fail to see your point.  Its like saying any class that &quot;can use a bow&quot; should gain Ranger Bow AAXP's.    Honestly the logic of SK/Pal having it just isn't there.<br />

I have an Ogre SK. He is currently lvl 11, made him yesterday night. I can't imagine not having no stun from front anymore.

The fact is I'm tired of every SK race trumping themselves up like they are the premier SK race.  As I said all races have their advantages and disadvantages.  Play what appeals most to you and stop trying to trump yourselves up like your better then others simply because your race &quot;x&quot;. As to the ability to be stunned less I wonder if Ogre's Warriors cried as much as people here are when that was introduced to other Warrior races. Since I don't browser the Warrior boards I don't know. We are Hybrid Tanks we tank though we do not tank very high end raid mobs because SOE has designed that to be a warriors responsibility. Giving us this ability is so minor really unless your talking worse case senario like &quot;OMG! I pulled 3+ mobs I can't feign or Channel Harmshield!&quot;. As someone else brought out even in these senario's there are many possible ways to handle this perhaps you've heard of a enchanters ability to &quot;mez&quot; mobs, root parking, kiting or having another melee off tank it etc.  If you did some parsing I would be willing to bet that the percentage non Ogre races actually get stunned is so minor. I get stunned once in awhile. It's not like I'm getting stunned  so much that I can't effectively tank for my group/raid and they are crying we need a Ogre Tank!. All in all as with EVERY other racial ability it's minor but if it's enough to sell you on  a Ogre fine enjoy your race and class but don't act like your the premier SK simple because of this one ability. The same applies to all races.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Rezzbagg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I too disagree with the comment &quot;making it an aa would make ogres useless&quot;. The argument about trolls and regen has already been pointed out. The thing that seems to keep most trolls/iksars from complaining that others get their ability, is that it stacks with the innate regen, so you are still ahead. Why would it be any different for stun? If you buy the stun aa, you become unstunabe from the front. If you are an ogre and you buy the aa, you should become unstunable at all. See, ogres still come out ahead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Lunaticfringesk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Desleg...Im sorry, but you have almost left me speechless with your post.  Its so flawed, I almost dont know where to begin.  You say that we, or perhaps even just I, am posting *nonsense*.  You are truly laughable.<br />
<br />
I can argue this like 10,000 different ways, but the easiest, by a country mile, is to just say, it is NOT a race issue.  All those lines of argument that you posted, as faulty as they are, are meaningless.<br />
<br />
Its a class issue, which you took a wild stab at defending, but to absolutely no avail.  It borders on the utterly laughable Im sorry to say.<br />
<br />
Lets examine your arguement in closer detail:<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Warriors are -THE- tanks.&quot;<br />
<br />
Umm.  OK.  Whatever this means.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;They should have all sorts of tankable bonus's AA's at thier disposal. &quot;<br />
<br />
They do.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;SK's/Pal are not ONLY good for tanking. Sure they do it good, but they can do many other things then just tank&quot;<br />
<br />
Oh really??  Tell me then, what is the overwhelming function of a SK/PLD then?  What---you want to AoE or something?  DD the mobs down?  In case you didnt know, we suck at that.  An SK/PLD *IS* a tank.  We just use spells to supplement our tanking ability.  We are not just added DPS, for if we were, we would become completely expendable, as other melee classes will often outdamage us, sometimes considerably.  An SK/PLD is every bit as much as tank as a WAR is, they just do it via different methods.  I am of the belief now that, all things equal, an SK can tank substantially every bit as good as a WAR, save for *boss* mobs.  That is about it.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Why not allow a class that is there pretty much just to tank, to gain an ability like that? Makes alot of sense to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yeah.  Ummm, see comment above in the first place.  Additionally, this is in complete conflict with the flawed argument you posted about why no other race should get this ability... /sigh.  Just think about it and hopefully you will see it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;The benefit of being an Ogre warrior over a Troll as a war is still there. Regen as a main tank really won't matter much. When your quaded for such high amounts of dmg, the regen is negligable. &quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
This has to be my *FAVORITE* comment you made.  WTF?   Are you serious?  If Troll had the aa ability, then, according to your *logic*, if I can even call it that, would *negate* the advantage of being an ogre.  Further, the fact that one of them is playing the MT role and regen meaning essentially *nothing*, is equally foolish.  Having regen is an advantage, despite how unvaluable you view it.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Warriors dont fear kite, or solo, so the regen doesnt really help with their down time.(yes some wars can solo in some places, but lets just say in general they do not solo like a SK or even a pal vsUD). Therefore the benefit is much less in regen over the no frontal stun +superior melee stats which allow more flexibility (unless in high end guild) with what gear you wear&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
This comment just shows volumes of your inexperience.  You have concluded that only when a *tank* type class &quot;soloes&quot; or fear-kites that regen is needed.  It has been argued by many that regen AA can be, and often is, more valuable then increasing your total HP via increases in STA.  I shutter to walk you through why, however, as it would probably be a waste of time.  It all goes back to the fact that, despite how *worthless* you believe regen is to a *tank* type, or MT, it *IS* a nice ability to have.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;So yes, there is logic behind it. &quot;<br />
<br />
No, there is absolutely no logic whatsoever, at least at the moment, and surely after your post, there appears even less.  <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;There is no logic behind adding such a skill for SK's, seeing as Regen is much more usefull to SK's, therefore the switch off isn't so simple, as with Warriors&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Regen is substantially just as useful to WARs as it is to SKs.  Soloing isnt the only time that regen is useful and your lack of experience is glaringly obvious.  What if you are freshly rezzed?? Or are in a raid where the battle will last for quite some time?? Or your healer died in your xp group and you are low on health?  There are numerous reasons why regen is important far above and beyond soloing and they apply equally well to both SKs and WARs.  Also, it is *NOT* common to see SKs soloing in PoP zones, especially upper tier PoP zones, so the solo argument holds little, if any, weight too.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is not a &quot;nonsensical rant&quot; as you like to call it.  There is very clear cut logic behind what I am saying and I can walk you through it if you still dont get it.<br />
<br />
I wont even touch the *race* argument, except to say that you are way off base.  The XP penalty is meant to *balance* the classes that have inherit abilities with those that dont.  Ogres, trolls, and Iksar *ARE* superior races, as they have inherit abilities that the other races dont, hence the xp penalty exists to *balance* everything out.  The ogre has the xp penalty *BECAUSE* it would take another race that much longer to get the same ability via AA.  Its so obvious, Im am just stunned that you dont get that.<br />
<br />
It seems glaringly obvious to me that you want ogres to be *superior* to all other races, not equal.<br />

Edit : yea Luna 's point is right regen is good when there is downtime/cleric down or such, it helps but eventually you won't regen to full health before cleric/healer throw you a CH/dot heal. ( get yourself Pach of Hate, summon an eye dot tap it + fungi is fast)<br />
OR  when you are fighting mobs that hits you for 300+ and cleric down, regen helps too but I guess yo are going to chain lifetap and wait others to heal you or so , well at the time unstunnable helps you while you are casting and I don't think that 10-20+ regen helps much since mob hits for 300+</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wow.  Utterly amazing.<br />
<br />
Ok.<br />
<br />
Assume the following:<br />
<br />
It takes a DE SK 4,000,000 XP to reach level 65.<br />
It takes a IKS SK 5,000,000 XP to reach 65. <br />
For the DE SK to get the same regen via AA, it requires 1,000,000 XP.<br />
The only difference between the 2 races is the regen ability.<br />
<br />
This example is crude and the numbers are pulled out of the sky, but it illustrates an important concept:  the XP penalty is meant to *balance* the races.  In the example above, it does so perfectly.<br />
<br />
All things equal, the DE SK will *always* be a higher level (or have more AAs), as the IKS paid the penalty for having regen from inception.  The only way the IKS *catches up* to the DE is when he spends XP getting the regen ability.  Hence, the races are balanced.  Who gives a damn about if another race can get the ability via aa or not.  One race has it from inception, the others dont.  That is an advantage.  The race that has the advantage should be burdened with an xp penalty.  If there was no xp penalty, all races would not be equal (debatable if they are now, but that is another story).<br />
<br />
Your question about why someone would pick a race and struggle with the xp penalty when all others can get it via aa at a later time is so senseless, I am struggling to reply to it maturely.  I mean, just think about it.  Its really obvious.  Further, there are a myriad of reasons why people pick the races that they do and some of them have nothing to do with an XP penalty.<br />

However I will argue this (well aware of what is coming my way about how you felt reading it) in order to give an alternative to your &quot;one truth&quot;.<br />
You said that in theory a (say) DE sk will &quot;always&quot; be higher lvl than a race under the exp penalty. I agree with this.<br />
This is because the races that have some abitities that the DE hasn't, are given an exp penalty. In other words you can put it like this: &quot;In order to BALANCE out the fact that some races have abilities others dont have, they are given an exp penalty&quot;. You said it yourself Luna, &quot;the exp penalty is meant to balance the races&quot;.<br />
Then what happens to that &quot;balance&quot; you like talking so much about if suddenly the DE gets these same abilities (via aa's)?<br />
I totally understand your desire to get &quot;unstunnable from the front&quot; ability, I even know how frustrating it can be sometimes, but how you state that as being balancing of the races if you got that is totally beyond me.<br />
&quot;Balance&quot; is keeping the races even to a degree (not identical). &quot;Balance&quot; is not about giving all the good stuff to some races while others are left with less.<br />
<br />
So, enjoy your race's ups and downs and be glad you picked what you did...and finally...boy am I glad balancing is SoE's job :)<br />

Sorry, this makes no sense to me.  A races that was *born* with the ability wouldnt have to waste time accumulating, say, 5 AAs to get it.  Further, they will enjoy it throughout their lives, not just at the *higher* levels.  That is an advantage.  The race that has the ability can spend their time working on other AA abilities.

<br />
Great point.  Similar (not identical) to regen for IKS/TRL.  <br />
<br />
One thing to note, however, is that ogres / trolls dont get to bash if they are in skellie form, which kinda sooks, as Deathly Temptation and, especially, Pact of Hate, are really nice mana regen spells if you have no other form of mana regen (C3/4/5, etc)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Squigle D'Muerte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Trolls and Iskar are still viable since added regen AA stacks with natural regen and unless you have played a Troll/Isakar to high levels you can't imagine how easy this makes solo fear kiting.<br />
<br />
With C3 and Mental Corruption I can fear kite blues one after the next without ever stopping to med.  Regen means I heal faster during a kite than other races do sitting down so as long as I keep mob feared it am healing up at a good rate.  Also means I can use Mental Corruption for mana instead of having to waste mana on life taps and Shroud of Death line of spells.  Life taps are NOT SKs strongest spells,  Fear is.  Lifetaps are very nice when things go wrong (Fear and life tap while NOT being hit) but otherwise not worth it.<br />
<br />
In some high level groups regen does mean almost nothing.  If grouped with a cleric -yes- cleric spells will normally overheal you so much your regen and life taps mean nothing.  If grouped with a Shaman though, his high level regen added to yours can mean considerably less other healing needed and it lasts a long time.  <br />
<br />
If you don't plan on soloing a lot then I would strongly suggest not playing a Troll/Iskar.  50+ leveling is hard enough without a experience penalty.  Personally I like not having to rely on a group to get my exp.<br />
<br />
Loseing the 2 handed bash benefit does hurt large races (who have little enough going for them) but I still prefer Trolls over Iskar for other starting attributes like STR/STA and ability to wear more types of plate armor.<br />
<br />
SKs strength is not in tanking but in their ability to maintain aggro.  I can gain more aggro in 2 rounds than a warrior can in 5.  This makes casters happy cause they get beat on less and on a raid it allows a SK MA to make much faster Assist calls.  We have all been annoyed with warriors MAs at some time who seem to take forever to make Assist calls or who can't maintain Aggro.  An SK who knows what he is doing will NEVER lose aggro when breaking a Mez. <br />
<br />
BTW saying that an AA ability that costs 5 AA points to give no Stun is balancing is extremely ignorant.  Ogres pay a penalty on leveling and AA experience as long as they play.  To say that 5 AA points is the same as playing 65 levels +100 AA points at an experience penalty is just dumb.  There is no point arguing about this however as VERANT HAS SPOKEN and is very unlikely to ever change their mind.</div></div><hr />

I do not want unstunnable all the way around...I do not tank mobs with my back to them so that is not an improvment.  Ogres get through 60 levels with a 15% exp penelty.  I would think that your AAs could work like regen.  Levels 51 have 3 levels avaliable:<br />

Firstly, your point on regen is exactly what I was saying when I said, &quot;similar&quot; to regen.  TRL/IKS regen will stack, and that makes a difference.<br />

&quot;SKs strength is not in tanking but in their ability to maintain aggro. I can gain more aggro in 2 rounds than a warrior can in 5. This makes casters happy cause they get beat on less and on a raid it allows a SK MA to make much faster Assist calls. We have all been annoyed with warriors MAs at some time who seem to take forever to make Assist calls or who can't maintain Aggro. An SK who knows what he is doing will NEVER lose aggro when breaking a Mez. &quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Isnt agro control a part of *tanking*?  And to make a comment as bold as *never* (how did you say it to me?) is extremely ignorant.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;BTW saying that an AA ability that costs 5 AA points to give no Stun is balancing is extremely ignorant. Ogres pay a penalty on leveling and AA experience as long as they play. To say that 5 AA points is the same as playing 65 levels +100 AA points at an experience penalty is just dumb. &quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
/SIGH.  5 AA was a complete EXAMPLE used to illustrate a point.  I thought that was pretty obvious and I even made a comment in a earlier post that the number(s) were *pulled out of the sky*.  If I was actually going to propose something worthy it would probably be in a manner very similar to the way that VI has ALREADY GIVEN this ability to WAR.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;There is no point arguing about this however as VERANT HAS SPOKEN and is very unlikely to ever change their mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yeah, Verant *never* patches changes to classes that they believed they over/under benefitted.../boggle<br />
<br />
At the end of the day, however, it is NOT a RACE issue.  Its a CLASS issue.  WAR get Stalwart Endurance and SK/PLD do not.  I still do not understand why.<br />

<br />
As some people have mentioned (including myself) - please look at the AAXP regens and troll/iksars.  What on earth does an unstunable AAXP offer an Ogre who suffers a penalty for the skill?  Now if you want to make ogres regen like trolls, then I can maybe see where your &quot;logic&quot; is, but until you give an alternative I don't see any &quot;logic&quot; in your remarks.<br />
<br />
I have a lvl 60 shaman, It is Vah Shir, As a shaman I am used to being able to tank slowed mobs if i draw aggro for a round or two, while people get things in order.  I know lvl 60+ sk's one inparticular in a relative &quot;uber guild&quot; decked out, Troll SK.  We partnered for quite a few levels (around 20-30levels'ish, if you count small hunting etc..).   If my shaman draws aggro, almost any POP mob will stun me at least 2 or 3 times in 2 or 3 rounds of combat.  The very rare situation would be only stunned once.  So yes stun is a big deal, as I know SK's (refer above) who also notice a large amount of stunning vs mobs of similar level.  <br />
<br />
The whole point you are making is, &quot;If warriors get it, why can't SK's?&quot;, Like I have said already and others have reenforced - Warriors are The Tanks.  What do warriors do? They tank.  Do you pick up warriors for DPS? How about for their nifty group buffs?  No, you pick warriors up to toss them infront of mobs, so you can CH them and get more bang for your buck per heal.  Therefore the fact that warriors can get an ability like this, is perfectly valid, seeing as that is their only role.  Again others have mentioned that as an SK (particularly in the 1-60 range) you can Solo for exp if you wish, and be efficient more often then not.  That is why we should not have it.  Ogres use their &quot;speacial&quot; ability in their later years to make it really worth it, while trolls and Iksars gain that &quot;speacial&quot; ability, and keep their innate regens (which do help with solo, 15+hps sitting regened raw without AA's in the 50's is way better then the 5 or 6 other races get without AA's, and I'm not even talking about the standing regen amounts.).  Once again your &quot;logic&quot; is nonexistant.  <br />
<br />
Let's examine the issue &quot;logically&quot;.   You can A) Suffer a 15% exp penalty to be unstunnable from the front, in effect making you better as a tank (not amazingly better, but still better in comparison to others with similar level/gear etc..)  or B) Suffer a 20% exp penalty and spend some points to gain unstunnability from the front, while gaining a massive regen bonus.   Theres not much of a choice that i can see between the two, can you seriously say theres a choice?  That's like making Iksar / Troll Regen an AA ability to gain the full effect that they have.  What benefit is then given to trolls/iksar? Not much, oh wait they have it for the first 59 levels of existence, but suffer a 20% exp penalty for it.  Yeah thats logical, 20% exp penalty or no exp penalty and in the long run, just as well off.<br />
<br />
The game has different races for a reason other then Roleplaying, if you want a game where everyone is the same, and all that you pick is the look, then play Communist EQ.  This however is not the case Comrade.  In addition to different roleplay looks, the races also *gasp* have different stats, abilities, and experience penalties for those abilities.  <br />
<br />
I would like to point out, that the fact that you two keep responding to these posts, even new posts, and then make statements like you &quot;could care less&quot; or such witty remarks to genuine questions as &quot;try search!'.  Is argueably better entertainment then most stations prime time line-ups.  I'd like to offer you an idea... If you do not care, do not read or post on these topics?  I know.. revolutionary idea, radical thoughts.. but please, try to understand that these are voluntary posts and boards.  To connect the dots further... You do care, so don't bs people like you don't.  Your bitter that your not as good as Ogres when it comes to straight up tanking (which is questionable, but Ogres still do have the edge, not gamebreaking, but still an edge), Your also bitter at the fact that your (regen for solo) choices, are not as viable after 60, when it is hard to find things that you can fear kite for exp efficiently.  So please, your fooling noone.<br />

Who in their right mind would choose to struggle through 60 lvls of exp penalty to enjoy a skill from lvl 1, if that same skill becomes available to everyone at 60? <br />
I would ask, if you leveled to 60 with a benefit that other SKs won't get until 59 + many AA points, why would you feel as if you're less important/capable?<br />
<br />
As was pointed out, Trolls and Ogres can bash without a shield from level 1, but other SK races can get the ability via AA points.  I don't see that this has led to fewer TRL/OGR shadow knights.  Nor do I see people devaluing a level 60+ TRL/OGR shadow knight as less useful now that one of their unique abilities is now shared by other 60+ shadow knights (or whatever the level is that you can get 2-hand bash).<br />
<br />
I think that this reinforces the point I was making in response to the question asked by the thread-starter.  Not being stunned from the front is a very nice ability to have, but have any non-ogre SKs ever been rejected as a main tank because 'I heard that you guys get stunned alot'?  Heck, ogres cannot be paladins, and paladins seem to have little trouble being accpeted as tanks in many exp groups.<br />
<br />
Giving SHD/PAL an AA that equals the ogre ability to avoid being stunned from the front won't affect ogres at all.  If someone decided to start a human SK instead of an ogre based on the reasoning that 'I'll get your abilities in 60 levels plus 30 AA anyway'-- well, I would not consider that to be a very intelligent approach to character creation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Im sorry, but this argument is Neanderthal in its conception.  You have tried to make a link between the fact that because a WAR exists only to *tank*, they should have this AA available.  Well, why is that?  Many might argue that a rogue or monk exist only for melee DPS, so they should be given this aa.  Others may say, well, my chanter/shaman exists to mez/root/slow, etc, so they should be given this aa.  Clerics may argue that they get *heal agro*, so they should get this aa.  Why *should* this be limited to *tank* classes in the first place?  While an argument may exist for who would get the most benefit out of this, that is irrelevant.  AAs exist all over the place that would benefit one class far more than another, yet they are available to both.<br />
<br />
<br />
Further, another flaw in your argument is essentially making the claim the SK/PLD are *less of a tank* than a WAR is.  The problem is, of course, is that a SK/PLD *IS* every bit as much of a tank as a WAR is.  They just go about it in (moderately) different ways.  I make no conclusion about which class *is* the better tank (it may vary, depending on the situation), but an SK/PLD IS a tank; 100%, through and though.  <br />
<br />
Almost every one of your *logical* comments above, if they can be called that, can be applied to an SK/PLD.<br />
<br />
What do SK/PLD do?  They tank.  Do you pick them up for DPS?  How about their nifty buffs?  No, you pick a SK/PLD up to toss them in front of the mobs, so you can get excellent agro control, whlie still getting a solid CH off (and various other reasons too).  Therefore, the fact that SK/PLD should get this ability like this is perfectly valid, seeing as that is their primary role...<br />
<br />
(Im waiting for someone to say, oh, well, SK/PLD *can* buff people...yeah, right.  That is exactly why I just invited my PLD friend to join my group last night in HoH--we couldnt live without BMB../sigh)<br />
<br />
You continue and actually suggest that because an SK can SOLO (??) they shouldnt have access to this particular AA ability.<br />
<br />
So, this is it.  This is as good as it gets.  The linchpin of your entire argument.  An SK can solo, therefore, they shouldnt have access to this aa ability. /shakes head...<br />
<br />
Apparantely, you are focused in on being a tank, so, lets examine that.  Under this school of thought, either you would be a tank class or you wouldnt.  Well, the fact that one class has the ability to solo is completely irrelevant.  Just because an SK can solo doesnt take away, in any way, shape, or form, their abiity to tank.<br />
<br />
Further, a PLD cant solo nearly as efficiently as a SK can, so should they be given access to that ability?   /boggle<br />
<br />
Its craziness.  I mean, lets take the flip side.  A monk isnt generally regarded as a superior *soloer*.  They are picked, I guess, pretty much for DPS.  So, should they be given SE also?  <br />
<br />
Additionally, Akeikyl beat me to the punch and he is exactly correct in his reference to 2H bash.  SE would work under the exact same idea.  The funny thing about 2H bash, however, is that 2H bash aa ability is actually *BETTER* then slam, as you can bash even while in skellie form (Deathly Temptation, Pact of Hate, etc.)<br />
<br />
I believe Lizarde is also correct in his comments also.<br />
<br />
It just doesnt make any sense for SK/PLD, at a minimum, to not be granted SE.  Id argue that any class should be able to get this aa, but, if for some odd reason it is limited to *tank* classes, there is absolutely no way that a WAR should get this and a SK/PLD should not.<br />

Why don't you guys get up in arms about this? Simple though it's nice it doesn't take away from anyone's group desireablility.

That being said, let me dignify it with a reply. Luna's arguments are all logical. Please examine the following:<br />
<br />
F: x cant be stunned from the front<br />
G: x cant be stunned<br />
H: x has natural regenration<br />
I: x can be replicated with y at the cost of AA<br />
J: x has an experience penatly.<br />
<br />
A: x is an Iksar SK<br />
B: x is an Ogre SK<br />
C: x is a Dark Elf/Human/other non troll iks ogr race SK<br />
<br />
A2: x has the static ability a2<br />
<br />
Vx(Ax --&gt; Hx^Jx)<br />
Vx(Bx --&gt; Fx^Jx)<br />
Vx(Cx --&gt; ~(Hx&lt;&gt;Fx)^~(Jx))<br />
<br />
Sony would have us believe the reasonable statements that:<br />
Vx(Ax&lt;&gt;Bx&lt;&gt;Cx --&gt; A2x=)                            Axiom: 1.1<br />
<br />
How was axiom 1.1 achieved? Through the following transformation [T here represents a Sherian transformation]:<br />
VxVyT(A2x &gt;A2y ---&gt; JxA2x)<br />
<br />
Based on this and throguh substitution and by proprties seven and sixteen of Sherian transformations:<br />
Vx(Fx^~Bx --&gt; MA,Hx [Ma represents modal all]       Result 1.1<br />
<br />
This is the core of Luna's argument and her reasoning is obviously valid and sound here. In other words, axiom 1.1 is maintained as long as the transformation in result 1.1 is followed, so an AA ability for lack of stun is, in fact via symbolic logic, reasonable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Lizarde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">Originally posted by Aaoogaa Soulhunter <br />
I could agree with giving other races unstunnable from the front as an AA as long as the AAs would also stack with the natural ability i.e. Troll/ Iksar regen.  Since there is no way to add a benefit to unstunnable from the front then their is no way that this should be made an AA avaliable for everyone else.  I do not want unstunnable all the way around...I do not tank mobs with my back to them so that is not an improvment.  Ogres get through 60 levels with a 15% exp penelty. <br />
Trolls and Iksar get through 60 (or 65) levels with a 20% exp penalty.<br />
<br />
If I want your resistance to bash as an AA, and you want my regen as an AA in turn, then I think it would be reasonable to then lower the IKS/TRL exp penalty to 15% as well.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, we're still paying a penalty for our regen, even if we do get your ability to resist stuns from the front.</div></div><hr />
