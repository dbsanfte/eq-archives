<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Skazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anyone suggested the idea of a disc that forces lifetap crits for say 20 seconds (or whatever the turns out to be a reasonable amount of time after some testing) as an alternative to any sort of defensive disc.<br />
<br />
Was just getting beat on by some Kod'Taz named and was thinking &quot;ya know, with garunteed ToI and ToV crits I could place those nicely to help offset some of the mob spikey DPS output.<br />
<br />
Anyway.. just a thought and I hadn't seen the idea anywhere that I could remember.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">yes people have suggested this, however what you and they propose is not a very good solution.<br />
<br />
healing != mitigation.<br />
mitigation scales, lifetap crits would not. this is why leech touch is generally useless.</div></div><hr />

Just getting a tap off while tanking is painfully unreliable, as is synchronizing a tap so as not to be overlapping with incoming heals...your first mitigation priority (aa's aside) is having high AC in order to take fewer max hits. Our healing isn't meaningful mitigation even if it crits; spikes of dps from a mob in GoD are not reduced by reactive self-healing (i.e. they will still drop you dead before you can get a tap off).<br />
<br />
Our real issue continues to be, as ever, our inadequate innate mitigation capacity, which would scale if it were ever improved.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Skazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Understandable.. was just in a situation last night where had I had a couple crit taps and no stuns to contend with the outcome of a fight would have been different and got me thinkin.<br />
<br />
Dyrkk - totally understand what you are saying and I completely agree with you.</div></div><hr />
