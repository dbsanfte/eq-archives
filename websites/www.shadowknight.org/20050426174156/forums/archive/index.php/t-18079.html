<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Chasliza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all :)  I am on the xev server and I just started an iksar SK.  I had 2 weapons when I started but someone gave me something better so I deleted both of them.  I later heard that one of the weapons was needed for the greenmist epic.... I have no idea what to do now!!  Can someone tell me if there is a quest for me to get back my weapon or do I NOT really need it??<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated :)<br />
<br />
Thank you!!<br />

Go back to the shadow knight guild. Up by the left tower there is a shadow knight trainer who will give you the pennance quest to regain your lost khukri. You have to say something to him such as &quot;What Pawn's Khukri&quot; or &quot;I lost my Pawn's Khukri&quot;.<br />
<br />
He will hand you a book. Bring that to the Toilmaster. He will hand you a second book in exchange for the first. Ask him for a bag and a Hammer of Pennance (I believe that is what it is called). <br />
<br />
Head over to the skeleton necromancer in West Cabilis (he is in a building by the necromancer guild). Ask him for a mortar and pestle.<br />
<br />
This is the fun part. Equip that awful hammer and head out into the field (I went to Kurn's Tower because I needed bone chips and decided that killing two birds with one stone was more productive). Start attacking everything. The hammer proccesses an effect which produces bone shards. You put eight of those in the pestle and combine it.<br />
<br />
That will produce bone dust. Put the bone dust in the bag. I think you need seven bone dust and one flask of bloodwater in the bag (you can buy the bloodwater from an Iksar merchant in Eastern Cabils). Combine it then bring that back to that first shadow knight guild master I mentioned along with the book that the Toilmaster gave you.<br />
<br />
In return you will recieve your Pawn's Khukri again.<br />
<br />
Been a little bit since I did the quest but I am pretty sure that is how it goes. Other races can do this too (I am an Erudite and I did it).<br />
<br />
You may want to check allakhazam first just in case I forgot something or posted it out of order.</div></div><hr />
