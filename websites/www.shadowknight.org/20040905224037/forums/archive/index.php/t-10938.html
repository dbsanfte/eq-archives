That is a GUILD raid items, on guild raid POINTS system. A ULTRA rare drop, and I will NEVER see it. People come up with &quot;get X item' knowing full well that is NOT attainable.<br />
JUPKE, you are the one is is an dumb. Read the above post and contest it HONESTLY! You can't jack ass. Verant honestly made a mistake when they designed this item. It made Gnomes WAY overpowered, but I never see any discussion about that do I?<br />
I like soloing, and a Gnome BURIES any other race because of ONE item for soloing. My warrior has camped the eye patch of plunder for 70 hours total so far. IF I can get the camp, IF I don't get KSed, IF Stormfeather )finally appears. That is WAY to many ifs for an item with HALF the haste of those arms, that are clickable and easily recharged with POI class 5 batteries I already have.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lunaticfringesk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I guess my only comment would be that if you are someone who is into soloing a ton, why on earth make a SK?<br />
<br />
In general, a NEC, DRD, WIZ, etc seem far more equipped for soloing then an SK will almost ever be.  As a matter of fact, if fear-kiting is your thing, then why not make a NEC?  They are going to be able to do it far better than an SK can.<br />
<br />
Yes, an SK can solo, and, in certain situations, solo fairly well.  However, that doesnt eliminate the fact that a SK is a tank and is a very nice addition for a group.  <br />
<br />
Re: THO belt.  I actually passed on that item.  The STA buff does NOT stack with SHM STA buff, which eliminates a huge portion of the appeal of that item.  Furthermore, the haste doesnt stack with any other spell haste either (that, however, was expected).<br />
<br />
I suppose that it would be a fairly decent item for soloing, but by the time you are of the level to join a guild strong enough to get it, you will probably either have (or desire) an item that is better or wont be soloing all that much (I am aware of a few 61+ SKs that solo, but they are definitely few and far between)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Skurrge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Are people still stupid enough to not know that haste items DO NOT STACK?<br />
<br />
What does stack is a haste spell, a haste item, and a haste bard song.  If you wear 2 haste items, the haste DOES NOT ADD UP.  You get the haste of the higher haste item.<br />
<br />
Anyway... playing a gnome over an ogre is about as idiotic as it gets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Akeikyl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">No they all stack for real! :p  Cha affects how long fear lasts and if you want to do epic part 2 you have better had kept your newbie starting sword, because you need to turn it in to start the quest. But to answer your question yes people are still that stupid and still cling to this horrible misinformation and more. They nerfed Jboots to they are slower now too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Lunaticfringesk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">&quot;Are people still stupid enough to not know that haste items DO NOT STACK?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Hmm--not quite sure if this is a flame or not.  If it was, I suppose my reply would be, &quot;are people still stupid enough not to read what is written?&quot;<br />
<br />
It seems very clear that the previous message said that the haste items were NOT expected to stack.  Therefore, as chanter and shaman haste will *supercede* the haste from Marvelous Visions, which just further compounds the *problems* with this item, as SHM STA overrites Marvelous Visions also, it primarily becomes a solo item, as in a group, you are most likely not going to get a lot of benefit out of it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>DaOgre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">This goes to show the COMPLETE lack of knowledge of any player bashing gnomes. Here is the skinny on haste.<br />
<br />
one item+one spell+one bard song, period, and THE FACTS, did you know though the eye patch stacks with speed of vallon? Try it. The arms are a SPELL, I want to solo a MELEE, not a necro, gnome SK is THE choice!!!!!!!!!!!!! The arms WILL stack with my CoF!!!!!!! That is 76% haste, self buffed, that is FAR beyond the max you can get of 61% with eye patch and a 41% item.<br />
<br />
I CAN NOT GET THE EYEPATCH IT IS CAMPED 24/7/365 GOT IT NOW PEA BRAIN!!! I CAN NOT GET THE BELT AS MY RAID POINTS WILL NOT ALLOW IT!<br />
<br />
A gnome will own you soloing, get over it, just cause you don't like the race doesn't mean they are the UBEREST MOFO SK SOLOER THERE IS!!!!!!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Paynreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">A gnome will own everyone over soloing.<br />
<br />
Yes. They have some distinct advantages. However, that is one of the most simply ignorant statements i have ever read. Your arms will not grant you a huge advantage. Dont get me wrong, 40% clicky haste is GREAT, but compare it to other races' advantages:<br />
<br />
- More INT<br />
- More STR/STA<br />
- Innate Slam<br />
- Innate Regen<br />
- AC Boost (Iksar)<br />
- Ability to wear different size armor<br />
<br />
(Obviously, those are not all ONE race)<br />
<br />
Now, its clear that YES your haste arms help you, but they do not make you the BEST.<br />
<br />
There is no best. There never has been. There never will be. Dont make yourself look incredibly ignorant by making a large blanket-statement about how your class is better than all the others.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Lunaticfringesk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Like it or not, gnomes make terrific SKs, but Im not so sure it has anything to do with soloing.  They have better stats than a number of other SK races (i.e. DE, ERU, etc.), and there are unconfirmed comments out there that they actually level faster than all other SK races (/boggle).<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;one item+one spell+one bard song, period, and THE FACTS, did you know though the eye patch stacks with speed of vallon? Try it&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
I dont think so.  If you think just because both haste spells show up in your buff box that you are getting *stacking* haste, I can tell you that SoV will stack with Celerity in much the same way, but you dont get SoV and Celerity haste combined.  Spell haste has similar rules, as far as stacking, as perm haste does--the higher one is applied.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;A gnome will own you soloing, get over it, just cause you don't like the race doesn't mean they are the UBEREST MOFO SK SOLOER THERE IS!!!!!!!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
I think you are setting yourself up for a big disappointment.  If you think that a few more percent of haste is going to make/break your solo ability, you are gravely mistaken.  The only thing that is probably going to make a significant difference on your ability to solo is getting some form of mana regen cast on you (i.e. c3).  Increasing your DPS a few points isnt going to make a gigantic difference.  Mana regen is the ticket to soloing.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not that it is wrong at all, hell, you can solo a cleric for all I care, but I guess Im interested in why you want to solo a *melee*?  You seem very concerned about this characters ability to solo, so it kind-of begs the question of why play an SK?  A NEC (all things equal), for instance, will just *own* a SK in terms of ability to solo.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Akeikyl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Your a Moron! It's one haste item + one haste spell or song + Special Bard Songs like Warcry of the Vah shir etc. Only these special songs allow you to break the haste cap and the first rule one item + one song or spell. Though both icons show up your only receiving haste from the most powerful one. Though you will receive other benefits from the spell/song. Example Monks prefer VoG over SoV because it allows their epic to stack. However understand that the haste portion of their gloves clicky does not stack. Only the AC and Atk potions stack into the mix not the haste. It's to fucking simple people.<br />
<br />
One Haste Item + One Spell or Song + Special Bard songs.  (all other effects may stack in but only the highest haste's are applied)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>chardrok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Why as everyone slamming DaOgre.  I think that a gnome SK is a perfect choice for him.  He undoubtedly is a gnome at heart, and should follow his fancy.  Hurry up and create DaGnome and get to the Steamfont newbie zone.<br />
<br />
When I think gnome sk, I think twink, fast leveling, good solo int.  These are all his arguments for changing, and frankly, I can't argue against them.  No one item is going to overbalance a gnome sk anyway, but you can't blame a guy for going with his true self.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for DaOgre changing into DaUberGnome, thats his choice if he feels like being a gnome.  Gnomes have pretty good stats for an sk but lack the strength and stamina which are made up with items.  <br />
<br />
My prefrences for picking an ogre was for the slam, excellent strength and stamina, cool armor look, and their superior tanking ability.  Gnomes on the other hand never came out when I started and don't have the armor look that suits my tastes.  The only reason that I see for hating gnomes is that they don't look or feel &quot;evil enough&quot; to be an sk.(Bick is an exception)  I've soloed all the way to 41 and bought sentient armor to make up for my intelligence deficit.  (I haven't had the chance to update my old magelo profile but my Intelligence is 118)<br />
<br />
Each race has its advantages and disadvantages, but in the end it comes out to what you want to be.</div></div><hr />

40% clickable haste is to much to pass up. All other SK races are dead for solo, they can't hack the overwhelming advantage.<br />
<br />
DaOgre<br />
now DaUberGnome!<br />
<br />
Remember if you aren't a POWER GAMER, you just leave a pretty corpse!  <br />
<br />
if you are referring to the new clickable gnome armor, then you DO understand that the armor has charges, right? and that means money for batteries for the charges, and a LOT more money to spend if you want to tinker and smitht he stuff yourself. <br />
<br />
so its not as good as its cracked up to be. but more power to you if you think you can swing it.</div></div><hr />

Im not crazy on the stats for watchman/observer armor so i just keep my vambs in my bag untill i feel the need for speed.<br />
<br />
 <br />
 The price of batteries is insignificant because you will be able to drop mobs slightly faster which will result in more plats per hour unless your fighting in a zone with no/poor drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Rugs Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Pick what you want, cause it wont matter in the end.<br />
<br />
Yep...regen, AC bonus, mana, slam immunity...who cares if you dont like your own character?<br />
<br />
This is a debated topic, as most people attempt to oppress others with their view...having &quot;evidence&quot; to who is the best.<br />
<br />
Tanking: a gnome sk will have the same hps as an ogre, cause if you cant cap stamina with shaman buffs at 65 than your hardly even a twink.  The stun aspect is nice for sure, but for a class that can regain aggro in seconds or maintain it through being stunned...its not as big an issue as for warriors.<br />
<br />
Soloing: Who cares if you have 120 or 400 intelligence?  If you cant kill something solo with 120 intelligence or even less (your complete bar), its most likely too difficult to kill in the first place.  <br />
<br />
Fear kiting you are constant procing Mental Corruption and probably liching, so your spells hardly even take a toll.<br />
<br />
Aggro kiting your going to get back mana at almost the same rate if you have kei or pact of hate up.<br />
<br />
So in the end, its not total mana for exp, its mana regen or simply not dieing.  When i die from soloing (hardly ever), i usually have half a mana bar left at least.<br />
<br />
Raids: mana is nice for this on certain mobs that your trying to sustain health and save healer mana, mana that should be shot to rogues and tanks that cant heal themselves.  <br />
<br />
In this case, having more base intelligence is a big advantage, but your still going to have lifetap procs from weapons and spells to keep you alive.  If your here, then some base intelligence wont matter anyways.  If your guild wipes it wont be cause a SK died a few minutes early.<br />
<br />
I play an 61 ogre sk with decent gear.  I solo well, I tank well, and I truly enjoy my class/race.  <br />
<br />
I also think gnome sk's are cool looking, probably duel well (hard to hit what you cant find), and envy their lack of needing to buy shrink potions.<br />
<br />
I even think humans and Inkies look awesome even dispite some of their disadvantages for a tanks job.  Then again, I only really tank in grind groups...and a good group could have a shaman tank...so whats the big deal?<br />
<br />
So, am I going to start over and make a small race...grinding aa's to make the difference that i might miss?  No, i love my ogre cause I really enjoy being huge and role playing a big :)<br />
<br />
Am i going to rant on and on how some class doesnt have innate slame, slam immunity, regen, ac bonus, etc and therefore they suck?  No, who honestly cares?<br />
<br />
If you have fun playing, can hold your own in the arena, might be able to solo something if needed, and generally have a sinister outlook on the game...your SK enough in my eyes.  <br />
<br />
Just dont go making us look stupid by mocking other classes who I might be trying to group with someday, rofl.</div></div><hr />
