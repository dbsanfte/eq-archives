<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Chayde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a question, did SV sell the Message board too, or just the URL? So say, when he gets back on his own two feet, he can move the message board to somewhere else, fully intact? Like shadowknightz.org? (See the z in there, for those d00d speakers to feel welcome)<br />
<br />
I only ask because I got tired of wading through the other crap and never saw the answer anywhere else.... Not like he would want to after some of the bull shit going on now, but still curious.<br />
<br />
<br />
Some of the people from s-k.org (not all SOME) are starting to edit their posts to nothing on them.  (Bannable offense if you ask me!)  Claiming SV sold &quot;their&quot; thoughts and such.. But if SV still owns the boards (just not the package they are wrapped in) doesn't that mean technically their &quot;thoughts&quot; were never sold? (Sure as hell aint them! They needed someone else to tell them to come delete their posts)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, I read both forums, like many of the people do. I am not a great contributer here, and even less so there. But the thought of them deleteing their posts here, hit a nerve. I mean, how childish can one act. &quot;On noz, mommy won't give me a cookie, lets destroy the kitchen&quot; WTF talk about having a 3 year old's mentality.</div></div><hr />

Edit::D  <br />
<br />
Since there is absolutely nothing else to do I guess I can get down to it. Derraj, why do you exist ? I can't think of anyone, on any board that annoys me as much as you. I know that's what you try to do but God Damn, you suck at it so bad it is actually annoying. You remind me of a teenager brimming with zits and a greasy forehead that can't find any friends so he has to sit at home and pretend his sisters barbie dolls will actually give it up to him. For the times his sister is actually playing with her barbie dolls (while not defending her older brother from bullies), he logs on to the internet to become someone he will never be. Or at least make a brave attempt at becoming the person he will never be. You're not even a computer geek, they're halfway smart and witty. I just can't pinpoint you. Usually dorks and geeks are great at being someone they're not on the internet but you can't even get that right. <br />
<br />
I would have thought that you might have realized this fact a long time ago and sank into a deep depresssion as friendless geeks sometimes do. That usualy leads to a couple things. <br />
<br />
#1 - Rebellious Geek, a geek who is sick of being a geek and will go to great lengths to prove he is not a geek. Things such as theft, drugs and running away from mommy. These rebellious geeks usually turn out to be computer programmers strung out on crack and booze but all the better for society really. <br />
<br />
#2 - Pussy Geek, a geek who is sick of being a geek but is too much of a pussy to become the rebellious geek. These geeks usually sink into a great depression which usually ends in suicide. Some make it out alive but those guys become CEO's and torment the Rebellious Geeks for the rest of their lives because they could not even compete with other geeks. These are bad for society.<br />
<br />
#3 - Loner Geek, these geeks are extreme geeks. The world revolves around them and they are brimming with knowledge you could never give a crap about. To them, this is the world though. They have realized that they were a geek, are a geek and always will be a geek and embrace that fact. To them , geek'dom is God'dom, for knowledge will rule the world and get all the hot chicks. These geeks are the worst, for they are right. The world does revolve around them and they get all the hot chicks and billion dollar companies. <br />
<br />
After reading months of your posts I still can't fit you into the right category though. You seem like you want to be Rebellious Geek yet slip into the Pussy Geek mode sometimes and I wonder if I will ever see another of your retarded posts again :P Maybe there is another category which I have not discovered yet... hrmmm.</div></div><hr />

For someone who found humour in a derelicts antics, you sure missed mine. I don't really have anything against him besides he tries too hard. Maybe you should have read the first line of my post which was &quot;Since there is absolutely nothing else to do ...&quot;. I thought it fun thinking up different categories of Geek :D Not to mention I was bored out of my mind. Is that not what trolls do ? And who is a better target than Derraj ? YOU!!!<br />

First off, to get things straight, I have no grudge over here.  I just want to be part of a board that SoE will even consider going to.

Actually they post on sites still, go check Monkly Business they get Dev posts still.  All having multiple boards does is seperates player communities and makes it far harder to communicate with game designers.  Otherwise theres no real impact on people either way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">It would be better for the SK community in terms of dev communication if one board or the other would die.  Seeing as the posters who fled to S-KO are by far the minority, and most represent lurkers or non-contributors (the core contributors either stayed or are posting on both), it's pretty clear SKO isn't going anywhere.  <br />
<br />
Fragmenting the community simply harms the SK community's ability to speak with a unified voice.  Furthermore, S-KO lacks most of the no-bullshit posters who keep posters like Forlane in check.  I shudder to think what would happen if SoE relied on the current poster base of S-KO for class balance ideas.  <br />
<br />
Dev's don't post on SKO much, and never really have, but it's not tied to a yantis affiliation.  Don't expect them to suddenly start popping up on S-KO.  <br />
<br />
Unless something changes significantly, the way things are developing, SKO will remain the core of the SK community, and S-KO will develop as a place for newbs to feel special and potentially, if managed well and the right people step up, as a decent source of information for newer/lower tier/level players to find some valuable information (though nothing they couldn't get here also).</div></div><hr />

Then you come forth with an actual comprehensible sentence sometimes, negating all I thought of you. I can't even rightly describe what I think of you, or know of you. I know you don't like beans but you like to use the word beans alot. You can mutter well and change the subject on a dime. People are confused by you yet act as if they know what the fuck you are talking about so as not to be the &quot;odd&quot; one who doesn't understand.
