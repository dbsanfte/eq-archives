<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xedd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi, I used to hate it when people did what I am about to do now but I figure hey the only person that matters is me so who cares right?<br />
<br />
There is some sort of slight chance that I might go about purchasing and playing eq again. However slight this chance may be I am curious as to whether or not my old comrads are pleased with the current state of EQ that is to say, is it still the same old shit, because the same old shit was pretty good at holding my attention even though everyone is a bunch of drama loving whiney babies. <br />
<br />
Is it worth playing this game again, honestly...? <br />
<br />
As a point of reference I quit a couple months pre-GoD.<br />
<br />
P.S. any old guild members who might see this would think better not to notify others of such a statement :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Skvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">if your pre GoD level then sure then game has very much to offer, although there is a trickle down perception that is hurting some Sks some of the time.<br />
<br />
GoD though ............ well from my own very limited experience we are next to useless. Maybe someone who has been playing around in GOD for a while would be better able to comment where roughly we go from being underpowered in GOD to plain broken</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Xedd, read my title</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Krushum Gudended</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">it doesnt say bring us up to par or fix us anymore, so i guess brael lost all hope<br />
<br />
i still find eq to be fun, xedd</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Xedd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I sold my account to a guild member<br />
He then sac'ed my toon down to level 46<br />
So I technically wouldn't be coming back as an SK, unless I elected to be an SK again. <br />
<br />
*hugs for brael though* I missed you!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tramlok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">dont do it , its a dieing game and sk is a dieing class. if you do come back dont pick an sk if you plan to get to end game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mordeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I find the game still has alot to offer. In fact while there are some issues with itemization (in that the slots i can upgrade are limited) at the levels i can hunt GoD has been a very fun expansion. There are lots of high skill low number encounters that are perfect for a small guild like mine. <br />
<br />
Also, most of the people I talk to in the High end GoD find it very fun as well.<br />
So it can caeter to most people<br />
<br />
I don't know if i could start all over again, but i do still think the game has alot to offer.<br />
<br />
As always if you have a good group of people to hunt with alot of our class issues can be mitigated to some extent (note to those ready to tee off i said mitigate not dissipate). I was tanking in Tipt (not the named of course) with less than 8khps and 1500ac (buffed) because some of my friends are really good at what they do...<br />
<br />
<br />
just my 2cps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Feriin Cydovu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Xedds' guild is toward the later part of PoP  and they are working on some GoD content.<br />
<br />
Sucks to hear that the guy sacked your SK down to 46. Though I am sure you could easily bring him back to 65 if you wanted to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Xedd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I should probably change my sig to reflect my current status</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kazh The Grim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hell no......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Eberan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">/disarm xedd<br />
<br />
Hey, Xedd...I sorta recently came back to the game as well. Not as much in a raiding capacity. But having fun doing ldon adventures and trying to solo stuff in GoD.<br />
<br />
What I hear from guildmembers in regards tp GoD is that, while it sucks not being able to progress because of broken content. Once the content is working, its quite well done.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I think the current state of the game is quite alright, its way better than anything else out there atm (Ive tried it all). Sure theres some balance issues regarding sks, but then again. It wouldnt be EQ if there wasnt :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ganaith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It all depends if you can spare the 6 hours a day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shurlock</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I continue to be amazed at people who say EQ is dead or dying.            Yeah, things are fucked up for high-end SKs, but it's pretty pathetic to say it's dying.               If it's dying for you, just go away and quit posting your Chicken Little bullshit here.            Find something useful for yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Askeer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">If you feel like playing EQ again, you should. It's still not a perfect game; but its good and GoD, now that it is for the most part debugged and tuned, is a very good expansion imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Xedd is Dead!<br />
<br />
Myself and the rest of the SK's in my guild still have a very good time playing. As with anything, a lot depends on the people around you and the general attitude you take. There are some areas for improvements in Gates, but also some very, very well designed encounters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Shurlock</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Doing Rathe Council tonight as I type this, so anything I may have <br />
typed indicating EQ is a wonderful game, please ignore.          I hereby rescind.             Sorry, Xedd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Theres encounters out there that are far less fun than Rathe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Call me sick and twisted, but I actually thought the rathe was kind of a cool event.<br />
<br />
Now I just don't want to do it again.  Ever.<br />
<br />
Ok, well maybe once, need a few friends to get time keys still.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Keyan Aubaine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Come back as a cleric named Xeddisdead, that way you'd be sure to play a class that won't ever suck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Vorth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Hey Peg leg :)<br />
<br />
While not a former guildie, guess I can spread the word  :D   Just kidding, yeah right.  Your guild is doing well,  and their is certainly still plenty to do outside of GoD.  However you'll find GoD sucks donkey balls.  If you come back, come back for PoP and the other expansions.</div></div><hr />
