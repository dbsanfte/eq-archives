<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>SweetMeef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just got Fire access and hope to start at the tables or thereabouts xping. A few questions before I leap out into the abyss:<br />
<br />
-do I kite it w/ snares/fear while necro/wizzie/dps nuke and/or hit on it; or does the necro/wizzie kite and I hit on it?<br />
-for lineup, off the top of my head I'd think Festering, Zevfeer's, Asystole, Clinging, Fear, FD, and maybe AoH or something?<br />
-anything else I should know now before I die from it a few times?<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />
<br />
(btw, search turned up &quot;fire spells &amp; BoH won't land most of the time&quot; and &quot;the xp rocks&quot;).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Reaniel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If your solo FD and BoH are your best bets with pet.  Maybe an occasional spear, but I'd wait till you've done a few mobs to make sure you've got the mana to handle it and BoH is our MOST efficient mana/damage spell in the book.  If your kiting for the group, better use FD and both fears.  Ignite blood never lands.<br />
Goodluck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>SweetMeef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Did tables today for the first time - piece of cake. Only issue i had was being lower elevation &quot;down the ridge&quot; from a mob and not being able to cast on him (spell bar goes 1/4 of the way and then just stops)...<br />
Had Festering and Clinging loaded for pull/aggro kitage.<br />
Threw on Asystole as mana allowed. Will try BoH next time.<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kelefane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Tables is easy....I always kite there.....Kited there and had a Wizard/Necro/Druid/Mage and rogue in group.....I didnt lose aggro one time in a 3 and a half hour or so session......I pulled w/ Festering and just basically casted Fear at each corner I turned....Festering+Fear = The win there when kiting for groups IMO</div></div><hr />
