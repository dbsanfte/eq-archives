<br />
Well I'm here to say, you can't. Why? <br />
<br />
Because /guildwar is broken, and sony doesn't want to fix it.<br />

Kazanti's Petition to fix guildwar, since Sony doesn't wish to give us what we paid for.<br />
<br />
They will revamp a zone, add in all kinds of funky new drops. But they will not fix this simple problem.<br />
<br />
Why is beyond me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Yoggi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">haha ... they didnt fix the team war servers either for 4 years...now we dont have any teams anylonger but just guildwars with the pain that you cant enimies which are in your team but all the rest ...<br />
<br />
If you want pvp join a pvp server --- quite easy... but check for the informal rules and powerstructures on those server first...else you might be disappointed</div></div><hr />
