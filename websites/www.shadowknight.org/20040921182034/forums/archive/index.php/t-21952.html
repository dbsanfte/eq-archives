<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well lets see what happened to me in Kod Taz today.  This was a comment made by a monk app to our guild during a group I was tanking in KT.  Now this group had a patch healer at the start (Shaman) and was later replace by an enchanter.<br />
<br />
Now this enchanter was landing slow around 60 to 70 percent health and the cleric who was not time geared or even elemental geared was going oom healing which was when the monk made the above commnet.<br />
<br />
Now I have every aa except for scs and innate wis and I am ranked 6 or 7 on eqrankings on my cazic thule.<br />
<br />
So if my tanking is that much noticibly worse then a warriors then something really is rotten in EQ.<br />
<br />
I sure hope you can do something to helpl us Brael the game is quickly losing any fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Slithinknott</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Thank you for the update.  i hate hearing this.  i will be Grinding in ldon for another month or more again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Slinstill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Problem 1:  Your chanter was waiting too long to slow.  If you can't have solid agro on inc so that your chanter/shaman can slow w/out being worried about pulling agro you should not be tanking there.<br />
<br />
Problem 2:  Your cleric is a little young to be healing in K'T.  Seriously,  I highly doubt that cleric could have kept most anyone up with the chanter taking so long to slow and having not even elemental gear.  In fact I'm suprised that Cleric even got thru the trials.</div></div><hr />

Fun, the reason i have always continued to play a sk was the strengths of the class when i started playing shortly after kunark came out.  I entered a raid guild sometime before velious and have been raiding ever since.<br />
<br />
Decent tank - tanking is my favorite part of the game.  Raid bosses were always out of my league but that wasnt a big deal, i tanked everything else.<br />
OK DPS - I like hitting stuff, weapons available to knights didnt make them dps kings but was enough that they werent a complete liability in that area.<br />
Uncontested aggro - Again i like to tank, no one having a chanse in hell of ever out aggroing if i so choose was a very appealing charateristic of the class.  If i felt like tanking, which i always did, other than not healing me there was nothing anyone could do about it.  Was a nice trade off for not being able to tank boss mobs.<br />
Decent pulling skills - with the exception of very skilled monks and harmony no one could do a better job of pulling then me even with the original FD spell.<br />
<br />
Everything fun that made me stick with this class, and i do have other  lvl 50 to 65 toons that quickly lost their appeal for various reasons, has been eroded by either lack of maintaince or out right nerfs.  Had i known then that the vision for the sk class was eventually going to be a non tank I would have certianly rolled up a warrior or paladin.  Why dont i roll up a new toon now ?  because im not willing to go through all the trouble of building another character to the level of play im at now.  Sony, in allowing people to sign up for and commit insane amounts of time to reach a certian level of personal acheivment doing what ever they happen to like to do in the game, and then pulling the rug out from under them with a different vision for their roll in the game is simply bad faith.<br />
<br />
Sony has never once acknowledged that there is an inappropriate gap in tanking or pulling skills between the classes.  They circumnavigated the whole issue before blaming the content and applied some *fix* to the content to *balence* it out.  Im thinking we can count on nothing being done at all and the tanking gap widening even further as new content is reached.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sibrius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It's not JUST the fact that we CAN'T tank as well as we should be able to, it's the fact we have lost nearly all fucking respect as a tank class in anyplace that requires any balls at all to fight at. I don't feel big or powerful like I used to, I just feel like &quot;a weak ass sk&quot; now on a daily basis and I don't see that changing much just because of gear, it's the SK part of it.<br />
<br />
Inferna, I retired 8 months ago back when my gear was pretty prime, was the top knight in guild and #2 or 3 sk on server, still back in Ele barely into Time back when Knights had it better off. I could still generate aggro and I used to like the feeling that you could walk past a line of warriors with equal or less hps and have them bow down.<br />
<br />
Coming back 8 months later when GoD was released was like night and day. First of all theres the nerf on aggro, second of all theres the obvious tanking problems and I HATE how some new members drool all over these knights that have gotten 500ish hps on me now, telling me I'm crap because to tank in GoD u have to be above 10k as a knight. I fucking hate that, we get no respect from anyone as a viable tank anymore exept for ldon and some pop and even there most would rather have war or pal.<br />
<br />
/rant off</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Belyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">When i said lack of maintance and nerfs i was refering to the time period between when i made a sk and today.  And there have been serious nerfs to aggro in that time period.  And 10k hps doesnt cover being able to off tank on god raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sibrius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">And 10k hps doesnt cover being able to off tank on god raid.<br />
<br />
I was (or they were) referring to exp groups here. KT in particular, but it applies to more.<br />
<br />
e.g. Ikkinz single group trials.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Maicom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I was the only person flagged for KT in my guild for a while, dragged some other people through sewers/vxed/tipt and now got a few others flagged.<br />
<br />
Now, afterwards, 3 of us decided to go to KT. Myself, a beastlord, and a cleric. We did fine killing trash mobs(I want the guise of seething or whatever). Course we weren't knocking shit out. Festering when mob gets close to camp, let bst slow, if it was a resist I kept kiting. Maybe a warrior can tank it better/more efficiently but its possible as an sk.<br />
<br />
Trials/named are completely out of my range though, which i guess is the real reason you would exp here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Belyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">We did fine killing trash mobs(I want the guise of seething or whatever).

.<br />
<br />
Id say most sks do alot of running away from mobs to avoid getting smoked, while warriors in the same gear dont.  That should say something right there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Thats what shows a problem, we have to (often) have a snared mob that we run like a bitch from.  Snaring a mob so it gets slowed on its way into camp is something I have to do often too, even in Tipt.  Thats one of the indicators of a problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Belyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">And we are talking about snare on a mob with none of its resists debuffed.  A resist or 2 on snare easily ends in tears.  On raids that tactic is useless unless your the main assist or its a single or unmezzable mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Adomander</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Sadly i hate tanking in God grps for some of the reasons stated above. In all honesty i feel like a mana dain, not only that but the whole session leaves me feeling seriously abused. :(  The only time i go there is with guild grp when farming vext named for spells etc.(which is as least often as possible). The only time i enjoy tanking in god is on raids, there is great saisfaction in out aggroing the wars  :D<br />
<br />
I do seroiusly hope these issues are addressed in the next expansion or ill seriously think about Putting Ado to eternal rest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Dkhar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">That's a pretty sweet pic for your sig Ado.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Vedark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">As sort of an aside from balance issues, your group may have made it look worse than it could have been.  If your enchanter doesn't slow on the pull one of you is doing something wrong. I talk to the slower if i'm in such a situation.  Secondly, there is a definitely cleric stigma you have to overcome in alot of pickups.  They just don't want to complete heal you.  I don't know if your cleric was spamming you, but its an educated guess that that was the case.  <br />
<br />
In KT a cleric will have no problem starting a complete prior to first hit on you, and then starting them shortly thereafter.  Some mobs will need spamming, and i'm sure you know which those are.  I tell my cleric which ones are going to tear into me beforehand.  At any rate, when the cleric sits there and spams you after every bubble or whatnot, you'll see another heal being cast.  These being cast with such frequency it makes it seem like you are getting folded in half instead of the much more casual completes. I'd like to think it was this type of behavior that the monk witnessed that made him want to bring it up.<br />
<br />
Not saying we don't need work, but i've been in the same situation there. constant spams from the cleric and soon they lose their mana and it looks like you are to blame.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Adomander</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">hehe thx. its a picture of my Mother in law :o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I know the enchanter was not slowing fast enough and I told him he wasn't.  On the other hand the cleric had poor gear.  But my point is that this gets blamed on the tank and yes a 10k SK with 2k ac or more should be able to tank this a lot better then we do .<br />
<br />
Yes I snare on incoming and I hope they can get it slowed before its starts hitting me but its rare that they do and often I see my hp drop 50 percent in one round on some mobs.<br />
<br />
My point is that if I am the number 6 sk or so on my server and there is really only two significantly above me in ac and hp.  Then what SK is supposed to be able to tank this well?<br />
<br />
I mean if I don't feel that I am tanking it well and I don't, then who is supposed to be able to?  This is not even the end game of GoD for chist sakes and its single group xp content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I find this scary...your equipment is light years ahead of mine...but if I was at your level of equipment and AA's I would have assumed that I &quot;should&quot; be a tanking god!<br />
<br />
If you are that high up on the list, and still are seen as a second rate tank, what chance do the rest of us have?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">You can tank it at level 70 :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Aye, SOE designed GoD content for lvl 70 in mind and forgot to re-tune it back down to 65 before the release. That was the MOST fatal mistake that SOE ever made in entire EQ history!!!<br />
<br />
That is very reason why SOE refused to improve knight tankability so they fix content instead cuz they KNEW that knights would do ok in GoD at 70 and re-tune some of GoD area back to 70 later (I hope not). Because if they fix knight tankability at 65 then those improved knights might be overpowered at 70 with new /discs, etc in SOE's eye I believe the reason why. So all they did was just to buy time til OOW comes out and hope to see knights whining to cease (doubtful if tank gap continues to widen). <br />
<br />
I sincerely believe that our tank gap against warrior and paladin would continue to widen even at 70 simply cuz of scalability. I think SOE would FINALLY give up and improve us ONLY if current tank problem persists even after OOW came out. I'm more than certain that SOE didn't really realize about paladin up to now as better tank over SK now all cuz of stun itself.<br />
<br />
That is why I just wait GoD out til OOW comes out then will farm GoD heavily at higher level. ATM, I continue to do lot of LDON runs trying to improve charm augs and buy more augs. Augs are much more attractive now cuz you can move them around easily. Thank Innoruuk. That way I can avoid GoD problem for time being. Heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Iohotep-CT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">First post on these boards, though I have viewed them for a long time. Just thought I post my 2 cents.<br />
<br />
 Problem 1: Your chanter was waiting too long to slow. If you can't have solid agro on inc so that your chanter/shaman can slow w/out being worried about pulling agro you should not be tanking there. <br />
<br />
Inferna doesn't have an agro problem. As a matter of fact shes pretty solid on keeping agro on a mob.<br />
<br />
 Problem 2: Your cleric is a little young to be healing in K'T. Seriously, I highly doubt that cleric could have kept most anyone up with the chanter taking so long to slow and having not even elemental gear. In fact I'm suprised that Cleric even got thru the trials. <br />
<br />
If I am not mistaken, the cleric in question was someones alt character. Another issue that could have added to the cleric running oom so fast is group dps. If your group is slow in killing a mob it is just a drain on healers, especially ill-equipped clerics. <br />
<br />
Regarding SK's tanking in Kod`Taz, its hard for sure, however I do manage to tank there fine with a well equipped cleric who knows what they are doing and a slower that gets the mob slowed quickly. I can also tank named there, though my survival rate is not neccesarily 100%. <br />
<br />
Our guild (Inferna's and mine) just started making the big push into GoD within the past 5 weeks or so. Needless to say you notice the strengths and weaknesses of a class fairly quickly there. I try to compensate by being the puller in K`T and the Ikkinz single group trials I have recently started doing. I'll never forget the first time I got wtfpwnd by a Kyv heh. GoD, and I am sure OoW, will have many challenges in store for us, I just hope we have a couple new abilities or something to help us survive there besides level 70.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Good to see you post here Tep.  Welcome aboard I hope you post more. <br />
<br />
Anyway I don't get invites for groups as puller or dps.  The only thing that I can manage to get a group for is to tank.  If I am seen as not being able to do that I am going to be stuck in PoE and PoF for ever.<br />
<br />
What I am saying here is yes there was problems in that group.<br />
<br />
But I don't see my self as being a good tank here.  And there lies the problem.<br />
<br />
If I am not a good tank there then what do I need to be one Braels gear thats well beyond that content.  As someone else pointed out Knights are the only group member in GoD that has to be geared beyond the content to do their job.<br />
<br />
So the problem could be one of the below<br />
<br />
1.  Not geared enough (then who is)<br />
2.  Sk's don't mitigage well enough for the content<br />
3.  The content is still not tuned correctly.<br />
4   Lack of riposte disk<br />
5.  Sk's are no longer a viable tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Howlitoezis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Im sick of everyone sayiong &quot;it's level 70 content, thats why you cant tank it.&quot;<br />
All this does is reaffirm just how FUCKING overpowered warriors discs are.<br />
If its level 70 content, then why the FUCK are 65 (and lower!) warriors able to tank it so well?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Aye cuz /disc defense at 65 still can scale well against 70+ mobs. Even warrior at 50 of /disc defense still can scale equally well against 70+. That is truly broken mechanic of /disc defense.. SOE shouldn't never ever introduce it in game in the first place and we are paying for their mistake for years.<br />
<br />
The reason why lvl 70 would make /disc seems less powerful relatively.<br />
<br />
FOR EXAMPLE.. If we are capped out at lvl hmm 55 and fight in BOT, we, knights would find it sooo hard to tank BOT and we would end up begging warriors to tank and we NEED warriors /disc to tank simple named in BOT at all the time cuz we might be 1-rounded.. Fast forward to 65.. Warriors HARDLY needed /disc in BOT at all. Why need defense?  BOT is CAKE.. ALAS! Knights can tank very well in BOT at 65. /disc is largely ignored there..<br />
<br />
Same for GoD,  we are 65 in lvl 70 content area. We experience the same thing as I mentioned above about BOT. Once we hit 70, warrior would find the less need of using /disc defense cuz mobs there become easier to handle at lvl 70.<br />
<br />
How to fix that? Simply FULLY disable /disc defense in NEW expansions ONLY so they can tune mobs properly. Alas, knight and warrior tank margin is largely closed. Warriors shouldn't scream cuz they STILL can use /disc defense in ALL expansions up to GoD and they only cannot use it in OOW or beyond for example. I think that's a good fix and good trade-off and get EQ fixed. Just same as CH, SOE try to kill it by capping it out at 7500 and have new expansions and have tanks hp growing beyond 7500 more easier than before that minimize the effectiveness of CH and Clerics ended up using new healing spells to replace CH due to fast cast time, etc. SOE did good job on phasing out CH but they seems can't find a way to phase /disc defense out AT ALL!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>bastardlunatic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">well last night my guild attempted agnarr for the first time.  we had 55 people.  We have just gotten into VT recently.  The other night we &quot;scouted&quot; agnarr with a raid of less than 40, and some of them were tag alongs.  The scouting mission got agnarr to 50%.  Not too shabby for not even reading about the encounter.<br />
<br />
So basicly first real attempt on agnarr by a guild that just got into VT.  went somethinig like this.  dead warrior dead warrior dead warrior dead paladin dead me when i got summoned from downstairs then the CH chain finds the current target and GO GO 65 sk with less tanking AA than you ever want to think about.<br />
<br />
It was a good sight to see and even better when we were bidding on agnarrs loots</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well what about the OoW content?  Maybe being level 70 is going to help me tank better in KT but what am I going to be doing in OoW waiting for the next expansion to be able to tank again?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Aye, DISABLE /disc defense for OOW and beyond is best solution, IMHO and SOE can tune mobs more properly WITHOUT the need of /disc defense. Alas, Knights can tank just ok as warriors but warriors still do better with increased hp/AC/mitigation maybe? Warriors just need to LEARN to live without /disc defense ONLY in OOW and beyond. ;) I'm more than willing to give warriors 5% mitigation and nice taunt before GoD came and give them 500 hp more from AA only if their /disc defense got disabled for GoD and beyond to balance it out..<br />
<br />
Or perhaps.. Make /disc defense FLAG for ONLY big raid bosses in OOW. Warrior cant even activate /disc defense against any mobs but when see raid boss, they can call up the power of defense for that special purpose. ;) But I rather to see /disc defense DIE alltogether. That single skill made me sick of hearing for years and it caused shitload of balancing problems for so long. It needs to die..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">What I'm saying if the content was created initially for level 70 XP groups, then a less than average level 65 group with a SK tanking is going to have its problems because we don't tank as well as paladins and warriors. We don't have any ability or innate tuning that allows us to scale up to the content. This problem has been said again and again in many different ways and GoD content makes the gaps and shortcoming of a SK very obvious. Sure at level 70 we may be able to tank Kod'Taz, but we will still have a gap that makes us the 3rd best tank at doing it, until there are any changes to SK's this is how it will be. I can go back and find posts from the #2 SK on a server who made the same point months ago. My opinion is at level 70 you probably won't have these problems be as obvious in the content you are in now, as for OoW who knows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Im sick of everyone sayiong &quot;it's level 70 content, thats why you cant tank it.&quot;<br />
All this does is reaffirm just how FUCKING overpowered warriors discs are.<br />
If its level 70 content, then why the FUCK are 65 (and lower!) warriors able to tank it so well?<br />
<br />
its not just discs, KT is an exp zone for the most part...the nameds require them for sure, but its mostly a war-only tanked zone as far as anyone on my server is concerned</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Cleric would have been a problem.  I am a god newbie, but I know that I rarely use CH anymore in god.  It just cant keep up, dmg spikes are insane.  And unless you got alot of AAs and focus items, the quick heals wont be enough either.  And having secondary healers is needed way too much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>bastardlunatic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">lifetaps need to get changed to a percentage system and then they will scale.  It will at least scale to your hitpoint total.  maybe not so much to the damage your taking but it is a start.  obviously there would have to be caps on how much each version could lifetap for.  the system could work with the current highest lifetap out there for SK's would not have a cap on how much it could heal.  the lower level taps would still be percentage based but have a cap.  <br />
<br />
so something like this:<br />
<br />
touch of inny 15% of your hp total lifetap no limit plus focus and aa<br />
<br />
touch of volatis :14% of your hp total or 400hp max plus focus stuff and aa<br />
<br />
Its a flawed idea but with a similar approach you could make a scaleable lifetap system that is not unbalancing.  and when OoW comes out touch of inny gets a cap and the highest lifetap is strictly percentage with no cap.<br />
<br />
capping the taps prevents people from loading a 15% 14% 13% 12% tap setup and just chaining them</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">You start to see the size of the tanking gap pre-defensive as well.  I'd  say late 40's/50's you see it, but as SK's still have better agro generation at those levels (not sure when warriors get AE taunt), it's not a game stopper.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Lifetaps dont do much good, if you are trying to burn down a mob fast.  Hard to channel through the hard hitters, and aggro spells are usually primary, since you need to keep it on you.  Improving lifetaps wont help much.  They use too much mana, and only get a chance to toss them in once in awhile while tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">The problem is not Inferna. By all indications she is a good SK, has all AA's and is well geared.<br />
<br />
The problem is nothing other than her group. Period.<br />
<br />
An enchanter that doesn't have the skill to slow on incoming, and waits until 60%! to slow the mob has no place in a Kod'taz group. Having an undergeared cleric, however skilled, will present mana issues. Also it sounded like the group with the warrior had a shaman healing? We also don't know what the warrior's gear was like, so the monks comments are not comparing apples to apples.<br />
<br />

With your gear, AA's and ability you can tank Kod'taz day in and day out. You just need for the rest of the group to be at your level, that was the problem.<br />

<br />
Would that fix it?<br />
<br />
I mean, we regenerate mana not by sitting on some mount in the corner, but by standing and hitting, proc's it back to us.<br />
<br />
Why not have an ability that allows us to cast flawlessly when we tank?  Pretty evil sounding I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Mactac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Things are tough now for healer classes as well all. So much damage is taken so quickly by tanks , let alone the other classes, that being the group healer is not fun - it is just nerve - wracking. So as a Cleric I took the best tank I could find that would let me sit back and enjoy things a bit. That tank was a Warrior. <br />
<br />
The fundamental pace of fighting in eq has changed so drastically in GoD that being a healer was just a pain in the ass I didn't need anymore. I was always on pins and needles wondering if I would be fast enough for the next heal. Sad to say a Warrior gave me a lot more leeway in reaction time over a Knight and let me enjoy the game more as a Cleric. It still was too fast though. <br />
<br />
My alt was a 65 SK in cultural armor, lol , what an embarassment he was to play. So because SOE took a fun game and wrecked it I  cancelled my account. No big loss to SOE I'm sure, or to me either, they just lost my business is all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Eggborn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Then, if a tank that could heal itself more in a fight and damage the mob at the same time would save the cleric from feeling pins and needles.<br />
<br />
If we could actually get those spells off somehow.. would work.<br />
<br />
IF I disc leech curse in a fight for the names in GoD trials, I do fine with the cleric heals, once the disc runs out halfway through the fight, it is over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Letting us channel infallably wouldn't do much for our tanking.  Lifetaps still wouldn't scale (they wouldn't scale well if they were based on your HP either, and that is a flawed concept because it rewards people who focus exclusively on HP at the expense of AC).  We'd still tank worse than warriors and paladins.  Our DPS still wouldn't be a factor.  Basically, we'd still suck.<br />
<br />
Nocifer, disabling defensive in future content is a very bad idea.  Defensive is only &quot;broken&quot; be cause neither of the other tank classes have access to DI-mitigation disciplines.  That fact aside, it is good for the game.  It creates a significant tanking gap for hard mobs without requiring XP trash to so hard that they anally rape any unlucky rogue or whatever (I.E. what would happen if we had Howlitoezis's proposition of essentially innate defensive).  <br />
<br />
The fact that defensive scales doesn't make it bad, it makes it well designed.  The fact that the content &quot;was designed for level 70&quot; (which I personally find somewhat hard to believe...) is irrelivant.  Warriors perform fine there, equally geared knights do not.  The problem is that warriors perform at a higher level of gear/level/&quot;power&quot;/whatever than similar knights.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">The problem is not Inferna. By all indications she is a good SK, has all AA's and is well geared.<br />
<br />
The problem is nothing other than her group. Period.<br />
<br />
An enchanter that doesn't have the skill to slow on incoming, and waits until 60%! to slow the mob has no place in a Kod'taz group. Having an undergeared cleric, however skilled, will present mana issues. Also it sounded like the group with the warrior had a shaman healing? We also don't know what the warrior's gear was like, so the monks comments are not comparing apples to apples.<br />

Again to restate I am not saying I can't tank it just can't tank it well.  I need to have special accomodations made for me like the &quot;special needs tank&quot;.  <br />
<br />
I need extra patch healer, a quick thinking cleric and a fast slower.  Where as a warrior can just sit back and tank away.  So I am last choice to get a spot.<br />
<br />
We need a disc to avoid or riposte damage and have it be available with a short duration.  And a DI bump even if this means warriors get another one.  We are just not really a viable choice to tank this type of mob with the spells and mitigation we have been given<br />
<br />
And as far as level 70 goes with GoD I agree with Slein I think it was damage control for them to stay that.  We never saw any spells on test at that time or higher level aa abilities.  I think the idea was there to split the expansion into two from the start and put the level upgrade into the second expansion as a marketing decision so they could sell it twice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Lunaticfringesk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Agree with Inferna.<br />
<br />
The fact that a SHD/PAL can tank it is irrelevant.  As stated many times before, a WAR makes a vastly better choice for a tank and therein lies the problem.  The 3 tank classes should be equally viable options--one class should not be vastly better choice then another.<br />
<br />
As stated too many times to count, SHD *NEED* an appropriately scaled form of &quot;/defensive,&quot; PERIOD.  They can call it whatever the fuck they want, but there is no other viable solution.<br />

We already have double riposte aa, this would allow me to use this disc when a mob is coming that that I know is going to be hard to slow and is going to tear my up before slow lands or other hard situations like single group GoD nameds.<br />
<br />
That along with a DI bump and give the warriors one too would make me very happy at this point.<br />
<br />
The coding is already in the game it would be simple to implement.  The tome could be level 65 and bought at the vendor. If people think we should lose a disc then I suggest fearless since we have this aa already and its useless to us.  If people have a problem with this then it could be dropped in a GoD zone but I really don't think it should be.<br />
<br />
This would not infringe on warriors as hybird already have this disc available, and so do other melee classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Chania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Inferna, we have very similar gear, and I have tanked in KT many times without much of a problem. The difference is my group, it is invariably guildmates that know what I am capable of, and what they are capable of. If a slower doesn't have the trust in you to lock aggro, they will wait to slow and that will cost your healer mana and give the impression you can't tank it. I usually pull and tank, I pull with Fear, and run back to group. I hit the mob with a Fester as it approaches, and that gives the slower lots of time to slow. Then the next spell is Aura of Pain, the extra AC improves tanking substantially. Toss in a spear, and 1 more fear near the end to guarantee aggro, and the mobs drop like flies. Try to cast a lifetap early, before the healer starts to cast, otherwise his heal will waste your tap. Casting early lifetaps gives the impression that you are tanking better, but it does get mana intensive.<br />
<br />
Anyways, not saying that SK's don't have issues tanking vis a vis Warriors, but I think most of yours were caused by your groupmates underestimating you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Mactac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Again, as a Cleric and no  gear SK i would remind you that Warriors are the preferred Tank nowadays. Simply because I don't have to heal them so often. <br />

Knights are their own worst enemy and always have been. Look at all the threads about defensive on PoN and here and how Knights should have a &quot;watered down&quot; defensive. Why? You are Tanks, you should have defensive , period. Hee Hawing around only makes it easier for eliteists like Absor to slap you down. <br />
<br />
Are you Shadowknights? Are you Deathnights like they are in some other games? Well then , as has been stated  in this thread, your life taps should be something to be feared, like FOUR TIMES as effective as they are  - just like a Warrior tanks four levels better than you. <br />
<br />
Get it together all and you might get someting good. Other wise you will be gimped by this dev team that if it ever plays eq, it cheat codes in the best armour and weapons in the game for themselves and hapilly calls it &quot;balanced&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Planes without the GY would be SKs paradise and we would prob be a key class there next to Healers and Slowers. <br />
But still - if anybody has seen a pet pull / fd pull from a SK in addition to tanking abilities and dmg output - who would not like to have a SK in his/her grp? <br />
When I started with EQ I was not allowed to tank anything on raids. I was just there sitting beside the healers/slowers, waiting for a mob to aggro on them and then offtanking this one mob. Now with all the AA abilities casters have - my job on raids is more kiting/offtanking mobs than ever before - making a lot more fun to play. There is no class out there that has the perfect Aggro control we have with hate spells/FD.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Vaclav</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">Shrug, been playing my cleric mostly solo for XP recently since the wife is being lax about playing non-raid times currently (I was normally playing our SK that we're catching up, and her on the cleric for a while there)...<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure every single KT group I've been in recently has been grouped with an SK or Paladin tank less geared than you (although not significantly, most of our Knights are in the 9.8k/1900 AC range raidbuffed), and we've never stopped pulls at any point for mana - in a few I've even been tossing nukes as well. My cleric is semi-badass, but honestly, theres no reason that I would ever expect to go OOM with either knight class as tank..<br />
<br />
That group would've also been 100x more solid with a BARD in the Shaman slot IMO - preslow is so wonderful when you can get it, and Marr to make up for the ghettoness of the Cleric. You shouldn't need any patching with preslows. Ditching the cleric to get one thats actually non-ghetto could help too - some people keep their clerics so poorly geared they're crippled to only using CH in XP situations.<br />
<br />
Also stick to the animal mobs if possible when first learning KT, their procs are insanely weak compared to the other races that have some nasty variable points. (ra'tuks flurrying, golems randomly double or quad with no indicator, nocs rampaging with VERY long arms, ixt + ikaav with swarm pets)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Powa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">Sorry im putting my 2 cents here. IMO to tank anything in GoD, required group setup will be Tank, Slower, Healer (doh) AND --&gt;Dispeller&lt;---. This is real important and most of u guys dont' seems to care about dispelling. Since 30% or more of the mob in GoD are oringal hasted. This is much more appeal in Ikkniz raid. Anyways, a hasted mob can quad every 0.5 secs. No one can tank that even war right? I do just fine when people dispell in GoD, seriously, my gear ain't sky high(barely time geared). <br />
<br />
In conclusion on what i've said, Dispell = greatest debuff you can cast on a mob in GoD. So usually, dispell first, then slow. <br />
<br />
Oh, also, fuck that chanter plz, if they cast slow on 70%, might as well don't slow the mob and tell him to fuck out of group.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>Sindian Sanguis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">More and more I am begining to believe that what needs to happen is 3 equal tanks in all aspects of the game - from grouping to end game raid boss encounters.  <br />
<br />
It would certainly be easier to balance the tanking aspect of all 3 classes together instead of balance knights to war, balance knights to each other etc.  I also feel it would be healthier for the game.  Same goes for healing, there should be 3 equal healing classes.<br />
<br />
This dominance of Warriors and Clerics needed to accomplish anything in a class system of 16 is flawed, especially in a game with dwindling numbers, limited sized raids, limited size group spots, there must be alteratives and there isn't if you only allow certain classes with specific abilities that are required to succeed.  Balance should be by archetype, equal core abilties, having nothing specific in one class that it is a required function of a group or raid to succeed, smaller skills/spells/abilities/utility can be tailored to a class to distinguish them - but again nothing that is absolutely required to succeed outside the basic tank/heal/dps.<br />
<br />
Regarding tanks specifically, in the end in my opinion there should be no warrior 5% advantage, no discipline advantage, all 3 tank classes should have the exact same abilities/skills/caps/disciplines in regards to tanking.  Specific skills/spells/utility is what should set them apart, but nothing so drastic as to achieve a perception/reality where one is better then the other, which is currently the state.  Warriors say they have nothing else but to tank, thats part of the problem, but don't be mistaken we are tanks as well.  Give them something (utility/abilities) etc to make them more robust that they aren't so specific.  There are endless possiblities of how to accomplish this.<br />
<br />
This above of course will probably never happen in EQ, people are too ingrained with the idea of one class must do this specifically, and this other class must do this only, this class must be the best at this absolutely, this class must do a bunch of little things etc all through 16 classes, too much thinking outside the box and what a uproar it would cause.  It will be curious to see in the end what SoE will do about class balance.  Currently tho, the lack of even trying it is just pissing off more people and increasing attrition.<br />

Hehe, I never forget that!! We had damn 230 Defense, lower HP table, Lower mitigation table over warrior. I shudder to think how we would have to suffer with this if we didn't get buffed up.. Knights would be basically extinct by then..</div></div><hr />

Either SoE as a whole doesn't and won't ever give a shit, or someone needs to fire that fat bastard. The original post clearly shows one class getting told they are getting looked at while another isn't hearing shit, and better yet, &quot;play another class&quot;...fuck Brenlo's slimslow ass and SoE along with him until he is removed from the company.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u87"><b>Vaclav</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p87">Wow, you mean him saying that if someone doesn't enjoy a class that's relatively well balanced overall (overpowered pre-Elems however) and likely won't see any &quot;class fixes&quot; (Rangers) that the player might consider playing another class is a BAD THING?<br />
<br />
For Brenlo's exact quote for the lazy:<br />
As to comments that rangers are worthless, if you feel that way then I suggest you try another class.  There are thousands of rangers who feel that they are useful and fun.  They have a great time playing each night.  If you find that you cannot do that with your current class, then try another, perhaps one that is more suited to your expectations.<br />
<br />
Some people choose the wrong class for their playstyle and try to get the class changed rather than changing their class to be more appropriate. Giving someone a nudge to the most appropriate direction makes sense, and saves the poor sap time.</div></div><hr />

If the guild having mana problem healing anyone other than warrior in raid, one word, they suck and shouldn't be raiding where they are raiding. In my guild, our healer heals everyone, even wizzy that tanks  :D</div></div><hr />

I have no idea if / what rangers issues may be, but that is a bold statement to make from the outside looking in. IMO, each class has what they feel is important to them, else their &quot;class list&quot; would be blank. Making such a statment at Mike Moore wannabe did is not only tasteless, but *bad* PR, esp for a customer service rep.</div></div><hr />

Past history indicates that whining works for bringing about change.</div></div><hr />

Personally, I'd like to murder every last person who says &quot;if you don't like the shit that's happened to your class, reroll&quot; - the answer to class balance is not picking a new class.</div></div><hr />
