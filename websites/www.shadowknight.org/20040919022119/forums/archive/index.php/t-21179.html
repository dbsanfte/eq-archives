<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Akronis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Wondering 2 things about it, firstly how does the cost scale? I just purchased 1st rank for 5, and second says 6, so is it 5/6/7/8/9? Or was rank 1 really only 3 aa and my eyes were just blurry when I bought it because I barely sleep anymore, and in that case is it 3/6/9/12/15?<br />
<br />
Second thing is how does it scale damage wise? Anyone done parses? Is it a multiplier, or a raw damage addition? Any info is greatly appreciated, thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>UGLA</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Haven't parced anyhthing...but i have viciuous slam 3 currently...and i really can't telll any difference yet.<br />
<br />
and its 3/6/9/12/15....what a great buy ;)  Right up there with pet crits</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's 3/6/9/12/15 AA just like Intense Hatred is.  It gives +5 Bash damage per level.  Bash is 6 second recycle, if you were to mash your bash key and never miss it would give you an additional 0.833 dps per rank, however since Bash is only at best 50% accuracy it's really only 0.416 dps increase at best, and probally closer to 33% accuracy meaning only 0.275 dps increase.  Also, since people don't mash bash and are sometimes stunned when its up or are doing something as timing it for a cast you really only bash every 12-15 seconds or so (I'll go with 12 for this) which would further drop that 0.275 dps increase to .138 dps. So the net result is 45 AA's for an increase of 0.688 dps.<br />
<br />
In short, it blows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Akronis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sweet, so what's worth getting out of GoDs, if any?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Run 4 and 5, then the Weapon Affinity line...then it becomes hard to say with any certainty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rhumba_Kween</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm working on Imobilizing Bash. No added DPS, but seems to be solid for interupting casters once again. Also, I must say that despite its lame ness for SK's, Pet Affinity is sadly much nicer than most of our GoD AA's. Thus I have it already. Its especially nice if you pull with your pet much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gruulgrul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Unless something has changed, even Weapon Affinity isn't worth much to us, because it reduces the rate by which our self-buff procs.  Depends on the weapon, weapon proc, weapon augs, etc.  (Do a search for Weapon Affinity and Window, he has good data on it.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">with GoD AAs, because of scaling cost the first couple levels of a bunch are okay deals, and further investment gets really costly for not nearly as much benefit.<br />
<br />
brael's already done the math for vicious smash above. it really sucks, the only reason you would want it at all is IF the first level causes bashes that would have been otherwise &quot;absorbed&quot; to hit. it could potentially work like that but i haven't tested, don't intend on testing, and haven't seen anyone post anything about it. <br />
<br />
intense hatred 1 isn't a bad deal, and intense hatred 2 is half as good a deal, 3+ are pretty lame. when tanking, i'd expect intense hatred 1 in general to add more DPS/cost than CF3 would, which is also more than double riposte 1 would.<br />
intense hatred 2 should be pretty close to equal double riposte 1 in terms of benefit/cost, and slightly better than any in the FotA line, although FotA is probably a better deal because it works when not tanking.<br />
<br />
weapon affinity really depends on what weapon and augment you've got. you can figure out expected DPS before and after using some formulas (http://www.shadowknight.org/forums/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=20180)... but for simplicity,<br />
just in terms of DPS, not considering the reduction in buff procs, if your weapon has a 300 point DD, each level gives you 1 more DPS from that proc.<br />
<br />
and its hard to determine the worth of the rest of the GoD AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kelv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I would rate the GoD aa´s as follows:<br />
<br />
1 - Weapon Affinity - this is supposed to work only for WEAPON PROC rate, not the self imbued procs from our buffs.<br />
<br />
2 - Run 4 and 5<br />
<br />
3 - Stunning bash<br />
<br />
<br />
The rest sux ass imho and is just a way to dump aa when you have nothing else to get. Heck I will get leech touch before I get anyother GoD aa besides those I listed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I plan on getting at least most of the GoD AA's to level 1. They arn't bad in cost at that level, and I don't see me maxing any of them anytime soon, just because they get too expensive for what they do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Some GoD AA are worse than nothing, I fully plan to save 30 aa's up prior to beginning to buy Critical Affliction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Actually since I use the pet all the time in LDON pet affinity turned out to be one of the better aa.  <br />
<br />
Run 5 I like but not an sk aa<br />
<br />
I got intense hatred cause I like DS personally when I tank as high as possible for LDON also.<br />
<br />
The immobilizing bash seems to work slightly better but its not a big increase in interrupts as I had hoped.<br />
<br />
I have WA 5 again not really an SK aa but it helps with aggro proc (yak ) a lot on my sews.<br />
<br />
The one thats supposed to allow u to cast through spells I cant even see that it works.<br />
<br />
Pet crits are useless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Akronis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I see casts through stuns maybe 1 in 40 times I get stunned with persistent casting maxed. I'm done WA5, immobilizing bash, and run 5, so maybe I'll just cave and go back and do natural healing and body and mind rejuvenation for the 4 extra points of regen and 1 point of mana regen!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Belyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Theres alot of sks that love wa5.  But one thing ya have to know about that ability is that no weapon is the be all end all last weapon you will ever need.  And quite a few of em have very lame procs.  If you have WA5, you could end up replacing shroud of chaos procs with boil blood or summon food as you upgrade your weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The impact of WA5 on innate procs is minimal, and nets out as a huge positive. Read the data.<br />
<br />
WA5 is very worth getting.</div></div><hr />
