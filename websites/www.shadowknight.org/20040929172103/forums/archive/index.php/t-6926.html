<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Darksiege</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After many /tell discussions with a variety of SK races, I decided to create an Erudite Shadow Knight.<br />
<br />
I was advised by all that if I were to solo more than group, I would need a decent sized mana pool so I split my creation points between INT and STR.  So far, I haven't regretted this decision on where to put my initial starting points.<br />
<br />
The questions I have are these:<br />
<br />
What's your opinion on this so far?<br />
<br />
Can any Erudite SK's give me more advice on playing an Erudite SK?<br />
<br />
I thought it odd that a majority of the SK's I did converse with stated that if they were to start another SK it would be an Erudite SK.  Does this seem odd at all?<br />
<br />
Your input would be greatly appreciated and I thank you in advance for it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
STA &gt; STR. FYI, STR gear is relatively easy to come across. STA gear isn't. HPs help you tank. STR helps you deal damage, and your primary role, as a tank, is to absorb damage. <br />
<br />
If you didn't put 5 points into AGI to raise it to 75, then you will cost yourself approximatly 30-35 AC at levels 40+. If your AGI isn't 75 due to gear, then get it there ASAP, and keep it there. <br />
<br />
Personally, I *think* I put 5 in STR, 5 in AGI, then the rest in STA. <br />
<br />
Note that by the time you reach 30, you should be starting to practice a 2-hander. That'll drop your STA fast. If your STA isn't over 100, you'll suffer penalties. <br />
<br />
My initial starting stats were: STR 80, STA 80, AGI 75, DEX 70, WIS 83, INT 117. <br />

Don't take your mana pool for granted. Use it. <br />
<br />
I thought it odd that a majority of the SK's I did converse with stated that if they were to start another SK it would be an Erudite SK. Does this seem odd at all?<br />
<br />
That is odd, though I think Erudite's a naturally good choice for my style of play. I like casting, so I like a larger mana pool. Additionally, there are more buffs to raise STR and STA than INT. I figure, I have more of a chance to maximize my abilities with an Erudite; I'd rather wind up with 255 STR, 215 STA, and 200 INT than 255 STR, 255 STA, 125 INT.  I'm more well-rounded, I feel.<br />
<br />
Having a larger mana pool also allows me stronger soloing skills in some regards; I feel it helps when breaking some tough spawns in areas you can't feign split, and that it allows me to escape from &quot;oh crap&quot; situations more easily when I'll have a few extra casts in me. <br />
<br />
We also have better faction than all but human SKs...have a very easily accesible home city in Paineel (Nexus-&gt;Tox is a godsend..getting to Neriak or the ugly cities is much more of a pain)...oh, and we're damn sexy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Valorax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I am also a remade Erudite SK =)<br />
<br />
<br />
I split up my stats a little different though... my stats look alot like Hrendra's, exept I raise my Int to 122... wanted to put more emphasis on Int then normal... cuz heck... I made an Erudite for the Int and I want to use as I can ;p.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hrendra is EXTREMELY right about the 75 mark.... make sure ya hit that and don't fall below, hehe... Even fully geared up at lvl 37 with nice twink gear.. I'm at 89 Dex and 98 Agi, little too close for me... but I'm still young. <br />
<br />
<br />
As an Erudite, the best advice I can think of... make the best use of your mana pool as you can... don't just use it wisely, use it alot, heheh.. I'm also a recently retired caster, burn that mana as fast as you can ;p.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>PLW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">As an Erudite sk you have a good continent (imo) to level. 1 - 5 in the Newbie zone, 5 - 20 in warrens, 20 - 30+ in stonebrunt. Also, you will have a leg up on Paineel guard killing ( i call it training or 'weeding out' weak guards). Not to mention the Hole.<br />
<br />
I was 40 before i left Odus and that was to travel to luclin and get a Rallic Pack, which i couldnt turn in anyway.<br />
<br />
Once you hit the 40's be prepared for the sucky melee damage you will deal. I went to solb and was embarassed by what the monks, rangers, warriors and rogues were doing. I almost never saw my damage in the battle spam. (i was wielding an ebon mace by the way). I felt like the group was carrying me, but i could at least taunt with DC then.<br />
<br />
Anyway, we look damn good.</div></div><hr />
