<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dkhar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just levelled to 65. Being on the Prexus server is a little intimidating at times when you get up /LFG and there are 50 level 65's looking for group. I keep getting asked to zones I know I have no chance to survive in due to my sucky hitpoints and horrid ac. Not to mention I have only 21 AA points so far. I just got ND1 last night and want to do ND3, CA3 but really don't know what to do from there.<br />
<br />
My gear needs work. My AA's need work. But which do I do first ? I figure with the ND I can get over 4k unbuffed hitpoints but I am competing with SK's that have 6k+ unbuffed. I am also in a guild that is starting to progress so HT aa's are going to be a must as well as my mitigation and avoidance aa's.<br />
<br />
I guess what I am asking is at my level and situation, which is more important to do first. I can do LDoN's for points for gear upgrading until Morte Ange starts to do ST and VT (keying now). Or I can bang out 100's of AA in PoV-BoT, which will take a while but about the equivalent in time of doing ldons for gear upgrades. <br />
<br />
*I cannot handle Hard LDoN's. I just can't tank them. The groups I end up in are mid end groups that do Normals, which bring in about 50 points each, I can do 2-3 of these a day.<br />
<br />
*I have problems tanking in BoT, I can't handle the named unless there is a super chanter who knows what he/she is doing and gets that mofo slowed ASAP. EDIT : I still die sometimes if they're slowed too.<br />
<br />
*I don't mind PoV, especially since I bring lower level guildmates along as well as my wife and still can net about 1 AA per hour or less.<br />
<br />
*I learned I can not go near any GoD zones because I am just a super frickin wuss.<br />
<br />
*I have none of my 65 spells yet. I do have 95% of my spells up to 64.<br />
<br />
*I have no cash. I guess I can go back to farming if that is what is suggested.<br />
<br />
What would you do ??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vezax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Id suggest banging out aa, while keying up for vt.  If your looking for upgrades in gear do ldon.  If your looking to make some cash or win upgrades (assuming ornates an upgrade) go to bot, also better xp in bot.  Once you start gaining aa and grabing gear from things like ldon or ornate, you'll notice your tanking power grow tremendiously.  <br />
<br />
When I hit 65 I had 3900ish hp and 1100 ac and was able to do ok in bot unless we were fighting named/krigers.  The exp was excellant, also I was able to start getting spec/runes to fill in my spell book.<br />
<br />
The nice thing about LDoN is your able to earn VT quality gear just by doing ldon on any sort of consistant basis.  Also augments, cant forget those.  The xp still seems kinda bleh to me.  <br />
<br />
Basically I suggest doing bot for the time being and pick up on key defensive aas.  You can get decent upgrades like ornate or various drops.  Also the xp is just better then ldon, and really at this point in the power curve your probably better served doing bot, and probably switching to doing ldon exclusively once you start maxing archetype defnsive/key aas.<br />
<br />
Id say once you reach at least the 7500 hp/ 1300 range buffed, do not do ldon hards.  I have 8k / 1500  ac buffed and it still scary to see how fast my hp bar drops.  I had 2 7500 complete heals land in one adv -_-.  <br />
<br />
As for being on prexus, it feast or famine for sks ive generally found.  Ive either got four offers as i log on or wait an hour -_-.  <br />
<br />
Side note:  If your really think your guild is going to be actively working toward VT, I'd suggest you proactively work on your VT key.  Also convince key members to start working on thier emp keys and ore farming for bane weapons.  The comanders drop keys to various other bosses (XTC and HP if i remember correctly) and they drop fastastic loot, and arent too hard (well the HP fight is pretty harry at first).  Also start farming rhags and convicing healers to do tak adv for greater remove curse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I know I play all wrong, but I hate only having the PoV or LDoN options as both bore me in the long term.  So I'll give you a third option.  Find a place that has upgrades for you and the upgrades are duoable or 1 groupable.  I seem to remember that your wife is a chanter, so I'm assuming having haste and slow when making analysis.<br />
<br />
I've narrowed it down to one place!  Decent AA, good upgrades, not crowded and easy to get to.  Yes the upgrades I'm suggesting are no-drop, but so would the LDoN stuff, so I'm assuming as long as it's relatively easy, a solid upgrade and you get aa (no not as good as PoV but not bad at all) you'll consider it.<br />

<br />
They are found in the Plane of Mischief, which is easy to get into and hard to get out of so bring a wizzy, druid or gate potion to keep the hassle to a minimum.<br />
<br />
I hope you take the advice as it would get you some AA and signifigant upgrades...oh and the zone is a hoot with invisible bridges and hidden doors and stuff.  Only the named see invis.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ramgar SK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The Defensive AA's really help out a lot, they stretch out your HP a ways.  But AC and HP are king.  I'd have to say that gear &gt; AA's, but not by much.  I noticed a huge difference when I bumped my ac from 1100 to 1300.  I also noticed a big difference each time I bought a defensive AA.  The biggest was buying PE.<br />
<br />
I noticed many of your gear items are lacking HP and suffering AC.  But you said you have no cash.  You've answered your own question, so go AA, preferably somewhere that drops stuff to sell/upgrade.  BoT and Droga are my favorite places for that, but BoT drops seem pretty rare except for the ring of Torden, lol.  Droga named pop about 1 in 4 and always drop something good to sell.<br />
<br />
Tanking BoT named or Kriggers is mana and DPS dependent.  Get resists up, the 1500 proc is what kills you.  If you play in BoT, you're going to see named and Kriggers at every camp but lower sands.  You will probably see them there too, but in trains from middle and upper.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ashrai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I was in a similar situation to you and the combination of AAs and the LDON armor/augs is really going to help you. I didn't hit 4K unbuffed until December and am still struggling to get up to 5K (really sad when I tank in exp groups where the cleric has more HPs).  <br />
<br />
Going for the LDoN armor will be a great boost for you in three ways:<br />
<br />
Chance to pick up little augs here and there for small improvements in STA, etc<br />
Working towards amazing armor<br />
Half an AA per adventure at 65<br />
<br />
At your stage right now, easy LDoNs will still be a bit difficult. Unslowed mobs will be tough on you. Once you get to about CA2 and CS2 with PE and maxed SA you're going to notice that unslowed mobs are a joke in there. <br />
<br />
I got both CA and CS to level 2 and left CS there while I finished up LR- I pull on a lot of raids so for me I wanted avoidance first and foremost.<br />
<br />
Don't worry about the other SKs you are competing with.  Sure it's nice that they have a lot of HPs and nice gear but you can do a hell of a lot with less than they have and if you do it well, that is what people will remember. A good healer will know that even though your HPs are lower, an SK with good AC, strong defensive AA and SA3 is a very different animal to heal than a 5K+ SK who put all his AA into melee/offensive skills.  <br />
 <br />
<br />
And there's nothing wrong with earning your AA in PoV rather than some other zone, if that's where you can easily assemble a group.  An AA is an AA ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Menon Lifeblight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Crank out CA3, ND3, CS3, and PE as fast as you possibly can, then do LDoN for gear upgrades.  HT AAs are much better for PoP than they will be in VT, so you can put them off for a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rhumba_Kween</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Have to say I agree with Menon.<br />
<br />
Get your base defensive AA's, then do LDoN and use those AA's initially to get your GoD Defensive AA's.<br />
<br />
I'll also say that the above post about Plane of Mischief is a good one. YOu can make lots of money from Research drops plus there are what I would think would be some solid upgrades for you there. Also, not mentioned there is the XP. It is very solid, maybe not quite BoT level (Actually Alice in Wonderland is as good) but the crew I have done PoM with rescently can pretty easily get 3 AA's in a 4 - 5 hour period there.<br />
<br />
Another great XP spot is Hate. Especially as you get into Teir 3/4 mobs. And at the same time you can work on a super nice caster/priest range item. The SK one is ok, but nothing to write home about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">One thing that I am noticing about your gear over everything else is that you have a pre-nerf CoS in your possesion. This is a huge advantage in BoT for pulling, and really great for scouting named targets in there when you have no tracker in group. If you are having trouble as tank in groups, stepping into the puller role is just as much exp. In fact, if the healer needs a med break and/or you have to rez the slower every few mobs...you'll get better exp as the puller at this point...<br />
<br />
But if you are going to be the group tank, you are better off staying out of the South wing of BoT where your Aura of Pain, Z-bite and mental corruption spells are useless...the added AC and group/self mana added should make things a bit smoother for you.<br />
<br />
Don't do anything stupid with the AA you earn until you have the tanking ones. Get CA/CS purchased for L1 and then get Physical Enhancement, then polish off CA/CS then ND-- Combat Fury, Finishing Blow, and any other junk like that will just make you weak for a longer time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Araden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">single greatest addition aa wise u can do for tanking power is CA3 to LR5.<br />
<br />
Btw HT aa's aren't important for VT not like tankin aa's,  i would highly recommend you bust out a few quick aa's in a pov group for tankage ability and then switch to doing ldon's for aa's / ap's for gear.  some of the ldon items you can get will be massive upgrades to waht you have currently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dkhar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Wow great advice. Thanks guys! Just went over the PoM stuff for the past hour and have to say it is something I will be bringing up to my wife in the morning. We know a couple people we can bring there, one being a druid so that's a good thing. Thanks for the links man. <br />
<br />
Ok, so I figure I will go to PoM every chance I can get a group together for it. If not I will go to PoV/BoT and do AA's until I get the full line of defensive aa's. That's like 50 more AA to go at least, 2-4 a day will take about a month.  After I get those AA, hopefully my wife will be 65 by then (she's 63 now), we will start doing the LDoN's for armor upgrades to fill in spots we don't fill in PoM :D  Meanwhile in between all that make sure to get my keys. <br />
<br />
Sound about right ? Sounds like a good plan to me. PoM stuff will net me AA and upgrades to better tank BoT named for upgrades or cash, all the while getting AA for defensive stuff. After that is full and my gear is a little better the LDoN's should be a little easier and quicker, netting me more armor upgrades. All that in preparation to sit on the sidelines in VT and ST hehe. <br />
<br />
And yea man, CoS rules :D It's just been really wierd lately, like these Uber ass monks keep showing up and pulling. Like this dude today was a monk with 450 AA and had 8k hp and did more damage with his pinky than I did with all my skills. But he only pulled and left me to tank. Had an Uber ranger show up the day before that with 350 AA... holy shit. He pulled and tanked :P bastard. But hey I can't complain. I can get up Boner and smoke cigarettes.<br />
<br />
I really do appreciate all your guys responses. I was thinking of doing all this stupid shit and decided to say screw it if I get flamed I want some advice before I spend the next month banging out pure ldons or something and basically just holding myself back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">You'll make yourself completely fucking nuts only doing LDoN content or only doing BoT, so remember that there are ways to alleviate the boredom. If you can convince a group to go exp in Torment and stock up on parts for tormentor stir fry and the pieces for the 2nd gate necklace, that is also a more interesting place to work on your pulling skills. Same goes for CoD, although that zone sucks hot shit off of the sidewalk.<br />
<br />
Also, when a group breaks and you are just a few blues shy of an AA ding, aggro kiting in the HoH graveyard with a partner or just solo is a technique worth getting comfortable with...PoP encounters love to toss adds into the mix that need to be kited.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Amphitryon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Variety is the spice of life and that means in EQ life as well..dont lock yourself in BoT all the time our you will want to gouge your eyes out after a while.<br />
<br />
I find doing some late night aggro kiting in PoN on prexus when everlyone else goes to bed is a very rewarding time. At 62, I just run around near the waterfall and pull of 1-2% AA per kill in a pretty short amount of time per kill (with Tranq buff)<br />
<br />
I sometime duo/trio with guildmates in HoH, or PoV (got some damn fine XP there)<br />
<br />
the real fun thoough is spelunking in Howling stones for the hell of it (it is a nice cash pharm as well), or blowing through Seru guards (they drop oodles of cash and are fun to listen too)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I went the LDoN route; saw it as my chance to get geared up, put my nose to it and didn't look back.  I'm at about the 30,000 point mark and have about 10,000 points worth of augs/gear left to go I figure.  However, I've slowed down a lot after hitting ~500 wins.<br />
<br />
At 2 - 3 adv's a night plus more on weekends, you can about get a new armour piece a week.  The nice thing about LDoN is the loot is guaranteed if you put the time in.  No DKP, passing on gear for friends, being passed up -- get what you want, how you want it.<br />
<br />
That said, LDoN isn't for everyone, many consider it boring.  The xp isn't the greatest, but when I want to grind I go elsewhere; however, I don't really feel the urge to grind any more.<br />
<br />
As for AA's, I didn't go for defensives first at the time because I didn't tank much -- I mostly fear-kited.  But yes, as the others have said, nowadays it's best to do the hp/defensives first with a little eye-candy aa's along the way to keep yourself sane.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Dakkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Menon saidCrank out CA3, ND3, CS3, and PE as fast as you possibly can, then do LDoN for gear upgrades. HT AAs are much better for PoP than they will be in VT, so you can put them off for a while.<br />
Absolutely agree.  Do AAs in LDoN and think about maybe the EF gear (barring BP) as a much quicker alternative to NRo if your gear really sucks.<br />
<br />
Tanking AAs &gt;&gt; DPS AAs unless your gear's already awesome.<br />
<br />
Also look up the 100 point 6 STA augs from BB LdoN.  A cheap disposable way to boost your hps on LDoN armour.<br />
<br />
If you're a good puller, get hard LDoN groups in EC and EF as puller, not tank.  It's easy to keep a new mob in the next room snared and single, while you sit FD on the floor waiting for the warrior to tag when the current one dies so you can pull again.<br />
<br />
In BoT (or general PoP or hard LdoNs for that matter), drop Festering on mobs at max range while incoming, then give them a fear or CD while they're crawling toward you, and push the slower to slow while they're still inbound.  Not that it helps with BoT named much but it splits inbound multiples very nicely and compensates for lack of gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Lynxal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Go get two Bracers of Benevolence.<br />
<br />
Unless you have not updated your Magelo....You need to sprinkle in for something different:<br />
1)   Complete PoJ trial<br />
2)   Complete alt entry to Tactics through the PoS Diaku charm<br />
3)   Complete alt entry to CoD through the PoD quest...You can now flag your whole group like the others...but it's a pretty easy camp to get all the pieces for one key in a night and it offers an insta clicky for people who need so you may want to help a couple people do it.<br />
4)   Complete alt entry to Torment....PoN spiders are actually good exp so it's not a bad hunt if the matriarch is up.<br />
5)   Complete HoH alt entry quest....most of the places you need are decent experience anyway with the exception of PoI which is horrid.<br />
6)   Complete the BoT key from the PoS minis.  It's a very easy kill now and with a decently equipped warrior should be no problem for a single group of friends...especially if most are VT level.  Even I can tank the minis now with a single group.<br />
<br />
The above will be something different, easy to do, and give everyone a charm upgrade and a bonus AA until your guild starts killing PoP mobs.<br />
<br />
Take a couple people to Velks and get a Sword of Pain for an insta clicky also if you are short yourself.<br />
<br />
Outside of that, stick to the plan everyone else has with Expereince camps in BoT, etc.  I also like the Plane of Hate camp for the marsinger's stone as an expereince camp that is almost always wide open and will offer the rest of your group a nice range item.</div></div><hr />

You didn't notice I have some more aa though :P I have been getting the PoV groups and BoT groups for the AA. Simply, nobody wants to go to PoM with me, it seems people are scared of the place or something. Turned down a lot of LDoN requests, since they are level 65 hards that they want to do. I will accept the offers though once I reach my goal of all defensive aa's. <br />
<br />
Bracers of benevolence and draconic pauldrons are great! I just don't feel like turning my faction all the way around due to killing Klandicar and stuff. I think Veksar might actually be the upgrade place for me since noone wants to go to PoM with me :(<br />
<br />
Then again, upgrades might not be a problem now. My wife and I are moving to Stormhammer. Today in fact lol. I was getting frustrated sitting LFG for hours every morning until a group of regulars shows up and gives me the pity group. Also disapointed that I could never raid with MA due to time inconsistencies. I think the events will help my gear issue a lot, if I win anything.<br />
<br />
It will also help me with my flagging issues. While my wife was on Stormhammer she had a lot of invites for flagging events. I always missed out due to the time thingy with my guild. All I have now is my CoD flag and only because /barbraid was doing an odd morning raid.</div></div><hr />

All that equip is from PoM except of course the one cultural bracer (PoM really only has ono good bracer) and the Earring of Solstice (which isn't worth sacrificing for any PoM earring).

Sure there are better out there, but bang for buck its a nice Ac increase and will likely add some Hp as well. Youll lose some Dex (meh not a big loss) so beg for Daiku from your local shaman.<br />
As far as droppable gear, ogre/troll cultural is right up there with some good drops.</div></div><hr />
