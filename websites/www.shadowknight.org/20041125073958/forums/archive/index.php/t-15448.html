<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mrbad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As I am now at my 51st level...I am hoping I can get some guidance on where to put my AA points.   Many choose regen, yet I am a troll...am I beating a dead horse by doing this?<br />
<br />
I also put all of my pp in MR...It is now 139 unbuffed...how do I fair?<br />
<br />
Also Str..is up there...203 unbuffed...the rest of the abilities are average or slightly above,,,with resistances at 70 to 90 on the other 4.<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Great to finally find a website so useful,,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>fendor stonesmith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">At 51 I put 3pts in regen first because I had j-boots... then put 3pts in run3. Now 54 and working twords 55 for next aa's</div></div><hr />

I am ogre, I do regen 3 first..then run3.. then lvl 55<br />
<br />
<br />
As a troll you could do run 3 first, and then regen 3.. it's up to you..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>DConquest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Run 3 is a great AA since you'll find yourself pulling alot more as you get up there in lvl, if you don't pull alot now.  Biggest tip I can give you is to level now and worry about AA later.   The spells and spell lines you start to recieve post 55 ( some even eariler like Mental Corruption ) blow away any available AA at the time.   <br />
<br />
Regen will be nice later on when you get your Deadly Tempation / Pact of Hate spells.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>AoWtho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Run3 -&gt; regen3 or meta3<br />
<br />
All other stats besides resists are cappable through items.  Regen never caps.. and it comes in handy when you're stuck in FD or have pact of hate on.  I would come back and get resists later.  I went with run3 -&gt; regen3 -&gt; ND3.. and I'm very glad I went in that order.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">run 3 if you pull in zones where you cant be sowed often, otherwise go all the way to 65 without any aa and just use sow potions when needed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mistii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Run3/Regen3 -- ND3/PE/PD3 are your basic hp aa's, PP will help as well if your buffed sta hits the cap, the increase in hp's is minor, but increases in str and dex are worth it imo.</div></div><hr />
