<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vuloshek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've always assumed that differences in diety are mostly reflected in default faction standings, but some have mentioned benefits to being a Bertoxx man when you decide to be a human.  What are these benefits, and are there any benefits to being an Innoruuk worshipper instead?<br />
When I made my human I chose Innoruuk simply because I'd just gotten rid of a gnome and I thought I'd get away from Bertoxx for awhile.  If this is a mistake, I want to switch now before I make it anywhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Scarus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">First and foremost, Freeport is a shithole.  Qeynos sewers rock.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ancatdub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Go Bertoxx! <br />
<br />
1. /agree Scarus...If nothing else you'll get a great looking guild rather than some decrepit hole in the mud. Qeynos Sewers are great fun as a starting zone.<br />
<br />
2. Go against the grain. Besides, do you really want to worhip a diety whose must numerous followers are the offspring of smurfs? <br />
<br />
/feignsdeath before the flames :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vuloshek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">So that's it then?  Starting zone and avoiding being part of the masses?  I have to agree on both points... not sure how much that means to me though.  If that's all there is to it, I might as well stick with what I got.  Any other reasons?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zzketza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Three simple words for you: Fetid Heraldic Plate.  Look it up and drool away.  (Of course my Bertoxx worshipper is a cleric, not a shadowknight, but despite that, it's still a great suit and more useful than the Hateful Heraldic).  Besides, who really wants to be a &quot;lesser cousin&quot; to the smurfs, when you can claim to serve a god so powerful he is reviled through half a continent because of his actions after the game was launched, instead of simply a backstory?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Krazaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Diety also determines which cultural armor you can wear.  Some diety's cultural armor is significantly better than others.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jobrill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Bertox:<br />
<br />
Pros:<br />
1) God of Ebola<br />
<br />
<br />
Cons:<br />
1) God of the Common Cold<br />
2) Gnomes worship Him<br />
3) Followers skulk around in Sewers, don't bathe<br />
<br />
Innoruuk<br />
<br />
Pros:<br />
1) Chief City has a Whorehouse, if yer into it.<br />
2) You can go all Kefkaesque and be &quot;HATE HATE HAAAATE! Uwe-hehehehe!&quot;<br />
<br />
Cons:<br />
1) So frickin Unoriginal that he hasta steal other peoples races to make his master race instead of making his own from scratch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ancatdub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Jobrill<br />

You have to watch for the fine detail in Bertoxx's actions. The common cold has killed more folk than Ebola ever will. Ebola is just for show.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Erasmus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I play a Bertox worshipping human SK. In general, its great to go against the grain. Some pros and cons I've discovered (now I play on middle of the road server, though, so your experiences may be different)...<br />
<br />
Pros:<br />
Fetid Heraldic is superior armor<br />
You get to be different<br />
Quenos is much much much much better than Freeport<br />
Great role playing options<br />
<br />
Cons:<br />
/agree with Jobrill...the gnome thing...<br />
<br />
Bertox human SK have no newbie armor quests (Innoruk do). This is important to newer players, at least. Though it didn't directly impact me.<br />
<br />
Fetid heraldic is better...but its hard to find anyone to imbue the gems (this has been a problem for me of late as I've been trying to commission some). Innoruk armor is much more readily available, at least in the circles I'm familar with.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just yesterday, this NPC namde Pyzjn or something like that, a gnome necro apparently, has taken up residence in the ruins in Qeynos hills.  She cons amiable to a Bertoxx human, of course, but she kills anyone who fights the skeletons there.  Those skeletons will attack anybody.  I don't know what level she is, but she's certainly stronger than the dread corpses, as is her pet.  To make it worse.... there are TWO of her, and TWO of her pet!  So, if you want to kill the restless skeletons there for decaying bone pieces for the armor quest, you're SOL (and so am I).  It was already hard enough dealing with dread corpses, and the drops are far too rare.<br />
<br />
I feel sorry for the monks who are trying to farm putrid rib bones...</div></div><hr />

I stand corrected. I'm sorry about that. They weren't around in my newbie days, so I was reiterating what I was told by someone else without doing the homework. Interesting to learn they are very difficult to do, though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
and no-one's killed her? She drops the Glowing Black Stone, which is 9 int, 10 sv magic. She's an uber rare spawn too.<br />
<br />
Someone will kill her, or she'll be gone on server reset.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Vuloshek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Really... then I wish I was strong enough to fight 2 of her, because they're both gone.  I'm glad I didn't know she had a nice drop at the time, I'd be pissed that I couldn't beat her, her pet, the other her and the other her's pet, 2 or 3 dread corpses that nobody could beat because they were with her, and maybe 1 or 2 restless skeletons, all at the same time.</div></div><hr />
