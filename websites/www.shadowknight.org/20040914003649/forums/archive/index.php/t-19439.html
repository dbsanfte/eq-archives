<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Awaon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been wondering about the degree of importance I should be putting on lightning reflexes over other defensive AAs.  Once I get my basic ones completely filled out - CA, CS, ND, PE - should I go for LR, or do I work first on PD?  Or ID?<br />
<br />
OR...<br />
<br />
Do I mitigate differently by choosing AAs such as SA, ToL and SCF?<br />
<br />
I had planned on choosing the latter, but I've noticed people lately acting as if LR is a crucial AA for SKs.  First, I was asked if I was interested in a hard adventure *if* I had LR5.  Later, I saw another SK listing (in the LFG additional comments) that he had LR5 along with his number of hit points.<br />
<br />
Are HP really king or are they simply a measure of a tank's e-dick?  It would seem that there are ways to stay alive other than straight hit points, especially when you're a SK who can tap for health.  But without fail, your HPs are always questioned when determining your ability to MT in raids and now in hard adventures.  My immediate goal is to be the best tank possible, while worrying about dps later on, so I want to choose my AAs wisely.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would max LR, tehn ID and then I would max PD.<br />
SA, ToL and SCF are all good AA's for mitigating HP with lifetaps, but I would maybe work those after you max your other defensive AA's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Menon Lifeblight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Each rank of LR is worth 1% of damage reduction.  Same as ID.  Both are more valuable than PD.<br />
<br />
I did the SCF/SA/ToL path myself before LR, ID, and PD.  It is better return for the AA spent.  But if LR5 will help you get groups, then it certainly won't hurt you to get it sooner rather than later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've finished CA3, CS3, ND3, PE... and at the same place.  I know that LR5 or ID5 is best to get next, but I'm actually getting PD3 next, just to have bragging rights of more hp than the other knights in my guild *grin*.<br />
<br />
LR is better at not getting spells interrupted.<br />
<br />
ID is better at not having huge spikes of damage that get you killed.<br />
<br />
Both prevent roughly the same amount of damage.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lynxal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">HPs are still very important.  Planning to lifetap to make up a 500HP difference another tank has over you is not really practical.  Especially since that tank is either another SK so it's a moot point, a Pally who can heal himself much more efficiently than you could hope to, or a warrior who mitigates damage better than you to start with.  <br />
<br />
If you are fighting trash exp mobs below your real ability (like LDoN Normal adventures for most 65s), then lifetaps and lifetap procs are probably helping you mitigate the amount of healing you need over a warrior since none of the mobs are really hitting either of you that hard.  However, when things go bad a group is going to want the higest Level/AC/HP/AA tank they can get...and that is what pick-up groups are going to look for up front (especially now that any poorly geared warrior using 4 expansion old weapons can hold agro).<br />
<br />
On a Hard advenure....unless you are an uber EP+ SK....your life expectancy is dependant solely on your healer getting heals off on you.  HPs give you that valuable second for a heal to land before the mob is slowed when it's really kicking you butt.  Even when it's slowed  they get the occasional good round of 900/900/900 that can be a shock to your health so any HP cushion is a good cushion.<br />
<br />
I would go LR5, ID5, PD3 if you are tanking a lot.  SA is not going to help your tanking/self healing when 9 times out of 10 you are probably using mental corruption in an exp group to keep up with the fast rate of kills.  The more you mitigate damage and smoothe out damage spikes the better chance you have of your healer judging their timing properly....and you living.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">SCF+ToL+SA with SoC is godly.  If I had to chose between giving up them or every other AA, I'd chose them.</div></div><hr />
