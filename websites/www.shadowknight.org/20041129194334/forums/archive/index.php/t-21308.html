<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Many say you guys need some upgrades melee wise to although I personally haven't seen anything to suggest that in any argument brought up yet, so I'm genuinely curious since with the way EQ is now while we play the same class in the same world we play a different game.  So... just to see if anyone can answer these sufficently to convince me.<br />

That should just about cover it I think...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dkhar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">We don't. The problem that we are having is a general opinion that a lot of other classes have come to believe in. Basically, the opinion that Knights are obsolete now that warriors can perform the Knight role more efficiently than Knights themselves. Once the high end Knights are balanced correctly, these opinions (or myths is actually a better word) should fade away and our group desireabilty return. <br />
<br />
I'm 65<br />
31 aa<br />
buffed 6.5k 1300ac<br />
only 1 65 spell (go summon corpse lol)<br />
recently unguilded<br />
a lot of pickup groups and raids<br />
<br />
So, as you can see, I am the perfect example of a mid-grade knight that you speak of. I can handle myself in the zones I am supposed to be in. My tanking ability is sufficient for 1 group encounters. I LFG alot, so I can definately say the Knights desireability has noticeably decreased over the past few months.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Knights Specialty: The knight gets to choose 1 weapon type (but just one weapon type) and gets a skill of 250 in that specific weapon. If they select a 1 handed weapon they get a bash skill of 225.<br />
<br />
Upgrades Needed: a small boost in melee DPS. Make us a specialist in 1 weapon type. Our fast cast spears of resisted too much so not an option. Our debuffs are nice, but unless undead hunting our casting DPS does not make up for our lower DPS.<br />
<br />
Why upgrade needed...if we have a warrior in group (a better tank), I need a secondary role of DPS and &quot;add-tank&quot;. Give me some more DPS or I am left out in the cold. Monks are pullers/dps, rangers are trackers/dps, rogues are stealth/dps...why cant we be add-tank/dps?<br />
<br />
Problem area...if tank in group, I am not considered an option...however I almost exclusively do guild groups and rarely raid. So I get choosen because of &quot;friends&quot;<br />
<br />
Affect other classes...I doesn't...except I think Paladins should get Knights Specialty also.<br />
<br />
Level 65<br />
<br />
113 AA's (more offensive then defensive)<br />
<br />
Progression Point...not in Vex That, PoTime...more of a LDoN Hunter...Play in BOT some.<br />
<br />
Loot System: Loot Council...but again  I rarely raid.<br />
<br />
SK Role: Main Tank in a Pinch, Pull in a pinch, Add-Tank, DPS (slightly under monk/rogue/ranger levels)</div></div><hr />

What do you think an SK's role is?<br />
<br />
<br />
1.) an ability/spell that provides some sort of security against spike damage.<br />
2.) i dont need them atm, but some time ago it would have been useful for my whole guild<br />
3.) see 2.)<br />
4.) As of 2.) in the time i may have needed such an ability i was MT in my guild, with no active warriors left (lower end causal player family style)<br />
5.) it would increase sk survivabilty and warrior replaceability, warrior would still remain best at tanking but sk would be a valueable replacement. Applications to higher guilds would even out in requirements, resulting in less draining warriors from lower end guilds. Something i always found interesting was to see the effect from class balance on my own guildroster. Every time when some class was ahead in power relativly to other classes, it only needed some weeks for higher guilds to adjust their requirements and thus resulting in draining these classes from the middle game guilds which then needed to replace their loss in taking them from the lower end guilds -&gt; removing these classes from my own guild, while i could go back and start helping newcomers to grow up, till the cycle startet again.<br />
Pre Time sk still have better aggro then warriors, but warriors now have enough aggro to do what is needed - without an sk.<br />
At my current stage of ldon pick up groups and pick up raids, i have no problem getting groups with people that i know, but its the people whom i never grouped with that are more likly to take an warrior over an sk.<br />
6.) warriors wont get their pickup groups as fast as now, instead war/sk/pally would be equally desired. Raidcontent wouldnt be influenced more then with a warrior tanking it.<br />
7.) 65<br />
8.) 54<br />
9.) i am at no progression type besides hunting plane of hate for the time of 566 drakes to get my hide and giving tanking to my chanters cod pet.<br />
10.) situational fairness - i am no loot whore<br />
11.) in the past up to 3-4 times a week, currently 1-2 group action only, since i hate large raids anyway<br />
12.) see magelo, nothing earthshattering<br />
- around 4k / 1.2 k<br />
13.) Playing since 2000, i think i have filled every role in an raidsetting, atleast multiple times , tank,offtank,puller,offpuller,mainassist,cc,aggro,snapaggro,dps,buffs, healing/manaregen,comedian, cr, ... and have liked everything, but as of definition i think we should be mainly tank and secondary flexible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Stryph</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">What upgrades do you think are needed?<br />
Better mitigation or higher dps role, frankly though Im all for the higher dps role if were to be subjected to being chosen after a ranger or monk to tank mobs.<br />
<br />
Why do you need these upgrades?<br />
We need something that gives us the ability to do something on raids besides be the FDed one in the corner waiting to loot rotting gear again...<br />
<br />
How long have you needed them?<br />
Myself? I could have used a better tanking mitigation ability on every raid, so I can split tank mobs better and let the warriors concentrate on the main objectives.<br />
<br />
What are your problem areas? (low desireability raids, groups, etc)<br />
I do nothing on raids anymore other then assist and watch for a mob that might accidently get past the tanks. Group wise, not so much because in the EPs you just need solid agro unlike GoD where you have to have a warrior's mitigation/defensive also.<br />
<br />
What problems will these fixes solve?<br />
Mitigation increase will help close the gap between the plate tanks while increasing the gap between chain and leather classes and the knights. Frankly that is one of the biggest problems I've seen.<br />
<br />
How will this affect other classes?<br />
The only real effect will be the warriors, but frankly I don't give a shit. Sony stepped all over us to make warriors wanted again, so I say we take some of that back, but that's just me.<br />
<br />

<br />
What content progression point are you at?<br />

<br />
What loot system do you have? (if guilded)<br />
Assigned, unique system to the guild in the way it's assigned.<br />
<br />
How much do you raid with your guild? (if applicable)<br />
Before I came back to the states, 3 days a week (Which is how much we raid anyways)<br />
<br />
What HP/AC do you have?<br />
Unbuffed 6200ish hp 1570ish I think ac, raid buffed goes from 8400ish hp to 8700ish hp and 1650ish ac to 1800ish ac.<br />
<br />
What do you think an SK's role is?<br />
Raid wise, tank mezzer and dps role (We just need better skills in the dps department).<br />
Group wise, Main tank or dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>shaneez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">65 sk 108aa family guild , raid 2 times a week, DKP guild,we kill everything up to rhags in ssra. Crush,IV,Doom,Vindi , Lacea Katta ect. I am one of a few Emp. and Vt keyed with some armor from both zones. 7489 HP 1541 ac. I have all spells but God spells. The upgrades I need: A defensive disc or sheild to at least make me preferred over a ranger, monk even if its for 20 or 30 seconds. The group spells other then zeb to go into the song window due to there short duration. Get rid of the voice line of spells and give us a new line of spells. The only time i have ever used voice was on a war and they no longer need more hate. I have always wanted revamped spells, everyone of them is underpowered at 65. I did not need a disc until the class balance. It could be a perception problem like Brael pointed out but whatever it is we are no longer perceived as tanks. My problem areas: I have a very hard time finding groups, almost like if im the only 65 left lfg i will get a tell. ( This isnt the case with ldon though, Im talking Bot tactics,Pov ect) Defence and Dps both lower than most classes. If a 58 war wants to take agro from me they disc, I can get it back but its the point a lower level war can tank with disc and take agro from me. Im using a Golden Rod. My role in guild, I still pull for my guild, offtank adds. I never MT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mdiyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">What upgrades do you think are needed?<br />
I believe that we need a mitigation improvement whether it be via a spell(not a good idea), discipline, or innate mitigation rebalancing.<br />
<br />
Why do you need these upgrades?<br />
Cause I'm tired of not being able to go 2 mobs without spike damage kicking my ass in GoD<br />
<br />
<br />
How long have you needed them?<br />
Since the first time I tanked in GoD<br />
<br />
What are your problem areas? (low desireability raids, groups, etc)<br />
I have hardly any groups ask me for anything in GoD unless people know me.<br />
<br />
<br />
What problems will these fixes solve?<br />
Will clear some of the stigma around the survivablitiy of the group with an SK tanking<br />
<br />
How will this affect other classes?<br />
Warriors may complain that we are still to close to them in tanking since the mitigation gap would be closer to them and further away from Chain wearers<br />
<br />
Paladins may seem more viable because of BSS, and the ability to lower mob DPS while tanking thus reducing downtime between mobs.<br />
<br />
Rangers/BST/any other class that has a mitigation disc, will not be suggested for the mob tank list during a raid when the OH SHIT protocol is initiated.<br />

Unbuffed: 6030/1473<br />
Buffed:  8478/1505<br />
<br />
What do you think an SK's role is?<br />
This is purely me, but I have fun knowing that I as an SK can do many things well.  Lately we have had an absence of monks to pull on raids, however instead of the night just being an xp night we raid with me as the puller,  I even have a robe i keep in my inventory jokingly to kind of keep up the illusion.<br />
<br />
I also off-tank as need be, and main tank during situations where defensive/furious isn't required(Hihi Bertox ring).<br />
<br />
Side Note:  I guess in my other post on the thread started by Stryph, my comments came across as a personal attack on Xanathol, this was not the case and I apologize for it seeming to be, however my question is moreso like the one(s) Brael asked, and since we both are at or around the same level of progression, I was just curious as to why if we were at the same level he felt that defensive was needed at that level.  I guess two people looking at a situation see two different things.  Anyway...</div></div><hr />

wouldn't mind a parry/riposte disc, or a mitigation disc.<br />
<br />
<br />
Why do you need these upgrades?<br />
a ranger/monk/bst/bard can survive a high damage output mob for a longer time than i can... or as an add tank i'm inefficient compared to a warrior.<br />

being squashed quite a few times waiting for slow to land, or eating up mana offtanking.<br />
<br />

if parry/riposte disc, SKs would get sacrificed instead of rangers building up agro before warrior taunts... if mitigation disc, would be more effective long term tank when necessary (might infringe on warriors).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">What upgrades do you think are needed?  <br />
Not qualified to answer that.  Although we need an upgrade in terms of tankability and a useful group role.<br />
<br />
Why do you need these upgrades?<br />
Sine the melees changes and increased warrior mitigation combined with warriors having at least serviceable agro.  Knights are useless.  You no longer need to slow mobs at this level on incoming or shortly after because the warrior can take the pounding while he builds agro and still not be a pain to heal<br />
<br />
How long have you needed them?<br />
Since Melee balancing and only to avoid obselesence<br />
<br />
What are your problem areas? <br />
Waste of slot even in an exp group no role and low DPS.<br />
<br />
What problems will these fixes solve?  <br />
Desirability, being useful<br />
<br />

Paladins will need a comparable upgrade to ours to stay in line with us, but even thier group heals are of more group use than anything SK's have.<br />

<br />
What HP/AC do you have? <br />
2100/920<br />
<br />
What do you think an SK's role is?  <br />
I beleive an SK should be 2nd choice for main tank (along with Pallies), focused on offense with the ability to fill in other roles in a pinch (scout, CR, puller, off tank, etc.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Duke Malagen Shai'Kar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Firstly, I doubt any arguement offered here will change the minds of those who think a class balance change for SK's should be limited to only the top percentage of the entire class, but for what it is worth...<br />
<br />
What upgrades do you think are needed?<br />
Damage avoidance disc, parry / riptose. Mitigation boost to bring us closer to current Warrior levels, and further from Chain based classed.<br />
<br />
Why do we need these upgrades?<br />
We need a boost to our Mitigation to simply stay within range of current Warriors, and a damage avoidance disc would allow us to be more effective off-tanks.<br />
<br />
How long have you needed them?<br />
Since Melee Balance went live, though these issues were present prior to that, but we had the best aggro ability of the tanks, which made groups / raids accept the increased healing needed. Now that Warriors have &quot;good enough&quot; aggro, raids / groups no longer have to accept the extra healing we need....they just use a warrior.<br />
<br />
What are your problem area's?<br />
Zero reason to have us do any tanking while a warrior is available. <br />
<br />
What problems will these fixes solve?<br />
It will bring us back to our position as off-tanks in raids, and a nice alternative to warriors in groups (not to the point of being favored, just nearly equal).<br />
<br />
How will this affect other classes?<br />
Should have zero affect upon warriors, but some will say that we would once again become the tank of choice in xp groups (which I do not believe).<br />

What content progression are you at?<br />
Stage 4 in Time (Vallon Zek). Trial 7 in GoD (Ikkinz).<br />
<br />
What loot system do you have?<br />
Bidding auction, he who bids highest wins item outright, or can lotto with whoever bid the same amount. If you're class can use, you can bid.<br />
<br />
How much do you raid with your Guild?<br />
Around 4-6hrs everyday depending on when we start.<br />
<br />
How much HP/AC do you have?<br />
unbuffed: 6559 HP / 1845 AC<br />
buffed: 9100 HP / 2135 AC<br />
<br />
What do you think an SK's role is?<br />
Raid: Off-tanking / Pulling.<br />
Group: Tanking / Pulling.<br />
<br />
In all honesty I'll never change my opinion that any future &quot;fix&quot; which may come about should be available to the entire Class, having only the characters level be the determining factor. By the way, I will not tank at all past Vxed without a warrior, and will only tank in Vxed to get people thru the trial, no nameds allowed without a warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Belyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Just a comment from what i remember of lower lvl play, the pets where utterly useless until the mid 50's.  The only place sk pets are really appropriate is in the xp group doing content well within their means at any lvl.  Giving the lower lvl sk a slightly better pet might work well for a small dps boost.  Also remember that back then having a mithril 2 handed sword or a pair of ssoys made you the bomb, now days someone new to eq with no help from PA can basically start the game with that or better which makes the lower lvl pets even more trivial.  Some kind of decent haste/atk pet buff for lower lvl might do the trick too.<br />
<br />
Its been forever since those days for me, I'm not sure that there is anything that needs fixing in that area or not.  In NO WAY am I implying that the pet should ever be used to &quot;fix&quot; balence with the high end sk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Xilith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Like Nocifer, I'd really like to see 1H + shield made more competitive to 2H, which due to the AAs and incredible weapons far outpaces it.  While you've said that GoD makes a shield a near necessity (and for warriors as well), I'd like to see it more viable in the VT-&gt;PoP stage.</div></div><hr />

12) What HP/AC do you have?<br />
13) What do you think an SK's role is?<br />
<br />
<br />
1.  DPS boost when not tanking, when tanking I feel we need to be able to tank named mobs in the areas we hunt.  This is not <br />
the case in a number of places starting in Tier 1 PoP.<br />
<br />
2) I'm the tank most often in any group I'm in, I don't like pulling around mobs because they kill me too fast for the healer to keep up.<br />
<br />
3) Since, Velious when I started losing my 3rd and 4th line tanking roles to rangers with weaponshield.  Watching the 2 rangers tanking Derakor after the 3 warriors had dropped really hammered it home.  Now, in PoP+ its come back again, shadow knights have no real damage mitigation other than snare and kite.<br />
My ability to tank mobs that hit for 700+ that mitigate slow is suspect.  It has returned to the trinity again, must have cleric, must have slower, then I can think about tanking giants in plane of storms or Bastion of Thunder.  Wing names in BoT aren't a possibility and I think they are supposed to be handled with a group.<br />
<br />
4) I often form the groups I'm in, rarely do people join me however and I come with a shaman and enchanter built in.  This greatly frustrates my ability to progress.<br />
<br />
5) Confidence that I can tank nameds in a given area that yeilds upgrades usuable by those that would join me.<br />
<br />
6) I think it would have little impact on other classes for us to have an auto-parry or auto-riposte for 10-15 seconds every 30 mins.  The goal here for me is to be able to tank lesser nameds and to be able to stand up to a greater named on the same par as a ranger or rogue.<br />
<br />
7) 65<br />
8) 104<br />
9) Pre-SSRA, with PoP Tier 1 loot mixed in.<br />
10) Loot council<br />
11) 90% of the time if I'm on, which has been most of the time.<br />
12) 1400 AC, 6000 hps when buffed.<br />
13) In the past puller, Main tanking, emergency tanking.<br />
      Now, bards pull better and we have 9 of them.<br />
      I've reached the point where there are very few raid targets<br />
      that I can tank, mainly only the ones that deal the majority of  their damage via AE.<br />
      Emergency tanking is still there as we don't normally have more than a handful of tanks on raid, but our rangers do a much better job of it with snare, root, weaponshield until the enchanters get stuff locked down.<br />
<br />
Simply put, I'd like to be a viable tank in the gear I have for 2 group affairs that the warriors in my guild with similar guilds are, I simply can't deal with the damage output from a mob dealing 400 dps.<br />
<br />
Food for thought, I thought EQs biggest mistake was starting to tune encounters for more than 24 people.  When they had to make all the changes to the bandwidth during Velious so allow for up to 50-60 people to be around each other at once is when I think they failed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1.  A &quot;defensive style&quot; discipline and increase in defensive and offensive skill caps.  Increase  the Stackabilty and move Aura of hate and aura of pain to short term buff windows.  <br />
<br />
2.  to be a viable back up as a raid tank, when the warriors die the only viable option shouldnt be camp a cleric.  <br />
<br />
3.  Since teir 3 at least maybe from Mithaniel Marr/Sol Ro/Rztw- elemental minis.<br />
<br />
4.  We are mediore pullers in most cases, 3rd rate tanks, our Buffs and debuffs are easily overwirtten in most raid situations.  Mobs have limited buff slots which is very apparent on large raids like Fennin ro-Rathe...my DPS goes down the tubes with Dots bouncing off mobs, im basically a warrior with less offensive capabilities and a lifetap.<br />

5.  Make us viable options to fill back up tank, rampage tank, slots also give us a place in damage when we arent needed elsewhere.  We arent as flexible as we should be, and our flexibility is limited and imposes on other classes.  With limited raid spots in new expansions, on top of forcing guilds to expand their raid forces (in PoP) our capabilities arent on par with any other classes thus giving guilds no real reason to actually want a shadow knight.<br />

We are able to grab aggro and tank quickly in tight situations but with the difficulty of most content and the reliability on defensive most would rather wipe or have a ranger WS tank.</div></div><hr />

What HP/AC do you have?<br />
What do you think an SK's role is?<br />
<br />
1. Obviously, it is not feasible that SK's are going to be able to tank boss mob encounters without beign significantly over-geared for it, ever. Now, assuming our role is to be tanking, this leaves us with few other options left, the primary option, and also the most desired option, being offtanking. I really think we should be BETTER than wars for offtanking. They dominate main tanking, and we can have offtanking. That seems perfectly acceptable to me. I am a strong supporter of Sleinn's ideas for a quick reuse &quot;mini-defensive.&quot; Exact numbers, of course, would be mulled out forever, and I dont wish to try to think out those now, so just as a number for presentation, 30 second duration, 30% mitigation, 15% spell mitigation, 3 minute reuse. I also think our aggro capabilities need heavy upgrades. Better aggro would support our offtank role by allowing us to grab control of adds quickly (possibly instantly..) and hold them down reliably. I think, also, as an afterthought wish...that possibly the same mini-def disc could increase our aggro generation abilities. Maybe an advanced Voice effect? DPS - why are wars out damaging us? That is simply and utterly ridiculous. Next they can get FD to so they can effectively be better at us than everything? Now, I do know that if our DPS goes up, it can and will be used as an excuse to not give us, or give us small, tanking upgrades. And that would just screw us over even more. But we do need to be relatively higher (to wars) in terms of sustained AND burst dps. Maybe not by a big margin sustained, but please by a bigger margin with burst dps.<br />
<br />
2. Because, as it stands, we're second-rate in everything. We have nothing to show. We are a sidelining class. We have no real niche to fill. We are not efficient at anything. We offer very little to the raiding game, which is what a whole lot of people play EQ primarily for. And personally, I play to raid. I exp too, and previously I quested, trader'd etc, but I do this to raid more, ultimately, to go progress. Getting bigger and better, conquering new things, moving forward, exploring new areas, this is what the game is for me, what makes it fun. And to do this I need to have appropriate aa, be high enough level, have good enough gear, enough flags, etc. And as it stands, wars outclass me doing just about everything I love doing in a raid, and there is almost 0 point in me doing anything significant when a war is there.(And of course the pulling situation, but thats for a different time...) Right now we tank worse than warriors, by quite a margin in both raid and group situations. To make up for this we have jack and shit. But, to make up for us getting jack and shit warriors get discs like Furious. Now, to expand on jack and shit. We get &quot;utility,&quot; and burst &quot;dps.&quot; Our utility is the ability to solo (with a shit return on exp for work put in), and feign death (pull). I realize we have other so-called utility, like a see invis spell, aura of darkness, diamondskin, etc. But these spells are so completely negiligible in today's game they aren't worth mentioning...there are VERY few of our spells that can't be replicated easily. To pulling, althought a precious role many of us desperately cling to, we are now pretty much at the bottom of the &quot;pile&quot; of typical pulling classes. We are ABLE to pull, but rarely do so when more suited classes are present. The almighty HT. What is this? Its fun. Its gives us the ability to solo old world content, and is reasonably useful on a few boss-type encounters EP+. It has almost 0 use in normal group situations. As an overall dps upgrade, being used instantly as it pops, it gives us approximately 2.2dps. Warrior's Furious disc not only provides more damage then HT, but helps to gain enormous amounts of aggro on their part. Admittedly, Furious is not able to be used as freely as HT(requiring the mob hitting you for it to work). Conclusion: We get close to nothing that's truly useful to us to make up for warriors having a large dominance over almost all our possible raid roles.<br />
<br />
3. I have not played as long as many people have, &quot;Beta 99!&quot; and so forth, but from what I have experienced in my time playing, we have always needed, not an upgrade perse, but another &quot;branch&quot; added to us. Something special, something unique, not shitty hand me down roles that we are outclassed at consistantly.<br />
<br />
4. As I have not personally been to GoD pass Tier 1 ( Vxed, Tipt, Sewers ) I cannot comment on &quot;high end&quot; single group problems for sk's. Generally, we dont do too bad in groups, but warriors do better. I would like to see, AFTER we get significant, really impacting changes made (haha, im speaking as if this is going to happen) some more group-desirability spells added, just some simple, unique stuff, that made exp go a little faster. Conclusion for groups: Fine.<br />
Raids: yes yes yes. See above. <br />
<br />
5. Sk's being completely fucking useless when a war or a bard is present. (for the most part, I know im dramatic)<br />
<br />
6. Obviously, warriors will bitch. They will not dominate every raid role, and will not be best tanks in every situation. It may piss rangers/monks off who think they are the up and coming tank classes as the gap is widened between knights and them. Depending on the extent of our dps increase obviously some other classes may bitch. Now, aside from bitching, the only classes I see this really effecting, not just in perception, but in reality, are rangers (weaponshield tanking maybe being taken away slightly) and warriors (obvious reasons).<br />

We would be inferior to warriors as druids are to clerics. Not able to do the huge jobs without significant overgearing or extra firepower, but still an acceptable niche in raids, primarily offtanking, with pulling abilities in a pinch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
1. Not really an &quot;upgrade&quot; more a retuning.<br />
Redistribute aggro and defensive skills between Warriors and Knights.<br />
Reduce Warriors aggro to a looooooong reuse discipline which makes it only practical for boss mobs.<br />
Something like the HT timer would be ok so Warriors use it once per raid for the boss and not for trash.<br />
Weapons like a BoW should not outaggro chaincasted Knight's spells.<br />
<br />
Give Warriors something like an &quot;Enraging Bow&quot; to help them with initial aggro in exp groups.<br />
<br />
Give Knights a form of minidefensive disk to widen the gap between Knights and rangers etc. in offtanking without threatening Warriors. The innate mitigation/avoidance properties of Warriors and Knights should be close to equal and clearly better than chain/leather classes. <br />
A significant HP advantage for Warrios over Knights is ok since it mainly helps with fast and hard hitting bossmobs.<br />
<br />
Improve SK's DPS to be slightly better than Warriors, alternatively reduce Warriors a bit to avoid clashes with the DPS classes. Pallys would have slightly lower DPS than Warriors to compensate for their stuns and heals.<br />
Warriors should be &quot;middle of the road&quot; amongst the three tanks.<br />
<br />
2. To define the differences between a boss MA and an Add-tank. <br />
<br />
3. Since the last rebalancing, we were fine in early PoP (exp-group Warriors were struggling there /nod).<br />
<br />
4. We do nothing better than a Warrior on raids besides pulling. But this is covered by monks in most guilds.<br />
Our buffs are of little consequence for most raids and often seen as a waste of buff slots.<br />
On raids you HAVE to do something &quot;best&quot; since there is always a tendency to min/max your crew in the long run.<br />
The &quot;best&quot; position for Knights appears to be off-tanking.<br />
<br />
We even loose in (percieved?) exp-group desirability currently but I don't care that much since I usually do guild groups.<br />
<br />
5. These fixes will establish a defined raid role for knights. SK's and Pallys will bring either DPS or healing to their offtank role, so they should find a balance of equal opportunities in raids.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Noctix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">What upgrades do you think are needed?<br />
We need some way to mitigate short term burst damage.  Whether this is a &quot;mini-defensive&quot; disc, a spell of some sort, or maybe just a riposte/dodge disc, something is needed.<br />
<br />
Why do you need these upgrades?<br />
Because I can't tank for normal single group encounters without a way to mitigate burst damge.  For instance, my group wins Hard LDoN collects almost automatically, with 30+ minutes to spare.  Put us in an assassinate though and I can't tank the boss long enough for slow to land.<br />
<br />
How long have you needed them?<br />
At least since LDoN came out but really, this has always been an issue.<br />
<br />
What are your problem areas? (low desireability raids, groups, etc)<br />
Groups.  I don't care about raids.  Others do but that's not my game.<br />
<br />
What problems will these fixes solve?<br />
It will allow a SK to be a viable tank in a normal group situation.  It's stupid that my group can dominate every form of LDoN but has to reject assassinates because of one glaring flaw in the SK class.<br />
<br />
How will this affect other classes?<br />
It will allow other classes to use a SK as a tank for more single group encounters and low-end raid targets.  It gives warriors a bit more competition as main tank for single group encounters.<br />
<br />
What level are you?<br />
61, almost 62<br />
<br />
How many aa's do you have?<br />
25<br />
<br />
What content progression point are you at?<br />
I don't play the &quot;progression&quot; game.  Almost 200 LDoN wins though,  about half of which are on the Hard setting.<br />
<br />
What loot system do you have? (if guilded)<br />
Not guilded.  I play in a permanent group though and we have need based loot system, with all coin and non-upgrade loot going to a bazaar mule and the profits split equally.<br />
<br />
How much do you raid with your guild? (if applicable)<br />
I don't raid.  4-5 LDoN adventures plus around 5 hours of random questing etc.<br />
<br />
What HP/AC do you have?<br />
7240hp/1718ac with normal group buffs<br />
<br />
What do you think an SK's role is?<br />
Single group tank before all other rolls.  Low-end raid tank in a pinch.  Fill the roll of puller or dps when another class is tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Wildize</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I'm going to approach this a different way. Let me ask you a few questions instead, Brael: if you were level 65 with little/no AA, and you were forming a group of other new level 65's, or leading a raid for your guild of new level 65's to go clear NTOV or something trivial like that... what would you use an SK for - in a single group OR in a raid? Would you *ever* put an SK in a role if you had a Warrior of similar level/experience there? I wouldn't - there is simply no reason to do so.<br />
<br />
Warriors tank AND off-tank everything with their agro abilities and multiple discs, with little to no downside to using them. Previous to the agro changes, Warriors could do it, but they had zero snap agro, and the group/guild had to work with the Warrior to 'let' them keep agro. This is no longer the case. At level 65 with equivilent AA and roughly level gear, it is next to impossible for an SK to take and/or keep agro from a Warrior who is also trying to keep agro now - much less any other class. Do you really think Warriors need high end agro weapons/augments to keep agro in fights now with their added agro abilities? They don't.<br />
<br />
Warriors and SK at level 65 have comparable DPS, although the SK is admittedly higher, but not by that much. The gap is probably bigger now than before though, due to the SK being able to unload with spells without FD'ing... and the fact that all the Warriors are tanking things (I'm ignoring Furious for this discussion, but it makes this gap even smaller)! This is highly weapon dependant, but the Warrior weapons at that level are not good enough to overtake the SK spells and the SK would outdamage the Warrior 99% of the time... but there would be easily 6 classes on the raid that would far outdamage the SK!!! Not exactly a necessary role for an SK... but looking good compared to the Warrior! Woohooo!<br />
<br />
Monks or Bards would pull - SK's are a distant 3rd (or lower) now. An SK can still do it in most places, but rarely by choice, and I sure wouldn't look for one to do the pulling. Bards and Monks have both gotten SIGNIFICANT pulling aids given to them since PoP - SK's have gotten nothing - but apparently that is not our *primary* role, so no one seems to care. Me personally - I liked pulling, and I think this is at least as lame as the Warrior changes... but I think I'm in the minority.<br />
<br />
In Kunark we weren't totally gimped compared to Warriors for tanking in groups, because high agro classes like chanters and rogues loved having SK tanks so they could cast/damage without worry - now they can do that with Warriors too. If the SK worked on it they could be a puller for any group/raid in the Kunark days, but now this is really innefficient. SK's were starting to define the agro/offtank role in Kunark, although this wasn't widely accepted (I know my guild at the time was pro-Warrior 100% of the time in Kunark still). I think most (including me) thought Kunark was the dark days of being an SK - I got groups and leveled and had fun - but it was due to my personality and friends, not due to my role. Do you think the improved damage spells we got with PoP actually make up for the fact that we now have *EVEN LESS* than in the Kunark days to bring to a group or raid in comparison to other classes?<br />
<br />
I don't think the question is about what exactly non-uber SK's need, it is a question of why don't they need the same things? They need to be comparable with Warriors (and Monks/Bards, but that is another topic) so a good SK can actually fill a role - not take the role outright, but fill the role without a significant drop in efficiency. I acknowledge that a 65SK *COULD* tank/off-tank in a group or on a raid - even many older expansion boss mobs - but the question is really: WHY WOULD YOU WANT THEM TO? A Warrior would do it more efficiently every time - that is not class balance, regardless of whether it *can* be done or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Rhumba_Kween</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Not going to answer all your questions:<br />
<br />
My perspective: 300+ AA's, Just shy of elementals, I raid 1 day a week.<br />
<br />
The problem that lower level Knights face is exactly the same that high end Knights face. The only difference being that high end Knights do not have the content opened up to them to be able to over outfit themselves for the content that Warriors can tank now.<br />
<br />
With the many enhancements given to the Warrior class, they can move on to harder content then they could when you came through this stage. Prior to the retune, we've seen stories of Pre Time warriors tanking many of the harder group trials. And there abilty to over tank for their gear, certain content is what the lower end SK has to compete against now.<br />
<br />
I am fairly lucky in that my usual group includes a Warrior. He has no Raid loot and has never spent over 30k on an item. This mean he has no Vellious Dropable gear or any high end pop/ldon hard items. He only has a few pieces of Ornate. Even so, with the HP's AA's he is about to cross the 8500 hps mark buffed.  I,  with some raid loot and most of the best buyable gear out there, am not nearly the tank that he is. 6 months ago, we seemed fairly equal for the diference in gear that we wore, now it is not that way. He is far and away the better day to day tank before defensive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Pretecf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Sorry, but these questions never reach the heart of the problem.  I am a 62 SK with 50 AAs and no role in a raid for my character.  This I am certain of because I set up the roles on most raids and certainly, I would not choose a the second or third best skill to perform any of the roles available.  (OK, I pull in Chardok until we get to the King room.  But it is easier to lead the way to avoid the pitfalls there.)<br />
<br />
I don't care what role is chosen for us, but I want one.  And, I want it to start at level 50 when I started raiding.  I want my toon selected for a raid because of what is expected of a shadowknight.  I was happy back in the day when we were pullers.  I was happy when we were the tank of choice and just as happy when my role was to watch for adds.  Heck, I was even mildly entertained when the only role left was dragging corpses of those who did not follow instructions (or the rangers who could not avoid death).<br />
<br />
We had to teach monks to pull, warriors to control aggro, rogues to handle corpse runs and several classes to off-tank.  If they ever give us a role again, we should all promise each other that we will not teach another class to do it, EVER.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Androsulach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Brael?  Were the melee upgrades limited only to those Monks, Rogues, and Warriors who were 60+?

I think our raid role sucks atm.   Warriors are better off tanks now they mitigate damage so much better and have adequete aggro at that level after the chages so our aggro advatage is useless.  <br />
<br />
As far as groups go I can tank everything fine except the named we run into just fine.  I'm talking 1 group named, but what good is a tank that can't tank the named your after I'm mean thats usually what your after.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>frotty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">First off, I think this is a loaded question. Melee upgrades? Who cares... we're still going to be second fiddle meleer. We seem to have gotten shafted in terms of not getting progressively upgraded when rogues/monks/warriors were notched up yet another notch in terms of melee. But that's not the main problem:<br />
<br />
The main problem is that a SK going through the PoP progression, from Grummus &amp; Xanamech to the Elementals, is basically never the preferred choice for ANYTHING.<br />
<br />
I show up to raids and spam zev and aura (sometimes) and put out my mediocre dps while staring at the mobs ass, then call it a night.<br />
<br />
I feel bad when I take loot from other classes, because I know it doesn't really help my guilds progression at all for me to have more loot.<br />
<br />
In the lower tiers, say for Bertox cycle, pre-warrior taunt upgrade, the tank mez was at least SOMETHING we could niche ourselves in. But my guild prides itself on crowd control and the tank mez isn't really a major boon. We were also a guild that came into PoP out of NToV, and not VT or even too much SSRA.<br />
<br />
When we hit 65, and the sks got aura, it was great. But that was only because the chances of one of our few beastlords getting ferocity was pretty slim. Now they have it, and if they would be, lets say, replacing me, they'd be feroing the group.<br />
<br />
So that leaves Zevs, which will never make or break an encounter, and being a voice bitch to warriors... which is really a throwover from the old days when they weren't as good with taunt.<br />
<br />
You could easily invent some quirky new skill that was ours and only ours that would make it valuable to have SKs in a raid.<br />
<br />
It would just be a little bit more interesting if for *EVERY CLASS* there was a necessity situation:<br />
<br />
&quot;If we don't have X # of [each class] we can't do this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rather than: oh, crap, &quot;not enough clerics, not enough chanters&quot; constantly.<br />
<br />
But again, why fix anything when we can easily just shell out an extra $12 a month and bot our very own &quot;More Relevant Class.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
In summation, I would like things such as (and these are random examples):<br />
<br />
...a large scale AE spell, aka, a method to do things similar to bards swarm kiting field of gib or casters AEing 20 mobs at once at tables.<br />
...a higher level fear.<br />
...ability to pack more of a punch with a pet via pet buffs/skills.<br />
...a spell that makes us unviable as tanks (taps a crapload of AC and ATK) but severely cripples a mob to DoTs or something, who knows.... Perhaps not as much as to conflict with other similar spells... perhaps it stacks with those? Dunno. the theme is: it sucks if you're tanking, it makes you a gimp, but it makes the mob more sensitive to a different tank or spells, etc. Good for kiting and adds raid viability.<br />
<br />
EDIT: NOTE: Even if we had all of these things, I'm not sure it would &quot;click&quot; well. It's just one of those things that we'll know it when we have it, when we can grab a group and not feel like some shunted step-child in regards to AAs/hour.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm not even mentioning endgame &quot;we can't tank, warriors must&quot; stuff. I'm talking about adding things to our class that wouldn't encroach on things like PVP or other classes at all, but would allow us some flexibility when we're not in a group (which, grouping, we're fine from pop1 through elementals with luclin era AAs). <br />
<br />
1. Raid level utility<br />
2. Soloability increased. If we're doomed to fucking dot kite, toss us a bone and let us do some more damage somehow. <br />
<br />
I agree with you 100% Brael, I see nothing horribly out of place with our melee in PoP. It's not so specific as that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Androsulach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Has anyone looked at Berserker mitigation?  Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think they are considered a pure melee class.  Their summon line may look like a spell, but it's a tome and uses a little Endurance and axe components to summon that stack of axes.<br />
<br />
My point is this.  We already knew that Warriors were going to be better, since they were on a different defense table.  This latest change only made that table better and left us not one step, but two behind.  At minimum, we should have been given the table they were on before the -1 DI table.  They did it the last time they upgraded the melee tables.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>RoshenWampa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">What do you think an SK's role is?<br />
IMO, SKs should be a pseudo pulling, dps, aggro class.  We are a utility jack-of-all-trades class, that isn't suppose to be the 'best' at anything<br />
<br />
What upgrades do you think are needed? <br />
Sony has made it clear that we're suppose to be behind not only warriors, but Paladins in tanking ability.  However, I feel that as being a 'knight of hate/fear', our AGGRO should be superior to either of the other tank classes.  Currently, it isn't.  A war with time BP and GoD gloves can hold aggro much stronger than most SKs.<br />
<br />
If we're suppose to be pullers, give us stonewall; that monk AA.  <br />
<br />
DPS; give us more AA to upgrade our dmg.  An AA to miss less, or yet another upgrade to soul abrasion.<br />
<br />
ALSO, currently both our brother class (Paladins) and father class (Necros) have some form of rezz.  This makes them much more desireable in single group instanced content.  I would like to see SKs get a rezz: maybe 90% rezz that takes 2 essence emeralds.  It would be too expensive for every day use, but at least give us another utility for a group.<br />
<br />
Tanking upgrades would be nice, but personally I would rather see us become more of a utility class<br />
<br />
I would also like to see an AA, that gives us some additional melee migation bonus when using a shield.  If we take a dps penelity, we should recieve some addition reward.<br />
<br />
What problems will these fixes solve?<br />
You fix our dps, our aggro, and give us rezz.  It would solve the 'desireablity' of the SK class.  For single group content it would give us a role, and allow us to contribute in groups that take a war or pal along.<br />
<br />

Why do you need these upgrades?<br />
Currently we are a very confused class.  Our raid role is NOT well defined.  If we're assigned to tank, we can't do the job as well as wars or pals.  If we're assigned to pull, monks do a better job than us most the time.  If we're left to dps, even wars will outdps us.<br />
Upgrade us, at least in a few of these fields, and make it clear to us what our role is through unique AA to the SK class.<br />
<br />
How long have you needed them?<br />
These problems started in PoP<br />
<br />
<br />
What are your problem areas? (low desireability raids, groups, etc)<br />
Currently we're not viewed as a neccesity to a group or raid force.  <br />
Group: we are a 'I can't find a war or a pal, so I'll take the SK to tank'.  We are rarely asked to pull single group, because we can't lull like a bard/monk.  <br />
Raids: We don't tank as well as other classes.  Our aggro isn't as strong as Pals or Wars.  We don't pull as well as monks.  We don't contribute a significant sum of dps.<br />
<br />
How will this affect other classes?<br />
I'm not asking to take any other classes place.  I'm happy to let wars remain to primary tank; while I'd appericate a upgrade to our tanking ability, I'd rather see us be the 'aggrokings', and allow wars to keep their current tanking skill.<br />
As far as dps goes, theres no reason wars should be even competive dps with SKs.  This should not surprise other classes.<br />
