Some of the mobs are pretty wimpy and wasnt sure on the levels.  Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Groff Gorespiller</div><div class="date">02-23-2004, 11:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">From personal experience, if your group's average level is 64 or greater, fear is safe.  This may dip down even further, but I know for a fact that three 65's, a 64 and two 63's in a group was enough to bump the mob level on a normal adventure in to the range at which fear was safe on all mobs.<br />
<br />
It seems like I had a group with average level 63 or so that was fear safe as well, but I didn't check the actual average level, so I'm not sure on that one.<br />
<br />
I've never tried this, but do mobs run if you fear them while they're mez'd?  If not, there's an easy way to find out what the precise minimum average level is.  I'll do some testing at some point when I finish my last three Tak adventures and the points aren't so important to me anymore.</div></div><hr />

they don't run when mezzed  <br />
<br />
Even when below the fear cap?<br />
<br />
I don't doubt or dispute fear's effectiveness at breaking mez.  I'm just saying that if we know one way or another whether mobs below fear cap will run when mez'd (and this is probably known and discussed ad nauseum, I've just never seen it and never cared enough to look), then it's easy to determine what the average group level in an adventure would have to be to ensure viability of fear for aggro.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cames</div><div class="date">02-24-2004, 01:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">At 65 the lowest level person you can group with is 58, so you are likely to have a level 60 adventure at minimum.  In those adventures, I have not seen any running on fear.<br />
<br />
In level 55 and below adventures, there will be an issue as the mobs are blue to a 55.<br />

If you are 55 and the mob is white or greater con, then you are safe. Use it in an upper 50s group for agro and use it sparingly if there is a chance that a blue mob is under 55.</div></div><hr />

When breaking mezz I just taunt, cast terror, taunt again, and engulf....works for me everytime.</div></div><hr />

Better to not have as complete of an aggro lock than bring a train on top of your group's heads and TPW.</div></div><hr />
