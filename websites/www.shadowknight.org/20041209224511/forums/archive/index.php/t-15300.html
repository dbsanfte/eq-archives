<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grimskayle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, well puppet strings are a lil hard to come by, and illusions didn't work. I was wondering if anyone as ever had a lv 65 enc charm rottgrime so you could turn in braids?  If so, what charm did you use and how did u go about using it? Friend of mine was saying the charms have a duration and long recast time. I really want to get that hammer. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thacker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">have to charm it yourself eh?  That sounds like a problem for SKs without charm.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ZealPath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yes and no (http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=11643)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Solan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Having a high level chanter charm Rottgrime for the turn in sounds like a viable option actually. All charmed pets are indifferent and thus he will take the braids.<br />
<br />
 I would think Thacker is thinking about charming the undead foreman, where you need a higher faction than indifferent to get the hammer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mystina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">A bard (Human-veeshan-max kos) friend did get the hammer by charming the foreman.<br />
It was before SoL and at 60 he had problems to charm him, he seemed very resistant to charm.<br />
<br />
I dont know if it still works, its about 2 years ago, heh *shrug*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Saruton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Aks sorry didnt read thorougly.  For the braids it should work to have a chanter charm Rottgrime. To know which Charms to use etc i would suggest asking on the Chanter Board maybe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>pikup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My 53 bard was able to charm the forman and get the hammer very easily.  (I might have gotten lucky but charm landed on the second cast.)  <br />
<br />
I was hoping that illusions might be good enough to get my Iksar to be able to turn in braids, but sounds like that does not work.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Furiousgeorge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It will work you knuckle head! :P if you get this message fast log back on as i got the chanter lined up</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Darkmourn D`Estrellas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I thought you couldn't get faction from turning in to a charmed mob?  You can get any rewards, like xp or items, but no faction.  Unless they changed it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Grundarz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">turning in braids will raise your VS faction?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Carshail Shel'rac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Foreman can't be charmed anymore, at least not on Kael :rolleyes:  received a &quot;wouldn't be affected&quot; message as I tried it with a friends 65 chanter.</div></div><hr />

Lol, my below 40 twink bard has had the hammer since the mid twenties, you can have it at a very low level.<br />

Dark Elf Mask and Cinda's Charismatic Carillon are your friends.</div></div><hr />
