<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Arangar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Would a small group of say 3-4 level 60s be able to do adventures in LDoN? Or would it be to hard?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Drakonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think its meant to scale down some if you have 4 or 5 members in your group, but I've only done it with 6 so far so can't confirm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Morgrist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">A good 4-group can do it on Normal. I wouldn't try hard unless you're REALLY well-equipped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Arangar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">but 4 people is minimum?</div></div><hr />

but 4 people is minimum?  <br />
<br />
Yes.  You can't start an adventure with less than 4.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lindyile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I did a 4 person group (2 2boxers) with a guildie over the weekend.  I was playing 59sk and 63cleric and he was playing 65 chanter and 58 wizzie.  Unless your very well equiped you will most likely fail.  Yea they may scale but your losing a lot of dps/utilities without those 2 other people.  This makes it hard.  It is real good xp and loot though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Arangar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Did it with 4 toons in MM the other night:<br />
60 sk and boxed 65 chanter<br />
65 sk<br />
60 druid<br />
<br />
was a nice assasination mission, that we succeded with 20-30 mins to spare, not many points, but very doable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sarlack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I had a group that started out with a full group of 6, but not 5 minutes into it, 3 people left.  Was just me (53 SK at the time), a druid and enchanter.  It was a kill 'em all mission and we failed at normal with 2 count 'em TWO mobs left, but we finished up for the lesser points reward.  If just one more stayed I'm sure we could of moped up easily.</div></div><hr />
