<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Astarin ShadowPrince</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has ANYONE ever heard of having a HT interrupted? I have a guildie that swears that she has interrupted a HT in a duel... and another guildie that swears that her HT was interrupted in the same duel... sounds like some BS to me... anyone EVER heard of this?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Insta casts can be interupted.  I've had procs interupted.  Granted thats only happened 2-3 times in 4+ years, but it has happened.  No doubt its possible for HT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Khat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Harm Touch is flagged as Interruptable so it's definitely a possibility of it happening.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Space</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">yup had it interrupted a few times in 5 years usually only when im being battered from all sides.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Astarin ShadowPrince</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">hrmm interesting... just seemed odd... cool thanks for the info</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Arikash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">That would take some badass timing to interrupt a HT, maybe I'll try it with my bro sometime.<br />
<br />
Me: Oops, looks like you missed the interupt bud, oh sorry man, did I just cast SoD and BoH on you? ;p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Daarksun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've never had one interrupted by being hit or anything. Only had one interrupted in 5+ years and that was while fear kiting. I was moving and hit HT and it didn't fire, though it let me hit it again in about 5 seconds. I've had MC/SoC procs interrupted a few times though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">/nod on self procs being interrupted.<br />
<br />
There was a time period (I'd guess somewhere in 2002?) where the interrupts on Scream of Death (lvl 39) were so bad, I went back to Vampiric Embrace from a BE piece -- which for some reason didn't seem to interrupt as often.<br />
<br />
Lately I don't think I've had any memorable interrupts on self procs but at one time, though only for a few weeks if I recall, it was really bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Muddah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">ive seen the Disc become active and harmshielded and not ate the HT but ive never heard of one being interrupted</div></div><hr />
