<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">- Added taunt state saving for Suspend Minion<br />
<br />
- Added pet hold state saving for Suspend Minion<br />
<br />
- Made it so Suspended Minions update their visibility after they are unsummoned.<br />
<br />
- Reset bards meditate skill back to 1. Having skill &gt; 1 didn't effect mana regeneration.<br />
<br />
- Created four new label types which can be referenced in UI files: <br />
<br />
EQType 128 = Mana / Max Mana <br />
<br />
EQType 129 = Endurance / Max Endurance <br />
<br />
EQType 130 = Group Leadership Exp % <br />
<br />
EQType 131 = Raid Leadership Exp %<br />
<br />
- Added checks when selling items back to adventure merchant to handle augments in the item <br />
<br />
- If any augments have a point value, the merchant will tell you how much you will get for them <br />
<br />
- When you try to sell an item with augments, you will see a confirmation dialog; if you accept, you will then receive the total points for the item and the augments <br />
<br />
- If any augment does not have a point value, the merchant will not accept the item from you <br />
<br />
- More AA Fixes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Androsulach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Any idea on how much of that, aside from the UI stuff, will go live in the patch on the 14th?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Leafweir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Er, did they forget that the meditate change was in originally to help memorization times? Will prolly hurt low level bards more than anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">it isn't going to change a thing for bards... its just that when they trained it at the trainer they'd have whatever their current level was (usually 10 or 11 or 12 or whatever), rather than having bards think incorrectly &quot;i could wait till level 50 to train meditate, then i'd regen 5 mana/tick sitting and no other bards would&quot; they're setting the skill to 1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I see they upped the buy-back percentage for LDoN gear from 50% to 70% on test.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Wow, nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">- The &quot;Spell recovery not yet met.&quot; bug is fixed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">- The &quot;Spell recovery not yet met.&quot; bug is fixed<br />
<br />
That alone is teh win.. About damn time! Most annoying bug we had to endure for long time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Khat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I see they upped the buy-back percentage for LDoN gear from 50% to 70% on test.<br />
I'm not too familiar with the changes regarding the buyback stuff since I don't play on test.  Does this imply that LDoN AP-purchased items as well as purchased Augments can be sold back to a vendor?<br />
I.E.  Can I sell back my MM Death Embracer's Chestplate and get some AP points back to eventually put towards the Tak Royal BP?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The &quot;Spell recovery not yet met.&quot; bug is fixed<br />
<br />
That's been in a patch message before, probably over a year ago.  Clearly they did a bang up job of fixing it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yes, they did. They ACTUALLY thought it was fixed til at summit, someone mentioned that its still there and developers were surprised about it.. Huh? Did they ever bother to read /bug messages?? Or maybe no-body ever bothered to send /bug to them? I just find it odd that developers weren't aware of it til recently..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>cauchy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">khat - yes.  So originally, you would get 50% of the points back from turning in AP purchased items, they've bumped it to 70% according to Klotar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">So if you bought the Miragul's plate and then later upgraded to the Tak the loss would only be 228 AP wasted (assuming the 70% return on the EF item)<br />
<br />
Edit: Hobart's post on changes  (http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=testing&amp;message.id=2782&amp;no_redir=true)   Latest update at bottom of page.<br />
<br />
Interesting that a programmer is the most communicative.</div></div><hr />
