<br />
Any good chat channels? the ones on stormhammer and extremely dull and apparantly i have a group of people that are bitter at me and just talk shit to me...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">That doesn't get him plat Keevel, you fail.<br />
The question was how to pass the time, not make plat.  You fail.</div></div><hr />

My dear Keevel, he wants plat.  You fail.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">How do YOU pass the time?<br />
Any way to make it more enjoyable?<br />
Dear Brael,<br />
<br />
He's asking how to make it more fun.<br />
He not asking how or where to farm.<br />
Are you suggesting he wouldn't have fun having sex with you?<br />
Also, he could sell the picutres, and the vial of Brael juice for plat.<br />
<br />
Everybody wins.<br />

Love Keevs</div></div><hr />

Watch movies<br />
Play on console games or retro games on my laptop<br />
Do crossword puzzles<br />
Chat with people<br />
<br />
But i find farming very difficult and tedius those are my tanking activities, for farming id probably read a book. Though movies are good there too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Chayde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Movies, definately, especially if you are doing mindless farming, for tradeskill items.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Skoggel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Boring camps are a great time to be productive. My apartment got near a full cleaning while camping Stormfeather. I wrote a paper while camping the AC as a youngun. Mistress of Malevolence camp, which has one or two mobs (depending on how you wanna do it) on 30 minute respawn timers, is just peachy for spending 80% of your time doing something else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Synapticus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Best way to pass the time:  Don't play, any game should never become a chore.  <br />
Can't see how anyone can play this game for more than 10-12 hours a week, i barely have enough time to sleep 4 hours a night.<br />
Im so jealous you guys actually have such free time!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Iohotep-CT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">The answer to the question is....<br />
<br />
<br />
There is no such thing as fun farming. Its doin the same stuff over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again. Pure and simple. Yes, you can watch tv, do chores, talk to friends and family, but ultimately when all that is done, farming is boring. Best thing to do is stop farming when it becomes boring. EQ is a game, not a job, if it gets boring, then stop playing.</div></div><hr />

Lol, today I went to a few local game shops to try and locate an EQ 90 day game card...<br />
  One shop I went in this fat pimply kid comes up and says &quot;Can I help you?&quot; <br />
  &quot;Yes, I need an EQ subscription card you have any in?&quot;<br />
   Fat kid &quot; Pssshahh,&quot; rolling his eyes &quot; Im world of warcraft...I dont play EQ, but Ill look...&quot;<br />
  <br />
  Hehe, he acted like I was putting him out to go look for an item that was so obsolete...<br />
<br />
   &quot;Im world of warcraft..&quot; lol jackass, like I give a fuck what he plays...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">A year or so ago, maybe more I went to buy a gamecard at EB.  I ask the guy at the counter for a gamecard and he gets it and proceeds to tell me how much better DAOC is than EQ, well... as he bags it and gives it to me he responds with &quot;Here you are ungrateful bitch, you should be glad we still carry these DAOC is putting EQ out of business&quot;.  Also, a few months ago (actually... this one was probally 8 months ago) I goto this sandwich place and ask the girl at the counter for a turkey club, shes wearing all these clothes that have video game names/characters on them which I found alittle odd but started talking to her anyways about games, then I mentioned my EQ character and she called me a &quot;gaming god&quot; and gave me the sandwich for free.  Another time last week I was at subway getting a turkey/cheese sandwich and the 15-16yr old girl behind the counter is talking to her friend behind the counter that she works with.  She starts talking to her friend about her party the night before and saying she shouldn't have invited all these guys over because they have diseases and she should trust her because she knows.  This is while she was touching all my food and I just thought to myself... couldn't you have waited 5 minutes to say that, preferably when I'm not within hearing range of you?</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot; So ok now that you have identified yourself as a WoW fanboi - care to do your job and sell me what I want?<br />
Or shall I ask for your manager and complain to him that you implied by not playing WoW I am somehow deficient?&quot;<br />

That usually gets the wind up them.</div></div><hr />
