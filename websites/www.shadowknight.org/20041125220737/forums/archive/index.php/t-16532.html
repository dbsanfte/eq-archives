<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>AislinSteele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I didn't post this on the 'What do we want from LDoN' thread because I felt it warrants it's own thread...<br />
<br />
It'll be a pain to program, but might be an idea for a future expansion (provided they have more like they say they will). Make the various races able to fight for their cities, or able to take over other cities. It'll be, essentially, a server-wide race war. An army of trolls, in this case, can mob Grobb and retake it, fighting both PC and NPC defenders. Dark Elves can raid Felwithe and vice-versa. To prevent it from becoming a frequent hassle, set it so it's GM-run and the day(s) this can be done are announced a week/month ahead of time.<br />
<br />
As far as design is concerned, if a city is taken over, change all the NPC's in said city to the model/faction of the conquering type. As far as zone changes, I have no suggestions (a complete revamp is out of the question). This can be the sort of thing that will make what race you choose matter more than it does now.<br />
<br />
Trolls won't be guaranteed they'll get their city back, but it'll give them a fair shake at it, and us Dark Elves can finally get rid of those bloody High Elven snobs :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Murgutroid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">That will never, never, never happen. Out of probably about a million reasons why, here's a few that popped into my head right away. In no particular order...<br />
<br />
1. How many quests would be broken by this? If the big foreheaded types in Erud decided to finally rid the world of their heretical brothers in Paineel, where would Duriek and Gerot go? To an allied city? What if there weren't any left? Out into some dark corner of Toxx? Maybe, but if the devs wanted them out there, I think they'd be there already. It's a pretty minor piece of the puzzle, but getting inside the city to talk to Gerot is still part of the trick. Where would all of the other quest givers go?<br />
<br />
2. Where would the newbies start if their historical home city fell? As it is now, there are only four dark cities left, counting Paineel. Neriak already has two races starting in it, what if Oggok went down? Could you put three races in Neriak? What if Paineel or Cabilis were taken out? Even if those races weren't KoS to the Inkies, how many could you squeeze into one city? What if all the dark cities were defeated at once? You know somebody would try it.<br />
<br />
3. What if you were bound in a city that got taken out and you died? Death loop? Or would they move your bind point? If so, where? Someplace neutral like PoK? What if you don't have PoP? To whatever remaining allied city was still standing? What if you're KoS there despite the fact that your two races are on good terms? I know evil characters who've screwed their faction with another evil race by killing guards or other NPC's, or by hunting in CB when they were little.<br />
<br />
4. Would the Outpost count? If it would, I think that would be one of the first places to go. All of those light loving, tree hugger types would be looking to avenge themselves on the Goon squad there. And that might really suck for anybody who relies on their OT hammer much.<br />
<br />
5. What criteria would they use to decide if a city had actually been taken over? All of the NPC's being dead? That might not be all that hard in places like Oggok and Kaladim, they're not that big. But what about Freeport? They'd have to stretch the respawn rate in cities to several hours or more just to make sure that citizens weren't respawning behind you, making it impossible to conquer the larger cities. They could do that, of course, but if a raid failed, it would make a good chunk of that city useless to regular folks just trying to go about their everyday business there.<br />
<br />
6. Who gets credit for sacking the city? What race would take possession of it, if multiple races were involved in it's demise? If all the Trolls, Ogres, Dark Elves and Iksar stormed Felwithe, what kind of NPC's would repop there? What if some turncoat High Elves helped? Would it go back to them? If a mix of light and dark races hit Gukta, would it just keep on as Gukta? Or would it become Grobb again? And if you limited a raid to just one race, the races with the highest populations would really be in the driver seat, with the more rare breeds getting kicked around a lot.<br />
<br />
Other questions/concerns would include the fact that on those special days when these city wars are sanctioned, each city (and probably the newbie area(s) just outside its gates) would have to be made a PvP arena. That would almost certainly piss off a lot of players on blue servers who may not feel like playing PvP that day, but still want to play and have access to these zones. Plus, think of the disadvantage dark races would have. There are way more goodie-goodies than us, and it wouldn't be that hard for them to organize the forces to take down Oggok, Neriak, Paineel, Cabilis and the Outpost all on the same day. But think of how hard it would be to take out Freeport, Qeynos, Felwithe, Ak'Anon, Kelethin, Kaladim, Rivervale, Halas, Shar Val, Erud, Gukta and Firiona Vie all at once. Especially if PC's are allowed to help defend.<br />
<br />
Besides, you can already raid city zones, if you want. You just can't keep them. And unless they add special NPC's with new quests or items to vend in the city after it's taken, why would you want to keep it? Other than taking Grobb back and chasing those slimy, bug-eyed, worm-eating freaks back to the mud holes and lilypads they crawled out from under, I can't think of any city I want that bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>AislinSteele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">3 things...<br />
<br />
1) All valid points, most of which can be addressed if the Dev team thinks about them<br />
<br />
2) The idea is primarily for the Grobb issue, just stretched to the rest of the game for the sake of amusement<br />
<br />
3) And idea is an idea. And since I wander the boards while at work, I can't devote much time to thinking out every little detail, as it seems you have. Eyes read Trolls complaining, idea forms in brain, fingers type siad idea into forum, and the rest of you think on it...<br />
<br />
And while I agree you have very valid points, considering the severe lack of racial conflict, as well as how little race matters to most classes (see the various threads on DE's being gimps, why race matters, etc in our Racial Conflict area) I think that if the idea was worked on by the Dev team, they might be able to make race matter again. They get paid for that sort of thing, I get paid for other things. But as it goes<br />
<br />
Problem; (since I'm off work as I'm typing this)<br />
<br />
1) NPC's involved in quests now become wanderers in other zones, as outcasts would indeed wander<br />
<br />
2) As the cities are 'conquered' the starting city is relocated. I see no reason a Wood Elf can't start in Felwithe or some other city<br />
<br />
3) Since most people binding in cities are A) non-casters binding at the Soulbinder or B) casters binding in a normally 'safe' area and the NPC pathing hasn't changed, the casters should be dandy with the non-casters simply moving with the Soulbinder to yes, a neutral area<br />
<br />
4) Outpost would count, yes. But since it's so easy to take from the evil races, it should also be easy to take back and/or keep<br />
<br />
5) Criteria would be either all NPC's being dead (bad idea) or a target group/NPC being dead (King/Lord or other governing body) muck like Chardok and other zones have Kings/Princes<br />
<br />
6) If multiple races take over a city, then those said races would be the ones to repopulate the city (turncoats excepted). No reason Trolls, Ogres and Dark Elves can't rule together<br />
<br />
7) If we announce it with plenty of lead time, then those wanting to avoid the PvP aspect need to get their business done before/after the war and avoid it during. No reason anything HAS to be done NOW in any city<br />
<br />
8) Only 1 city at a time, two at max. If this is GM-run, then the chance they'd allow multiple city-raids at once is slim anyway<br />
<br />
9) If dark races are at such a disatvantage, then this might kick up the number of new dark-race characters. There's a thing called balance, and you admitted it yourself, it's way out of whack. In a game it doesn't matter, but why not make it matter a bit? <br />
<br />
Blah. Put out an idea and the dogs get sicced on me. Seems dear Murgutroid didn't sit down to think about his own questions before posing them. And with a post like that, I don't see being at work being a valid excuse</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Drakonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I had a brief idea I never put forward back when Grobb was taken over by the frogs...<br />
<br />
It would have been cool to have Innothule swamp as a &quot;Hollowshade-esque&quot; zone... a small war going on constantly between frogs and trolls (and perhaps another race, kobolds maybe? to spice it up a bit)...<br />
<br />
It'll never happen though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Murgutroid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Blah. Put out an idea and the dogs get sicced on me. Seems dear Murgutroid didn't sit down to think about his own questions before posing them. And with a post like that, I don't see being at work being a valid excuse <br />
<br />
What? Who's siccing any dogs on you? I simply posted my thoughts on why it wouldn't work. Don't be so sensitive, and don't try to make it personal. And I did stop to think about my questions, you however, didn't answer them. <br />
<br />
1. OK, so the quest NPC's wander. But like I suggested, some might not be intended to wander or to be that accessible. Or didn't you read that part?<br />
<br />
2. Fine, so Wood Elves start in Felwithe. I pointed out that possibility, too. But that wasn't my question. I asked how many different races could be relocated to start in any given city. If there was only one evil city (or good city, for that matter) left, wouldn't it get kind of crowded? I mean, you can't just start people in a new city and leave it at that, you might need to move their guildmasters and such there too. A Troll SK (at least one who worships Cazic Thule) cannot train at an Ogre SK guild. The races are allied, but the factions are opposed. If you don't believe me, try it.<br />
<br />
3. So the bind points are moved. Cool, that works for me. But where is this neutral area? That's all I asked.<br />
<br />
4. The Outpost would be easy to take, and to take back. But if it was only possible to take a city on certain days, certain places might be in &quot;enemy&quot; hands for a while. Personally, I wouldn't want to have to wait for weeks or even months to be able to use my hammer again. If the wars were more frequent than that, I think it could just become a real headache for everybody, including Sony. My opinion.<br />
<br />
5. See, a legitimate question, a legitimate answer. Target group/NPC. That would work.<br />
<br />
6. I think that could be even more problematic than simply handing the city over to one race. But, as you said, if the devs thought about it long enough, they could probably come up with something. Perhaps a generic &quot;good-race/bad-race&quot; set of NPC's to fill a city that has changed hands. But that would pretty much ensure that Trolls never actually get Grobb back, at least not as a Troll city.<br />
<br />
7. Sure there are reasons that things HAVE to be done NOW. No matter how much advanced warning is given, not everybody is able to play the game any old time they want. If someone can only play on Saturdays, for instance, and the war takes place on a Saturday, maybe they won't like having to wait until next week to play, assuming they even heard about the war in time. They pay the same monthly fee, they should be able to play whenever their schedule allows them to without worrying about some GM event rendering certain zones inaccessible (or undesirable) to them. Fair concern, don't you think?<br />
<br />
8. One or two cities at a time. Fair enough. Isn't communication great?<br />
<br />
9. I'm not so sure it would help balance the races out at all. If anything, it might throw them even more out of whack. I doubt there'd be a huge rush of people playing good races jumping over to the dark side because they see how bad the dark races have it.<br />
<br />
If you didn't want, or weren't prepared for differing opinions/viewpoints/input, why did you post this in a public forum?<br />
<br />
Eyes read Trolls complaining, idea forms in brain, fingers type siad idea into forum, and the rest of you think on it... <br />
<br />
And that's all I was doing, brudder. Lighten up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Drynnious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It would be cool to have something implemented like this. They could possibly take bits from planetside. Have every race have a base city that cannot be taken over, or even two huge cities one good, one evil that cannot fall. Then each race would have their own city that could fall to invaders. Killing a ring event, or the &quot;King&quot; on top of a tower, something like that to take the city. <br />
<br />
The only problem with adding this kind of stuff in would be that all anyone would ever do would be pvp. It would just turn into a fantasy-type planetside equivalent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Maniacles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Clearly the trolls take over west and south freeport, with the paladins and arcane college being the hold out human forts to the north.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Skoggel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">As cool as a thing like this would be, one major flaw gets in the way no matter how it's designed: mechanical limits. Real GM events attract TONS of people, as I think this would, and they get downright unplayable. Even the carbon copy events like werewolves in WC get tough to work sometimes. Having fun events like this would probably attract more than 200 people I'd say, and that's assuming you don't announce it before.<br />
<br />
For that reason alone I'd never expect this to happen. Maybe a huge revamp of netcode or something, I dunno. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Makkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">sorry only good races can take over evil cities, not vice versa.<br />
<br />
i always thought it'd be cool if you were allowed to attack kos people who were in your home town</div></div><hr />
