<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>neferaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A lot of people severely messed up with their starting stats. Me included, for some reason I put all my points into agi (ughh) while I wish I put it into int. There are already services where you pay for changing your name or changing servers. Changing your stats would be easy to program. And heck I think a lot of people would gladly pay to correct their mistake.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Warmaster Xsavuung Llaahh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nah. If you want different starting stats start your character over. Otherwise just tailor your gear so that you have more of what you want. I started out with 100STR and 75 STA, when I wish those were reversed. Now I have 181STR and 204 STA unbuffed, and buffed they are maxed out at 280 (no planar power yet).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>neferaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm level 65 again and I am not going to start over, already did that once :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Drakonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'd probably put mine into dex and agi now lol, rest is easy enough to max.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Apokx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">With the higher level equipment your stats will be capped anyways.<br />
<br />
<br />
Starting stats dont really mean much.<br />
<br />
<br />
And if it makes you feel better agi is the only thing ive never seen maxed. /shrug ( With plate classes )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Renmazuo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Agility actually isn't that bad of a skill to have raised for a human SK.  Considering almost all SK armor/weapons increase Str, Sta, Dex or Int, but fail to increase Agility all that much.  Truthfully though at the high end of the game, all stats can be maxed, what you start off with just helps ya get there.<br />
