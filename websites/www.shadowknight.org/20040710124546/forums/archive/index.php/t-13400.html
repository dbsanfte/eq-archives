<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rykor Bloodscream</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm doing the Coldain ring quest...got from 1 to 5 in no time...spent twice that time camping Rodrick for the 2nd half of the 6th ring.  He didn't spawn.  I read multiple posts that he's broken on Allakahzam.  <br />
<br />
No real tricks to spawn him I hear....the only thing to do is to wait til after a patch, *sighs*  <br />
<br />
Is this mob really broken, or just a long spawn ?  Will GMs help *laughs hysterically* ....sorry, lost my head there for a second.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>yaalc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I was in the same boat a month ago, and yes Rodrik is bugged and yes doing a /petition will not do anything about it, I did talked to a gm and there is nothing they can/will do about it. the only thing you can do is wait till after a patch/server down. then run like hell to get him b4 he bugs again<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Stugein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Damn.  I ran across him last night accidentally when running through EW.  He was parked in front of a little hut thing near the Rygorr fort.  He aggro'd me (dark blue to me @ L43).  I was in a hurry to get back to PoK so I just feared him and kept running.  If I had realized what he was for I would've dropped him.  Crap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kaynin Shadowwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">befor the severs go down log out just outside the spot he spowns and when the servers come back. <br />
<br />
 If the emmisary isnt dead yet. you just need to wait for him to spown.<br />
<br />
its what i did and hell keep spowning aslong as the emmisary doesnt get butt raped.</div></div><hr />
