<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GlyphicVZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I did all of the test of betrayel up to the part  where you kill the hero, i found no drachnid spy. all hero groxnot did was stop, and say he was tbe traitior and i can go or die. i saw no drachnid spy so i just killed him and still didnt find one. any help?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Naaklum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Drachnid spy spawns on the eastern part of map near that temple thingy?  Man it's been forever since I did this.  The hero guy should walk all the way to him, but he goes near guards, mobs, etc.  He was quite hard to follow at the level I did this.  I finally figured out where he was heading and did trigger again.  I then just ran to where I knew he was heading and waited there.  Killed spy then he said HE was trader etc.............  Did he walk to this area for you, and the spy just never spawned?  You have to be there cuz spy depops fast if I remember right.  This was the hardest part of the Khukri quests for me.  The rest was just time consuming.<br />
<br />
How I figured out spy's spawn point, was have a ranger go near there and keep checking his tracking until one showed up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">When I did it, I checked the loc in the walkthrough on this board, then just ran there and waited for the Ikky to show up.  It is just outside of one of the drolvarg caves.  At the level I did it, none of the drolvargs aggro'd me, and I just hung around waiting for him to show up.  He walked up, said some stuff, I waited a few seconds, the spy popped, I whacked it, then whacked the traitor and popped off out of the zone.   You may have to follow Groxnot from his rock, though, as I seem to recall that he would occasionally aggro a wandering pilgrim or fae drake or something and get a bit beat up.<br />

Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>DarkWyld</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The first time I tried this, the pilgrims and drixies didn't touch Goxnok, but, while following him, I was fair game.  Needless to say, I got 'sacked' in the backfield.<br />
<br />
The next time I did this, I just ran to the Drolvarg Temple and waited.  It wasn't too long before a hail and hearty Goxnok showed up and started the conversation about catching the traitor.  The Drachnid spy popped and I pulled away from Goxnok and killed it (if you stay near Goxnok, he will heal the spy, making for a little longer fight).  When you go back and hail him, he admits to being the traitor, at which time you kill him.  He's actually a little easier than the spy, but be ready to eat a HT.<br />
<br />
The initial poster mentioned Goxnok admitted to being the traitor without the drachnid showing up, which is contrary to the flow of things.  If this truly happened, you hit a bug.  OR maybe you had killed the spy without realizing it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jobrill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">No, When I did it, Goxnox admitted he was the spy before my drachnid spawned too. You need to stand by Goxnox and wait for the Drachnid Spy to spawn. Once he does, THEN you kill him, THEN Goxnox.</div></div><hr />
