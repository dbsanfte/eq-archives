<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Brutticus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have recently just made lvl 51 ..and have been searching in paw all day for the mob that drops this spell ..i aslo have a druid with me ..to track ...i have yet to see this mob and from maps i been looking at ..dunno if i am even in right area ...<br />
 Does this Npc have a Place holder ...and what is name of place holder i can maybe track for?<br />
 Any help on this is greatly appreciated ..thankx in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dester</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes this mob has a place holder.<br />
<br />
Its pretty deep in the zone, and you can only get to it by swimming down into some water and through an underwater tunnel.<br />
<br />
Go to alkazams and look up the map there.<br />
<br />
Dester</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Get a map download if you have LoY expansion, try at:<br />

maps.eq-toolbox.com<br />
<br />
There is an underwater tunnel that gets you to the Ishva Mal area, I'm pretty sure you can invis the whole way there. He's in a little room at the very back left of the area you swim into, placehoder can be there instead...repop might be 20-30 mins, seems like forever...thats all I recall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">loc 715, -450<br />
<br />
Ishva has placeholder, they spawn at the same rate as the other mobs in the area.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Saveaux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The Ishva is in a room with another mob. Its a healer, kill it first and then the Ishva.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Don't quote me on this, and perhaps others can confirm but I do believe other more common mobs (giant snake things) also drop the Summon Corpse spell.  If so, that's another option perhaps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wyrdlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The snakes in the water do drop it.  That's where I got mine last year.  They drop it rarely but if you swim around popping them off you'll get it faster than the Ishva unless you get lucky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>NorrynNoir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">just camp the ishva. he pops i would say 1 in 3 placeholders. shouldn't take more than any hour to get him to spawn. there are 2 spawns in the room, one is often a shaman so beat it down first. once you kill them both, sit &amp; med , set a timer and come back in 20 minutes. you'll have it quickly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Oagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You kill the snakes on the way down anyway.  Kill the snakes.  I got a copy there, went to the Ishva room, and got another copy and a robe there, too.  An extra copy for sell wouldn't be a bad time investment.  They sell pretty well for a 51 spell.<br />
<br />
Just kill the snakes.  You may get lucky.<br />
<br />
also eqatlas map shows the way down there pretty well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>scaledge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Also something that is notable is that the snakes can be nasty fights for the people earlier in the zone, so do NOT train them to the zone!  Their pathing is fucked up and they do NOT return to their spawns, so you will have a nasty snake mob sitting at the zoneline chewing up everyone who tries to enter, and never leaving.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I got mine from snakes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kromglon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I had to camp it for about 2 hours. The guy who drops it doesnt pop everytime.  I think he popped 3 times before he dropped the spell.</div></div><hr />
