<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Here's what my guided meditations look like, missing only Saryrn for Sol Ro's tower or Rallos Zek.  Am I missing anything else?<br />
<br />
The History translated for you reveals the fate of Zebuxoruk.  Trapped in the Plane of Time you must gain the power of the elements to gain entrance.<br />
Mithaniel has been bested.  An aura surrounds the mystical symbols that have appeared on your arm.<br />
You have completed all of Honor's Trials.<br />
You have bested Aerin`Dar and proven yourself honorable enough to pass into Mithaniel's Halls.<br />
Mavuin is grateful to you for taking his case before the Tribunal.  The information provided to you, that Mithaniel Marr and Karana carry information you should seek, could be quite useful.<br />
Tylis is being tortured by Saryrn.  The only way for him to get away from his misery is to escape from the Plane of Torment.<br />
Saved from a world of eternal nightmares, Thelin is forever in your debt.<br />
Saved from certain doom, Milyk and Adler are forever in your debt.<br />
Now that Grummus has been destroyed, the entrance to the Crypt of Bertoxxulous should open before your might.<br />
The portal into the Plane of Fire has been altered.  Miak needs you to find the correct way to channel the portal.<br />
The pack of notes from Vallon are scribbled in a language that you cannot comprehend.<br />
The pack of notes from Tallon are scribbled in a language that you cannot comprehend.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dustwyrm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Looks like you might be missing BoT key and/or Agnarr flags.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hmm... I have &quot;talisman of thunderous foyer&quot; for access to BoT.  Did that quest before they changed it to not need the key for access.  I'm done with tower key.  And I'm halfway done with key to Agnarr's area.<br />
<br />
And I JUST did Agnarr AND talked to Karana and got the flag from Karana.  What text should it be saying for having rescued Karana?<br />
<br />
Why the heck are my flags messed up!! GRR...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Krazaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I take it you've 'unlocked memories' several times, as well as visiting Maelin and hailing and dealing with his 'lore' and 'new information' threads?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Here is the guide I followed exactly to try to straighten out my flags:<br />
<br />
**************************************************** <br />
say &quot;portals destination&quot; to the PoFire drake (the round house out on the water in PoTranq (loc approx. +300,-2300) to get solro nameds (Arlyxir, Jiva, Rizlona, Xuzl, Protector) to show up in guided meditation. <br />
<br />
go to pok <br />
go to seer <br />
<br />
say &quot;unlock my memories&quot; <br />
<br />
go to librarian maelin <br />
<br />
Hail librarian maelin <br />
say &quot;I have new information&quot; and &quot;I have new lore&quot; <br />
<br />
go to seer <br />
<br />
say &quot;unlock my memories <br />
<br />
go to potq <br />
go to sickbay <br />
<br />
Hail Adroha Jezith and say 'tortured by nightmares' <br />
Hail Elder Poxbourne <br />
Hail Adroha Jezith <br />
<br />
go to Adler Fuirstel <br />
<br />
say &quot;what ward&quot; <br />
<br />
go to the sick bay <br />
<br />
Hail Elder Fuirstel <br />
<br />
go to Adler Fuirstel <br />
<br />
Hail Adler Fuirstel <br />
<br />
go to pok <br />
go to seer <br />
<br />
say &quot;unlock my memories&quot; <br />
<br />
go to librarian maelin <br />
<br />
Hail librarian maelin <br />
say &quot;I have new information&quot; and &quot;I have new lore&quot; <br />
<br />
go to seer <br />
<br />
say &quot;unlock my memories <br />
<br />
go to potq <br />
go to sick bay <br />
<br />
Hail Fahlia Shadyglade and say &quot;what condition&quot;,&quot;what plane of torment&quot; and &quot;I will go&quot; <br />
<br />
go to pok <br />
go to seer <br />
<br />
say &quot;unlock my memories&quot; <br />
<br />
go to librarian maelin <br />
<br />
Hail librarian maelin <br />
say &quot;I have new information&quot; and &quot;I have new lore&quot; <br />
<br />
go to seer <br />
<br />
say &quot;unlock my memories <br />
<br />
<br />
****************************************************<br />
<br />
Additionally, after I finished killing Agnarr and saving Karana, I went to the seer, said &quot;unlock my memories&quot;, then went to librarian maelin and said &quot;I have new information&quot; and &quot;I have new lore&quot; then went back to the seer and said &quot;unlock my memories&quot; and &quot;guide my meditations&quot;.<br />
<br />
What should it say for Karana?<br />
<br />
Maybe I just need to unlock memories AGAIN and then go to the librarian AGAIN and then go to the seer AGAIN...I'll try that tonight... then again, maybe it's just WAY BUGGY. :(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Krushum Gudended</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Karana should be something along the lines of &quot;The information gathered from Karana is written in a language you cannot comprehend.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dont know... I can't log in to check atm...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Krazaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Tylis is being tortured by Saryrn. The only way for him to get away from his misery is to escape from the Plane of Torment.<br />
<br />
I misread originally.<br />
<br />
If you're missing Saryrn, you don't have part of the cipher and none of the flags that rely upon it will register properly.<br />
<br />
Kill Saryrn and that should clear up everything to the point of needing Rallos Zek.<br />
<br />
This flowchart helps some.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yes I'm still missing part of the cypher.  That's why the symbol on my arm from mithaniel glows.. but isn't quite doing what it should.  That makes sense.<br />
<br />
Die Saryrn!!<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Just got Saryrn killed yesterday.  Finished flag.  Able to zone into Sol Ro's tower now.<br />
<br />
I miss all the things in Sol Ro's tower, Rallos Zek, and the flag for the factory in Plane of Innovation.<br />
