<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Messer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">WOOOHOO!!! Finally, drake #477 dropped the decrepit hide tonight!  Our group was fighting on Maestro's steps for 6 hours straight.  Thankfully the guild Lost Fires was fighting at the zone in and had just killed a drake with a hide that was rotting.<br />
<br />
Thanks Hotas, Sirrin, Anguish, Mordana, Fudorm and Ainadine - you guys rock!  Yes, I'm still your whore.  :D <br />
<br />
The scary part was I was getting tired tonight and almost logged 15 minutes early.<br />
<br />
Watch the freakin hides drop like flies now.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Silvershadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Haha, about time for you - grats :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ainya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Gratz Messer, bout time!    . . . time to change the sig :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nycathis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">WHooo Hooooo!!!!!<br />
<br />
Well done Messer you are so close now you can taste the blade :)<br />
<br />
Becareful with Lharc (sp?) cause he is a bitch! get a ranger to wepon sheild tank him while the rest of your group/groups nuke the crap out of him - (Lharc not the ranger although once you have the IC you could always try it out on him .... )<br />
<br />
anyway about it GL!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Messer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Working on the SoA in Sky now, my last drop!  Cleared the island twice now.  Server was reset today which screwed up my spawn rotation.  :mad: <br />
<br />
Don't know any rangers to help so for the last fight, we'll put together two gimp groups (avg level 62) along with a one time equipped SK and gank Lhranc.<br />
<br />
Our little guild has done a ton of stuff with one group that we aren't supposed to be able to do.  Fighting together as a group for years and having real-time voice communications &gt; all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nycathis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Just be careful Messer,<br />
<br />
I had a Time equipted pally with 3 cleric chain healing him and he lasted all of 30 secs tanking Lhranc. Then I lasted about 12 secs, then the ranger decided to tank and fire off weapon shield and that was it - he tanked until Lhranc dropped.<br />
<br />
Have an enchanter chain cast runes, or your tank to trigger riposte disc cause he will be eaten otherwise - I triple guarentee it!<br />
Defensive does nothing against him.<br />
<br />
Better to be safe than sorry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kilauea Bacchus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Grats :) I'm glad to see you finally get that hide :)<br />
<br />
I had a 65 war tanking my Lhranc, and he went berserk in the first second after taking what appeared to be 4 harm touches back to back.  We had 2 dead at the end of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Yaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Did my Lhranc fight recently.  Had a Ranger tank with weaponshield.  I pulled with Harmshield.  we had 1 Mana Burn Wizard and 2 Full AA Harm Touches.  Everyone else there just nuked right off the bat.  The fight lasted all but 3 seconds, Lhranc is a GIMP!  4 people were actually in the fight the other 7 were just standing around watching.  Congratz on the Hide, I really love that sig of yours.</div></div><hr />
