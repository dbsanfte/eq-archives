<br />
I made a assling rangah, twinked the ever living hell out of him and sent him on his way.  ( who cares if those damn rangah's get called twinks right =P )<br />
<br />
Needless to say I played him for 1 hour, and said fuck this.<br />
<br />
Reason:<br />
<br />
....&quot;you have been stuned&quot;......&quot;you have been stuned&quot;.....&quot;you have been stuned&quot;.....&quot;you have been stuned&quot;.....&quot;you have been stuned&quot;.....&quot;you have been stuned&quot;.....&quot;you have been stuned&quot;...<br />
<br />
I have been sold on the Ogre Race argument 100% from this point on.<br />
<br />
I seriously can't remember the last time my Ogre was stunned, and talk about DPS loss....wow.<br />
<br />
Unreal, just thought ide share. <br />

and on being stunned constantly...  rangers suck...  i'm a DE sk, and i don't get stunned to often...  only when i'm trying to FD</div></div><hr />

I wonder how other Melee Class/Race combo's function being that Ogre's can't be most of them? It's simple as your skill increases you get stunned less also fighting mobs that don't bash helps amazingly well. Why not try to insure that your skills (defense, dodge etc) are up to par with your level. Having stated you only played them for a Hour and twinked the hell out of them shows what a moron you are. You need to put some level's and skills on them in order to see a progression of your defensive abilities then you'll see your not really getting stunned much. Twinking out a newbie and pulling 5+ mobs and mowing through them as you get stunned right and left does not give you the ability to judge the class (or other races if you will). Evidently you have neither the time nor patience to learn and grow as another class/race. You just want to toss on your gear and go!. Well go back to your Ogre I'm sure your a wonderful SK with such a narrow outlook on things.</div></div><hr />

I imagine that he was only trying to show that he loves being an unstunnable ogre, no reason to jump down his throat about it.<br />

And besides it would be &quot;Thanks you anal prick&quot; with out the s it would need to be &quot;thank you, anal prick&quot;</div></div><hr />

Melee is melee no mater how you look at it - When you fight, Hitting your opponant helps - When you are stunned (thanks Greggthegrmreapr) you can't accomplish your #1 goal in a fight.<br />

Enough said,</div></div><hr />

<br />
And to rest of you fuckers...its just penis envy.<br />
<br />
I think I struck a chord with Akeikyl.  His main must be a ranger, lol!<br />
<br />
You preach about knowing your class and twinking......that coming from a Leezard whos wearin a CCoM and a Fungi at level 50! LMFAO<br />
<br />
Good one.   <br />
<br />
You can justify it to your self all you want and in the end...fighting any bashing Mob an Ogre with the exact same equipment and skills will have higher DPS than you. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Akeikyl</div><div class="date">03-09-2003, 05:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I been Playing EQ for 4 Years it ain't brain surgery, If your smart and play the bazaar game well you to can afford nice toys. There is more to this game then just swinging your sword and casting some spells. I have played enough different classes to respectable levels to know what I'm doing and do it well regardless of what character I'm playing. Why? because I take the time to really learn the class. Yes having nice toys can help but if you don't learn your class they are only a crutch that make you a worse player at higher levels. I've been complemented as a player by how well I play on more then one character because I really take the time to learn all the nuances of the different classes. What I'm tired of is this &quot;I'm a Ogre there for I'm better then you&quot; mentality.  <br />
As I said in another post I'm not getting turned away from groups because I'm not a Ogre and groups aren't hopping all over you because you are. In the grand scheme of things your benefits are really minor. As much as you would like to trump them up to be otherwise. Twinking a toon and playing them for one hour doesn't teach you shit . You Sir are a coward, you have neither the time not patience to learn anything new and for that I pity you.</div></div><hr />

I'm better than you.<br />
<br />
Twinking a toon and playing them for one hour doesn't teach you shit . You Sir are a coward, you have neither the time not patience to learn anything new and for that I pity you. <br />
<br />
i recently did basically the same thing as Tumy - sub in a wizzy tho - and i prob havnt even logged a whole hour on the twink. that doesnt mean i am a coward nor does it mean i dont have the patience to learn something new. it simply means that playing another race / class combo than my main is a waste of my time becase if im not enjoying it, why bother? ...i just lost interest in writing any more on this subject, that prob makes me a pitiful coward too :p<br />
<br />
edit: /salute Tumy, hahaha</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tumy</div><div class="date">03-12-2003, 11:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I still think that I pissed Akeikyl off because he knows im right.  <br />
<br />
Insulting me and my play in game doesnt bother me a bit. I know that if you took the time to play a Ogre &quot;tank&quot; that you would understand what Im talking about.<br />
<br />
Any person that has done parsing will know the advantage of not being stunned &lt;---- (notice the &quot;nn&quot;).<br />
<br />
I dont know where your leveling your twink at, but the PoP 1st Tier mobs do bash.  I have been &quot;asked&quot; to tank for PoP groups since 56th level, and I would not feel as efficient if I was being stunned and interrupted by the mobs.  <br />
<br />
Like I said  before, any humanoid mob will bash.  &quot;Most&quot; high end mobs bash.  Its nice not to lose DPS or have as many spells interrupted.<br />
<br />
This may not add up in your mind, but it adds up on my parser.<br />
<br />
Oh, another thing that I like is the fact that I do not need to spend nearly as much money to increase my stats as the small races do.  Im not rich and never have been, but with my minimal budget I perform well.<br />
<br />
+Sta gear = BIG MONEY<br />
<br />
Ogre sta = best starting Sta in game = less money spent<br />
<br />
and as everyone knows...<br />
<br />
Sta = HP's<br />
<br />
and...<br />
<br />
HP's = happy cleric becuase they dont use as much mana healen the tank, which in turn = group invites over other tanks.  <br />
<br />
(Would a group prefer a meat sheild with 2,600 Nat Hp's or one with 3,200 Nat Hp's?  Thats a tough call eh?)  <br />
<br />
Im not saying that the other races can not get as many or even more hp's than Ogre's.  I know a little gnome that has WAY more hp's than me, yet he also has about 20 times the PP invested in his gear as I do and his ND and PE maxed.<br />
<br />
All in all, what this article was origonaly about is the fact that Ogre unstunablility helps DPS and Tanking abilities.  The added bonus of the Ogre's natural Str, and Sta make the race just that much better for the person who is on a limited budget and play time.<br />
<br />
If I didnt make that plain enough for you Akeikyl, then your just going to have to insult me again and this time you will prove who the blockhead is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tumy, some of your analysis may in fact be correct, but you are side-stepping one important aspect--the XP penalty.<br />
<br />
All things equal, a non-large race (sans Iksar) will ALWAYS be of a higher *level* then an ogre race.<br />
<br />
How do you quantify that, let alone still conclude that the ogre is the best?<br />
<br />
Personally, an ogre is one of my favorite races for an SK, but I do have respect for the XP penalty and the advantage that it brings.  You just cant ignore it, nor its importance.<br />

Thats all I got say about that. =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
But would it be ding 63 if you were a Human SK?  :) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tumy</div><div class="date">03-13-2003, 02:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, but the lvl cap is 65 and I will be there soon enough.<br />
<br />
If I was a human I would level faster yes...just think of it as less time to get to know your class. lol<br />
<br />
Im realy not bothered by the XP penalty, my first main was a Iksar.<br />
<br />
Im untterly satisfied with my racial choice.</div></div><hr />
