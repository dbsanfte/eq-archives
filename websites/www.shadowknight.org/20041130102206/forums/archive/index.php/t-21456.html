<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Let's get a list of ideas going of spells for the new expansion in one definitive place (feel free to copy your ideas from other threads).<br />
<br />
No problem to constructively critique ideas or give them praise, but let's not have a huge back and forth that destroys the intent of the thread. Most importantly get your creative ideas posted.<br />
<br />
Since none of us know the power increase level 70 will bring, concepts of spells will be more important than the details, which can be fine tuned later. Some people's ideas may look over powered by today's game, and that is ok for now. The idea is to brainstorm.<br />

<br />
I may be wrong ( and probably am ), but besides bards, does any class have any buff that ups spell damage? I haven't looked, but I haven't heard of it either. This could be a really nice area to tap into on recurses if only one class does indeed currently provide such an effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>cmdrbean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I actually do like quite a few of your suggestions. I don't have any good ones to add atm, but I'll come back here when I think of one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Good start Siilvir, but there are some things I'd like to clarify/modify:<br />
<br />
Invoke the Reaper <br />
Level 67<br />

<br />
Make sure it's got plenty of HP, and if it can have its resists boosted, it's be beneficial.  At this point in the game, it's not like your risking making an overpowered tank monster pet or anything.  It's just a means of giving it the survivability to endure a couple AE's, some damage shielding, etc.  <br />
<br />
Touch of Muram <br />
Level 70<br />
Mana 1000<br />
Cast 1.0<br />
Recast 90 seconds<br />
Resist -500 MR<br />
Description: 1350 Life Tap. Long recast, heavy mana cost.<br />
<br />
With that recast and dmg:mana ratio, you could give it more damage.  It's not going to imbalance tanking in XP groups or self-healing over time or anything due to the much, much greater effeciency of &quot;Touch of Mata&quot; - make it heal a more noteworthy chunk of HP.  I'd consider a 0.5 sec cast time more appropriate also - it'd be an &quot;oh shit&quot; spell, let us get it off more reliably.  <br />
<br />
Scream of Pain <br />

<br />
Make it's recast 84 seconds so you can keep it up consistantly.  It's not like a 1-tick overlap would have any real effect on balance, just make it less annoying.  Allow it to be clicked off.  I'd prefer a MR resist check (our taps were traditionally MR based for a long time and the move to DR was not for the best).  <br />
<br />
Darkness <br />
Level 66<br />

Cast 0.5<br />
Recast 2.25<br />

Good except that there's already a NPC blind spell by that name.  Rename it and GTG though.  <br />

Description: Zero % experience res, cost one bone chip.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I don't think there'd be anything imbalancing about giving us a partial XP rez.  It's one of the reason pallies are currently a better class than SK's in many ways and it'd bring back some useful utility.  Make it 75-80% if needed.  Granted, if that were deemed not fisable, I'd take 0%, but I don't really see why it wouldn't be.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If I didn't comment on it, I like it as-is.  I've yet to really give a whole lot of thought to OoW spells/AA myself - I'll add my suggestions eventually, but this is definately a very solid start.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">A decent pet heal would be nice to help counteract those damage shields.  Dunno if I'd waste the spell slots to mem it or not, but often healers either don't wanna waste the mana on keeping an SK pet alive, or just don't pay attention to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Both the 0% exp rez version and the original necro rez would be ideal.  Necro rez preferred if you have the reagent, but sk rez as a backup.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">What about an Upgrade to Banshee Aura? I don't have stats in front of me, but something in the +30 to damage shield and duration of 1.5 hours?<br />
<br />
Also (and I know I will get attacked for this one - /em puts on fire resist equipment); what about an overhaul of diamondskin line? Maybe something in the 1,500 point range? Costs 3 peridots?<br />
<br />
Maybe a New Cloak...something in the 500 hit point, 50 AC, +20 Damage shield range?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Xanathol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">what about an overhaul of diamondskin line? Maybe something in the 1,500 point range? Costs 3 peridots?<br />

Die.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Slein, I am fine with your modifications, they seem fairly minor. The reason I didn't include resist for our pet or the pet aug is that the pet uses its master's resist now. Yes it will be affected by the lower level, but that is something we can live with for having a pet that is green to the mobs we fight, /wink.<br />
<br />
Josahd, with pet affinity, group heals work on our pet, including both of the Zevfeer's spells we get. I think we are limited in the amount of spells we are going to get, so we probably want to focus on the things that are most important.<br />
<br />
Croaakk, I like the Banshi upgrade, but again it comes down to the amount of spells we will get. An Aura of Darkness upgrade would be nice too, but not at the cost of something more important. As far as a Cloak upgrade, I included that in my list, Cloak of Omens. I substituted a DS with the stun resist, which I think is far more beneficial to us. A rune upgrade is probably a matter of opinion; chanters can cast it on us if needed, and again I would rather see us with other spells.<br />
<br />
Good feedback so far, let's keep the ideas coming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Xanathol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Invoke the Reaper <br />
would rather a backstabbing rogue pet. yes the war version would in theory give it more HP, but IMO the AEs are just going to get bigger in new content, aka he's still toast. *if* we could be assurred of the pet having a 'significant' HP gain, war pet would be preffered again.<br />
<br />
Augmentation of the Reaper <br />
don't like the DI part of it for one reason...knowing SoE, it would probably cost a reagent; screw that. I'd rather see a haste + pet CoL style buff, for a lil more hp.<br />
<br />
<br />
I agree with SJ on ToM, SoP, SoH, GT.<br />
<br />
<br />
I would also like to see a couple short running dots, BoH style, against FR and MR. Fast cast, short running, good per-tick damage. Would add DPS nicely in 1 grouped named content, even if only one resist sticks on the mob in question. Might be too strong though if each one stuck. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Siilvir have any ideas on an upgraded DoT and an upgraded Lifetap DoT? I understand we are only going to get a limited number of spells, but I think we should get an upgrade in the DoT department.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yes Vici I had one worked up, however I decided not to include it. With how fast mobs die now there is little advantage of DoT's over DD's (just listen to the complaints of the Shamen and Necros). <br />
<br />
At Fan Faire they said that they were not going to go back to long fights (Luclin era) but would continue to keep them short. So it might be best if we guide ourselves more towards the DD line of spells. <br />
<br />
At the stage we are at in Gates, I rarely if ever mem a DoT any more, mobs just die too quickly. There is also the issue of spell gem slots and the amount of spells we will get in Omens. Lastly getting too many types of spells on different resist charts will dilute our Focus Effects, or at a minimum call for having to have multiple Focus Effects, thereby sacrificing other effects. That being said, if you want to see what I worked up I would be happy to post it.<br />
<br />
A Bond of Death upgrade (to me) would not be something we should ask for. Would rather have another DD life tap for the above reasons.</div></div><hr />

Slein, I am fine with your modifications, they seem fairly minor. The reason I didn't include resist for our pet or the pet aug is that the pet uses its master's resist now. <br />
<br />
Yes, but pets still keep innate resist bonus's, so if your resists aren't capped out, it'd still be beneficial (I.E. mage fire pets).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Just a personal experience here.<br />
<br />
Last night I dinged Pet Affinity and tried a pet in an AE encounter.<br />
<br />
The mob was Dvoin in Quiv. I had druid FR CR, chanter MR, shammy dr pr, and bard was singing one the resist songs (think dr pr), so all resists capped at 500 or close to it. Pet had my resists, and it was buffed with 9 and focus and brells. Funny thing was that the pet took less AE damage than some of the members in my group, and actually lasted about a third of the way through a longish fight. Bard songs were hitting him too, as was Aura of Hate and Zevfeer's Bite was doing small amounts of healing. Had we had someone doing group heals he probably would have lived through the end of the fight.<br />
<br />
With Pet Affinity and pets now sharing our resists, my feeling is we don't need to ask for more resists for a new pet, let's save the request for something better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Shredderr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I just want darker empathy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Nice list.. I'll add to mine. <br />
<br />
I do want upgrade to ignite blood (Pyro), upgraded BoH, upgraded festering darkness (God, I love that festering darkness cuz of cast time and nice dmg) for DOT department to scale our current DOT up to 70. <br />
<br />
For Festering darkness, I wanna see dmg doubled and snare from 60% to 70% and higher resist modifer to -100 ish range for same 2 minutes duration. Putting it to 2.5 minutes would rock to work with our FD mem wipe of 2 minutes and it would still be snared to peel it off easily in xp group without any form of puller, tank and CC. I do pull AND tank in HARD LDON several times without any form of CC. This longer duration works good in heavy dps group to split 5-6 mobs rooms easily.<br />
<br />
Pyro is logical upgrade to ignite blood for us. We used ignite blood alot when we solo and on bosses or any long fights. BOH is very useful dot that we use ALOT due to short duration for large damage. Doubling its damage would be cool and retain same duration.<br />
<br />
Asyotole upgrade with -100 DR would work good cuz of 1 minute duration that can be useful to work with upgraded BOH on tough mobs. <br />
<br />
Give us..... damn necro rezz. Thanks..<br />
<br />
One thing I would like to see. Just one single spell.. An AE type spell. Don't flame me on that.. Our last AE spell was just lvl 49 one. I actually used that much in normal LDON run training so many mobs to our AE team and just AEing them to death but my biggest gripe was that our AE is soo outdated..  One thing I would *LOVE* to get upgraded AE is no-damaging terror AE (low spell cost) or damaging+terror AE (higher spell cost) almost same as warrior AE taunt.. :) Handy with AEing team for sure.. I often wished for stronger AE spell to farm greenies for faction or/and tradeskills as well.. Just need 1 *HUGE* upgrade to our lvl 49 AE for lvl 66-70 range. It's just long, overdue upgrade. Warriors might get mad over this... Screw them. :)<br />
<br />
That's all. I just wanted to add something related to DOT department that some SKs neglected.. I want us to keep in top hybrid in DOT department that we enjoyed for long time. BST is catching up to us in DOT department. We just need to stay on top of it. Oh yes, if we got new upgraded DOTs, they must still have quick cast-time that works well for hybrids.. Also, I want to retain our solobility for some who just wanted to solo to relax or whatever especially those casual gamers. Having tank-related spells are still very good but we just need to keep our DOT spell-line up to date as well cuz we had them for 5 years and it would be very bad idea to abandon DOT line at 70.. One thing I love about SK class.. Very verstile. I want lvl 70 spells that still keep SK as verstile class as well. Just need some improvement to tank department then we would be set.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Azerinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Overall I like your ideas and general direction... I have a few comments tho...<br />
<br />
First... I disagree with wanting a new green pet... if you want a green pet then we already have plenty of pet spells you can use... just use a lower level pet... I want a higher level pet (with whatever appropriate DPS... doesn't have to have the DPS of MOBs near its level) so that its procs land on MOBs and it resists better and has higher hps... and I don't want hand me down necro pets because they aren't designed to be used against the MOBs we fight.<br />
<br />
As far as the taps... I really want our new taps to have a faster recast... if we have a &quot;BIG&quot; tap in addition to those that has a longer recast that might be ok... but really our main tap I want to have under a 5 second recast and the bigger tap I don't think I would ever mem unless the recast is 45 seconds or less... and both of these taps should have a .5 sec cast time<br />
<br />
Some things like +50% stun resist I doubt they will give us but like you said it depends on how big of an upgrade they are planning.<br />
<br />
Here is a shot at a list based roughly on the 61-65 progression in PoP with some changes and borrowing some of your names and ideas =)<br />
<br />

&gt;Wave of Hate<br />
    300dd 15 tick recast Group Recourse: +200 atk +5% type 3 haste duration or increase chance to crit 16ticks<br />
&gt; Want one more spell here... not sure what... want something that is fairly unique and original... have to think more</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Azerinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">One idea for the last spell that I am playing around with in my head:<br />
<br />
Plague of Nightmares:<br />
Extremely short duration (2-4tick) mez with guarenteed mem wipe at the end... probably would need a longish (20-40sec depending on duration) recast... mostly thinking of it as a pull spell similar but different to lull... with this you can cast it on one thing but will aggro nearby MOBs unlike lull and if it is resisted you will definitely get aggro... would also have other uses... not sure if this would be too overpowered or not... leaning towards not because of all the lull spells and fade like abilites of other classes... and because of the mez nature would only be good for mobs up to a certain lvl</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">If it's level limit is high enough to be useful, it'll be abused.  If it's not, it'll be... well, useless.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Keep our tanking aura self only.  If it's a group spell, then it's not an advantage for us as tanks and it's pissing off group members by eating buff slots (irrelivant if we're successful in getting it into bard box, but I still don't want it as a group spell).  <br />
<br />
<br />
Our chances of getting root are about nil, and it's not really something we need anyway.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Leaving for a baseball game... I'll finish later.</div></div><hr />

For the love of Innoruuk, dont give it DI.   I dont think pet pulling was intended from the start and having a pet with DI seems to be conveniently conducive to this.  <br />

No thanks.   10 seconds is already too long.   If we've got limited spells ocming to us, i'd rather see two more 10 seconds taps like we got in pop.     clones of volatis and innoruuk are fine with me.   Not to mention, even tho ppl rarely use it, this is basically just lifetap HT in a 90 second spell slot.<br />

Personally, i really dont want to see an upgrade to this spell at all.   I have more people complain to me than praise me when I use it due to the icon not being able to be clicked off.   Unless that is fixed, i dont want to see another version of this spells.   (But if they do fix it, sounds good.    overhaste and +spell dmg are quite unrealistic tho)<br />

Absolutley.   This is an awesome idea.     I could stand to pay a little more mana for it and have a greater duration.   maybe 200 mana for 120sec duration or something.  <br />

Boo....   Siilvir you know I dont like our spear spells as it is, and i'd be loathe to support any new ones.   but, it's decent dps when they dont get resisted i guess. ;)<br />

Make it level 70.    Also, stun resist rocks.    I really would hate to lose the damage shield component on this spell tho.    maybe 20% stun resist and 15 ds =)))<br />

I saw someone else mention they wanted &quot;darker empathy&quot;.  I agree.    I really think a dark empathy upgrade is in order.     <br />
<br />
30 second cast,  4000 hp (self) to 1500 hp (target).    mana cost 500?  i dunno.     Just something i can use to get ppl out of that under 20% death trap since my agro spells have become totally useless at that point.    I cant stand being an add tank and see ToT come up with some poor caster at 7% life and me having 0% chance to save them.     Altho, this might be a good idea for an Omens AA skill too as opposed to a spell (similar to paladins having that damnable AA group heal)<br />
<br />
<br />
All these ideas are good tho, overall, Siilvir.    Great post.</div></div><hr />

I would love to see a haste / slow tap that would help me when soloing or maybe even in 2-3 person groups where we dont have a shaman / chanter / beastlord. It should be self only. However, it would not really be used in full groups or raids and would not impose upon the shaman or chanters as their slows and hastes are better and longer lasting.<br />
<br />
level 50 spell - get a 10% haste / 10% slow<br />
level 60 spell - 20% haste / 20% slow<br />
level 65 spell - 30% haste / 30% slow<br />
level 70 spell - 35% haste / 35% slow<br />
<br />
These should have the same short duration times our other torrents and auras have. They should not stack with beastlord / shaman / chanter slows and hastes.<br />
<br />
Agree or Disagree?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">It's an idea that we as a community have kicked around for a few years now, and it seems to resurface every time we get new spells.<br />
<br />
Some like it, some don't.<br />
<br />
Personally I am in the camp that likes the concept, but it would have to have severe stacking limitations, both with slows and haste buffs. Probably also a relatively short duration. It would be useful not only for soloing, but for pulling as well.<br />
<br />
Keep the ideas coming.</div></div><hr />

This would be in line with being the &quot;offensive&quot; tank. You could also put an agro modifier on it as well if you wanted for tanking, or make a similar one for tanking that lowers the mobs chance to riposte or proc rate taps.  If they can add bonus's to chance to crit to enchanter hastes, (as seen on the OoW spells on lucy) then there shouldn't be much trouble for them to alter proc or riposte rates as well.</div></div><hr />

id disagree with arex wanting a lower resist check on the lifetaps thats just being a glutton for punishment and we take enough shit as it is.... <br />
<br />
i do like the idea of having a rez, i hate having to bring a necro along or a pally  or something just in case ... giving us a lower % res wouldnt hurt isnt pallies like 90%?   giving us a 75 or 80% one seems pretty realistic, <br />
<br />
love the idea for Aura of Malice,  and Cloak of Omens  very creative, the lack of a DS would help on those fights where we cant let the TM mob die... (only rathe so far but seeing as how painful that is i would bet another is coming)</div></div><hr />

If a spell needs an upgrade, SOE should fucking upgrade the spell. Who gives a shit if we get a hundered new spells, we can still only memorise 8 at a time.<br />
<br />
And besides, would a new Banshee Aura in addition to the standard improvements throw us a mile infront of the pack and make us the all-feared Uberclass? <br />

<br />
I agree with adding more damage to Muram, if it's going to be our Oh Shit spell maybe even a longer recast time and up it to 1500ish. 1k Mana cost could like a little overkill. Maybe more like 700-800. It would be nice to have an oh shit spell we can acutally use while tanking, Harmshield is fine for .. well.. basically running through a zone with a shit load of mobs beating on you into a trial or w/e but it's impossible to use in a group cause of the aggro negation. The reason I doubt they would give us this spell is the fact that we crit and we get a 3k DD spell, and we crit spells a LOT. Double Crit and ToL would give us a nice 6k heal though, an oh shit I just saved my own ass spell indeed :P<br />
<br />
The name Grave Thief just doesnt strike it with me.. I'm very picky about names and such, my reccomendation would be something like Dark Rebirth, and give a little less % than the necro res. All in all I still think SKs have it better than necro in most aspect, I think taking thier res (even though seldom used) would be kind of greedy on our part =p<br />
<br />
+15 or 20 DS on Cloak of Omens =P<br />
<br />
Black Horror looks like its a little overpowered (like Azerinn hinted to, I think the mana recourse still too high though) a 450 lifetap with SA3 is heavy on its own, 220 mana recourse on it as well might be a bit too much (u know how much we proc those spells) 220 mana each time would be insane. Maybe lower it to 125 lifetap (375) and 50-100 Mana recourse (because they are the same spell and you're getting the benefits of both, this would just be a nice little addition to lifetap line)<br />
<br />
I'll post thoughts on other spells later if I have any~ But good ideas overall!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Actually Sibrius SK's crit less than any other class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Sibrius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Interesting didn't know that was a fact Brael, all in all though we crit a reasonable amount, and mainly I don't know if they'd feel comfortable giving us the ability to nuke for 1.5k+ and crit for 3k+<br />
<br />
Doesn't sound too unreasonable to me, but I'm skeptical that they would.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">With the resist mod lowered on it and ToI capable of a 1k+ dd/2k + heal already, how is this so hard to believe? But with 30% dd focus this OoW tap also maxes in the area of 1768/3568 also...</div></div><hr />
