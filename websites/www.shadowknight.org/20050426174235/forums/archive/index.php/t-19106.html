<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Islekillyourass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i am on the lord of pain's khukri quest right now.  its the last of the khukri quests, right before i start crusaders of greenmist quest.  I am currently hunting IN FRONTIER MOUNTAINS looking for penmasters and penkeepers ,  not temp of droga,  not burynai mines,  IN FRONTIER MOUNTAINS,  specifically, in a small cave system type thing with nothing but dead ends.  I have seen penkeepers spawn here,  always at the very bottom level.  And from them i have collected these keys, bone (not necklace) , bronze, copper, and steel.  ALSO , in this area i have found &quot;an enslaved iksar&quot;   with the gold loincloth and the whole bit, standing right next to &quot;an iksar slave&quot; .  right by where i keep seeing the penkeepers spawn.  What i want to know is, is this the right area to be hunting?  or do i need to go droga or burynai mines?  Eventually if i keep clearing this small cave system will i get the stone and bone necklace keys?  Also,  is this iksar in frontier mountains that i just spoke of, is he the Argest who i am supposed to give the 3 keys to? whenever i hail him he just says something like &quot; an enslaved iksar looks up at you , scars can be seen all over him&quot; or some crap like that,  what im trying to say is he doesnt strike up a conversation with me, ask me for keys, or anything like that when i hail him.  So once i get the three keys do i give them to this iksar in frontier mountains?  And lastly, is the machine i need to combine the item i get from Argest and my 6 scrolls in still  in Droga?  Thank you so much to anyone who can help me with this.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ritter Bok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">That is the place where the penmasters and penkeepers spawn. It took me about 3 hours to get all three key drops. The penmasters and penkeepers only spawn in the same room as the enslaved iksar (and yes that is Argest) so you dont have to clear the whole cavern unless you just want to. GL!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Yaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yes. the Machine to combine the scrolls is still in the jail of Droga.  It looks like a pottery wheel and when you open it the name of it is Always Works, like the forge in Dalnir.  Argest is supposed to hand you back the stone key to get you into that cell.  Back when I did it I just used a shrink potion and walked right through the door, did my combine, then left.  Nothing in Droga sees invisible either so that makes it easy to get down there.  Circlet of Shadow is so uber.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>nnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">you can Shadow Step in and out of the cell if need be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I was never able to shadowstep in and out of any of those cells.  Besides which, at the time I did it (before the revamp), there were a ton of mobs around that area to aggro on you if shadowstep plopped you down somewhere inconvenient.<br />

Get yourself an Anizok's Minimizing Device and wiggle through the bars is my suggestion.</div></div><hr />
