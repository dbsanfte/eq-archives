Then yesterday we killed all three defunct sentries, spawned the Furious Sentry, killed him, identified the loot, and...no Task Stage Completed message, no named spawn at the ZI.  Checked alt-q and noticed that it was still on the 'destroy the sentries' stage with credit for killing only 2/3.<br />
<br />
Obviously this is a bug.  Has anyone else run into this?  Any ideas if it can be prevented?  If this happens with any regularity, I'll be looking for a new mission to farm.</div></div><hr />

Killed all 3 sentries, was given credit for one of them. We had a lot of pets with the 69 Shammy proc, maybe a pet getting the killshot has something to do with it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aaubert</div><div class="date">03-11-2005, 12:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe it IS just the pet, and the reason i heard for the bug was just a rumor, but what was told to me, is that if the statues get pushed around too much, you get no credit. Pets push a lot, so maybe its because of the pets, but just assumed it was due to movement. I'll have to test it. But yeah, what was told to me was that we needed to keep them from moving around much. They need to be snared so they won't run at low HP, and don't bash them into oblivion. I'll check and see if its actually a pet thing. (bwahaha, at the expense of my group). <br />
<br />
Last night we didn't get credit for the 2nd statue, but got 2x credit for the 3rd....so maybe its just the 3rd that can't be pet killed? (no matter what, a stupid bug, but still).<br />
