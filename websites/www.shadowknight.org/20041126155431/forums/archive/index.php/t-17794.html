<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Arbaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What would you gents/ladies like to see? Can be class AA, or general, etc.........<br />
<br />
*Please post realistic idea's<br />
<br />
**thread will be moved in a day or two to correct forum</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vezax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A MGB recourse ability.<br />
<br />
AAs that lower refresh on disciplines.<br />
<br />
FD hotkeyed.<br />
<br />
A crit dot ability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Strahvn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thought Consumption - HT Based mana tap <br />
<br />
HT's and taps the same amount of your current mana pool from the mob to your group leaving a 10tick duration dot on the mob that is a mana dot. <br />
<br />
Independent of your HT Timer, HT time reduction AA's effect it as well as ID items. <br />
<br />
<br />
I don't think that's too overpowered, would be a helluva nice thing on a gating boss mob and very group friendly in xp situations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>DConquest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">AA's I'd like to see<br />
<br />
Increase Lifetap dmg by 5, 10, and 20 percent<br />
<br />
Increase DoT dmg by 5, 10, and 20 percent ( per tick )<br />
<br />
Increase Mana given by Zev Bite by 25, 50, 100<br />
<br />
Increase the Power of Leech Curse to 1500 base <br />
<br />
Change Leech Curse to HT mob and heal GROUP by 1500 / 250 mana ( up to 3000 heal with AA, 500 mana )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Soulle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I want the AA that makes the WoW beta start tomorrow and places me in it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Manslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Death Peace hotkey would be fantastic.  Fury of Magic or something similar that increases spell crits would be nice, if not very original.  Something that increases either dot damage or duration would be nice.  Also wouldn't mind something that would put leechtouch and IHT on different timers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Korekil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">More or less what Vezax and DConquest said, especially an AA Death Peace.<br />
Would also like to see an AA that maybe raised our attack and weapon skills by 5 per rank 3 ranks available.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>raptus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">An AA that makes you unstunnable.  I understand the large races are unstunnable from the front, so make this AA apply to attacks from all quarters so everyone benefits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Would love to see the following:<br />
<br />
1.  Death Peace Hot Key AA (12aa)<br />
<br />
2. Disc re-use timer AA (Match Unholy Aura refresh timer with Touch of the Wicked 3) (2/4/6aa)<br />
<br />
3. Increased Skill Caps AA (2aa/ 1 skill point/ Skill)<br />
Allow us to increase our 1h,2h, Pierce, Offense, and Bash skills by 1 skill point upto 15 skill points. At a cost of 2aa/Skill Point/Skill. (Each skill is increased seperately) <br />
<br />
4. Unholy Touch 4 / 5 (9aa /12 aa)<br />
Adds damage to existing IHT.<br />
Requires Unholy Touch 3<br />
<br />
5. Stirke of the Ages (9aa)<br />
All Melee critical hits now do x2 damage instead of current x1.7ish damage.<br />
<br />
I would sooner see a handful good AA abilities with next expansion rather then 7-10 half ass abilities. <br />
<br />
I also have some ideas for new spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ruuti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">How bout some racial AA.<br />
<br />
stuff that would not necessarily be customizing the class of the character but more aimed at customizing the race<br />
<br />
Iksar and trolls get to buy back some of their XP penalty.<br />
<br />
Dark elves purchase AA that increases their immunity to to Magic.<br />
<br />
Gnomes get a natural disease ability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jorx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Maybe an AA that adds some kind of stun component to Harm Touch.<br />
<br />
Jorx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Szandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I want Slay Living!<br />
<br />
Szandor's unholy blade corrupts his target! (666)<br />
<br />
Seriously, though, I would like to see an AA that allows you to memorize an extra spell, or hold an extra buff. I would also enjoy seeing hybrids get Fury of Magic.<br />
<br />
Maybe even an instant Feign Death . . .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ruuti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">For that matter Mobs and Rogues get an instant kill,  why not some kind of limited DT...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Menaden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Here is some ideas that are coming to my mind.<br />
<br />
Knight advantages for 1H<br />
Speed of the knight for 1H<br />
Change leech touch into a group version<br />
Chance Crit for DoTs 1/2/5% (1/2/5/10% for necro)<br />
Increase chance to hit and to do dmg with bash by 2/5/10% (2H bash / shield)<br />
Increase LR (3 lvl for knight, 5 for warrior)<br />
Increase ID (3 lvl for knight, 5 for warrior)<br />
Lower re-use time of unholytouch discipline (10, 20, 30 min)<br />
Lower re-use time for spells 5, 10, 20%</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>belize</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">what about letting recourse spells land in the bard songs window?<br />
<br />
i would really love to see sk's allowed to continue the spell casting fury line much like the rest of hte int casters did in POP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>EdgeOfDetroit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tumy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">FD AA would ROCK!!  Ide love to free up a spell slot!<br />
<br />
Ide like to have the Unholy aura disc match HT timer with the time reducing HT AA's.  So yes, disc refresh time reducing AA's.<br />
<br />
How about a Undead Steed AA!  I want a damn skeletal horse! Damnit!  The damn modles are already in the game!  Use them!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">For the next expansion:<br />
<br />
Death Leach- Gives a chance for any normal hit to be a life tap. Level one 0.5% chance, level two 1.5% chance, level three 3% chance. Cost 5 aa, 10 aa, 15 aa respectively. Stacks with innate, spell, and weapon life tap procs.<br />
<br />
As bove, Speed of the Knight and Knight's Advantage for 1handed weapons.<br />
<br />

<br />
Disc refresh to match Touch of the Wicked.<br />
<br />
Instant Death Peace hot key, with appropriate refresh.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Death Peace - Allows us to cast deathpeace from a hotkey. (Paladins get a stun AA, Rangers get a snare AA, I want my fd AA back).  SK only<br />

<br />
Army of Death - Summon 4/8/12 level 30 skeleton swarm pets, live for 15 seconds, each has access to Harmful Touch is fear immune and has the hp/melee capability of a level 30 necro pet. SK only<br />
<br />
Improved Unholy Touch - Further increase HT damage ability.  SK only.  This would be something which should be added ONLY if new levels are put in, in order to make sure HT is capable of scaling up in damage with increasing mob HP.  If there are no new levels, then ignore this.  Prereq of Unholy Touch 3.<br />
<br />
Improved Consumption of the Soul - Further increase LT damage ability.  SK only.  This would be something which should be added ONLY if new levels are put in, in order to make sure LT is capable of scaling up in damage with increasing mob and player HP.  If there are no new levels, then ignore this.  Prereq of CotS 3.<br />
<br />
Improved Touch of the Wicked - Further decrease HT timer.  SK only.  This would be something which should be added ONLY if new levels are put in, in order to make sure HT can scale appropriatley.  Reduces the recycle on /disc UnholyAura as well.  If there are no new levels, then ignore this.  Prereq of TotW 3.<br />
<br />

<br />
Unholy Drogmor - Think Unholy Steed.  SK only<br />
<br />
Fury of Magic - Already exists, allow SK's to use.<br />
<br />
Advanced Fury of Magic - Assuming this will be added, allow SK's to use.<br />
<br />
Advanced Theft of Life - Just like Advanced Healing Gift.  SK/Nec<br />
<br />
Innate Leechcurse - Like the name says, innate form of leechcurse, allows us to gain 1/3/5% of the damage we deal per swing back in hp.  SK only.<br />

<br />
Shield Mastery - Three Levels. Gives you a shielding mod equilavent to the shields AC/10 while wearing a shield at level 1.

<br />
Strengthened Bash - Increases the damage bash can do while having a shield equipped.  Three levels of the AA each removes the cap by 1/3, so for example if you have a 55 AC shield with no AA your bash uses 25 AC for damage check, with level 1 1/3 of that ac over the cap would be added giving you 35 AC for damage check (10 or 1/3), level 2 would be 45 AC (20 or 2/3), and level 3 would allow you the full AC of the shield for damage.  War/Pal/Shd only, prereq of shield mastery level 3 for knights, no prereq for Warriors.<br />

Standard caster shit (crits, mc, fizzles, etc)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Ruuti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">All good Ideas but would like to see somthing that is totally different.  How about something that would completely allow us to customize our class.  For instance introduce a huge melting pot of unspecified AA and let people purchase them in a skill tree patern.  SK who finally get to learn 2 weapon style,  maybe never as good as the warrior but hey we have always wanted it.  Add 10 levels that can be customized and purchased like they are in SWG or EQ2<br />
<br />
Maybe we could come up with AA aptitudes,  where a character spends a certain amount of AA to become a fast learner in trade skills or non-tradeskill abilities.   <br />
<br />
Hell make elite classes where people become the end result of their character arch.<br />
<br />
Paladins would become Generals,  or knights templar.<br />
<br />
Shadowknigts would become Unholy Death Lords.<br />
<br />
Necromancers could finally achieve a permanent state of lichdom,  perhaps getting an undead version of themselves.<br />
<br />
<br />
Clerics become Bishops<br />
<br />
Bards become Elton John<br />
<br />
and Beast Masters finally become shamen....</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Ragnarok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Resist mod AA for all casters. Shadowknights don't suffer a whole lot from resists, since many of our spells have resist mods and end up being either unresistable or 100% resisted depending on the mob's immunities. But if you've ever casted spells with no resist mod on untashed mobs, you'd start to cry. You may have even noticed a lot of resists on festering, and that has a -20 mod omg.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Darko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">To add to Brael's pretty complete list:<br />
<br />
AA extending the duriation on recourses or all determental spells<br />
AA lowering recast times <br />
Suspend Minion<br />
Also id like see something usefull done with our AA leach touch and /disc leachcurse.  Both of these are a bit out dated, a method of upgrading both via AA or other wise would be nice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Spell Casting Fury POP levels- Every other hybrid got something from their parent class.<br />
<br />
Fury type AA that works like a disc- ATK goes up as our HP goes down type ability, good enough to be useful but not overpowering.<br />
<br />
AA that makes ToW work with Leechtouch<br />
<br />
AA that decreased reuse time and duration on leech curse.<br />
<br />
Charm immunity AA- We are the direct champions of evil gods, are we not?<br />
<br />
AAs that gve us Bane damage against specific groups of good aligned mobs, like Servants of Mith Marr, Servants of Tunare, ect.<br />
<br />
Innate Invis to undead- Clerics have it, Paladins and SKs should have it too.<br />
<br />
AA that makes your entire group affected by leechcurse discipline.<br />
<br />
AA that gives entire group unholy steeds.<br />
<br />
AA that makes the sackers in your guild log in on time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>HodorOgre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I'd like to see a new line of weapons mastery AAs, for example 1HS Mastery. These could be deep in the tree, requiring CF3 and maybe the knight AAs. Then I would like to see uber weapon drops that required these AAs in order to equip them.<br />
<br />
I'd like an AA that allows me to revert to the pre-Luclin ogre model. While we're dreaming I'd like the skeletal horse that Vhaksiz rides in PoN.</div></div><hr />

Undead resistance 5/10/20% damage reduction of damage with undead source.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>krikk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">FD hotkey is a good one, and pet's getting recourses.<br />
I'd like improved blocking on shields, as in almost every other Roleplayer where you can use shields. Maybe &quot;Knight's Protection&quot; 1, 2, 3 allowing %5, 10%, and 15% more parrying and riposting of attacks while using a shield as a paladin or Shd (to help make up for, somewhat, the current crummyness of 1h'ders damage bonus and the crazy ripostes we get with faster 1h weapons)<br />
Oh yeah, death touch that refreshes every 5 minutes. that's not asking TOO much is it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Sharkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">SCF upgrade (once again more and harder crit blasts)<br />

Res Ability (the Necro Spell or something)<br />
<br />
Pet Enhancement (how about a unique looking SK pet either?)<br />
<br />
2h Skills Enhancement (raise the cap for 2h for knights or add more levels in SOTK/KA)<br />
<br />
1h / Shield Combo AA (bonus if you use this, knight only)<br />
<br />
Taunt Upgrades (aka fix terror line, can happen without AA or expansion since it's a balancing issue)<br />
<br />
UT upgrades (for DMG / Resuse Timer)<br />
<br />
AA to buy more Spell Gem / Buff Slots (8 spell gems and 15 buff slots isn't enough anymore)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unholy Champion- creates a swarm pet that lasts for a minute that mimicks the knights fighting abilities <br />
<br />
Raise the Dead - for each level the knight can raise 2 skeletons of fallen heroes nearby (2-4-6 ) skeletons would hit maybe 200 max, and last for a minute  kinda like WTD but instead of a mobs corpse it needs PC corpses,<br />
<br />
Unholy Pact - necro sacrifice / rez deal, maybe make ours 85% or somethin with a component like EEs,<br />
<br />
an aa line that lets us crit a little more would be kewl,  or maybe one that would give us a chance to get more from a tap, like an innate ID,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>krikk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Doesn't have anything to do with AA, but...<br />
Why in the sweet name of f*** is there no Numeral Mana meter?! For example:<br />

64 gravelord<br />
2890 / 6400 HP<br />
1920/ 2622 Mana<br />
1360 AC<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Paynreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I want to see two new catagories :<br />
<br />
RACIAL AA:<br />
<br />
IE: Ogres, comlete unstunnabillity (Rank 1, meelee from all sides, rank 2, from spells aswell (maybe not boss mob spells, or just a resist %)<br />
<br />
DIETY AA:<br />
<br />
IE: Cazic-Thule, Fear cap removed<br />
<br />
Of course, this might require a one-time only diety change quest (race change quest seems to extreme to me)<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, i want a new type of AA progression where you can only choose some on a BRANCHING path - IE: Only get to follow a defensive path, which itself would branch into several very good abilities (Super dodge, super-mitigation, etc). OR, take the offensive path, which again would be branching and allow you to get some great abilities like super-crits, super-nukes, or something. I HATE the ability to get every AA, i want to CHOOSE the type of SK i am, not play knowing eventually everything could be doable. Of course, the abilities would have to not suck, and maybe a 1-time buyback for points if you didnt like what you perma-chose? Anyway...<br />
<br />
As for SK aas? <br />
<br />
Death Peace Hotkey<br />
<br />
Improved lifetap heals<br />
<br />
Improved Soul Abrasion<br />
<br />
Manatap-HT like has already been said<br />
<br />
AA improving the %chance for shields to block (assuming they ever add this)<br />
<br />
A SUPER-Taunt aa spell, not like this BS we have now (So few people use this junk!) (IE: A stacking 2%snare, 1DoT per tick, 5dd on cast, and 1tap of all stats - the point is, combine lots of weak things to make one spell useless for killing, but GREAT for aggro, like DC used to be)<br />
<br />
Pretty much whats already been said, especially what Brael said. My fave: <br />
<br />
Lesser form of a permanent leechcurse (gain back say 5% of damage we deal in hp) .<br />
<br />
Oh, and what about a truly unholy unholy steed? Im tired of just a black horse, i would GLADLY play more AAs for a rideable Dracholich thats just like a horse, but looks different. <br />
<br />
Also, what about a disc-like ability that transformed us into something for a brief period (PoNightmare skeleton SK mobs, anyone?) and increases our ATK/Lifetap procs etc as a meelee rebalance? I'd love it.</div></div><hr />

Pet FD-<br />
<br />
Pet Focus- ( this is a must, we should be able to make our pets stronger ) Pet recourses and any buff we can cast on ourself let us be able to cast it on our pet.<br />
<br />
Increase soul abrasion-<br />
<br />
Unholy Touch- 3 more levels<br />
<br />
Theft of life- 3 more levels<br />
<br />
Would like to see the mastery of the past atleast upgraded to 60 spells, so that we dont fizzle on FD.<br />
<br />
MGB recourses- with a low refresh time like 10 mins or something.Would be nice with Zev. Bite<br />
<br />
Pet swarm<br />
<br />
DT- mobs under level 60 can DT them instantly saying there name like the golems in Fear do ) Long refresh timer.<br />
<br />
Leech curse- UPGRADE THE DAMN TAP ITS WORTHLESS ATM. ( and seperate timer from HT )<br />
<br />
Maybe a Mana Leech- fills up your mana pool/or groups ( same reuse timer as leech curse, but a diff one then HT )<br />
<br />
A benficial spell duration increase- based on taps so that our recourses last WAY longer.Like Aura of darkness/Hate/Pain taps all lasting like 10x there normal time would be nice.Not sure why Aura of darkness is such a short duration.Also make that damn spell unresistable like Tash/Malo/Mala/HoS ( seriously why the hell isnt ours? )<br />
<br />
Super VoT- low refresh timer 10 mins, but atleast then i would never have to mem it again!<br />
<br />
Dire charm undead- considering by the time we are 70 DC pets wont be over powered for us to have.<br />
<br />
Stun resist<br />
<br />
All the normal crap-<br />
<br />
would like a purge- so when we are the last one alive on a raid and we are dot'd :p<br />
<br />
Skill cap increases- or specialisation in one like casters have.<br />
<br />
Undead track-<br />
<br />
Death rez- i dont even care if it gives you ZERO exp back and is on a 2 day timer, just give us it PLEASE.<br />
<br />
Pet consumption- makes it so you dont have to use bonechips anymore.<br />
<br />
Pet repost focus- makes pet immune to:enrage/ae's/rains/traps/ds's<br />
<br />
Maybe a group/targetted super twitch- so you can fill your cleric/chanter up with half the mana from your pool at the expense of all of your mana.This for when they die in a exp group or something, and need to get going fast ie; LDoN adventures.<br />
<br />
Double bash<br />
<br />
Bash cap removal<br />
<br />
Call to corpse<br />
<br />
Deaths mimic- Instant cast FD that is unfailable, not even by a caster casting on you.Long refresh timer or it makes you stay FD/stunned on the ground for a duration like 5 mins or something, as a penalty.<br />
<br />
Target FD- long refresh also, lets you target someone &quot;in your group&quot; and makes them FD instantly. ( this i would love )<br />
<br />
2hand bash focus- making it do alot more dam!<br />
 <br />
Fear spell focus- allowing us to use our current Fear spells on higher level mobs atleast to level 63 or so. ( a must )   <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Rhumba_Kween</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Not sure I like the Deity aa's. There is a lot of balancing issues that would get introduced there, and historically. Sony has not wanted to deal with balancing racial/deity advantages. So no thanks. :)<br />
<br />
My top 5 would be:<br />
<br />
1) An AA that would let your group buffs affect pets. (I know this is the bot chanter in me coming out).<br />
<br />
2) Critical Dots AA. Just like SCF only for DoTs. Why should Necros be left out. :)<br />
<br />
3) An AA that lets us impart our AC/Avoidance/Mitigation to our pet. Even if its only for a short time period. Maybe it lasts for 60 seconds, with a reuse time of 1hour at level 1, 40minutes at level 2 and 20 minutes at level 3.<br />
<br />
4) Fury of Magic. We got the upgraded melee crits. Lets see the other side of things.<br />
<br />
5) I think a good one for all classes would be. Exodus home town. Make it expensive and make it a really big reuse time, maybe a week? But this would be really handy.<br />
<br />
6) FD on a stick would... I mean FD on a hotkey would be nice, but I have a feeling we will never see this for balance issues. For each spell slot you free up for us, our dps will go up.<br />
<br />
I also think that when they add the next round of AA's they really need to look at upping the cost. There is nothing wrong with introducing some very nice AA's that may take a big amount of time to obtain.  In the age where its pretty easy to get an AA in an hour and half, there would be nothing wrong with seeing a 15 point or two skill for every class.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Paynreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Guys, lets be reasonable with these, eh?<br />
<br />
I saw someone post for another 3 levels of UT. If we got that, it would hit for roughly 20k! Though i would love it, thats completely absurd unless EVERY class gets such an ability, in which case zones would really be thrown out of whack (MUCH more so than any other expansion has done).</div></div><hr />

FD on a hotkey would be nice, but I have a feeling we will never see this for balance issues.<br />
<br />
i think we can and should get it. basically to avoid the balance issues it would need to be the same as death peace, have a 1 sec casting time. its not much different than having an innate camo AA, its just a nice utility put on to a hot key.<br />
<br />
if it doesn't have a casting time the reuse would have to be made too long to free up the spell slot (because of balance issues)... making it definitely not as nice.<br />
<br />
i like the two suggestions i made, and don't think they're too overpowered.</div></div><hr />

How long has it been since it was considered a viable alternative to using a 2hander?  PoP just made it worse by giving us the same AA for increased double attack and applying it only to 2handed weapons (the triple attack AA is 2handers only across the board, iirc).<br />
<br />
Fury of Magic, please.  Do we share ANY non-generic PoP AA's with Necros outside of Theft of Life?<br />

The pet simulicrum would be fabulous.  It would be like a gimptacular DI for pet classes... then again, we aren't considered a pet class.  Aren't we the only class that gets a pet spell that is over level 60 which summons a pet below level 60?<br />

Racial AA's would be excellent.  Diety restricted AA's would be better.<br />
<br />
DoT Crits, please.<br />
<br />
Please remove our dependancy upon Unholy Aura in order to maximize Harm Touch.  Attach the multiplier to the Improved Harm Touch AA as a second level, and remove the discipline entirely, as changing the resist check does little.  Raid mobs will have their MR gimped by HoS, Tash, and Malosinia... none of which affect their Disease Resistance.  If fighting DR immune mobs, we are half-gimped, already.  Only Warriors are so dependant upon a single discipline, and in any situation but tanking a raid mob, they have other alternatives which may be better than defensive.  Our other non-generic discipline is so situational that it is ridiculous (both generic disciplines can be rendered completely useless, one through enough resist buffs/songs/gear, the other through an AA).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>Dester</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">I would like to see an AA that would make your spells harder to resist.  Say three levels -10/-25/-50 to any spell you cast for 3/6/9 AA pts.<br />
<br />
Another option I like from AD&amp;D was that you radiate an evil aura that lowers any mobs resissts in a limited range around you by say 10 or 15 for 6 AA pts.  SK only<br />
<br />
I know we have a lot of low resist spells anyway but the first could be for any caster /shrug<br />
<br />
I like the idea of inate leach curse and eliminating the unholy aura disc but really what other disc would we use?  Leach curse doesn't really last long enough and / or has way to long of a reuse time to be worth it.  Fear resist is obsolete already with AAs and the resist one is just a joke both for effect and for reuse.<br />

/shrug just my take on the matter<br />

Please remove our dependancy upon Unholy Aura in order to maximize Harm Touch.  Attach the multiplier to the Improved Harm Touch AA as a second level, and remove the discipline entirely<br />
<br />
actually this is a good idea... except keep the discipline in place, and make it so they don't stack. something like:<br />
<br />
death knight's aura: permanently envelops you in an unholy aura, increasing the damage of your harm touch. 4aa.<br />
<br />
this is an especially good idea if they're giving new disciplines as they've planned, because we're basically stuck saving /disc for IHT.</div></div><hr />

So if big races get 2h with shield, what do the small races get? Big races already have stun immunity/regen/slam over them.  <br />
<br />
Most of those advantages with the (curent) exception of stun immunity are already available to the smaller races to varying degrees.<br />
<br />
regen - iksar and aa<br />
slam - 2h bash aa<br />
<br />
Considering the exp penalties that the ogres and trolls take for these &quot;perks&quot; only to be mimicked by all the other races in the end, it would be nice if they either did away with the exp penalties all together (can picture the bitchfest), or add another ability to try and justify it. <br />
Trolls and ogres are twice the size of a human, or elf. Wouldn't it make sence that they could wield a mansized twohander in one hand? perhapse have ogre sized twohanded weapons that only large races have the strength to weild?</div></div><hr />

That said, an AA to allow the use of a 2h weapon and a shield isn't really out of the question IMO, particularly in terms of implementation difficulty. Balance options could include applying 1hs damage bonus and disabling Knights Advantage etc. <br />

I just think that despite the xp penalty, letting large races use 2h as 1h weapons would be a bit overpowering. Perhpas give the smaller races something like added avoidance, or you know what would be really cool? If they had coded combat to use size modifiers ala AD&amp;D. So if I'm a small race, I'll get a bonus to atk when I'm attacking anything larger than me. That wouldn't really help to balance out your proposed ability though, so I digress.<br />
<br />
I think that the xp penalty more or less balances out the regen, slam, etc. However I think that something else would need to be added for small races only if large races could weild weapons in such a way.<br />

Of course, I could be wrong. ;p</div></div><hr />

Peeps are talking about  L vs Small races for AAs . How about<br />
<br />
Large Races (playing off  str)<br />
<br />
getting there Two handers as one handers<br />
<br />
How about some thing like DB/2 if greater then 12(or what ever a one hander is)<br />
<br />
So you would get Half Damage bonus while useing a shield.<br />
<br />
even the strongest is going to be stronger with two arms.<br />
<br />
<br />
Small races(playing off of there Agi or dex )<br />
<br />
Small haste bonus or increase odds of dbl attack with a one hander.(maybe even a trip) Point being missing less or pileing on more chances to hit.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Both would be very situational  nor unbalanceing ( there are two handers with more ac the most shields you will see and they give knights triple attack)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u112"><b>Kalendrox Grimblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p112">Some good ideas, but I think most of it is unrealistic.  If SoE wanted to add a couple of those, I think that the AA cost should be doubled (at least on some of the more drastic ones, like:<br />
Zevfeers Sting - 10 minute reuse 2500 dd, 2500 group heal, 1500 mana for everyone in group. SK only, which i think would only be realistic as a 40-60 min refresh, which can be reduced with more AA).  <br />
<br />
I think that the most we can hope to get (again, if there is no level increase) is AA for an improved ZBite, better leech touch, and maybe the FD hotkey and innate lifetap abilities (maybe heal only when you crit, and for 50% of the damage you crit for).<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: (reading more): I like the diety specific ideas alot, but I think they would be difficult to balance.  Maybe have those abilities at a cost of 12AA and only available to level 65s with a minimum of 100 or 150 AAs?<br />
<br />
Also, I don't see SoE removing the fear cap.  I mean, it would be great to be able to solo semi-effectively again, but if they removed the cap, they would need to go mob by mob and decide what should be immune and what shouldnt for everything over 55 (assuming that they never bothered flagging any mobs over 55 as fear immune since at the time nothign could be feared above 55).<br />

<br />
This argument is based on the cosmetic differences between the races, rather than any inherent gameplay imbalance between them (with the possible exception of racial exp penalties). But, what's the first thing that happens when you enter a dungeon or raid? &quot;Shrink that damn fatass down to the size of a gnome, plz&quot;<br />
<br />
Or, you Pact of Hate or whatever, but my point is that, from personal experience, we fatties spend more time downsized than otherwise, and then the wielding 2 handers like 1 handers argument becomes sorta null and void.<br />
<br />
Back on topic: some other AA thoughts.<br />
<br />
Maybe a buyback option? I honestly can't imagine using this but it would be interesting to have the feature. Sell your horse back for a little extra resistance on a particular raid, or some such.<br />
<br />
Diablo style abilities like AAs that cause mobs to drop more gold, or have a greater chance of dropping their rare drop. (I know, loot table is determined when they spawn, but still, maybe at the least it could increase the cash dropped)<br />
<br />
Some kind of &quot;Intimidation&quot; AA where the mob will choose to run for its life sooner than usual, thus allowing your group to beat on a mob for free longer, perhaps bringing the insta-kill AA into play more often.<br />
<br />
Speaking of intimidation, who here misses the good old days when green con mobs would leave you the hell alone? How about an AA where you can walk right past those green mobs without them annoying you.<br />
<br />
An AA ability called &quot;Warhorse&quot; or somesuch. May have been mentioned here already, but if you're meleeing from horseback, your horse gets an attack too, like a bite or kick. Would of course be a trivial amount of DPS, but I think it'd be cool nonetheless.<br />
<br />
Speaking of horsey AAs, maybe &quot;Racing Steed&quot; or some such... something that speeds our horse up a tidbit. Or &quot;Airborne Steed&quot;... your horse has built in levitate.</div></div><hr />

yes, I am well aware of that...  but you might take note of the fact the timers to REUSE them are different due to unholyaura being a level 55 discipline and leechcurse being a 60th discipline.<br />

Leechcurse takes (slightly) longer to get back your discipline than when you use unholyaura.<br />

Why did you suggest they 'nerf' the mana we get back? I see lots of weapons with lifetap procs (there's even a lifetap proc augment) but I see nothing with a MC type proc. So, why ask for a 'nerf' on the most unique part of our procs?<br />

well for me, MC is very situational...  I use SoC nearly all the time...  MC is maybe 10% of the time if that in current Adventure or XP groups... (only when someone in the group is worse than pointless and I have to do multiple roles AND continue pulling someone's patootie out of the fire...)<br />
<br />
if it really that big of a deal, raise the AAXP cost to 9, and make it 200 lifetap, 100 mana innate... (its a self only proc...)<br />
<br />
I would take 200lifetap+50 mana and buff slot over MC any day of the week and twice on weekends...  I would just as happy if that mana went up to 100...<br />
<br />
I simply want our proc lifetaps innate so they don't cost us a buff slot anymore.  Buff slots are very precious right now.<br />

<br />
However, given Touch of Innoruuk and SA3, then you need 3.3 procs for enough mana to power one Touch, for a base of 0 mana spent for 470 healed, and 965 damage done, + crits. 3.3 shots of SA3 Shroud of Chaos is 643.5 damage dealt/643.5 healed + crits. If you're looking for raw damage, I'd suggest MC. If you're just looking to lighten the load on your healer, use SA3 Chaos. Most of the time, I just use Chaos: I'm primarily the tank, and lightening the damage load on the cleric takes stress off her. On raids, I'll generally use Chaos as a damage proc. With Wind of Marr, Spiritual Purity/Domination, and C5, mana is not a significantly limiting factor for me. <br />
<br />
Where I personally find MC to excel is LDoN hard mode dungeons. In this case, I am frequently my own secondary healer while tanking, so I need the timing I can get from Touch of Innoruuk much more than the overall better healing of SoC.<br />
<br />
As for what do I want from AA?<br />
Dot compaction AAs: AA that causes DoTs to deal more damage in a shorter time.<br />
Fury of Magic.<br />
Innate Mana Preservation. <br />
AA pet: Level 60, quad ~65 with a delay comparable to our 64 pet, and fugging backstab. <br />
Suspend Minion. <br />
A 0.1% chance of casting Cazic Touch instead of Improved Harm touch. Complete with zone-wide, all caps shout.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For the record, ( since some fags don't get this ) it is my opinion that our overall DPS is too low in comparion to other tank options. Due to the lifetime of the common XP / LDoN mob, we spend more time and mana on aggro than what we can contribute to DPS through spells, if we are the MA. Therefore, what grants us an edge in DPS amoung the tanks is limited in use in groups. Up the melee DPS, and now that situation doesn't arise. Some may argue that the way it is is the way it was meant to be - that is your opinion - but this is mine.</div></div><hr />

Darko, if you had a clue you might be worth the time to flame in return, but alas, I'll leave you to your idoicity. Let the thread return to the AA wish list, and buy a dictionary.  Don't be a hater; just reroll the druid man, reroll as the druid.<br />
<br />
For the record, ( since some fags don't get this ) it is my opinion that our overall DPS is too low in comparion to other tank options. Due to the lifetime of the common XP / LDoN mob, we spend more time and mana on aggro than what we can contribute to DPS through spells, if we are the MA. Therefore, what grants us an edge in DPS amoung the tanks is limited in use in groups. Up the melee DPS, and now that situation doesn't arise.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u170"><b>Karnij</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p170">I agree with nocifer on these I would like to see 1hander /  bash dmg increase and a overall dps increase for shadowknights so the STRIKETHROUGH,RAPID STRIKES, INCREASED BASH DMG would be awsome.  I would also like to see a Hybrid or KNIGHT SPECIFIC 1hander dps increase like an additional hit or double increase like they gave us for PoP aa on 2handers.  MY basic only concern is that we GET A DPS BUMP and a DPS bump on 1hander/shield combo<br />

1. Improved Innate Run speed (we all get that so its required)<br />
2. Improved Innate Reg (we all get that so its required)<br />
3 Sturdiness (We MUST have that to keep in-line with warriors!)<br />
4. Weapon Affinity (assuming that its proc-rate increase)<br />
5. Shield Specialization<br />
6. Increased Bash Damage <br />
7. Blinding Reverence <br />
8. Fury of Magic Mastery<br />
9. Stonewall<br />
10. Shallow Grave<br />
11. Strikethrough<br />
12. Rapid Strikes <br />
13. Theft of Life (assuming its advanced version)<br />
14. Persistent Casting <br />
15. Critical Affliction<br />
