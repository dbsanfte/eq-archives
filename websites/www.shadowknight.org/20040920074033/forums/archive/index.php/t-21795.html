<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Prevost</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anyone seen the new turn-in runes drop in anything below Kod'Taz since the patch? Spent most of Saturday farming names in Sewers and, while pre-patch had gotten a few spells (about 1 spell for every 2 names and none for SK, of course), after 6 to 8 names over the weekend we saw no runes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shadowsoal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">yes my guild had one drop in Ikkinz raid 1, there are three different new Taelosian Geomancy stones<br />
<br />
Taelosian Geomancy Stone Eril (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=59975) = Miasmic Spear<br />
<br />
Taelosian Geomancy Stone Jelki (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=59906) = Black Shroud<br />
<br />
Taelosian Geomancy Stone Yiktu (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=59974) = Mental Horror</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I got the jelki one couple days ago in Kod Taz.  I have seen the others drop but lost the roll. <br />
<br />
The nameds there seem to spawn either frequently or not at all and never know what its going to be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Saruton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think the question was not if they drop KT+. It's anout them dropping in sewers etc. Would be interested in that too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>VengerMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">got the Yiktu rune off of Umbiki in Vxed and another off of Sludge-Eating Fly in Sewers-Lair since the patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Prevost</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thank you, VengerMT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Hsrool</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have killed in the neighbourhood of 15 named in the sewers since the June 16 patch. I have yet to see a single spell drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Prevost</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Just a confirmation update to this topic:<br />
I had a friend send me tell from SNLair linking me a Yiktu rune that they got after their group killed their third named on the 5th of July, 2004.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rhumba_Kween</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I've seen one rune drop since the patch now. But They are deffinitely rarer than they were before. But on the bright side. Generally when they actually do drop now, someone in the group can deffinitely use them.<br />
<br />
I'll take the tradeoff.</div></div><hr />
