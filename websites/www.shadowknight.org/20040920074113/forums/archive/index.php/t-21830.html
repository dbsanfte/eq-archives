<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Qoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">How do u get to Yxxta ? That a grind zone?<br />
  Is there anything needed to start a Ikkinz grp trial?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You get to Yxxta from Kod'Taz. I have only been in the zone a few times, I don't think anyone xp's there if thats what you mean by grind.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what is required to start the Ikkniz single group trials, I would assume the first one just requires to be Kod'Taz flagged (because the npc you get the trials for is in Kod'taz), but I'm not sure if you need to gather anything before starting the first one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It is a zone off of the far side of Kod'taz. The run is easy once you know it, but it you don't it can be dangerous.<br />
<br />
The experience there is good, about equal to Kod'taz. There are experience group named there as well, and some drop quite nice aug's and spells too (my 50/50/50 aug is from there). Ther reason people don't experience there is that cr is harder than Kod'taz, both in getting to the zone, and then to your camp in the zone.<br />
<br />
Ikkinz trials are started by talking to Kevren in Kod'taz (near the zone in) and following his text.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Since the BiC page drop change my guild has an exp group there nightly.  Its decent exp and no competition.</div></div><hr />
