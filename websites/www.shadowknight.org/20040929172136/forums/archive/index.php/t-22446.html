Berzerkers are getting more DPS upgrades than you can shake a gnome at.  Rogues getting a way to stay Hidden when AE'd.  Death Peace hotkey appears to be in the Necro AA's.<br />
<br />
SK's get tap boost, tap boost, and another tap boost.<br />
<br />
I see a very large number of generic AA I will have a hard time deciding upon the day OoW is out.  That isn't to say that I dont like the tap-based AA's, but I will withhold judgement on their effectiveness as a 'mitigation.'  I expect they will make soloing old crap that much easier, and might help a teeny, tiny bit on the new big mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">One thing to keep in mind is that AA's shared by multiple classes appear to only be listed under the first class (in alphabetical order).

Please re-read the above list and keep a close eye out for something along the lines of:<br />
<br />
Mnemonic Retention<br />
This ability gives you an additional spell slot so you can memorize an additional spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Nikl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Mind Crash<br />

<br />
&lt;I&gt;Advanced Pet Discipline<br />
The first rank of this ability allows you to give your pet a &quot;&quot;focus&quot;&quot; command so it will not attack any opponent other than ones you directly order it to. The second rank allows you to tell your pet to not cast any spells. Usage: /pet focus, /pet nospell.&lt;/I&gt;<br />
<br />
I'm guessing we'll get this, but am not really seeing it as a big deal.  I have been annoyed a couple times at not being able to get my pet to attack who I want, but not that annoyed.  If it's cheap, I may pick it up.  Can't see any circumstances under which I'd get the second rank.<br />
<br />
&lt;I&gt;Improved Critical Affliction<br />
This ability grants damage-over-time spells an increased chance to have a critical effect each time they are active.&lt;/I&gt;<br />
<br />
An upgrade to a low priority AA.<br />
<br />
&lt;I&gt;Death Peace<br />
This ability gives you an additional way to feign death.&lt;/I&gt;<br />
<br />
FD hotkey.  We had better get this.<br />
<br />
&lt;I&gt;Shield Block<br />
This ability grants you the chance to fully block an attack when using a shield. Increased ranks improve the chance to block attacks.&lt;/I&gt;<br />
<br />
Something they should have given knights and warriors without having to spend an AA on it.  I'll probably get it as soon as I can get myself a decent onehanded weapon.<br />
<br />
&lt;I&gt;<br />
Touch of the Cursed<br />
This ability grants the shadowknight a chance to drain the life of his opponent any time he makes a melee attack.&lt;/I&gt;<br />
<br />
Sounds like a mini-leechcurse that's always in affect, I like it.  Probably not on the top of my list of my priorities (avoidance/mitigation, DP hotkey and spellslot addition comes first) but something to consider after that stuff.  Hopefully by then we'll see some parses to get an idea of how often it goes off.<br />
<br />
&lt;I&gt;Spiritual Corrosion<br />
This ability further increases the damage of the lifetaps that result from shadowknight self buffs.&lt;/I&gt;<br />
<br />
I agree it's lame that they are giving us tiny upgrades to our innate procs, knowing we all eventually pursue SA3, and this will only excerbate that issue, SA3 is one of our better AAs, and I'm expecting this to be as well (though probably at a higher significantly cost), considering that it will continue to interact nicely with our crits and crit heals.<br />
<br />
&lt;I&gt;<br />
Soul Thief<br />
This ability further increases the chance that the healing effect of your lifetaps will provide an exceptional amount of healing.&lt;/I&gt;<br />
<br />
This is okay.  We seem to heal crit a lot already, but more is always good.  This is probably on about the same priority level as the Touch of the Cursed AA.<br />
<br />
Aside from the FD hotkey (which, again, I must say: we had better get it), this stuff looks nice, but I'm not dazzled.  FD hotkey alone will be sweet, so that's nice.  But compared to what some of the other classes are getting, and considering that from the looks of things, we aren't getting anything other than incremental upgrades to our spells in the next expansion, I'm sorry to say that it seems that Sony is not looking to go beyond the current status quo as far as shadow knights are concerned.  It looks like an OoW AA'd level 70 SK will have nothing to differentiate himself from a level 65 non-OoW SK, aside from better numbers and hotkey FD.  I think looking back, we will see PoP as a better expansion for us (but we can see what the content/itemisation brings... those things probably won't concern me too much though, as I doubt I'll be uber enough to enjoy mot of it.)<br />
<br />
Of course, none the above is going to balance our tanking with other classes, but that shouldn't be done with expansion AAs anyway.  I would be upset if they gave us an OoW AA to bring us in to line with paladins... but I'll be even more upset if they don't get on the ball already and do what they have to, to balance us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sindian Sanguis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">All things aside regarding needed tanking fixes IN ADDITION to the supposed OoW AA's of  Reflexive Mastery, and Defensive Instincts, I personally do not think any other classes then War/Pal/SK should recieve those AAs.  I am not looking at OoW to fix the tanking problems we are experiencing, and hope, god I hope they have their shit together to finally address all these class balance lists after this expansion is out, time is ticking regardless of how wonderful things might be in OoW.<br />

Death Peace, FD on a hotkey will be sweet indeed, already some monks though think it is an instant cast FD, or the ones that think it is indeed just a hotkeyed Death Peace, think they will be marginalized if we could snare pull and instantly be able to cast  Death Peace, ignoring the fact that if you did, the snared mob would still be in camp with the other mobs, dunno what kind of snare/FDing that is heh.  In any case loosing a spell we always have memmed and gaining another spell slot on top of that will be very nice, to actually have more varity to what we can keep in our lineup (especially like my lazy ass who hates even switching spells with the fast menu mem system).<br />
<br />
Shield Block, I really hope this is a useful AA, and not some retarded 2, 4, 6% line of bullshit.  I want to see a REAL substantial advantage by using a shield and purchasing this AA.<br />
<br />
Touch of the Cursed, will be interesting to see how often this will proc, and if so, I would hope Spritual Corrosion and Soul Theif would also effect it.  If it is some retarded 5% chance, useless in my books.  It's too bad it wouldn't take weapon damage/crits instead of a base proc number, be nice if it was also  linked to weapon affinity.<br />
<br />
Spiritual Corrosion, I always loved SA, and it is retarded that Pal/Rng proc dmg is balanced assuming SKs have SA3.  On a side note, I use Mental Horror  almost exlusively, and am disappointed that there is no upgrade to it in OoW.<br />
<br />
Soul Thief, love those crit heals, more the better, it's always nice to somehow pull one off when shit is going bad. Now I just wish our OoW lifetaps had a bit more umph to them or offered some scaleability or one of them to be a flat out % of your HPs, beated to death anyhow, but can always hope =/.<br />
<br />
Other AAs, I wish we would have recieved both Fury of Magic and Fury of Magic Mastery, not just FoM.  The ability to not be stunned at any angle rocks, hope it is a meaning full AA.<br />
<br />
I think we made out okay, especially compared to other classes (/laff at improved tracking), certainly by the descriptions some sound great, but after going through the crap that was GoD AA , I will try and not freak out just yet, and who knows what will actually make it live.<br />

This ability raises the maximum that your mana regeneration can be increased with items by 5 points per rank. <br />

Assuming it'll have the standard 3 or 5 ranks, this seems... excessive...</div></div><hr />

No friggin' way they release this AA with 3-5 ranks that each raise the cap by 5.  Can you imagine if all casters can get FT 30-40?  The low-mid level game is retarded enough with the current cap+KEI.</div></div><hr />

Thinking maybe they just mistyped it like they probably mistyped alot of things heh... betting 5 ranks of 1 ft increase per level... though i wouldn't think 25 ft cap would be too bad. At 40 ft cap though i think bards, sks, druids, chanters should be abit upset at making our mana providing abilities significantly weaker...</div></div><hr />

Sindian I agree with a lot of that, except a 5% per swing chance to tap wouldn't be retarded at all.  Tapping 1 swing per 20 would be pretty good.</div></div><hr />

<br />
FT20 is more of in-line with increased spell costs for OOW. FT25 might be ok but probably little excessive. FT40 is completely out of wrack. It's just wrong.. For sure with FT40, ppls can just start to fire off dd spells like machine gun with unlimited bullets like in cheat games. :)</div></div><hr />

Sure the FT40 cap looks high but the FT cap of 15 has been in game since Luclin.  That's how many years ago?  Hopefully the main problem casters will now have will be aggro managing, not going oom all the time.  Plus this will help wizards in groups because they need that kind of mana regen to contribute as much as other dps classes.  (Hard LDoN comes to mind).</div></div><hr />

Wizards do not need FT40.  I 3box a SK, rogue, and wizard every single night.  I've done about 5 LDoN hards per week for the last several months and with FT9, KEI, Z-bite from my SK, mp3, ornate gloves, and ZERO AA, my wizard easily does 30% of the damage to every single mob we pull.  That's with a rogue, SK, and monk all with more AA attacking, shaman for FA/haste on the melees, and both the shaman and cleric chipping in occasional nukes.<br />
<br />
I can cast 2 ice spears and one SoS on every mob in the adventure most nights, sometimes even 2 SoS's.  Most mobs are dead or running by the time those three spells hit anyway.<br />
<br />
If you are running out of mana on LDoN hard with FT15, you are either running without KEI (which almost no wizards do...don't try to convince me otherwise, I see friggin' 20 wizards standing in line for KEI in PoK every time I pass through) or you are not showing even the slightest bit of spell management.</div></div><hr />

My wife's magelo she fires off 2 SoS's per mob and usually 1 draught of thunder or teleka (for gaters/chealers) and typically doesn't run out of mana with SK/BST/CLERIC/WIZARD 4boxing an ldon (me 3boxing her playing her).</div></div><hr />

Actually, I just started an enchanter twink so I was reading through The Runes one day (chanter forum) and they had suggested an AA exactly like this, with that exact name. So I'm assuming that if its for anyone, it will either be int casters, or else enchanter only. Wizards already have an agro reducer, via Concussion spells.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That 30% is actually rather bad.  Your wizard should be doing closer to 50% damage on all those mobs.  I 2 box my 65wiz (elemental equipped) and 64 sk.  With some type of healer for a group of 3, my wizard does around 70-90% of the damage on every single mob.  With the rogue and monk, unless they're putting out similar dps, hence my approx 50% guess.<br />

The casual wizards definitely could use some FT loving, I don't know if I would go as high as FT40, but definitely more would be welcome.</div></div><hr />

You expect a zero-AA wizard to be equal DPS to a superior AA'ed rogue, in addition to 4 other group members all contributing to the DPS?  You've got an inflated image of the wizard class, I'm afraid...</div></div><hr />
