<br />
Taking bets what it will be in a few days. I say...... Ferine Avatar!<br />

<br />
EDIT Hey SoE, Pssssssst!! Here's what you're looking for! :http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4983&amp;source=Test</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">lol. that's hilarious, it casts itself as a recourse.... i wonder what would happen when you cast it on a mob<br />
A: it kills you,<br />
B: it kills the mob,<br />
C: it alternates back and forth and kills whoever has less HP<br />
D: nothing<br />
E: the world crashes</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>UGLA</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">omg wow that spell has a 20 hp upgrade and a 10 mana upgrade on it...talk about a HUGE UPGRADE to ZB!!!  <br />

Bah..that better not be the final edition of our spell :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Inquestion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Haha, I still say Wave of Trushar was the best autocast for it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even if it was just a simple copy of Zevfeer's it would be a great spell to have.  It would give us the option of sacrificing another spell slot for a 2nd ZB... Assuming the recourse stays 220/110, that's equivelent to 42 hp/tick regen for yourself/group and FT21 for your group (under perfect circumstances.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>aress</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">heh, and we need 10 spell slots :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>shadowblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">A full 8 would have kept me happy.<br />

<br />

<br />
It was admitted they werent able to tie the spell to a hotkey.<br />
<br />
Simple lack of programming skill..which sums up SoE</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Aavixx Squarepants</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">not to get to far off topic...<br />
<br />
but couldn't they just make a real hotkey that has the same properites of a spell?<br />
<br />
Make it cost say ...10 AA's...turn the AA's in and &quot;magical quest item&quot; appears on your cursor, turn in magical quest item and a death peace scroll at a SK NPC and your real hotbotton appears....<br />
<br />
or...<br />
<br />
Make it work like the rule 1...a no drop item clickable from inventory spell item,sk only, the result of a minor quest, with one of the quest items coming from cashing in AA's. I'd gladly sacrifice an inventory spot for a spell slot.<br />
<br />
I mean...if the only drawback is there programming skills...then there ARE ways around that using time tested methods and outside the box thinking.<br />
<br />
<br />
It doesn't seem that hard to do...but I could be wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>wetwurx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Doubt iwas not being able to tie the hot key, look at our aa horse or rangers camo or beastlord paragon. AA have a make hotkey function already. they just didnt want us to have it. period.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">you are misunderstanding what was wrong....<br />
they could give us death peace hotkeyed, but they couldn't easily make it so you couldn't use the SPELL death peace immediately after using the hotkey.<br />
<br />
IE, if they had given it to us, we'd be able to use the hotkey and immediately cast the spell if it failed.<br />
<br />
this would have caused a monk bitchfest if they implemented it without fixing this, and fixing this wasn't easy... thus we didn't get the hotkey.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Back to the original topic---<br />
<br />
Spell Data for Ancient Bite of Chaos is looking fixed again, recourse ...still nothing to jump for joy about, but that's old news...<br />
<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4982&amp;source=Live</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Bruuz Err</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Im a bit surprised that no one is really excited, or at least looking forward to the spell. Think of how often MC procs, and now notice that the recourse is a group spell.  As far as bone's being thrown, I'd say that was a pretty good one, but that's just my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Assuming you actually appreciate the fact that our 'bone' is switching from a tank to a mana battery in groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Thack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Switching?  We always have and always will be a tank.  Personally, since my GF plays a cleric and we are always grouping together, I love any spell that gives the group mana.  If you are so selfish that you don't see the benefit of how helping the group helps you, then so be it, but I'm not quite so shortsighted there.  The spell hasn't taken away from any of our combat abilities, and apparently it is going to be better than MC, so for the huge number of SKs that use MC regularly, this is going to be a significant help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Kyfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Bruuz and Thack, are you confusing Mental Horror and Ancient Bite of Chaos by chance? Because otherwise what you are saying doesn't make too much sense.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, but you compare it to MC (Mental Corruption), which is a proc buff and not to Zevfeer's Bite which is our 1 minute recast group hp/mana tap.<br />
<br />
Ancient: Bite of Chaos is an upgrade to Zevfeer's Bite, Mental Horror is an upgrade to Mental Corruption.  Both new spells are just a minor upgrade to the old and don't do anything to change our role.</div></div><hr />
