<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>VengerMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">hey guys,<br />
<br />
my guild is currently doing Ssra nameds and we are gearing up for Emp.  wondered if those who have already been through Ssra can offer input as to which type of DD works best against them?<br />
<br />
i am looking to augment my bane weapons and dont want to waste points on an augment only to find they resist it.<br />
<br />
i beleive the options are:<br />
<br />
125dd poison<br />
125dd magic <br />
150dd cold<br />
<br />
any input as to which they will likely resist the least?  i'm looking to specifically augment a weapon just for Ssra, so i'm not concerned with whether its the best all-around dd augment or whatnot.  my only concern is Shissar atm.<br />
<br />
thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tr0lls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">With all the decent sk 2h weapons that drop in ssra, you won't be wielding the bane weapon against the bosses for too long. blade of angels, blindfoe, cudgel of cowardly death, goldenrod, sword of ssra...<br />
<br />
 I don't recall any of the live ssra mobs being particularly resistant to anything, so the 150 cold dd would probably be best. Some of the mobs are undead and very highly disease resistant. Not sure if they're poison resistant too or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mnayar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Don't bother to Aug your bane weaps. Just swing and Lifetap his ass.<br />
<br />
On shissar, Spears resisted, Zev Bite resisted, Mental Corruption resisted.<br />
<br />
Lifetaps not resisted, Shroud Chaos not resisted, Fester sometimes resisted ( mostly not thou some are immune to snare )<br />
<br />
If you really wanna blow the ldon points gor a direct damage modifier thou honestly any augs on a bane weap that you will most likely only use for a month and then probable only once in a blue moon if you get Emp spawn is not worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Doing the Grey on my Shaman last night and I couldn't land a poison based anything on a Shissar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wyrdlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Shissar in the grey don't follow the same rules at shissar inside, they are much more resistant outside than even the Emp himself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vezax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Depend on which shissar you fight.  Most arent disease/poison immune in ssra, i think its only the shissar lich (near al), rhags and AL.  I know for xtc all our spells land fine and it one of the few fights in ssra I actually use spears, and watch them land for full about 90% of the time.  As for HP/EMP, im not sure, im tanking mezzing stuff usually.  And i still havent fought cursed cycle yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rothund</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">From what i recall, High Priest is poison immune... i'm not positive though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Numzaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I tried the epic on Emp, looks like consumption of Soul won't hit him :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>logbash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">For purposes of Emp, he is 100% completely and totally magic immune.  If you're augmenting a bane weapon just to increase damage vs Emp, I'd go with the fire based one for damage.  If you're looking to increase your ssra dps overall, I'd stear away from the lifetap one, as most of the &quot;undead flagged&quot; mobs in ssra will resist it 100%.  Stay away from the MR based ones too.   Just as other posters have said tho...Augmenting a bane weapon just for the extra dps from that...really isn't worth the AP.  Hold out til you get a good ssra 2hander, and augment that instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>lorddaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i love my blade of angles (got it a week ago), and i stuck a 50 point lifetap aug on it (cause i use it everwhere).<br />
<br />
i do not remember xtc or rhag's resisting that aug.<br />
<br />
with SCF 3, i love crit blasts from it.  SCF is worth the points in the fun factor alone. &lt;Klaumbazz Critial Blasts for (400)&gt;<br />
<br />
hehe<br />
debating wether to get SA3, or start going defensive..but that's for another topic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Only spell I could ever land on emp was the fire based dots.  I can get Zbite to land maybe 75 percent of the time.  Touch of Innoruuks lands.  Shroud of chaos does not land or MC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Elkar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">ToI is resisted on emp, not sure if that is what you meant, Inferna.  He's flagged magic immune.<br />
<br />
My guild is in Ssra now, 5 emp kills in, and all named (yay GRod dropped on first Cursed kill).  I haven't found anything to be particularly resistant, except Rhags to disease/poison, and Emp to magic.  Rhags are undead (not AL, though, iirc)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Nambkab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If I remember correctly, Cursed cycle had Zev's resisting, so I'd assume disease immune.</div></div><hr />
