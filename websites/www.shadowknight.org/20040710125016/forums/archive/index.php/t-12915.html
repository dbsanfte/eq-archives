<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kizzestra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been spontaneously falling to my death. At random times during play I have been experiencing &quot;position flux&quot; I call it. Where the game suddenly moves me 10' or so in a random direction and faces me North as though I had just zoned into the zone.<br />
<br />
This has recently caused me the following problems:<br />
<br />
I was in The Deep a few days ago with a full group near the invisible bridge when I suddenly died, even though I was sitting and medding and had been for several minutes, there was a hiccup on screen and suddenly the game said I had fallen to my death for 20k.<br />
<br />
The next day I was in PoV at Inner camp medding and I was suddenly transported to the GY alive and unharmed but with a message saying I had been underworld.<br />
<br />
Yesterday I was fighting in a hall in Ssra temple (fully enclosed, no where to fall) and I suddenly died, having fallen to my death again for 20k.<br />
<br />
Has anyone else been experiencing similar issues or am I alone in this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Erodalak Souleater</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I died zoning into Plane of Fire the other day for 20k.  Also my gf (druid) has died 3 or 4 times due to &quot;pain and suffering&quot;.  She's died in PoTranq, PoK, and the nexus.  Really odd thing.  As for falling through the world, I end up getting ported back to the zone's safe spot.</div></div><hr />
