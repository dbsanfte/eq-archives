<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dravok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Been away from everquest for the last 10 months and I am ready to start back up.  My old account is gone and looks like I'll be starting over new.  I have some questions before I begin though:<br />
<br />
1.  Since I have nothing to begin with nor know any friends who play the game, is it wrong to maybe buy a few pp off of sites so I can get some equipment or should I just start up with what I have and go from there?<br />
<br />
2.  I want to make 3 or 4 different characters on my account:  tank, a caster, a damage dealer, and maybe a healer.  Tank I want to go SK, yes I know SKs have been given the shaft as of late but I still love the class.  I was wanting some ideas for the other classes.  I was thinking rogue for the damage dealer, not sure on the other two.<br />
<br />
3.  My old SK had epic and was wanting to see if its worth trying to do it again.<br />
<br />
4.  I'm going human with SK, no flames about my choice of race please, but was wondering which god would be more of a roleplay feel to it, Bert or Inny?<br />
<br />
Thank for any help and flame away if you wish.  I've posted here before and have read others people's posts so I'm use to it.</div></div><hr />

1) Buying pp is always bad.  Don't feed the monster.<br />
2) I'd pick SK, rogue, enchanter, and cleric.  Although playing 3-4 characters on one account just means none of them will get enough time to progress past mediocre.<br />
3) SK Epic sucks at this point.  Only bother with it if you get some sense of pride from having it.  On a related note, Epics 2.0 are being introduced next expansion.<br />
4) I think Inny would be more fun for RP, mostly for interaction with dark elves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Howlitoezis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I used the newb no drop armor till around level 25 on my current SK.<br />
Threw in cheap crap like a chit belt, whatever i could find for a few hundred plat <br />
that gave me some AC and HP (and MR, as I'm on a PvP server.)<br />
Theres some LDON armour for like 150 points. Might carry you a ways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dravok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thx for the comments so far.  I'm really not looking at being some uber SK or any other class for that matter.  I'm just looking to enjoy a game, level at my pace, enjoy grouping, things like that.  A year ago I had the time to do that.  I would spent like 5+ hours during the week and god knows how much on the weekend just trying to be uber and getting things like epic and greenmist.  Now I'm just looking to have fun, enjoy group playing, and maybe get some nice drop every once in awhile.  <br />
<br />
Any thoughts on races for the other classes?  My only requirement is that they are not of the short side, i.e. dwarves, halflings, gnomes.  Nothing against them just personal preference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Marruk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">No real point in buying plat.  As was already mentioned, the newbie armor can carry you for a decent period, plus you can always earn a fair amount of plat in the course of your ordinary leveling; you just need to know what to look for.<br />
<br />
Read up on your tradeskills and find out what are the most popular paths to quick skill-ups.  Then find some tradeskill items used in those recipes that require low-level farming.  Farm them while you still get exp for it, and then sell it in the bazaar (assuming you have SoL).<br />
<br />
Animal pelts, spider/spiderling silks, swirling shadows, and many foraged items can make you enough plat to get some decent gear.<br />
<br />
Rumor has it that having your epic will make it slightly easier to get epic 1.5 or 2.0.  Given what a pain the current SK epic is, though, I'm going to risk doing 1.5/2.0 from scratch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kuvak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">1.

<br />
This is a question of individual consience... why ask a message board what is right for you to do? You should decide that for yourself.<br />
<br />
2.  I want to make 3 or 4 different characters on my account:  tank, a caster, a damage dealer, and maybe a healer.  Tank I want to go SK, yes I know SKs have been given the shaft as of late but I still love the class.  I was wanting some ideas for the other classes.  I was thinking rogue for the damage dealer, not sure on the other two.<br />
<br />
I would really suggest you consider only one character. Having 1 level 65 with 50 AAs is way way better than having 4 level 45s, and would take you about the same time (maybe even less). If you want versatility, just make that 1 character a versatile class, like a necro, that can do almost anything. The only way I would suggest you have more than 1 character (apart from mules) is if they are on different accounts so you can group them and multi-box, which is a viable option for some.<br />
<br />
3.  My old SK had epic and was wanting to see if its worth trying to do it again.<br />
<br />
I really would advise against that one unless the alternate route to getting Epic 2.0 ends up being much more difficult than the Epic 1.0 turn-in option that SoE has alluded to. I suggest just buying a bazaar weapon or two that have way better DPS output than the old epic.<br />
<br />
4.  I'm going human with SK, no flames about my choice of race please, but was wondering which god would be more of a roleplay feel to it, Bert or Inny?<br />
<br />
<br />
I'd probably say Inny, as was mentioned above.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dravok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Any suggestions for a server to start on.  I'm on the East Coast of the U.S. plus I'm not looking to play on PvP servers.  I wasn't sure if it made a difference but I thought I would ask.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>TelimTor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you startup on Druzzil Ro, give a tell to &quot;Rotlung&quot;.  I have lots of starter SK gear that has been sitting on my trader forever that I'd donate.  It's hardly twink gear, but it's better than bronze... :)  And I have my first 2-hander also, Blackened Alloy Bastardsword... heh.  Feel the power!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dravok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thx TelimTor.  I would hate to impose on someone to give me gear but if you wish to do so I would be most grateful.  I've decided also to not have so many characters and just have a SK and rogue because those two classes intrigue me the most.  Any ideas for race on the rogue.  I was thinking of either half elf, human, wood elf, or maybe barb.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thx TelimTor.

<br />
Barbarian will have the easiest time of it because he has the highest strength and the highest stamina, but being night blind is lame and I've always been a fan of shorter races.  Just pick which one you think looks the best and have fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Noctix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Thx TelimTor.

<br />
I have a barb rogue and sometimes it's hard to get her maneuvered around to the back of a mob when in tight quarters.  Illusion masks can help this but it might be easier to pick a small race from the start.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Arzakon420</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">1. Never buy plat, it only gives the ebay'ers a sense of overstuffed pride.<br />
<br />
2. SK, Mage, Ranger, Shaman.<br />
<br />
3. Only if you want to do 2.0. I'm level 65 and haven't even thought of beginning it.<br />
<br />
4. Cazic-Thule. Play an Iksar one and play a challenge.<br />
<br />
My own biased answers, of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Housedown</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'm really not looking at being some uber SK or any other class for that matter.  I'm just looking to enjoy a game, level at my pace, enjoy grouping, things like that.<br />
<br />
So you're telling us you want to buy plat so you can level at your own pace and enjoy grouping.  The only people who buy plat are people who want to level above their own pace and be as uber as possible.  So which is it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">No, he's asking if one should buy plat to start from scratch.  He doesn't know the current condition of the game, quality, prices etc.<br />
<br />
Better gear is available now for cheaper, just pure saturation.  good, cheap non level restricted player made armor (gothic, frosted. sandblasted) that will cost 100-250 per piece at most and last you until your 40's.  Plat is easy to come buy and if you hunt in areas with many tradeskill drops you level as you make money and waste no time on farming.  If you went through the steps to get and epic, leveling up enough to make desent money won't be anything to you and you'll feel more like you did it.<br />
<br />
If you wind up on Brell my friendly group of assholes is alway swilling to help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>kassdax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'd advise against buying plat simply because it's soo easy to make a ton of it in game.<br />
<br />
Levels 1-5, go kill spiderlings in Feerrott/Innothule Swamp/Everfrost and sell the silk for a small fortune.<br />
<br />
Levels 6-18, go to Kurn's Tower and collect/sell the bone chips for another small fortune.<br />
<br />
Levels 19-24 is East Karana time for spider silk. These also sell for a pretty plat or two.<br />
<br />
Level 25-30 you can take on greyhoppers in Marus Seru and sell the hides.<br />
<br />
Congrats, by the time you ding level 31 there should be a couple thousand plat in your bank account and several thousand plat worth of gear on your toon.<br />
<br />
Incomming biased opinion time for a damage dealer class. Magician, hands down. Not the highest sustained or burst damage but good enough in both areas to be fun. You'll also be a vending machine of goodies, have pretty good utility and can laugh at wizards when they go out of mana while your pet beats the stuffings out of mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Mages are like SK's - they're not bad at the low end, but they suck at the high end.  Non-scaling abilities (for them, pets) being central to your class's power sucks ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>kassdax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Mages pets at the high end do need a serious overhaul. As loud as mages are screaming though, we're due for an overhaul.<br />
<br />
Up through the elemental planes non-summoning trash mobs mages do fine. Granted necro's and beastlords are superior pet classes there but we're not fubar until GoD content.</div></div><hr />
