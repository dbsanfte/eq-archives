<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Blackmerlin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just thought i would start an OOW AA's Thread (not spell thread) overhere too, think there is only one at the SOE boards atm.<br />
<br />
Life Affinity  - provides a chance to receive Life from every spellbased DD or DoT (that isnt an lifetap already) equally to the damage done to the Target (Harmtouch excluded, innate and weapon procs included, damage shields included(possible?))<br />
 <br />
Life Affinity 1 (20AA) - 10% chance to receive Life equally to spelldamage done<br />
 <br />
Life Affinity 2 (20AA) - 20% chance to receive Life equally to spelldamage done<br />
 <br />
Life Affinity 3 (20AA) - 30% chance to receive Life equally to spelldamage done<br />
 <br />
 <br />
Theft of Life 4/5/6/7/8/9/10 - at 10 we should receive ToL healingbonus on every lifetap we cast<br />
This one could help to balance Lifetaps more to current highend content, where we should receive more selfhealing but not equally increase dps.<br />
<br />
<br />
I would like an AA line that scales with the new levels called Specialized Necromancy.<br />
 <br />
To start putting points in this AA you would need lvl 65, your class title and all casting AA's.<br />
 <br />
SN 1 would cost 10 AA and enable you to scribe and use all necromancer only spells up to lvl 9.<br />
 <br />
SN 2 (cost 10 AA) would require lvl 66 and enable you for all necromancer spells up to lvl 19.<br />
 <br />
SN 3 (10 AA) requires lvl 67 and gives access to all necro spells up to lvl 29.<br />
 <br />
SN 4 (10 AA) requires lvl 68 and lets you scribe and use all necro spells up to lvl 39.<br />
 <br />
SN 5 (10 AA) requires lvl 69 and lets you use the necro spells up to lvl 49. (after scribing)<br />
 <br />
SN 6 (10 AA) requires lvl 70 and maybe the next higher title for sk and would finally give you access to the necromancers spells up to lvl 59. (after scribing them)<br />
 <br />
Essentielly i dont think that would be unbalancing after checking all the necro spells up to 65.<br />
Most of them wont get used by highlvl necromancers and the few that could really be usefull like the necro root/mez/charm would mostly get used against mobs that are trivial anyways.<br />
It would be some fun toys to have and would not be unbalancing since all these tools did work nicely in composition with other classes when they were actual for necromancers.<br />
 <br />
The most benefit i could see in this would be the enabling of sks as a rez class by using essence emeralds like necromancers do, having an 'ok' pet at lvl 70 and being able to preslow undeads on pull maybe.<br />
A 720 point lifetap at lvl70 would be totally inline since i would expect to have a better lowresist lifetap (-500) at that lvl anyways.<br />
 <br />
AA's costs could be adjustet as powergain is visioned, maybe make it 10/15/20/25/30/35 it still would be nice to have.<br />
<br />
Soulslayer (toggle) - allows the Shadowknight to do half off his melee damage directly to the manapool of his opponent.<br />

<br />
Soulaffinity 1/2/3 (passive) - allows the Shadowknight to gain 25/50/100% of  the mana he takes from the enemie while using Soulslayer</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This is realistic, wow. I'm just not sure if ToL 10 or getting all the Necro spells up to the L 59 ones should be our main priority...<br />
<br />
There should be some base requirement of having the major AAs we are given currently before someone is allowed to suggest new ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Blackmerlin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I agree that there need to be tanking AA's to be aquired as well, but i always was an utility freak and will leave it to others to suggest these.<br />
<br />
Since i wanted this thread to be a start on the topic and on this board.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Good creative ideas Blackmerlin. They may need to be refined a touch, but the thoughts are in the right place (except the Necro spell book, Necros would go nuts).</div></div><hr />
