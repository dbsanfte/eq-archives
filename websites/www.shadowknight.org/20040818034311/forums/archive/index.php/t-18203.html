<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Habyoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i'm new to the boards here, retired from the game a few months back for playing almost 3 years with a wood elf ranger.  So i'm kinda looking to get that look back (cause plate on wood elves looks cool).  Has anyone done the crown of decieit quest?  I spent a good bit of time in lower guk today and bottomed out my dead frog faction but live frog faction is still scowls.  Has anyone done this as a noam sk? Any suggestions that could be offered i would be very thankful for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Paynreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Try a search - but be warned, you need to kill 5000+ dead frogs. I did, took forever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>VengerMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">did this recently as a DE SK (inny) just for kicks.<br />
<br />
here is the best advice i can offer, im not sure how well it will relate to a gnome.  i'd imagine a gnome will have an easier time than a dark elf though.<br />
<br />
1. go to Seb with friends and farm a Reet Crown.  this is likely the most difficult part for any SK as it cannot be done solo, so i did it first.  you gain +Frogloks of Guk by hunting the reets as well as the required quest item.  it drops about 1 kill in 50 in my experience.<br />
<br />
2. camp the Ghoul Lord in LGuk for his scalp.  i did this solo at 62 with little difficulty using mixed Cultural/Thurg/SS armor and Greenmist (the proc is an excellent source of damage mitigation against the green con frogloks).  took me 15 kills to drop it, and then it dropped again on the 16th, grrr.  guess that makes the drop rate 1 in 8 or so.  he was dark blue to me at 62, put up a decent fight against me when only self-buffed, but was easily overcome using Touch of Volatis, Bond of Death, and the occasional Leechcurse /disc to maintain my HP.<br />
<br />
3.  begin to farm the green mobs in LGuk for faction.  i didnt bother going near AM-Lord-Frenzy at this point, the loot is nicer but i only wanted fast faction kills.  i roamed from Bedroom through Ass-Sup to Cav-Sage-Exe, killing everything i came across.  a pet is a major source of DPS here, mine killed adds frequently without my assistance.  do this until your Frogloks of Guk could not possibly get any better.  dont even bother trying to complete the quest until you have reached maximum +Frogloks of Guk.<br />
<br />
4. go to PoK and Bazaar to aquire everything you need to finish the quest.  i refused to pay 700pp for wood elf parts (the price on MT skyrocketed once this quest came out) so i went to LFay and ravaged the ranger outpost.  took me 2min to get 2 parts. <br />
<br />
at this point i was ready to finish my quest but even when using the scalp the old froglok only conned kindly to me (warmly is required).  i experimented and found this remedy:<br />
<br />
5.  buy a Essence of Human (illusion: human potion).  do NOT waste time with illusion: froglok or illusion: guktan, neither will work.  i tested both personally.  human did the trick.<br />
<br />
use your potion, turn in the book to recieve the recipe, do the last combines and enjoy your new illusion: wood elf item. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>magget</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">With the above poster and what I found below, you should have enough to do the quest.  Heh, I may do it myself too.  I did the froglok quest but it is such a pain since it is only 1 charge.  Having to recharge the froglok illusion is a pain.<br />
<br />
<br />
First, find &quot;Sage Balic&quot; in the Plane of Knowledge. You can go through his  dialog if you wish, but if you want to get right to it, ask him &quot;What  magical mask?&quot; the Sage will then hand you a book. Arguably the hardest  part of the quest is getting your faction with the live frogs of Guk up. If  you haven't killed any before, than the quest will be that much easier. <br />
<br />
However if you have, you must kill the undead frogloks in Lower Guk or Frogloks in Old Sebilis until your faction gets to Warmly.<br />
<br />
Now, find &quot;an old froglok&quot; in Upper Guk. Hand him the book you received from the Sage, and you will get a recipe. Four things are needed to get the crown.<br />
<br />
1) &quot;Elf Essence&quot; which is made by combining, &quot;Wood Elf Parts&quot;, &quot;Dark Elf Parts&quot;, &quot;Celestial Essence&quot; and the recipe you received from the froglok, into a Mortar and Pestle.<br />
<br />
2) &quot;Reet Froglok Crown&quot; which is dropped by Froglok Reet<br />
Wizard/Knight/Shaman, who are found in the lower portions of Old Sebilis near Trakanon's lair.<br />
<br />
3) &quot;Vial of Purified Mana&quot; which is summoned/made by an enchanter with the &quot;Purify Mana&quot; spell. The enchanter needs to have 4 Ruby's and a Poison Vial while casting this.<br />
<br />
4) &quot;Velium Mastodon Fur Cloak&quot; which requires somebody with 250+ Tailoring skill, as it is NOT no drop, so you can have somebody make it for you. It is made by combining 4 &quot;Velium Mastodon Furs&quot; (dropped in Western Wastes off Mastodons), a &quot;Vial of Purified Mana&quot;, &quot;Platinum Thread&quot; and &quot;Cloak Pattern&quot;. <br />
<br />
When combined, you will receive the Velium Mastodon Fur Cloak.<br />
<br />
Now that you have all 4 items (Elf Essence, Reet Froglok Crown, Vial of Purified Mana, Velium Mastodon Fur Cloak) hand them to the &quot;an old froglok&quot; and you shall receive the Crown of Deceit, which now allows you to change into a wood elf!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Habyoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">are there any gnome SKs that have done the quest? i'm at amible atm and wondering what my faction will cap at</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>EdgeOfDetroit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'll second the above.  I have done this quest 3 times, but none of them with gnomes.<br />
<br />
Dark Elf/Shadowknight/Innoruuk - capped at Amiable, with scalp Kindly, with scalp plus good race illusion Warmly.<br />
Iksar/Monk/Cazic-Thule - capped at Indifferent, with scalp Amiable, with scalp plus good race illusion Warmly.<br />
Halfling/Druid/Karana - capped at Ally, no scalp needed nor illusion.<br />
<br />
I think the key is to cap your live frog faction and use the scalp if evil race and use a good race illusion, as the others have stated above.  Notice also that my Iksar monk jumped 2 levels of faction with the illusion (combined with the scalp) as opposed to 1 level of faction for the SK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Yaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Since you need 8 rubies for 2 vials of purified mana.  You can spend even more time in Sebilis getting + Frogloks of Guk faction hits along with the Reet crown camping.  I started off by collecting 8 rubies at B2 camp then moved to juggs are for reets.  By the time I left Sebilis I was amiable to Froggies.  The scalp dropped while I was doing AE groups in Lower Guk topping off my faction.  It can all be worked progreesive like so that it doesn't even seem like you're JUST camping faction.  Might as well get all the pieces along the way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zakton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Couple of questions, does the wood elf illusion have a faction modifier (aka I am more kindly to wood elves)?<br />
<br />
Secondly would froglok illusion by a 65 chanter help with the turn in?</div></div><hr />
