<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Arangar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone know / have a strat for soloing / duoing the report camps in seru for the veracity earring quests?<br />
<br />
The mob themselves are easy enough to duo with a slower / healer. But is there any way of avoiding the silly ammount of adds that tends to show up?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kormus the Dark Angel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The only class that could solo reports there reliably is probably a Chanter - and duoing is already very hard. You should be able to duo Eye and Shoulder but the rest is definitely still not a 'safe' duo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Carshail Shel'rac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Duoed them all with a 65 cleric.<br />
<br />
Set up camp in the first room on the left on the 3rd  floor. It's usually empty except in the Eye building, there's a spawn inside, just kill it, respawn is like an eon.<br />
<br />
If you're out to pull, stick to the wall. Gotta be careful there. Look carefully around the corner, target the mob as fast as possible and hit em with a spell, I don't recommend heavy nukes or you'll get summoned. Then run back to your camp spot as fast as you can, kill, proceed with the second mob. <br />
Getting mobs on the 4th level is easy as a SK. FD near the porter, hit it and look around for the roamer. If the floor is clear, stand up, hit the mob at the porter, port down and head to your camp.<br />
This is risky though, you might end up with an add.<br />
<br />
Only thing you really need is patience. Took me 1 week to get all reports. At least I made 3 AAs and lots of cash.<br />
<br />
Eye is the hardest building to enter.<br />
Heart by far the easiest.<br />
Shoulder really sucks.<br />
Hand can get messy because of Decurion Ralla, she sees invis and has a huge aggro range, she'll make mince meat outta you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dustwyrm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">How about the rarity for the reports? Shoulder dropped fast for me. I've been in hand building for the past few days and have gotten nothing :\ Haven't tried heart, but I did eye building with a few guildmates and got around 1 report an hour.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Carshail Shel'rac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Completely random imho. Heart took me 3 days of 8 hour camping, Hand 15 minutes and Eye 10 hours : / Shoulder dropped for me during Seru.</div></div><hr />
