<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am kind of curious about the new task system they are implementing. Any of you beta testers seen it yet? Anything good you are allowed to report?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There's something called an NDA.... anything that happens on beta, you're not allowed to report on.</div></div><hr />

...in a public forum.  <br />
<br />
Craoakk, you obviously do not have any friends on the internet.  Go sit in your room with the lights out and scratch your arms with that dagger you bought at ren-fest while listening to Morrissey.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Khat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">...you bought at ren-fest...<br />
<br />
I go to ren-fests, you have something against them?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ganlarg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">With the open beta they just started, there have to be thousands of people in it, and its not like they're going to track you down and kill you because you explained the task system...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">No, but I still think it's stupid to ask about it on a public forum.  It's not that hard to find someone in beta and ask them, if they're willing to share.<br />
<br />
And since it is mostly open, it's also not that hard to just join the beta and look for yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>brian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I go to ren-fests, you have something against them?<br />
<br />
...No  <br />
I have been to the Texas ren fest a few times...  it was a lot of fun actually.<br />
but i think its retarded to *buy* anything at ren-fest aside from food maybe...  when you can buy it beforehand or afterwards for much much much much much much much much much much much much much much much much much much much much much much much much much much much much much much much much much much much much much less money.  <br />
<br />
Regardless-- I was just teasing whats-his-name so don't take it so personally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>SuDanger68</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Don't think its against the NDA to talk about something you dont even test. (Didnt do the last full downlaod yesterday so maybe its in now)</div></div><hr />

did you have your balls removed recently sir?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hey Bri-Bri!<br />
<br />
Any luck getting a chubby woman?<br />
<br />
Peaches and Cream,<br />
<br />
Keevelkins<br />
<br />
P.S. you should come to the Bristol, WI Ren Faire (notice the &quot;e&quot; and the end?, it's for &quot;exciting&quot;) and take a gander at my cod-piece.</div></div><hr />

no luck  :(  and my g/f is not taking to my subliminal whispering that she should eat more pizza and ice cream.  <br />
<br />
I will not take a gander at your cod-piece.  Neither here, nor there, i do not gander anywhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">What do you have against Morrissey?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Dear brian,<br />
<br />
Morrissey once wrote a song called &quot;You're the one for me Fatty&quot;.<br />
I jerk off to it every time I'm flying a plane.<br />
<br />
Love Kee-Keev</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>DrakainShadescale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">In general, the lag sucks, some of the models look good, and beta buff character makes my real SK feel ubber :)<br />
<br />
There's really nothing to talk about yet except for a few of the easily obtain drops.  AAs haven't been released yet.  Judging on the past, I wouldn't necessarily hold my breath for the SK ones when they do.  I've just decided to enjoy my class for the fun element.<br />
<br />
Incedently, out of curiousity I tested to see what a 65 berserker was like.  They blow.  That's not really related to anything though.  Poor serkers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Vaclav</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Interesting that you tested a class that you can't betabuff....<br />
<br />
Or did they change that in the past day and a half?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Askeer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">those pictures were horrible brian.<br />
I hate you now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Manslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">You could always betabuff a zerker.  At least you could like almost 2 weeks ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Moonslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">God damn those pictures. And god damn the man who took them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Vaclav</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">You could always betabuff a zerker.  At least you could like almost 2 weeks ago.<br />
<br />
Shrug, couldn't for the first week or so while my wife was waiting on hers to have her /beta copied - she was trying every day, unless they turned it on and off throughout the days...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Perhaps they mean that you can betabuff a zerker on Test, but not in the OoW beta?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Vaclav</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Perhaps they mean that you can betabuff a zerker on Test, but not in the OoW beta?<br />
<br />
Good point, I did assume OoW beta - and checking on your hunch, /testbuff does work for Zerkers on Test server.<br />
<br />
Or maybe he borrowed a friends Zerker, not really clear either way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">This thread is supposed to be hawt pics of Ren girls (and ren guys for you ladies and non traditional males out there)<br />
<br />
Though we may branch into hawt comi-con girls (sorry ladies and non-traditional males, there are no hawt comi-con guys)</div></div><hr />

I think when I log in today Im going to refer to every warrior in my guild as a &quot;Non-Traditional Male&quot;.</div></div><hr />

That is their preferred, PC term these days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Morganti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Of course the good part of hitting a ren fest is women who are roleplaying as gypsies are notoriously easy to bang, and as a bonus they leave on their own.<br />
<br />
Fat girls are like mopeds, fun to ride as long as your friends dont see you.<br />
<br />
Slap em on the ass and call em a scurvy wench, they like that.</div></div><hr />
