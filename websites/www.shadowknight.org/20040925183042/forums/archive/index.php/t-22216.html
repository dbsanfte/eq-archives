<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Satist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'd do a search but am way too fucking tired for it, so  here goes:<br />
<br />
Is the GoD expansion worth buying for someone who solos more than groups? <br />
<br />
I mainly solo, due to short amounts of time to play, being in a guild that's falling apart (and yes, I am going to be going guildless fairly soon), etc... finding a group is a giant pain in my ass, however, if one happens along, I join. People have told me that LDoN is the way to go for xp, because I usually only have an hour and a half to two hours to play... but, they neglect how long the set up time takes... one nice day I was actually looking for a LDoN group for two hours, going from camp to camp, with no luck. At that point I said screw it, and went back to soloing. <br />
<br />
That being the case, a lot of the content in GoD I will not be able to see, after having read about the trials, etc. So, would it be worth it for me to go ahead and get the expansion, knowing full well that the main use I'll get out of it is the tribute? <br />

<br />
Its not worth it - IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Maicom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">GoD is not for &quot;casuals&quot; in my opinion.<br />
<br />
casual != non-raider.<br />
<br />
if your a &quot;hardcore casual&quot; you will get lots and lots out of GoD(casuals who are decked out in tak gear/hard ldon stuff/etc)<br />
<br />
here's a magelo of entirely 1 groupable stuff in GoD, without augs etc. Its a warrior profile cause im too lazy to do the same thing for an SK and i just found this on TSW:<br />

Entirely GoD Magelo (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1071587)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Leafweir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Unfortunately, solo you're not going to get alot. Natimbi is soloable and maybe a few other spots, but Gates is definitely more aimed towards grouping. It has a good chunk of content for good single groups though. A single group could in theory advance as far as Yxxta/Kod'Taz. Soloing however, you won't get very far, if you have money to burn though, the tribute effects are excellent for a soloer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Envoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">actaully, GoD, even if your not high end, can be extremely rewarding.<br />
<br />
the sewer trials have some very nice drops, as does Riwwi.  this is especially true if you have a dedicated group of friends you work with alot, as you could prolly manage to pull off some Vxed and/or Tipt trials, and farm up some gear that is VT quality and better.<br />
<br />
the augments alone make GoD worthwhile....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Oberyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">...there is very little in GoD for the soloer.   Theres a few places where you can solo for decent xp, but due to the nature of GoD mobs, its always risky.  They hit hard. A couple stuns or an LD guarantee trouble.  I have found PooP or Ykesha of far more value to the soloist, and I do a fair amount of soloing during the week.<br />
<br />
 BUT, If you have a good regular group, there is a lot to make GoD worthwhile, even just touching on Qinimi, Barindu, Riwwi, and Ferubi.  Augments, some nice weapons, and the odd very nice piece of armor.  Not to mention a replacement for the Fungi tunic with no negative stats and lots of HPs/stats.  Overall SK itemization is spotty, but theres a few high points here and there.<br />
<br />
Plus (always assuming a competent group) GoD is FUN.  Mobs are nasty, theres the lure of some nice drops, theres some good xp when you start mowing down the mobs quickly... its a challenge.   Tanking there as an SK is spooky though:)  Thus the fun factor.  Also, IMHO the mob graphics are the best part of GoD, theres some creative ones:)<br />
<br />
So for the soloist, not much, for the person with a group of friends, a challenge, is my take *shrug*  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Satist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Finally, I'm able to get back to this one... <br />
<br />
No, I'm not level 65. As a matter of fact, I'm slowly making my way (slowly) through the 30's right now (more solo then group due to time constraints, etc). I do, however have a few semi retired characters that are between 30 and 52, that I pull out and dust off from time to time... <br />
<br />
Honestly, when I posed this question, I was thinking just about the tribute, as I doubt I will ever have the proper level and/or the amount of time, to hunt in GoD, regardless. <br />
<br />
Edit:  I did leave my guild, as what use is it to be in a Guild where you have the tag, but no one posts on the boards, where you never see anyone, and without you in it, there are all of 37 members, most of which are alts?  Am I looking for a new one?  Nope, gonna go unguilded for a while, see if I can't make a name for myself when I do get to group. (was how I got in that guild, pickup group for LDoN, and the twink pally was impressed that I went thru mobs faster than he did, and me untwinked)<br />
