<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>soggin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Maybe this has already been posted elsewhere but.....Is it just me or am I fizzling about 5 times more than we usually do already? Seems this has just happened within the last couple of weeks. <br />
   The reason I noticed is because I was in the middle of moving and did not play for about 10 days.....round the 20th of May untill the 30th.....And in that time I noticed a DRASTIC increase in my SK's fizzle rate. Now my Spear line likes to fizzle 2-3 times in a row before it goes off as do my taps.... All of my casting skills are maxed or darn near maxed. I did a bug report on it (not like it is going to do any good). Anyone else notice the same problem lately?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Silku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've been fizzling a horrid amount for quite sometime.  I've noticed it since I got about 62, not sure once but streaks of fizzles.  Sometimes 4 or 5 in a row.   Maybe a weird coincidence, but since I've gotten my int above 250 the fizzles have lessened.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dakkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">A long time ago they did a patch to make spells fizzle appallingly, especially high level ones it seems.<br />
<br />
The general suspicion at the time was they did it to make their spell casting expertise AAs worthwhile.<br />
<br />
What's frustrating is almost all the spells people have memmed at 65 are too high to be affected by the AAs.<br />
<br />
I bought spell casting expertise level 1 to stop CD and fear fizzling, but the rest are worthless to me because they cover only spells up to level 58.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You needed to parse it before in the same zone and then parse it now int he same zone to make the determination. I think someone did a parse that showed higher INT lowered fizzle rates. So maybe you don't have kei+ or something, maybe you changed some gear that lowered your INT. Maybe the sky is falling, but to any end I haven't noticed it at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>NorrynNoir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i've noticed no change but second what was said about intelligence. if you get to used to fizzle rates when you have kei on, you'll think they are getting worse.<br />
<br />
that said fizzles really only are frequent on spells lvl 62+ and way to frequent of lvl 65 spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">This may also have something to do with people using Pact of Hate over Enchanter mana regen buffs. Lich regen spells don't add that extra +INT that KEI/Tranq/VoQ does. If INT gets checked for fizzles, then that would explain alot.<br />
<br />
Also, casting a L62 spell at L62 versus casting the same spell at L65 might play a part, although that is just a speculation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>soggin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think you misunderstood my question. lol As a young SK (56) I am used to fizzles and a lot of them. But I am talking about lately, like within the last patch or so, being more than it used to be. No change with or without KEI. Just mean more fizzles that we normally got before. I was out of game for about 10 days or so and a patch was put out while I was gone. I noticed a drastic increase in my fizzle rate after that patch. A few of my friends SK and non-SK alike noticed a difference also.</div></div><hr />

Parse it, otherwise we've all heard this same subjective opinion following each and every patch...</div></div><hr />
