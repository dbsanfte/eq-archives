<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>AkumaShreddies</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK, I am getting really bored. It is getting really hard to find groups at this level. I have read the sticky, but I don't know if I am just looking in the wrong spot. Does anyone know a good place to go for xp at 53 that groups are usally present?<br />
<br />
TIA</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kromglon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Im around the same level 54. The only place Ive had much success in pickup groups is LDON's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Androsulach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Pickup groups in PoJ as well as LDoN have kept me moving.  I just wish I had better luck getting grouped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Taeluuan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah it seems the good word about sk and aggro is lacking lately. At 61 I am finding a hard time getting groups. While playing an alt i suggested an sk (always ant to put a good word in) and the group leader asked me if an sk was any good.... I let him know and sk was in group not long after. I dont know maybe we have some sloppy sk's running around on nameless or not enough. Anyway good luck on it and when on an alt speak up for your fellow sk</div></div><hr />

 and when on an alt speak up for your fellow sk  <br />
I prefer them when I play both my druid and cleric. Even when the changes come out I will likely be taking SK's to tank in my xp groups over warriors of the same level, and since im usually primary healer it will be my choice.<br />
<br />
Thankfully I have a cleric friend that I group with normally on my SK. When you start the groups it gives you alot of say in who gets in...if im not playing tank its only cause theres a higher level SK in my group (usually another friend). I don't normally take warriors into my groups because they have that whole &quot;I have to be the tank&quot; attitude and it pisses me off to have to play that whole 'who can get aggro' game when I have more hp/ac and they can't stop mashing the friggin taunt button or switch out thier super proccing weapons. Its a waste of my mana as an SK and also a waste of mana for the healer. <br />
<br />
As an SK,I hate playing ping pong with a mob. As a healer, I hate having to heal an inferior tank just cause they are a 'warrior' with a complex...SK's will always have a spot in my groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kromglon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I seen a group today, cleric, enc, war, war, bard they wanted another warrior or paladin. I have no clue why a sk wouldnt do but thats what the fuck they wanted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gargar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Just wanted to relay a story. The comment about warriors and their &quot;i have to be the tank&quot; attitude reminded me of this. <br />
<br />
I'm finding the same thing.. just hard to find groups (or maybe a good group.. lol)  I was in POI a few nights ago. We had a great group. We were there a couple hours bangin away at the mobs. I was MT and had a BL pullin. Well the BL had to log, so we started looking for a replacement.  I started pulling and bein MT.  NO problems at all... had fun..  we SHOULD have stayed as we were BUT we ended up getting a warrior 3 lvls above me. (i wasnt group leader) He HAD to be tank cause he was higher lvl. His ac was only 20 or so above mine, it wasnt that big of a difference. SOOooo  i let him tank and i started pullin. (yes, he was whining about IMA WAR.. IM TANKIN)  I got initial agro from pull.. cd'd and taunted for a short bit to make sure that when he did get agro from me, it was solid, we generally did not have any problems. We weren't ping ponging back and forth..  I had solid control, then just gave it to him and let him have it when he could take it.  He told me NOT TO TAUNT...  i splained to him why i was doing what i was doing (and i do know what im doing.. lol) I said alrighty..  have it your way..   next thing ya know.. casters are scattering cause he cant hang onto the mob. Of course i go pull the mobs off and keep agro the rest of the fight each time it happens.   He got pissed... told me to tank and that he would pull.....  I said aiight.. go for it. Well, bastage pulls multiples..  4 i think.. gets folks killed.   All cause he was bitter and had an inferiority complex. Needless to say he wasnt in the group anymore. We filled the spot and continued killing. Me pulling and tanking. Never once had two mobs. Never had a mob go bash on a caster.<br />
<br />
<br />
I guess the reason i bring this up is not to say anything about my skills cause god knows i have MUCH to learn about being an SK. I bring it up more to say that our skills as an sk do spread. Okay, so what if a war has more ac and more hp. Fat load of good that does if casters get killed or healers always LOM from healing the multitudes of people that the mobs have bashed on....  I've seen a group or two where people in the group i  was in that night will make an SK tank over a war intentionally after that incident. <br />
<br />
Made me proud to be an SK.. <br />
<br />
Now why does it seem like the most egotistical, impatient,  self centered folks play war's.. lol   Not that there arent good wars out there, i have guys i group with regularly that are awesome war's. I think the difference is that they're a bit more patient to get agro.. hell i dont know..  rambling now in any case..    <br />
<br />
Just a story and a thought</div></div><hr />

<br />
ask your guild or everyone you know around your level to go to a zone not everyone goes to like the Deep and have a ball.  Soon you'll have a band of merry adventurers that goes wierd places, works well together and can generally handle slightly more thatier their leves and gear say they should.  It's fun while it lasts.</div></div><hr />

LDoN group. 57 sk(me) 60 war, 55 cler, 57 shm/wiz and 56 druid.<br />
<br />
I've read peoples grouping tales of woe, and had my laughs. I finally saw it at work last night. And, I had more laughs then ever.<br />
<br />
Cler &quot; who's tanking?&quot;<br />
Me &quot;you want to tank?&quot;<br />
Him &quot;you mean you want me to do my JOB&quot;<br />
me /t druid guildy in the group, when this game becomes a job, i'll quit.<br />
Me &quot;sure, tank!&quot; /tell to druid &quot;I love playing dps and kicking on atk and watching tv like wars&quot;<br />
<br />
I was pulling aggro off this cat after starting on the mob at 90% and at max melee range, I checked so often I missed a good number of swings. I believe, I took the least amount of damage, aside from the druid guildy, that entire adventure.(I tanked more then 1 add) Mobs were everywhere, it was just awesome. Halfway thru I started just pounding the hate list at the beginning of a fight, so he told the cleric not to heal me or some such nonsense, so the shm kept healing me with that slow/snare piece of shit in the middle of fights.<br />
<br />
Damn, it was great how he took offense to someone suggesting I tank! I had him by 800 hp and 200 ac unbuffed.<br />
<br />
After that, I was very much happy to see my normal group on tonight.</div></div><hr />
