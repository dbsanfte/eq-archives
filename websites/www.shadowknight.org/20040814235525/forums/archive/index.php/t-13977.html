<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grimskayle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I have that Axeroths Belt of Defense atm (20ac 15str 15wis). It's nice and all but lately I have been working on getting my hp higher, and most of my gear has hp on it, except for my belt slot. I was wondering if I should stick with this belt, or if there is a better belt out there that has more hp on it that would be a better option. Is defense belt not that great really?<br />

Only killed him once myself but others in the group said the belt wasn't too uncommon of a drop. The mob is a 'growth' type mob: he starts out as one mob and grows every 24 hours (i think) into a new mob, last version being 'a restless burrower' If any of the earlier versions are killed he starts over at step 1.<br />

edit:not sure if you were looking for droppable items, if so ignore :D</div></div><hr />
