<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nasiir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">On a Fire clearing last night, I ended up in the same group as a partially ep geared sk. He was chain casting Aura of Darkness on every mob. I asked if it really needed to be cast, as I'd much rather get in the FA rotation, and he proceeded to tell me how crucial it is - great debuff on mobs, very helpful resists for group. Later that night, he was telling me how great his dps was, referencing a 300'ish per tick number for dots. It turns out, he was casting 5 dots. So 6 of 8 spell gems were dots and aura of darkness.<br />
<br />
The next day, I made sure to expand the Shadowknight Guide in the knight area in our guild forums to include some information on Auras and the value of SK dots, but I think it might be a good idea to create a spell FAQ if we have a veteran who is willing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Menon Lifeblight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Your friend is an idiot.  Mobs have 50 debuff slots and he (as a SK) was taking up 6 of them.  Somehow I think the shammies and necros on your raid could make better use of those slots.<br />
<br />
AoD = fine if your group can afford the buff slot.  I always ask before casting.  Resisted a lot.  Debuffs a whopping 10 to each resist.<br />
<br />
BoH = good.<br />
<br />
Any other SK DoTs = waste of a debuff slot, mana, and melee damage lost to casting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I can think of a better use for at least 5 of those spell gems, and potentially 6 depending on the enemy being fought.  300 damage a tick in dots looks nice, but how much swing time is he sacrificing for this damage?  How many of the dots are lasting their full duration and getting their full efficiency?  In short, Menon is correct, your friend is an idiot who doesn't know what he's talking about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grarg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">AoD may only be a small amount of debuffing, but with my sham alt, 99% of the time AoD allows me to slow without worrying about malos first which saves several thousand points of dmg.<br />
<br />
Maybe less viable in a raid situation where you have tashers and malosiniers, but *shrug*<br />
<br />
Very hard to tell with streaky dmg but i do believe that AoP and AoH have a significant debuff effect on mobs when tanking, at least the combination of the increased AC and Atk seems to make my SK significantly better at tanking the mobs in solro. Im a bit sensitive to this cause my healer is a sham so small differences in mitigation make a noticable impact on healing.<br />
<br />
From my observation the two seem to be more effective than cripple.<br />
<br />
Laters all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hmm... I might try Aura of Darkness with the new shammy slow from GoD and see if I can get by slowing without malos on the pull.. that would rock. :)<br />
<br />
I thoguht they recently upped the number of dots that can be on a mob? Didn't we just see that in a patch message?  If they double it from 50 to 100 or so, should be plenty of room for the shd's 6 or however many dots.<br />
<br />
-Bolas</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grarg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">but cant remember the detail.<br />
<br />
I do know that when I attend ar a sk on raids i feel a little useless. Cant offtank the adds, cant heal and have rather low dps by the time you run around and try and get in melee range.<br />
<br />
but i spose thats cause i am often two boxing.<br />
<br />
Great duo group though. SK + sham are fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Maicom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">it's being upped to 50 in the patch right now, it was 30.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nasiir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Actually, I was really hoping this to informally petition vets (B, slein, window, silvir?) to start a spell FAQ, which we could associate with the complete spell list (as we have for AAs, for instance).<br />
<br />
The example to illustrate the need for it, ie- it seems many average SKs have no idea what they are doing and could REALLY use the guidance.<br />
<br />
*edit, I never said the sk was a friend, only a guildmate. all of my friends know their stuff.*</div></div><hr />
