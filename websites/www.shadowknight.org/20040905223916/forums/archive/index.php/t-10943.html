<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Moltenfists</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Why the gnome hate, i understand the &quot;twinking idea&quot; and thats old and played out, did you hate iksars as much? all those iksar monks and SK running round people hated for so long and you all defended yourselves.<br />
<br />
i notice a lot of those SK are iksars the eternal twink race.  why hate on a class that basically has taken your spot of the whipping hourse?<br />
<br />
those who livein glass houses.....<br />
<br />
<br />
also i started a gnome SK  she be hella pimp and hella mean looked at the troll, lets face it they are ugly as all hell, iksars are cool but i liek the plate look, ogres, please don;t get em started om how retarded they look.  humans, those where a maybe but since i got a 63 human monk from release of EQ why nto try a different race.  wow look somehting new a gnome.<br />
<br />
you can't hate a race of  SK just cause your to ignorant to see what your doing. don's hate  celebrate the gnome wielding the IC will sure as hell know just as much about being a SK as the troll that was twinked up last week.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Soulstar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">not only that, but iksar are by far the least twinkable race in the game due to armor restrictions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. fungi<br />
2. COF<br />
3. noc blade or ebon mace<br />
<br />
look there is 3 items that you can toss on an iksar that you can PL to 50 in no time, hell i did it one weekend when i got bored.<br />
<br />
Gnomes just suck... deal with it. There's nothing remotely 'evil', 'scary' or 'foreboding' about an overgrown prune with hair running around like a Chucky doll on crack. <br />
1. chucky is scary<br />
2. gnome necros and SK live in the mines and in a deep hole where they had to adapt to the darkness.  what you got humans? who just are everything?<br />
3. who says SK have to be foreboding or scary? who says you can;t just play some skill of the class and look good while doing it and NOT want to get a shrink every zone or take up uneeded space.<br />
The only Iksar twinks you see in mass are Iksar monks other Iksar Class combo's are much rarer <br />
monk = tons because they are far better than human monks.<br />
warrior= i see tons of them because of increased AC and regen<br />
shaman = regen tossed in and good looks<br />
necro = regen and iksars are MADE to be necros<br />
SK = you kidding me i see 20 of these running round LOIO every day.<br />
<br />
the rest? if there are any, your right  but so are human bards and wood elf rogues or human rogues.<br />
<br />
<br />
face it you just wanna be trandy and hate on a new race combo because you want to be a gnome.  granted i will say a troll SK looks good and mighty tough  and my choice was between troll and gnome and i play a female, and female trolls are ugly as hell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Soulstar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I didn't say iksar weren't twinkable, I said they're the least twinkable.  Here's 10pp, buy a clue.<br />
<br />
And Fungi/CoF are not exactly common items your average gn0me twink has, so your point is invalid.<br />
<br />
Also: Gnomes look nothing like chucky.  Chucky is scary.  Gnomes are appetizing.</div></div><hr />

Sure there are a million twinks of every class combo in Loio etc but how many hold strong to that toon not very many. My guild only has like 4 Iksar's that are mains a Shaman, Shadow Knight and two Monk. That's right all our other guild monk's are human.</div></div><hr />

Only thing worse then a gnome SK is a halfling paladin.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kushpok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">So my main is a grandmaster tinkerer...  I decided to make another alt to model Clockwork gear since there are basically no gnome plate wearers in my guild (My first plate gnome alt is a warrior, which is fun, but gets boring after a while in the lower levels), and it's nice to be able to make high level gear for myself; similarly, it isn't much fun to make gear, and sit around as a wizard saying &quot;Wow, nice gear.  And nobody wants it, and I damn sure can't use it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Anyway, being a gnome is fun.  I'm not going to say that being a gnome makes me TEH UBAR1337 M4574H!~!!!11!111 or a better shadowknight than anyone else.<br />
<br />
I will say being an intelligent player (you can choose to dibelieve that qualifying description, I don't care) makes me good at any class I play.<br />
<br />
Anyway, fun stuff with the Clockwork Vambs:  best price for a class 5 mana battery is 52.5pp<br />
<br />
One right click of haste lasts 20 minutes, tops.  A vambrace holds 10 charges per battery.  200 minutes/52.5pp = just under 4pp a minute.<br />
<br />
This is assuming that you aren't farming batteries in PoI.  But still...  Farming just ONE stack of batteries in PoI takes a damn long time.<br />
<br />
While I'm certainly biased about gnomes as a race, I don't see anything wrong with em as any particular class.  Of course, I also think us gnomes are delicious and indulge in cannibalism at every possible opportunity, so maybe I just want more possible targets for my drooling, gluttonous desires.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'm sorry so many of you hates us gnomies.  I shall do what I can to reinforce that hate by being the mostly disgustingly twinked shadowknight out there to help pass the time and explore LoY. <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Dios Hyaenae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">You might hate me, and that's okay. But Bertox is giving you the clap.<br />
<br />
Hehehe, one of the better sig lines I've seen</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Rikkar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">kushpok you did a bit of math wrong, if 1 mana battery (52.5pp) lasts 200 minutes, thats .2625 pp per minute, not 4.something (52.5/200 not 200/52.5).   Sorry that just happened to catch my eye, continue your pointless flaming everyone :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kushpok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">pffft  trolls can't do math!<br />
<br />
But yeah, it was late and I screwed my math up.<br />
<br />
Anyway, even at that rate, you require a steady looting rate of around 2pp every five minutes while soloing to break even on your expenditure on batteries.  Solo someplace like PoV or PoS?  Hope you get lucky on drops for vendor sploof or tradeskill stuff to /bazaar off.<br />
<br />
And remember, buying a stack of class 5 batteries costs just over 1kpp.  Having guildies who hunt in PoI save their batteries helps, assuming they don't use them *waves at everyone with a GVD*<br />
<br />
GVD is a right click invis item by the way.  If you were going to ask.  I've answered your question prematurely, which is not realted to immaturely.<br />
<br />
So the bottom line is:  the Vambs are nice.  The boots are nice (right click +30 dex, stacks with focus and stuff).  The rest of the right clicks all kind of suck for shadowknights.<br />
<br />
Are those two right clicks nice to have?  Damn straight.  Am I going to get a group over other shadowknights for being a gnome?<br />
<br />
Are you fucking high?  Of course not.  I'll get groups because people know me to be a good player, assuming shadowknights are out there getting groups at all  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Eatbugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">did you hate iksars as much?<br />
<br />
Yes, still do.  Handbags.<br />
<br />
Dark elves?  Little poofs who think staggering around in plate and knowing a cute necro chick makes up for being weak. They're probably all Bards in disguise.<br />
<br />
Ogres?  Dumb as rocks, and about the same personalities.  You can't stun Ogres, mostly because hitting the one spot with a brain cell underneath it is impossible.<br />
<br />
Gnomes?  Diseased, disgusting little perverts whose ultimate outcome in life is to become gnome kabobs.<br />
<br />
Seeing a pattern here? ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
Eatbugs, Troll Reaver.  <br />
The only REAL SK race.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kushpok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Yeah, trolls got their asses beat by some amphibians.  They're certainly terrors of the night!  *snicker*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Eatbugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">*grin*<br />
<br />
Good, you're getting the idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Magus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Look out! A Shadow Knight!!!<br />
<br />
oh wait, it's just a gnome....<br />
<br />
Here's the deal. Gnomes could be warriors or necro's, so some BRILLIANT person got the idea that if they can be one or the other, then why not both?<br />
<br />
Terrible. Same situation with Halflings and rangers.<br />
<br />
gnome stats pretty much suck (unless your a magician maybe), and whoever worte this thread: gnomes are NOT pimp in any way, shape, or form.<br />
<br />
Besides, a class that is the quintessance of evil is NOT manifested in the gnome.<br />
Iksars....not the best race, but not horribly bad. Humans (in my opinion) are worse.<br />
<br />
Trolls/Ogre's great stats, bash, terrible looks. I wouldn't be them for the size and horrid faction/home cities problem. <br />
<br />
If you ask me I'd say Dark Elf, Troll, Ogre, Iksar, Erudite/Human, other races.<br />
<br />
Really all the races have checks and balances to make them pretty much equal, except for the gnome. pure crap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Paynreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Faction problem? Bad looks?<br />
<br />
What, you think something evil should be pretty?<br />
<br />
I love being an Ogre. I get to slaughter everything in sight and look straight outa hell while doing it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kushpok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Yeah, listening to all you oversized jackasses covered in shoe polish really makes me think less of myself as a shadowknight.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, i'm a dark elf and have no physical prowess!  I'm such a common race/class combo, you can just call me Inkie Shadowknight_01, King of the generic evil combo!  Look at my incredible ability to look like the vast majority of all the other shadowknights out there!  We're so common the epic is named after our god!  Hooray.  Go on, try to distinguish us from the thousands of others just like us- it can't be done!  Don't even try to remember who I am, because it's pointless.  I'm the same as that inkie over there, and that one over there, and that over there, and sweet hatred almighty, that one over there!  Even I am stunned by the lack of differentiation between us all!&quot;<br />
<br />
I could go on, but blathering like a bland shadowknight is starting to take its toll on me.  I can only hold onto such a lack of individuality for so long before I begin to want to pound my face in with a truncheon.  Oh, go ahead and say something like &quot;Go ahead,&quot; or &quot;I won't stop you&quot;- taking such an easy retort will surely make you look cool!</div></div><hr />

Hell yes time to make a new Gnome SK.</div></div><hr />

No.</div></div><hr />

<br />
/rude to all the blimps out there :D<br />
<br />
Seriously, 2 very good reasons<br />
1. exp bonus, i just dont have time to play as much as i'd like, i do have work and stuff :(<br />
<br />
2. clockwork armor, we all know SK's solo til VERY high levels, can't beat the clicky buffs. Not to mention the revamped observer armor has superb stats also.<br />
<br />
P.S. gnomes make excellent shadowknights because we are the most hated, even by other shadowknights :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Aaoogaa Soulhunter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">gnome stats pretty much suck  <br />
<br />
Just wanted to point out that 'nomes have better starting stats than dark elves.<br />
<br />
As for the Ogres out there...<br />
We ruled EVERYONE.  If it were not for the pretender gods having to combine their meager power Rallos Zek's children would to this day hold sway over you.  How pathetic for weak gods like Cazic and Inny to ally with the likes of powerless dreamers such as Tunare and Karana.  Most of us were striped of the great knowledge we once had.  Many have forgotten our downfall at the hands of traitors, but the ones that recall the old ways are we the few TRUE Shadowknights.  Rallos Zek's rage burns within us and we will again rule Norrath...<br />
<br />
Ok I'm done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Magus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Hey, if you're into the ugly oafish ogres/trolls then who cares???<br />
<br />
&quot;Better to be ugly and alive than a pretty corpse.&quot;<br />
<br />
As far as DE SK's being a dime a dozen: true, but bear in mind that when players pick a gnome for the race as an SK the reasoning is almost always &quot;because I wanted something new and different&quot;<br />
<br />
You gnomes are not breaking the mold, just fitting into another one.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Uglugg Bloodsbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Gnome Shadow Knights are like Rabid Poodles: Funny at first but get annoying extreamly fast.<br />
<br />
As for the Frogs taking over Grobb:<br />
<br />
1: They attacked when all the Warriors, Shaman, Shadow Knights and Beast Lords were out hunting down the Broken Skull clan. Defeating the old, sick and children of a city is in no way impressive or hard. <br />
<br />
2: They had the backing of the Incest Twins power, bet all those Frogs celebrated their victory by humping their sisters.<br />
<br />
If the pathetic Frogs had attacked with out the Incest Twins help or when our real fighters were in Grobb not only would the Frogs have been defeated but we would also have gone into Guk and any other Frog home and exterminated them all.</div></div><hr />
