Pesky Ranger snares overwrite our low level snares I use for aggro.<br />
<br />
IF a ranger has cast his pesky snare, and my lower level snare does not hold, does it still generate the same aggro? or do I need to cast a bigger snare to over write his snare?<br />
<br />
I had assumed it would not generate aggro if it could not hold, but it looked like it did the other night (hard to tell some times with all my procs and such).<br />
<br />
Probably obvious to the vetern Knights out there, thanks in advance from this young Ogre learning to bring terror to the masses.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Makkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">spells that are resisted generate slightly more aggro anyway. i think &quot;would not take hold&quot; is the same, but i wouldnt stake my life on it..<br />
<br />
anyway cd aggro generation with &quot;cannot take hold&quot; is at least as much as if it had landed, so no worries</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">May lose the additional aggro due to the damage the dot causes to the mob, but that aggro is rather small compared to the snare effect anyways... consider it negligable.  Clinging is a great aggro tool even if the mob is already snared.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The thought of a Ranger interfering with mah aggro, made me want to sacrifice 100 Wood elves and kill their banker.<br />
<br />
Hmm, Maybe Doog do that anyways to honor these fine posts,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>NorrynNoir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">you'll actually learn to like ranger snare since it means at higher lvls you can keep up just CD for aggro and don't need to use a higher powered one for actual snaring.</div></div><hr />
