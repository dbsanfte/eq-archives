<br />
I was looking for someone to comment on SCF3 + SA3 + Theft3 to see if it really was all that and a bag of chips.<br />
<br />
How often do the spell and theft crits go off, is the double crit ultra rare or common at all?<br />
<br />
Thanks, after my abortive cf path, I am re-evaluating my path.</div></div><hr />

I dont have numbers, but you get like 1-3 &quot;390&quot; for 10 procs.<br />

Double crits are rare tho, but still you can expect to see several ones per week.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's more healing for you, and more dps at the same time.<br />
<br />
If you have SCF3 it's even more gravy, you'll be busting off 300 pt crit's all day.<br />
<br />
Toss in TOL and you have the potential for a mana free 600 point heal.  With ToL  at lvl 2 I *occasionally* have a critical blast stack with a critical heal at the same time.  I imagine that with ToL 3 it would happen much more frequently.</div></div><hr />

probably cause yo uknew where it was already anyway. search features give you back like 100 results majority of the time none of them are what you want, so it is faster and easier to post a topic get a response and let it fall into obscurity.<br />
<br />
then some &quot;high and mighty&quot; wiz kid decides ot post the &quot;use your search button&quot;  and it works one out of five times i used it.<br />

<br />
Right.  Now, using the searching skills I learned in third grade, the keyword search works like this:<br />
<br />
&quot;Soul Abrasion&quot; and SCF3 and Theft<br />
<br />
Ooo look.  3 responses, 2 of which are highly detailed and informative threads.  That search wasn't intuitive enough for you?<br />
<br />
STFU and do some research before you open your mouth.</div></div><hr />

Okay, I'll dumb this WAY down for you, becuase apparently you got lost on the last set of directions.  I even included pictures to help you out.<br />
<br />
step 1<br />
<br />
Scroll back to the post where I told you the EXACT GOD DAMN KEYWORDS TO USE.<br />
<br />
Copy<br />
<br />
http://students.washington.edu/millardr/eq/step1.jpg<br />
<br />
step 2<br />
<br />
Scroll up to the top of the page.. find the search key.  Its the one with the word &quot;Search&quot; on it.<br />
<br />
Click<br />
<br />
http://students.washington.edu/millardr/eq/step2.jpg<br />
<br />
step 3<br />
<br />
Assuming you've made it this far, just paste the text you copied from text one.  Do I need to slow down and use smaller words?<br />
<br />
http://students.washington.edu/millardr/eq/step3.jpg<br />
<br />
step 4<br />
<br />
Perform Search.  If I need to explain this step to you, please shoot yourself now, and save our future generations the grief of dealing with your offspring.<br />

Picture included anyway... I expect you'll need it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wildize</div><div class="date">02-05-2003, 02:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Search function is not broken, the searcher is.exact wording you needHe gave you the wording. Doing the search for &lt;&quot;Soul Abrasion&quot; and SCF3 and Theft&gt; gives exactly 3 posts - not sure where the meltdown is occuring, but it is not in this search. Clearly you are going off the deep end - you might want to step back and realize he is not only trying to help you (and others), but he is also right about using the Search function - regardless of if you like to hear it or not.<br />
<br />
Asking to have the same info posted, AGAIN, for you personally because you can't search for it may seem easy to you, but it contributes significantly to board noise, and actually makes it harder for those looking to do their own research. Keeping the noise ratio down is good - or would you disagree? If the info is already posted on these boards, how exactly is it easier to post a new topic on it and wait for people to respond?<br />
<br />
If you just have issues using search engines, studying this example will probably help you in EVERY web search you do. Using lame search parameters makes for posts saying, &quot;it's broke you fool,&quot; rather than getting on with your business.<br />
<br />
Edit: dammit, hate posting at the same time the_artist_02 posts above you :(. Mine may not have the helpful pics (ok, at least one of them is helpful), but then again, it doesn't have the attitude level either~</div></div><hr />

<br />
either way this whole thread coudl have been avoided if you woulda simply linked to the fucking thread or the search and just STFU and not be a little bitch like you are anyway.<br />
<br />
but instead assholes like you wanna feel fucking special, so WTG you feel special, and the sad thing is you got a picture of a nake army guy and then had to block out the cock......no comment on that at all.<br />
<br />
might i add while using the words you choose<br />
&quot;Soul Abrasion&quot; and SCF3 and Theft<br />
you get those three posts<br />
while using his<br />
SCF3 + SA3 + Theft3 <br />
or spelling those words out, or using ANY other compbo then the one you foudn to work will yield either a hge search, such that i found or a no match search.  so again i say search feature  sucks when if you have a community of people with a god damn common curtosey assuming this is not the sullon zek boards that you simply awnser it and let it die.<br />
<br />
cause i know i held a gun to yoru head to read or post on this thread you fucking twit.<br />

Using + in this engine doesn't do jack for you that I can tell - same as using a space. Note that the handy helpful hints there don't say anything about + signs, but they do mention spaces, the logical operators, and *. Pretty basic search options really...<br />
<br />
However, it doens't make much difference in this case. To be honest I can't figure out what combo you used of those AA skills to get your results! I used different combos of SCF* or SCF3, Soul and Abrasion, and Theft or Theft* or TOL* - always get between 1 and 5 posts (including this one LOL). SA3 doesn't work at all since it is less than 4 letters - did you just remove it from your search completely? Even when I did a search with 'SCF* and TOL*' I only get 16 posts - I guess it is too much to ask for you to look through that many titles? Even worse still, if you look at the 'huge' list of results you got in your first search picture, the majority of those posts look dead on for this topic, probably giving you more perspective on the question than the narrow search Az did - what else do you want?<br />
<br />
ps. the sad part of this post is that you think that picture is the saddest part of this post...</div></div><hr />

I can see why these boards have gone to shit since the knightwatch (which I only trolled) went down. Far too many arseholes who would rather jump on someones back for asking a question, than answer and discuss it. For the slow of thought; he was asking for peoples opinions on it, i.e. whether they found it as useful as other skills they had.<br />
I would also point out that 1 of the 3 responses returned was in fact this thread. I would say that he is looking for examples and opinions on when this combination saved someone or worked particularly well.<br />
Honestly, the Rangers may whine, but no one bitches as much as the SK trolls in the random feeding frenzies that pop up when a new player wants to discuss something. <br />
Some of you guys want to get a grip, this kind of behaviour is probably a good reason why we don't see many informative posts and strategies from the high end SKs - just a bunch of pointless flamers and bandwagon jumpers.</div></div><hr />

All that effort you expended trying to make your point.... posting pictures, 3 paragraph dissertations on why someone should use the search function....<br />

Would have been a whole lot less effort just to answer the man's question.... or *GASP*  ignore the gawdamned FRIGGIN POST!!!<br />
<br />
Oh and BTW.... Did the Army guy come out of your own collection?? Bet you didn't have to use the search function for THAT<br />
<br />
<br />
OK now my advice...<br />
<br />
I am thinking more and more that Soul abrasion might not be the way to go myself.  I just hit 18 AA so now I have the Class AAs available to me, and I have been asking myself... how often do I use the life taps???  Hardly ever, I usually have mental corruption going so I can keep my mana up while pulling/soloing.  In raids with AE, I could see more use for SA as it helps the healers stay focused on the MA, but the day to day grindage SA seems a little pointless, especially with mobs in PoP hitting for 300+.  <br />
<br />
     Granted, my dex isn't maxed so maybe I am not seeing as many procs as I could, but I am leaning towards some of the other meat and potatoes type AAs (combat agility, ND, etc etc).  SA seems to me to be the &quot;frills&quot;, and while I may throw the first 3 AA into it since that is rather a cheap price to pay for adding 25points of damage to my procs... it will be awhile before I max out SA.  Just my opinion, and just the way I want to spend my AA.  I am a big fan of SCF, and would highly reccomend maxing that out (I have 2 levels so far), as I feel this is a better skill to max first as it effects every damage spell that we have, and especially Harmtouches with UT (drool).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rezzbagg</div><div class="date">02-05-2003, 10:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If the search function doesn't work how did you get that screenie? I agree that sometimes the search function isn't all it's cracked up to be, and you have to be creative to get the information you seek, but how dumb are you to post a screen shot of the very thing you just said isn't there?

<br />
You'd notice I didn't flame the original poster at all.  I just suggested that he use the search function to look up a topic that has been discussed signifigantly before.<br />
<br />
The flames didn't start till &quot;moltenfists&quot; started spouting dumb shit like &quot;The search button is broken&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
The point is... these boards are flooded with a lot of posts asking questions that have been asked 2 dozen times.  I think we'd be well served to educate members to use the search tool, to access a LOAD of information.  I can't remember the last question I posted in the general forum, because most answers are a search away... (and you don't have to wait for people to respond).  Since TKW, the single-to-noise ratio on these boards is pretty low.  Do you really think telling people to look it up for themselves is such a gross violation of moral code?<br />
<br />
Do I think this board should be a useful place for asking questions? yes<br />
Did I tell the original poster to STFU AND SEARCH? no<br />
<br />
Really, I think suggesting that he search for an old thread provides a LOT more information that I ever could with a &quot;2 line answer to the guy's friggin question&quot;.<br />
