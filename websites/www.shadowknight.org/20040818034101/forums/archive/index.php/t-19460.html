<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'd been gearing towards replacing the functionality of my War Crested Ring (ID4) with Anger of Druzzil / ID2 augs via LDoN so I can get a higher hp ring.  I'm not ST/VT/elem geared and in a small family guild.<br />
<br />
The 10th ring has always been looked upon by myself as unattainable; likely as I recall the early days on Prexus when we had 70 - 100 peeps on the ringwars and still failed.  And since the day of the very first successful 10th ring on the server (after a half dozen tries); I've only helped once or twice in subsequent rings and so I'm out of touch on what it takes nowadays.<br />
<br />
I have two questions:<br />
<br />
1) Are there still stacking issues with dru/shm regen and some atk buffs?  I suppose that even if there are, one could just run out and get an 8th ring to use as DS/clicky instead of the effect on the 10th if it's overwritten.<br />
<br />
2) Does the person doing the final ring turn-in (9th ring + head) have to be the one who initiated the war?  Let me clarify: we are short on tankage (our guild + small alliance) where we probably can't afford to have me standing back with the seneschal doing nothing.  Two of us have our 9th rings and plan to do the 10th; so if the other person (a BL) turns in his 9th ring/dirk etc to initiate the war and control the hero's etc. (allowing me to run around and tank waves, etc.), can I loot Narandi's head and do the final turn ins for the 10th ring?  If so, that means the BL can do the turn in next time and loot the head for his turn in.  Would this work?<br />
<br />
I realize the 10th ring isn't terribly uber these days, and that the ringwar is trivial for elem-geared guilds but this is prolly as good as I'll get for a finger slot.  I figure we can come up with at least 24 peeps -- avg lvl 64, hopefully 30 or so but will be light on tanks.  Doable?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wretchedness</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hi Klotar, this is Shoibhus =)<br />
<br />
24 - 30 people, you will be hard pressed after the first hour.  My current guild has averaged 30 - 40 with around 50 being the highest count and we failed, just not enough tankage.<br />
<br />
Like you, the most successful raids I have seen are with 70+ people.  That seems to still be the magic number.  This is still a situation where numbers are more important than levels.<br />
<br />
Send me a tell and I can see if I can muster some folks for ya.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KlaoofQuell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My ring war had 63 people, mostly 60+. Key to success is know what you are doing, and get other people that know what they are doing to lead groups. We did not  lose 1 coldain hero with my strat and info that other folks posted that I have linked below. Lemme tell you though, leading a raid this nerve-wracking more than once will make your head explode. Be prepared with copious amounts of advil, cigarettes, coke, and junk food. I was typing none stop for like 6 hours organizing shit and making sure everone was on the same page. Of course, it was a pickup raid so that made it hellish. Soon as I got the ring I crashed, exausted. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Menon Lifeblight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Klotar, we do this with 30ish all the time.   No VT, no EP gear.<br />
<br />
Have a good snare group of druids and rangers.  Festering works well also.  It is nice to have a couple chanters to tash the 3rd wave.  They are very MR and tash will help snares land.  I also use AoD on the third wave, every bit helps.  Get everything snared ASAP.  Mobs are easy to tank, the only problem is letting them run free.<br />
<br />
If you have two bards with the gate song, you are guaranteed success.  Just have them hang out by the towers and handle runners.<br />
<br />
Kill the captains/generals/warlords last on each wave.<br />
<br />
We like to kill the spearmen to the west (toward velks) during the first wave (one group will mow them down, and first wave is numbingly easy) so we can engage the pops there earlier, but it's not necessary.<br />
<br />
No reason to bother with the MQ, feel free to run around and fight as the risk of death is pretty minimal.  If you lose, it will be due to runners, not because your force was wiped by giants.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Krushum Gudended</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">did mine with 40ish<br />
<br />
failed first time cuz a bard was blinding instead of highsun=bad<br />
<br />
stand by the waterfall and make a hotkey for /say for the dain, attack, and you wont lose a single dorf<br />
<br />
mine is always up... druid/shammy regen overwrites, but thats the only stacking problem in game now</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kazral Shadowthirst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">One or two bards doing highsun and and average level of 63 or 64 in my guild with about 50 to 60 peeps on easy.<br />
<br />
The key is having those 50 or 60 people not being dumbasses and actually killing.<br />
<br />
Shadowknights are actually one of the best classes for this with the combination of tankage, dps, and snaring.<br />
<br />
Clerics are probably one of the least desired as long as you have a couple.<br />
<br />
(not going through entire list) Druids are good alround to have a well for this. Only until the third wave do you have to take the time for the bards to send alot back.<br />
<br />
Nardani is also kinda gimp as long as you have either a rotation or a bunch of druids slowing the MTs hp down while a cleric CHs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks everyone for your input.  I'll be thinking about this very carefully over the next little while (still need a few k points for those augs).<br />
<br />
Sounds like this would challenge me/us to our limit.  I had never paid ~that~ much attention during these as a participant other than the task at hand -- it'll certainly be different attempting to coordinate one. <br />
<br />
The bard Highsun thing is something different I just learned here -- very interesting!  I'd understood Highsun to be a shadowstep rather than a gate.<br />
<br />
And heyas Shoi!  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Wienaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You can't gate third wave, the levels are too high...Ring War is easily doable with a coordinated raid force of 36 people, our guild farms NToV (family guild) and we do Ring Wars with around 6-7 grps regularly, or we did as recently as a month or so ago.  Most of the reason for this is a rock solid strategy; we play it almost like a football game.  We engage in certain spots, we control the mobs completely (most are rootable).  Read somewhere once that a full ring war was done with about 15 people; I call BS on this one, think even with that mostly being root classes its still a lie, but who knows? /shrug.  Anyway, its a pretty simple encounter, keep KOS people away from the Dain, you can lose heroes quickly that way if you're not careful, and sure as HELL make sure everyone knows not to attack the Dain (lost an Eye of Narandi on my own ring war, I know its the crappiest loot but still)  At any rate, have fun with it, its one of my favorite encounters in the game, and distributing the loot afterward is fun, as you get 3 pretty darn nice loots (Crown, Choker, Faceguard)  Crown and Choker still stand somewhat highly on peoples' lists of great items today, even after PoP.  Have fun!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vezax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hey klotar, im on prexus too, if you need a hand on a ring war, ill gladly help out.</div></div><hr />

You can't gate third wave, the levels are too high... <br />
<br />
Totally incorrect.  We gate the third wave all the time.  There is never any need on the first and second wave.  I have been in about 10 ring wars and run one myself, I can assure you that the third wave can be gated by bards.<br />
<br />
Edit: fixed the quote tags</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Khat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Originally posted by Klotar AngedeMorts <br />
I'd been gearing towards replacing the functionality of my War Crested Ring (ID4) with Anger of Druzzil / ID2 augs via LDoN so I can get a higher hp ring. <br />
<br />
I have been looking into either the War Crested Ring and/or the Anger of Druzzil &amp; Improved Damage II augs lately and it got me wondering...<br />
<br />
I checked out Lucy for the specs on both and ran some queries through my local database o' spells and came up with this:<br />
(Disclaimer: Info in my database might not be up to date and according to LUCY there is no resist check on WCR's ID4 focus).<br />
These are, from what I gather, our spells that work with their respective focus:<br />
<br />
<br />
Improved Damage IV (War Crested Ring)<br />
65 Aura of Hate<br />
65 Touch of Innoruuk<br />
64 Spear of Decay<br />
64 Scythe of Innoruuk<br />
63 Aura of Pain<br />
62 Touch of Volatis<br />
62 Zevfeer's Bite<br />
62 Deny Undead<br />
60 Drain Soul<br />
57 Drain Spirit<br />
55 Spirit Tap<br />
55 Expel Undead<br />
54 Spear of Plague<br />
54 Scythe of Death<br />
51 Siphon Life<br />
49 Dismiss Undead<br />
49 Life Leech<br />
49 Spear of Pain<br />
49 Scythe of Darkness<br />
39 Expulse Undead<br />
34 Spear of Disease<br />
30 Lifedraw<br />
22 Ward Undead<br />
15 Lifespike<br />
09 Lifetap<br />
1 Harm Touch<br />
<br />
Anger of Druzzil (Gleaming Prism of Destruction augment)<br />
65 Touch of Innoruuk<br />
64 Scythe of Innoruuk<br />
62 Touch of Volatis<br />
62 Deny Undead<br />
60 Drain Soul<br />
57 Drain Spirit<br />
55 Spirit Tap<br />
55 Expel Undead<br />
54 Scythe of Death<br />
51 Siphon Life<br />
49 Dismiss Undead<br />
49 Life Leech<br />
49 Scythe of Darkness<br />
39 Expulse Undead<br />
30 Lifedraw<br />
22 Ward Undead<br />
15 Lifespike<br />
09 Lifetap<br />
<br />
Improved Damage II (Cracked Limestone of Aggression augment)<br />
34 Spear of Disease<br />
1 Harm Touch<br />
<br />
Looking at this, it would appear that removing the War Crested Ring and instead having the Anger of Druzzil &amp; IDII augs you no longer gain focus'ed benefit from:<br />
<br />
65 Aura of Hate<br />
64 Spear of Decay<br />
63 Aura of Pain<br />
62 Zevfeer's Bite<br />
54 Spear of Plague<br />
49 Spear of Pain<br />
<br />
<br />
At least I think I got that right. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Very nice summary there Khat.  A couple weeks ago I stopped loading spears and will basically only bring them out for PoJ trials, etc., I'm loading Touch of Volatis as a 2nd tap instead.    Loss of 20% on a ZB doesn't concern me that much; and the auras are put away most times too... though I do bring Aura of Pain out for a difficult fight.<br />
<br />
As for the 10th Ring, thanks again for all your suggestions and strategies.  Gonna think real hard on this one as to if I can come up with a viable force.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ghomer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Since i didn't see it posted.<br />
<br />
Frostreaver's Blessing is overwritten by any regen higher than chloroplast. It is overwritten by chloroplast as well but can be cast without having to remove chloro first.<br />
<br />
To my knowledge as long as the required items are turned in it doesn't matter who started the war, as any type of flag system like PoP uses was not in place with Velious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Wendingo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">From my experience, its nice to have a force of about 40.  We have never failed with 40+.  Success between 30 and 40 is spotty.  Less than 30 would take a truly well coordinated force that really knows where to stand.  Even with a capable force, expect to fail once learning where the waves spawn.<br />
<br />
No idea on whether someone else can start the war or not.  <br />
<br />
As someone else said, when you fail its generally because of a runner getting though.  This can happen on waves one and two, but is most likely to happen on wave 3 because they are very resistant and root/snare do not seem to work unless you are on top of the mob.  Also, remember to kill the boss of each wave LAST or you will start the timer on the next spawn.  Two spawns at once on the second or third waves is almost certain failure.</div></div><hr />
