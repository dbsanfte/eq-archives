<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Black Knight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi there, I'm new to these boards. I have a little story and I need a little help. :D <br />
<br />
If you play on Tunare and have met me my name is Sithro the Magician.<br />
<br />
Now I group alot and normally wish I was the guy up front taking the beating and slashing away. Thats why I chose to make a Shadow Knight as secondary main character.<br />
<br />
Thats right... Another main...<br />
<br />
What led be to doing this is people keep thretening to kill me. Lol, and mages aren't great duelers. You know how dueling people are, they win, they never let it go. So I chose to make an SK to beat up those people that tease me... And because no Shadow Knight has ever threatened to kill me, they always been cool with me. But you know those moronic people... You know like...<br />
<br />
HAHAHA! Mage duel me then!<br />
<br />
So now I'll say...<br />
<br />
Inc Body Guard SHADOWKNIGHT... You'll make a nice pet component...<br />
<br />
I hate people that do that. But I want to be a group SK mainly, why? Because I like meeting new people in the world of Norrath.<br />
<br />
As for the help. I'm making an Erudite SK. I wanted to know what kind of armor should I get him to start off. I'm not rich at all... Lol, I can probably put 500 - 800pp into him.<br />
<br />
Also, is the ShadowKnight worthy as a secondary main? He's not just going to be some character just for when people try to kill me. He's going to be character I play, a character I try to get his epic weapon, and hopefully people will know me as Sithro and my SK.<br />
<br />
And also, whats a cool Erudite SK name?<br />
<br />
I would like to thank the people of the Magician's Tower for sending me here for help.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
<br />
Bad idea.<br />
<br />
First off, if you want to get help, never tell this boards your a twink, do not make a gnome, use the search button for stupid questions and post the good ones and dont be offended quickly.<br />
<br />
SK's aren't bodyguards.<br />
<br />
Secondary mains  = twinks.<br />
<br />
You dont make SK's for dueling reasons, you make SK's cause you feel like one and all the stuff they can do.<br />
<br />
That's enough for formalities.<br />
<br />
For gear, search the armory, lots of good posts there, cheap and expensive ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shirou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Even if you make a Shadowknight, it isn't like we are PK gods or dueling gods from level 9+...start a SK and have fun, learn how it works, then try dueling. I think you'll have a better chance then. Oh, and for 500-800, I'd look at a MoSS/Sarnak and like a Mithril 2Hander to keep those skills up..maybe a centi SS or something for 1HS and a centi spear for piercing. Don't know of any cheap 2HB. Armor wise? Crustacean or..I forget what the like HUM/ERU only SK armor is..Flayed Skin or something? Not great, but cheap on Mith. Marr at least.<br />
<br />
Edit: Cool name? Go with something you think of.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Black Knight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm not going to *super twink* him. If I did that I would never learn how to play him.<br />
<br />
The ShadowKnight will probably be the character I use to represent my dark side (EVERYONE has a dark side). I'll even give him a cool life story.<br />
<br />
The reason they cought my intrest is the fact that there the brothers of Necros basically. And they can carry blades. I've played a Necro so I know how to FK.<br />
<br />
I wont use him just to duel or anything. I want to play him along with my Mage, when I get bored with one I'll go to the other. But if you play a mage, you know we kind of go shafted duel wise. But like most people say, dueling dosn't matter anyway, it was last minute idea.<br />
<br />
I was thinking of making his first name Saidean... Don't know yet though.<br />
<br />
Thanks guys, you've been helpful!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">No matter why you start you will fall in love with your SK.  I made mine just to keep a friend company.  My friend no longer plays that char but Keevel keeps rocking on.   You may find yourself switching mains.<br />
<br />
Play style:  You will not be the most physical tank.  But adapt to an Erudite style, you mana pool is huge (for a hybrid) you can control agro well, enjoy it.<br />
<br />
Gear:  With an Edurite sk, if you want to twink him a bit.  Park your SK at the ent of the Warrens.  Switch to your mage and go pull the mugglewump to the entrance of the warens and kill him there.  The mugglewump will sometimes drop a cool shield with RuneII and and Erudite Sk only helm.  Switch back to your SK and loot.  If he drops any of his other items, all of which are very class specific, just ooc to see if anyone wants it, though you may want to keep the Mage only fishing pole for yourself.  <br />
<br />
Weapons:  You'll want to keep all weapons skills well trained.  With your high int, you have an advantage there.  Get weapons with low delay for better training.  The MoSS is good.  For 1HS I use either a Wakashi of the Frozen Skies or a Sharpened Flotsam not great but speed and nice for holding agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Black Knight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I wont be switching mains. Now treating himually to my main is a possiblity. :D <br />
<br />
I always wanted a secondary character to play as a equal main. The SK *might* become and second main. But he can't replace my Mage, put so much work into him and I love my mage! Very fun class!<br />
<br />
As for twinking him... I was thinking of something easer, like getting Flayed armor from KC. But were is this guy your talking about?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Duke Xerro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">SK doesnt become powerful in duels until you start getting your HT duels. Then we do become duel gods.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Drynnious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">HT duels?<br />
<br />
You shouldn't need HT to win a duel. It just makes the ending faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Black Knight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm starting to think about an Iksar SK now... They any good? How do they look in very dark gre armor?</div></div><hr />

HT duels?<br />
<br />

<br />
Exactly, HT is just for emergency situations. Your in a close duel, its going down to the wire, boom HT, game over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shirou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Look on Allakhazam under luclin fashion (If using luclin graphics) or non-luclin (need i explain..?) and see what you will look like with a certain piece of armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Aimbot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Uber cheap twink items:<br />
<br />
Shissar Knight's Sword - 10/22 - 10pp<br />
Clay Guardian Shield - 25ac, 50hp - around 20pp<br />
Netherbian Chitin - 20ac, some stats - 10pp<br />
Dwarf Work Boots, Lumberjack's Cap, some cheap Gnome Skin armor... And you have yourself a pretty nice setup. And all for around 200pp, which saves you plat to buy upgrades / spells.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You missed my point, you said sk's don't become powerful until they get HT in duels. I said you don't need HT to win a duel, or even to be good.<br />
<br />
Go home ebay.</div></div><hr />
