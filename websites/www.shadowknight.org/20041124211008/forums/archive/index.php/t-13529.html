<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>cigarskunk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What is the damage progression on harm touch.<br />
<br />
What AAs can we get to beef it up?<br />
<br />
How much of an improvement does that give?<br />
<br />
Basically, how can I work my HT skill to get the most out of it as I progress - I'm currently 53 and want to start planning AA paths.</div></div><hr />

It's jackasses like this that make SO many people just want to flock to this board - sigh - atleast he's the minority SK player.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Antihero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">its jackasses like you that post usless threads when the answer was so easy to get by either going to the evil beginnings then spells % skills(seems to say it all there) or search button put in *harm touch* and it gives you 368 to choose from..which then one with you answer was like 12 down. By the way it took me all of 30secs to find the answer...but no you want to be spoon feed this and dont want to learn it on your own let alone had you oh maybe used each level you could have figured it out then at 41 it changes but Im sure the math was to much for you..have to waste space on the board so that you can be spoon feed..<br />
<br />
so either get some research skills or go kiss my ass dont really care maybe one day you will look before putting you foot in your mouth..<br />

Have a nice day..</div></div><hr />

Speaking of wich. Out of curiosity I looked to see just what exactly you've contributed to the forums.<br />
<br />
No suprise. Out of 144 some odd posts you've contributed Jack and Shit.<br />

So why don't you do us all a favor, troll somewhere else. Get your thumb out of your ass and grow the fuck up.<br />

Cigarskunk, I thought it was a legitimate question, I've been searching myself trying to find the different max / min damage for HT with the combinations of Unholy touch, scf, unholy aura, imp damage items, bard songs.<br />
<br />
And found this ( from another thread somewhere )<br />

Thanks for the additional info, RandomKayan. I'd like to fine-tune a formula for UT before I plug it in. Since there are several variables, I'll define those first.<br />
<br />
Harmtouch:<br />
10 x lvl + 1 (levels 1 to 40), add 30 x lvl (levels 41 to 60), add 10 x lvl (levels 61 to 65)<br />
At 60: ((10 x 40) + 1) + (30 x 20) = 401 + 600 = 1001<br />
At 65: ((10 x 40) + 1) + (30 x 20) + (10 x 5) = 401 + 600 + 50 = 1051<br />
Source<br />
<br />
Unholy Aura: Add 50%<br />
<br />
SCF: <br />
Without UT: Chance to crit as per your SCF level (add 33%, 66%, 100%)<br />
With UT: Guaranteed crit as per your SCF level<br />
<br />
Unholy Touch: Adds 450 per skill level, guarantees SCF crit<br />
<br />
So a general purpose formula could be (HT + UT) x SCF x UA<br />
eg.<br />
Level 65 HT with UA, UT3, and SCF3 (no focus)<br />
(HT + UT) x SCF x UA<br />
(1051 + (3 x 450)) x 2 x 1.5 = 7203<br />
<br />
All we need to complete the formula is to identify where the focus get calculated. Anyone know?<br />

Theres also a good one on the layout and damage for going for super harm touch ( what aa's to get and stuff )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jabbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You really should try the search button though, Cigar. :)  Most everything you might be looking for has already been covered, ad nauseum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Drynnious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">heya Mnayar... your link's broken :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>TheDarkness</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Maybe I missed something here, but I am currently lvl 60, with 14 AAs, SCF1 being one of them. I have critted on casting twice - TWICE - in two weeks ( I play every night btw ). I have NEVER critted a HT, and I have only performed one HT with SCF, without using unholy aura.<br />
<br />
So....where is this SCF1 33% crit, and more importantly, the &quot;guarantee&quot; to crit with UA is simply incorrect.<br />
<br />
Anyone else with simliar experience as mine?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Talonmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I could be wrong, but the guaranteed crit comes from the Unholy Touch not unholy aura.  Also, higher levels of SCF I *believe* increases the chance to crit, in addition to the damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Darber</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Correct, your SCF and UT only seems to work with the IHT (Improved harm touch).<br />
On a side note, WHAT is the big deal about search...... come on people.. Im sick of seeing people flamed for NOT using search, sure maybe it's lazy to not try and answer your own question BUT, maybe the person's specific question was not answered in a way they understood in other posts Either way, is it that big of a deal to some of you that you need to post a reply flaming them? Does any post on this board effect you so much that you have to be an ASS?<br />
<br />
Darb :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Belyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If you have SCF and UT at any level and are not getting crits on your harmtouches, you are using the old HT hot key.  Go to the aa window and click on improved harmtouch skill, then click on make hot key.  You must use the hotkey created from the aa window for HT to gain abilities of Improved HT and UT.<br />
<br />
The garenteed crit only comes with improvedHT, UT and SCF.  On another note, your complaint about scf1 not doing much...it works much better at lvl 2 and 3.  More often and more damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jespar Bloodreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Belyle is right, I use UT/SCF/Sup.HT and everytime I cast HT it turns critical. But yes, you need to train Sup.HT(6 AA) and then make key. it should look like &quot;Super.HT&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Keero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I like goldfishes cause their so delicious!!! I love goldfishes!<br />
<br />
oh and SCF isn't a 33% crit chance it is a 2% chance =P, it adds 33% more damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Grumoor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The Search Button Nazis are fucking geeks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>krikk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I agree about the search nazis. And as for ID items, I have an ID1 cloak, and notice a drastic improvement about 30% of the time (rough estimate). the only spell I use which is affected by ID1 is Harmtouch, because it's technically a lvl 1 spell. I've read that ID2, 3, and 4 items have better chances of improving HT. At lvl 54 I've harmtouched from, if I remember right, 740 to 970 with my cloak on. Each time it says &quot;Your shitty newby cloak feels alive with power&quot;, but the damage improvement is random. Next lvl with my disc and with my lame ID1 cloak I should be able to break 1000 pretty often. I hope this helps, it's about all I've noticed with varrying damage in HT at this point with Krikk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Krikk,<br />
<br />
With the discipline alone I was getting 1275 at lvl 55 (haven't tried it since I hit 56), so you should do well over that with your cloak.</div></div><hr />
