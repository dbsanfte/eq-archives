<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wedge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was just reading through the latest incarnation of the &quot;do gnome SK's suck?&quot; thread, and it got me thinking.  If they were going to introduce another race/class combination (not another new race or class, mind you, just added another race to the list that can play a certain class), what would you want to see, and why?<br />
<br />
I'm not looking for comedic value here, although I'm sure some people will simply post the goofiest thing they can think of, but I'd prefer if people thought up some things that made some RP sense.<br />
<br />
My favorite?<br />
<br />
Iksar Rogue<br />
<br />
Something about this is just really attractive.  They have decent rogue stats, as well as regen, AC bonus, etc., but that's not the real reason.<br />
<br />
The Iksar don't like rogues, hence the &quot;Forsaken&quot; mobs outside Cabilis, all the outcast rogues.  They could start you in some crappy corner of Cabilis, or in the tunnels, and give you apprehensive faction to all of Cab, and have some merchants not sell to you.<br />
<br />
I've had some friends tell me that Iksar just wouldn't become rogues, since it's so frowned upon, but think about it:  can't you see someone being part of an isolated race that's hated by the rest of the world, and thus becoming all bitter and hateful and turning to theft and murder as a way of taking out his aggression?  <br />
<br />
What do you guys think?  What would you like to see?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vniluuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Barbarian Shadow knight. Definitely. Think of warriors of Chaos, a race of bloodthirsty vikings slaughtering and raping, turning to the black arts. Thats my pick.</div></div><hr />

On balance i don't think barbarian sk's work with the lore of the game because shadow knights exist within more sophisticated societies with a capacity for evil (human, gnome, erudite, dark elf) or as remnants of once sophisticated societies (ogres, iksars). The odd ones out are the trolls, but their origins remain largely mysterious. The lore in game seems to suggest they were smacked down hard by the ogres in their prime and not much else. <br />
<br />
Evil barbarians do exist in game though. Brutol Rhaksen, warrior guildmaster of the Dismal Rage is a barbarian. I think i've read that barbarian warriors of Rallos Zek were evil team on SZ for a bit before being taken out. So i'd be quite happy to see barbarians lose the good race tag, Halas has always seemed rather bland and boring to me, when it should be a den of bloody feuding. <br />
<br />
Practically a new race/class combo should involve minimal work and not be some new departure so my suggestion would be barbarian bards (there is that one in lavastorm already). Vah shir monks are also a pretty obvious suggestion, though there aren't any Vah shir monk NPC's to my knowledge at the moment.</div></div><hr />

Um, I don't think this makes sense. Considering the lore on Erudites specifies that they don't really use melee (SK and Pally I think because of the magical properties about the classes. Not sure though)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jobrill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The Roguish Arts are consider Anathema and a threat to society by Cabilis. Thus why all Iksar who show Roguish Tendencies are cast out from the city and become Forsaken Bandits. Having Iksar Rogues as a class would fly in the face of establish lore, unless you want a character KOS to every old world/kunark city INCLUDING Cabilis and make a bandit camp with a trainer and a bank and a newbie vendor somewhere, I suppose. Which to me would be too much work for one new class combo.<br />
<br />
Dark Elfs believe that all Magicks beyond Necromancy are inferior, and barely tolerate the lesser forms of magic. There is NO reason for them to suddenly add bard music, as that is simply another form of inferior ,agic. Just go get a Mask of Deception. <br />
<br />
I personally would like to see a Barbarian SK, because we have seen examples of the Barbarians as a Savage and Evil people in some NPCs (ie, Inny Warrior GL in FP), and it might be nice to explore that side of them. They are direct descendants of the God of Valor, so it's not like they don't have the Chivalric and Knightly codes in thier blood. Rallos Zek Barbarian SKs would be an interesting storyline I think. I would like to see Barbarian Bards too because of the whole &quot;Skald&quot; Tradition.<br />
<br />
I too would like to see Froglok Mages and Enchanters, since there are multiple froglok mage and ench nameds in Uguk and Sebilis.<br />
<br />
However, at this point, I think any future addition of classes wouldn't be advisable. It would just be to appease the &quot;Ooo man this combo would be kewl!!!&quot; crowd. It's probably best that they don't add anymore unless they plan to work in yet another new race/class in a future expansion.<br />
<br />
However, a revamp of the game so that every race could be every class...you got my attention. That would cause too much trouble and should prolly be in a new game.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Carshail Shel'rac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I don't see a reason for Barbarians to become SKs. Sure there are some outcast subjects who turned on the dark side but these are rather few, Barbarians are over all in peace with each other and other good races also they are considered as orderly good/neutral.<br />
In my opinion the reason for the existance of Rallos SKs is the fact that Ogres and Giants are his children and so they take the role of holy warriors and &quot;batlle priests&quot; in their society, after all Rallos is a god of warriors. Same with Trolls, they are (were as Cazic was still their main god) the holy warriors in their society.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Vniluuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Think of the Barbarians and their history. Bloodthirsty pillage, raping, combat, combat, combat. They ruined the north western shores of europe for century's, bringing death and desolation wherever they went. Nice race? Bah!<br />
Now from a gaming point of view: Barbarians are a strong, fierce race with a society that evolves around combat for domination, disdaining the civilized world as weaklings in silk &quot;diplomating&quot; cowards. The first choice for a barbarian would be warrior of zek of course, but I think thye should have the option of becoming evil warriors, which only the roll a Shadow Knight could fulfill... Even if I must say the idea of magic among the barbarian tribes troubles me quite a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">.... This has nothing to do with the Teutonic and Viking tribes of Europe. Barbarians, as we call them in Norrath, may as well name them Burglegups so you don't get in a tizzy over real scotchmen, are what happened when the God of Dreams implanted part of the life of the God of Valor into the God of Love. They were probably the linchpin soldiers of the Combine Empire, I'll give you that, but what part of this is 'Pilliage, rape, THEN burn'? They saved Mithanael Marr from Cazic Thule by main force, then settled down in the icy wastes cause they liked the harsh life, cause it tested them. -That- is the history we have to work with. Barbarian SKs should be as rare as Orcish Paladins.</div></div><hr />

If barbarians in EQ are what you describe, they shouldnt be named barbarians, but Northern human tribes. Obviously the Barbarians of Norrath are inspired by the viking tribes of the north, by their look, city and way of living. Making them as normal as humans, with the difference of bigger muscles and cold resistance, is not the right idea of barbarians that should be upheld... Maybe everquest needs to be a bit more realistic...</div></div><hr />

Yeah, then WE wouldn't exist. There was never once any record in history describing a ShadowKnight. Only Necromancers (If you've ever read the Necronomicon, but even then, they could never summon a skeleton or anything. Just talk to spirits) <br />
<br />
So, no. EQ needs to stay a jumbled mess of ideas being thrown left and right.</div></div><hr />

Actually, the one story I read (can't remember if it was official) was that when Trolls arrived in Antotica (sp) they were met by Ogres.  They both mutually respected each other and I beleive it was then that Ogres taught them about being Shadowknights.  The history of the Trolls isn't really a mystery (wish I could find that site and link it).  Basically, the 'Field of Bones' is supposed to be where Trolls Tribes fought for survival and basically ended up having to flee Kunark.  Again, not sure if it is official but it is listed with a bunch of other 'histories'.</div></div><hr />

I have long thought an evil Iksar variant of a ranger - maybe called a tracker? - would be cool.  Making use of the naturalistic capabilities of the iksar, but for evil not good, to dominate nature not protect it.</div></div><hr />

Screw FFoL and those Allakhazam lore stories!! They are player written, not &quot;official&quot; lore. Yeah I know, it's a game, lore in a game can be whatever blabla but Banegrivm has only woven a bunch of phantasms that fit into his view of the game :P<br />
<br />
LoY reveals that Trolls originate from Innothule and the south of Antonica, Guk was once one of their main cities before they got crushed and suppressed by the Ogres.<br />
<br />
Take a look at the barbarian cultural armor, it's called Northman chain, I bet the name Barbarians was given to them by the other races. High, Wood and Dark Elves also refer to themselves as Koada, Feir and Teir'dal not like we call them.</div></div><hr />

It get's repeatedly mixed in with actual release lore so people tend to think of it as official lore. If you read the troll books in PoK they refer to oppression by the Rallosian empire. The ogre books about the end of the Rallosian empire also refer to the trolls rising up at it's collapse.<br />

I would like to see racial mutations added too. Like as you advance perhaps you could do certain things to change yourself. Examples:<br />
<br />
Divinely touched - maybe you meet your god and gain some special powers like aa abilities<br />
<br />
Undead - you become an undead member of your race. Maybe you do some quest to become a lich or a vampire.<br />
<br />
Were-creature - you can turn into some animal and gain some advantages like regen or attack bonuses<br />
<br />
Hermit - you lose faction with everyone, but maybe gain xp a little faster<br />
<br />
Famous - mayber you gain faction with everyone but you also get aggro faster than others. Perma VoT :eek: <br />
<br />
<br />
I dunno, there are tons of ideas to make characters are little more unique. I think that's the next step imo as you can't keep adding races to the game forever as cool as new races are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Requiam O'Souls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Just think of that guy from Highlander the movie, Kragen or something. He was one bad mofo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Jice Virago</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">My reason for DE Bards being logical:<br />
The Dark Elves are a sophisticated society with a stong persuit of knowledge, forbidden or otherwise, in their history.  The two parent classes of bards (Ench, Rogue) are prevalent within the race and the prevalance of bardic influence is strong within their panteon (Maestro in their God's Plane, Mayongs various bardic entanglements, numerous mention of entertainers in their lore).  I mean, even Iny must like a good goth tune or he would have smashed that big ass pipe organ a long time ago.<br />
<br />
Erudite Monks:<br />
Quelious, the deity most strongly identified with monks, is worshiped more commonly among Erudites than among any other race.  Erudites, as a race, are also big about mental persuits in general, and the EQ view on monks is their awesome martial prowess is derived from magic and mental discipline; if an Erudite was going to enter hand to hand combat, this would be the way to do it.  On the paineel side, the only other diety with strong monk representaion is Cazic.  This could be a cool way to make Odus the &quot;Kung Fu&quot; capitol of norrath, esp since you already have all those monk flagged Kerran NPCs there already.  Since martial arts is primarily a mental discipline, Erudites should excell at it.<br />

this is not WH.  Don't mix the two.  don't try to mix the two.  there is no point to be made about it in reference to EQ.  <br />
<br />
Barb sk's as good an idea as gnome sk's.  friends don't let friends make bad ideas.  <br />
<br />
For a short period of time there was rumor of DE Bards and Iksar type rangers to be implimented but like i stressed it was only rumor.  no loss.  What would a DE bard do anyway?  sing funeral dirges all day?  :D <br />
<br />
i still say let there be gnome monks simply to let the monk genre know the shame of being prevert and defiled and give every D3wd out there their wet dream come true.  <br />
<br />
i like your ideas bunny about faction and what not but one problem with being divinely touched by innoruuk... that means he kills you ... the prince of hate grants no favors.  The undead thing sorta exists... back in the old day there was a quest and you could get ally faction with Mistmoore.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Warmaster Xsavuung Llaahh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Bards are NOT a 'child' class of enchanters and rogues. Bards are a unique class. They have similar skills as other classes, but that's all.<br />
<br />
DE bards and Erudite monks make no sense at all. DEs are too pissed off to learn music. Yeah, we have death metal and acid rock, but Norrathians don't. Bards of old were the story tellers of society, and they'd tell the stories in the form or song and verse. This just doesn't fit the over all 'feel' or Dark Elves. <br />
<br />
Erudite monks = no. Erudites have this HUGE head to house their HUGE brains. For them to study a straight melee class would be a complete waste of 75% of their being. IMO makes no sense at all.<br />
<br />
I think Sarnak would make a really cool player race. They'd have similar classes to that of the Iksar, but add wizard, mage, and enchanter. There would need to be a new starting city, though. Or, there would have to be another zone attached to BW around the corner from the fort for newbie Sarnaks to level. They'd also make a nice player race because they have good and bad faction hits (in the game), have an established lore (at least partly so), and they are an evil race that HATE another evil race (the iksar).<br />
<br />
If they were going to make a new class, I'd like to see a shape changing class. Not illusion, but different forms that give certain bonuses and disadvantages. Probably will never happen, but would be neat to see.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Actually, the class of rogue is not neccesarily anathema to the Iksar. However, thieves, assassins, and poisoners are. The Iksar are very communally minded, meaning that they hate thieves and bandits for much the same reason that a good race or highly spiritual race would, like, oh, Wood Elves or Vah Shir. The key is not the class, but rather, the role the class fulfills in society. Wood Elven rogues are the scouts and spies and messegers of the children of Tunare. The Vah Shir rogues are hunters and stalkers, the very essence of a cat, and their society depends upon them the way humans depend upon farmers. Human rogues are the familiar bandits, theives and swindlers, while Dark Elven rogues are the terrifying secret police and silent enforcers of the law of the Thex monarchs. Could not many of these serve as models for the Iksar fanatic rogue?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>shadowblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">I dont think we need a new warrior wizard type of class. think about it , would that not somehow intrude upon what a shadowknight does, especially at high lv? I think it would . this is bad.<br />
<br />
Barbarian shadowknights? They would not be able to worship RZ beacause he is a purely warrior god, and would frown on the use of any type of magic. From what I understand Shadowknights all dervie power from the gods they serve. <br />
<br />
Perhaps If Terris thule was added as an option to worship. then it would fit. I can kind of see the barbarian race being very respectful of the dream world, and terris's influence could drive some barbarians to the path of Darkness, these certain knights of course would be shunned in barbarian society and driven out.<br />
<br />
And yes Kurgan from the hylander was a very bad Mofo. (too bad the rest of the series turned to shit)<br />
<br />
I would definately like to see a Draconian type race for sure (sarnaks). Perhaps innate levitation as an ability would be fun hehe. They would be able to be all casting races, warriors and shadowknights (evil only)<br />
<br />
I also think a Vah shir Shadowknight would be very cool. But it would have to be a black panther type with red eyes heh. Any other look is just wrong on very many levels. Since the lore of the world does not really fit with this race/class tho it wont and shouldnt happen.<br />
<br />
But in saying that, any of these combinations are more fitting to the shadowknight class than Gnomes =/</div></div><hr />

Actually Rallos isn't a pure warrior god...he has a bunch of wizards (Giants in Kael and Goblins) in his service *shrug* guess he also has a favor for magical destruction not only martial :P<br />

<br />
Many cultures have had Song and Dance without &quot;Bards&quot; of any sort. Dark Elves may have many hymns of praise to Innoruuk and court harpists who sing the Praise of King Thex, but I see no logical reason for them to take up MAGICAL music.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for the Barbarian SK of RZ discussion:  Rallos Zek has no problem with magic.  If you remember, the only reason most of his creations on not very magical is because they were stripped of their powers when they were stripped of their intelligence by the other gods, following their attempt alongside RZ to storm the planes. (this is all from official lore)<br />
<br />
You could definitely take the approach that the Barb SK's were those warriors that had taken their bloodlust to an unhealthy extreme, and had gained some insight into the Dark Arts at the expense of some of their sanity.<br />
<br />
And I also agree that Erudite or Gnome monks would be just plain wrong.<br />
<br />
Oh, and thank you to whomever it was (forgot to scroll up and check) who pointed out that not all classes play the same roles in each of their respective societies.  While rogues might be lowly thieves, bandits, etc. in other cultures, I see no reason why Iksar Rogues couldn't be those charged with assassinating the enemies of the Iksar empire and Cazic-Thule (that's a pretty good way to spread Fear, I think).  Besides, Iksar look very slithery and sneaky to me, from a movement standpoint, and I could totally see an Iksar rogue, lurking in the shadows, then springing out to Backstab someone.<br />
<br />
The only thing about Barbarian SK's that I really kinda dislike is that if they were ever put in, you know a bunch of people would start saying &quot;Hey, if Barbarians can be SK's, and can also worship Mithaniel Marr, why can't we have Barbarian Paladins?&quot; and that would just be weird.<br />

Now I just thought about the barbarian society based around strength and honor, not evil or good. If a good attentioned chieftain is powerful and charismatic enough to be head of the tribe, let him be. If that chief would want to conquer the whole world in his quest to power, maybe it wouldnt seem wrong to the barbarians. Just the strongest of them would come at the head of the tribe, regardless of alignement.</div></div><hr />

Bards are NOT a 'child' class of enchanters and rogues. Bards are a unique class. They have similar skills as other classes, but that's all.<br />
<br />
DE bards and Erudite monks make no sense at all. DEs are too pissed off to learn music. Yeah, we have death metal and acid rock, but Norrathians don't. Bards of old were the story tellers of society, and they'd tell the stories in the form or song and verse. This just doesn't fit the over all 'feel' or Dark Elves. <br />
<br />
  <br />
<br />
There, I think, you're missing some in game lore.  As the descendants of the Loyalist faction in the war that ended the Dal empire, there would be some form of bardic tradition to keep the Loyalist tradition alive.  After all, the Feir'Dal (Wood Elves) sided with the Rebels and have bards who tell the story from their point of view.  The Koada'Dal (High Elves) even built Felwithe on the spot where the last Emperor was killed.  Had it not been for the Hight Priest of Innoruuk, the Loyalists would not have survived to become the Teir'Dal.  <br />
<br />
I look at it as a rather messy divorce between Innoruuk and Tunare.  Tunare turned a major portion of the children against Innoruuk.  Hence, the dream to get Father's blessing to visit Mother and kick her ass.</div></div><hr />

That only applies to arcane magic. They view clerical magic just as highly as they do necromancy. And even wizards, enchanters, and magicians aren't totally shunned, they are just thought of as a lesser caste of society. The Dark Elves are a very cultured people and it would make sense to have professional musicians and playwrights to entertain their nobles. <br />
Bard and Minstrel are not really synonymous. Whenever someone not familiar with fantasy role-playing games hears the word &quot;bard&quot; they automatically think of William Shakespeare whose main focus was to create beautiful plays to entertain the Queen and other nobles, not to pass along oral tradition to the common folk with a mandolin and a cheesy ballad. This role of a bard would work well in Dark Elf society, and would fit nicely with EQ lore. And there's plenty of empty or unused buildings in the third gate that the developer's could put a few Bard NPCs in and turn into a Bard guild.<br />
<br />
I think a Dark Elf Bard would be bad-ass, I'd definitely roll one up. SOE is too stuck on D&amp;D fantasy roleplaying traditions (bard = good). They need to start thinking outside of the box.</div></div><hr />

Clerical &quot;Magic&quot; isn't magic tho, It's Innoruuk answering the prayers of the dieties. And I figure there's a major reason that Magicians, Enchanters, and Wizards are called &quot;The Forsaken&quot; and they are diametrically opposed to the Necros and SKs via thier alliance with Naythox Thex (Vs the Necros and Sks, who follow Cristianos Thex).  <br />
<br />
The Dark Elves are a very cultured people and it would make sense to have professional musicians and playwrights to entertain their nobles. <br />

You could say this about most cultures. I'm sure Erudites have Troubadours in thier courts, and Barbarians have Skalds around the campfire telling stories and singing songs (Theres only so much you can do when you're snowed in in Halas in the winter months). High Elves have just as ordered a society as Dark Elves, guess they need bards too.  The fact is, the bard in EQ is a semi-primitive, chaotic, carefree traveller, who's songs are wild and primal echoes of the human spirit.

I think a Dark Elf Bard would be bad-ass, I'd definitely roll one up. SOE is too stuck on D&amp;D fantasy roleplaying traditions (bard = good). They need to start thinking outside of the box.  <br />
<br />
Actually, in my D&amp;D experiences, most bards are Chaotic Neutral, not good. Bards in general are considered Chaotic, which seems to go against the highly ordered society of the Dark Elves.</div></div><hr />

Clerical &quot;Magic&quot; isn't magic tho, It's Innoruuk answering the prayers of the dieties. And I figure there's a major reason that Magicians, Enchanters, and Wizards are called &quot;The Forsaken&quot; and they are diametrically opposed to the Necros and SKs via thier alliance with Naythox Thex (Vs the Necros and Sks, who follow Cristianos Thex).  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You could say this about most cultures. I'm sure Erudites have Troubadours in thier courts, and Barbarians have Skalds around the campfire telling stories and singing songs (Theres only so much you can do when you're snowed in in Halas in the winter months). High Elves have just as ordered a society as Dark Elves, guess they need bards too.

Whatever. Dark Elves should be bards just because it would be cool. Its not like anyone pays attention to in-game lore anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u88"><b>Shizzythugmasta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p88">Goblins.   Can start in Runnyeye, Dagnor's Cauldron, or Sol A.  newb zones already nearby, already has some vendor's and a bank.  <br />
<br />
Kobolds start in North or South part of Stonebrunt.<br />
<br />
Sarnaks that start out of Dalnir or really really deep in Chardok.<br />
<br />
Luggalds that start in LoY.  Big race thats awesome at pure magic<br />
classes.<br />
<br />
Gnolls that start outta southpaw. <br />
<br />
An undead race of any kinda would be kickass.  Could start in Befallen or something like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u89"><b>Calamity_Daemon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p89">For all those people out there who dont believe anyone listens to game-lore anymore: YOU WRONG. My WHOLE guild on Inny server and there are more completely base our RP on the grounds of game lore. Without the lore there is nothing to base your character story on, his dialect, his determination, etc. As for the Erudite bards? That was probably the most...anyway...it wouldnt work because bards just dont fit in their culture. It just is...<br />
<br />
    If you want different types of classes seriously consider the Dancer. Dancer could be played by all elves, humans, and vah shir. Their dances would be enhancing to the group, deadly to the enemy, and darn fun to watch. I dunno...maybe Im just thinking about FFT too much but THAT is the class I want to see...and as for Dark Elf bards? It would work becuase bards are respected even with the dark elves...in a sense</div></div><hr />

Has anyone seen the dryads in jaggedpine? That seems like it would be a cool caster class to play. <br />
<br />
as far as melee class i would like to see? aviak would be an interesting melee class, but they don't show much lore in eq about them. anything that creeps off the dox in loy i would have an issue with. but one class i would love to see made is a centaur warrior, druid, ranger. <br />
<br />
think about it though, highly in tune with nature...blessed with not being purely animal, or human.<br />
<br />
that would rock.<br />
<br />
dark elf bards? only if they look like ozzy osbourn.<br />
<br />
gnome monks? that would remind me of yoda going nuts on sw2.<br />
<br />
but i can see centaurs as a melee combo.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u93"><b>Calamity_Daemon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p93">You say Dark Elves cannot be Bards because they are too &quot;primative&quot; or just really not connected to Tier'Dal culture? Well, really they are. Of course, we know the Erudites DO have singers and likely mistrels and so on but who says they have to be Erudite? An Erudite minstrel would be out of cultural bounds for the Erudite...but this is beside the point.<br />
<br />
   Dark Elves COULD be bards. Why? They could be bards because it is a form of worship for the Tier'Dal. I'm sure you don't go to church but in church songs are sung and rituals to be had (Communion for instance). Not to say that the clerics themselves could not handle it but surely there are, indeed, needed bards to lead these rituals. Then why can't Koada'Dal have them? Nothing says they can't really, however, because &quot;High Elves&quot; are so graceful I feel that they would take up dancing or something of the like. Besides, they don't really need bards for two reasons. One, Wood Elves are there all the time, and two, they are all born with beautiful voices and such.<br />
<br />
    I wouldn't play one for the &quot;bad-ass&quot; factor but rather that the history and roleplay value would fit and make sense...<br />
<br />
p.s. The Spurned, or the wizards, enchanters, and mages, are not necessarily &quot;spurned&quot; pre se. They are just like a poorer class of Tier'Dal. Pretty much the rich and powerful are Necromancers and Clerics (Though rare exceptions certainly apply). Rogues are probably the most hated but they fit in with Dark Elven culture because they have proven their culture mad by thousands of years of literally and figuratively stabbing themselves in the back. Bards would be a slight step above them in a sense...<br />
<br />
p.p.s TIER'DAL ARE NOT DROW!!</div></div><hr />

Also the tinkering got me thinking (And I'm kind of a FFT nut) of and engineering class.  Have your own class specific tradeskill (engineering) that could give you one shot 5 shot or 10 shot fun things.  Also engineered only weapons (slingshots, nunchucks for monks {no sword-chucks, sorry}, etc.)  Not married to the idea but it was a fun thought.  Would be very difficult to blend with the existing skills, if say you made a smoking flask (smoke grenade)  what skill delivers it.  Would be a nice creative outlet for designers do figure out fun things like strengthpants....</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u103"><b>Calamity_Daemon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p103">Ok...I thought about this a little bit during practice. (I have a lot of time to think then) and here it is:<br />
<br />
Mancers: Hybrids of the Magi class each specializing in one aspect of the Magi's job<br />
<br />
Pyromancer: Attuned to the world of fire. Able to use swords and axes (All these mancers will be able to they are melee and get watered down pets and spells but they work). Races: High Elf, Erudite, Dark Elf, Human. Born ability is Fireball which is the classic &quot;BURN!&quot; attack.<br />
<br />
Geomancer: Attuned to the world of earth. Yes your thinking of a druid but no. These are melee casters who can only summon earth pets (Like the pyro can only summon fire pets) they get crippling earth magic like the druid but also get powerful earth dd spells. Races High Elf, Erudite, Human, Dark Elf. Born ability would be to manipulate surroudings which would take anything around them and use it to do massive dmg to the enemy<br />
<br />
Aquamancer: Attuned to the world of water. They will get minor healing spells because water is the symbol of health and purity and they get water pets. Get severe water DD's and choke spells. Races: same as above. Born ability would be to evelop in water and slows movement and does a DoT depending on level and AA's.<br />
<br />
Aeromancer: Attuned to the world of air. Utility hybrid with spells that levitate and throw things and hit with all manner of air. Get choke spells and minor illusion spells. Air pets. Same races as above. Evac spells, Born ability would be a move like Whirl Till You Hurl only with massive results.<br />
<br />
All offshoots of the magi class and can be roleplayed well, just played well, and have some interesting side effects in groups. I think it would be a great class. They could wear up to chain mail armor and are meant only for damage not for taking it. (A lot like rangers in a way). Would be interesting to see if they could solo and all. Dunno, you decide</div></div><hr />
