<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>DarkQuark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So how long (after the release) do you think it will take us to see 65 Frogloks with epics that cannot play their way out of a wet paper bag?  ;)<br />
<br />
/shiver .. Brings back nasty memories of the first 60+ Gnome Sk's I ran across  (yes I know their is no Froglok SK's)<br />

With epics....<br />
<br />
Can't play their way out of a paper bag???<br />
<br />
Haven't run into many people like that myself, maybe its just you.<br />
<br />
<br />
who cares, sick and tired of people criticizing racial/class combos just because they are new.</div></div><hr />

65's...<br />
who cares, sick and tired of people criticizing racial/class combos just because they are new. <br />
<br />
 He didn't criticize because they are new... He just asked a question...<br />
<br />
You're just bitter because of his gnome SK reference..<br />
You must play a gnome...<br />
<br />
Heh, You DO play a gnome!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Uglugg Bloodsbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">People dont criticize just because their new, they criticize the ones that gain level 60 a month after they have been released. <br />
<br />
If you played your character properly you wont get 60 after a month unless you do not sleep - eat - or hit the shitter and spend  every single minute in game exping. If you see a new race / class at 60 or 65 after to short a time period of being released they have been PLed or played by mulitple players wich is against the EULA.<br />
<br />
Most people that get PLed to 60 don't know how to play their class and end up getting others killed, they become a pain in your ass during your leisure time that is why they are crticized.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Azariah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Frogloks are gonna own.  I wish I had time to play an alt... I'd play one in a second.<br />
<br />
Gnomes are dumb.  People suggested gnome Sks for 2 years, and each time someone brought it up, the were repeatedly told what a bad idea that was.<br />
<br />
<br />
Someone in-house at Sony didn't listen.  So the shadowknight class, which is supposed to be Scary, Brutal, and Malovelent is stuck with goofy little gnomes running around making a mockery of any RP value left in EQ.<br />
<br />
Thats just my 2cents about gnomes.<br />
<br />
Az</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mnayar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Dark I'd bet within 2 weeks you will see lvl 60+ frogloks and within 2-3 weeks at least one 65 froglok char. It's just way to easy to grind or pl or dual box a char these days.<br />
<br />
On a side note been thinking lately that later one the next &lt;cough&gt; expansion will contain Evil Frogloks like with the Euridites ( no idea why they couldn't do that this time.. oh wait yeah to charge us for another expansion )<br />
<br />
&lt;Shrug&gt; got illusioned last night, kept asking for Euri but ended up a gnomer evertime.. after a few minutes got used to it.. sssh don't tell anyone..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Akturus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">So far they've made 1 new evil race(Iksar) and 2 good races (vah shir, and now froggies)  i'd like to see a  new SK evil race i dunno, maybe gnolls? i think a gnoll SK would be cool, either that or let barbarians be SK's!!!   I know the latter is impossible, but i'd still like to see em.   And I'd have to agree with Mnayar, 3 weeks tops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Peasley Grunglefunk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">gnolls are retarded</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Lizarde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Aren't Vah Shir neutral?  They /con the same to evil and good races, and do not attack either of them on sight.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Akturus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Gnolls with upgraded graphics would pwn.  anyway, i meant vah-shir as good, in the sense of them in my pvp server, they are good.  but i think youre partially right, they can be neutral too, i think... I just know if i see a cat, I'm attacking it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Flanders</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I think lvl 1 Frogloks should look like the froglok tads in the feerott...and then 65's should look like mugglewump.  Everything in between should be the regular froglock...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Xadion Von'Darkborn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">all I know is to kill the gnomes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Medzgaleer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">gah who said add another sk playable race.  personally i'd like to see Gnomes, Erudites and Humans all go bye-bye as SK  playable race.<br />
<br />
DE, Ogre, Troll, Iksar  (imo)  flame away :-P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Antihero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Hey Lizarde, yes teh NPC are nuetral but the PC's are not on PVP..<br />
<br />
on PVP the teams are:<br />
<br />
Dark Races - Comprised of Iksar, Dark Elves, Ogres, and Trolls<br />
Short Races - Comprised of Dwarves, Halflings, and Gnomes.<br />
Elven Races - Comprised of Half Elves, Wood Elves, and High Elves.<br />
Human Races - Comprised of Humans, Erudites, Barbarians, and Vah Shir<br />
<br />
And now the Frogloks are getting add to the human side..<br />
<br />
The teams are way lopsided.. and on PVP you will find alot of the other teams will group up and kill dark races..<br />
<br />
And yea they need to come up with another DR playable toon...but not gnolls or orcs(at least like the ones that are roaming through most zones) Maybe crushbone orcs =)..but would like to see a new race completely..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Pallid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I've yet to see anything that suggests Frogloks will be added to the Human team in PvP.<br />
<br />
I'm hoping they will be added to the shorties seeing how they are a small race.<br />

<br />
Oh and as for the &quot;Dur, no human/gnome/erudite SKs&quot; post up a few:<br />
The first shadowknight ever was a human, iirc.<br />
Erudite SKs were introduced before Iksar, and are trés cooler.<br />
Gnomes are good for killing elves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Zolexa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">No Humans?!?<br />
<br />
Why I ought to hunt you down and kill you in your sleep.  While you so called &quot;evil&quot; races are just born that way and could  be misconstrued as misunderstood, us humans have &quot;chosen&quot; our evil way of life.  Turned away from our own kind and our own humanity. That is truely evil in it's finest.<br />
<br />
/grins sadistically</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>shadowblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">NOPE All those classes you mentioned are very viable shadowknights. Get rid of gnomes tho .. thx</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Buliwyk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">You'll see a 65 Froglok in 3 days.<br />
<br />
Epic?  10 days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Antihero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">well this is what i have read to prove it but was told by someone dont remember who but they told me they read on the EQ forums. I got this form the history of the frogloks when you look them up..<br />
<br />
* Seeking justice for the imprisonment of their father, the Northmen joined with the Froglok armies and the *alliance of Froglok and Man* succeeded in freeing their father Mithaniel Marr. The minions of Cazic-Thule and the Avatar of Fear himself fell before the unity and valor of the children of Marr. For the first time in the history of Norrath, the swamps were not safe for the evil creations of the dark gods.*<br />
<br />
So that is all the proof i have for now but.......As always I could be wrong..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>StruzorGnome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">If the people have the means and knowledge to get to 65 and get an epic that quick, they must be good players. . you original poster, are a moron.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Kebsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Not really.  Most of the people who make it to 65 in two weeks will be powerleveled by an alt, or a friend, meaning they'll miss the learning phase of the more subtle aspects of EQ, such as aggro management, pulling, things  like that.</div></div><hr />
