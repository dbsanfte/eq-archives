The group that we farmed with was only: lvl 60 SK, lvl 60 Monk and a lvl 60 Shaman.<br />
Was a bit tough when we had 3 adds cause of the new Amygdalan Protector roaming<br />
down there in the sewers but we made it through cause I kept aggro on me all the time<br />
and the shaman could keep slowing and healing without trouble.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes very simple, see GD Crash 3 times over 2 days because of a buggy script.<br />
<br />
Then see multiple waves of giants pop when it was triggered right after serverup...<br />
<br />
Or how about...<br />
<br />
It truly is simple!</div></div><hr />

Must be doable with 2 groups of 60's after a 30mins fight.<br />
<br />
CT boots = easiest, because you just need to spend some time farming cash to get em, group not needed, guild not needed, just cash...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">silthus</div><div class="date">05-29-2002, 04:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually the camp where the FT III boots drop is not that bad. You don't need 6 60s, as long as you have an FD puller (which you obviously will). 56+ would be a good idea though. Chanter should be at least 56. I'm 60, so not sure how much worse the aggro range is if you are lower.<br />
<br />
This is one camp where SKs really shine IMO. Most of the stuff you have to pull is Slimes. There are 3 classes -- Oozes, Swirling Ooze and Pool of Slime. Never bring back more than 2. And never bring back more than 1 PoS. The PoS are pretty nasty. They hit pretty fast, max at 210 and Enrage. <br />
<br />
Bonus is the Slimes do not cast. They are also static spawns, so are very easy to split. As an SK, you can pull and MA. With your Taunt skill, you also let the chanter Slow the MOBs. Most chanters aren't willing to try slowing with a Warrior MA down there.<br />
<br />
Your problem will be that there are two types of drops here -- the Boots and the Mosquito Leg Earring. Both are uber items. (There is one Mosquito PH in the camp that you will have to clear as well. Basically the equivalent of a PoS.) Typically, groups go NBG -- casters roll on boots, while melees roll on the earring. <br />
<br />
The Named MOBs that drop the items are pretty rare. I've spent a total of about 14 hours down there and have seen 2 Boots drops and one Earring (I won that one:)) Bonus is that XP here is unreal. I have yet to find a better XP camp.<br />
<br />
I don't really solo that much any more, so am not interested in the Boots. But they aren't unobtainable, if you can get a solid group together.<br />

<br />
He does have a load of hp's but only took us about 15 mins to drop him. Our lvl 60 warrior went ass up half way through the fight and a 56 Ogre sk tanked for the rest. Poor guy dropped 5 seconds before Zel died.<br />
<br />
The main prob with him was his ae stun on the clerics while they were trying to heal. Not sure if its disease based or magic based, I had over 90 resists in both and only got stunned once through whole fight.<br />
<br />
Didnt drop a tomb of self reflection but did drop 2 nice bracers, one was bracer of fortitude ( I think) ac 12 sta 15 sv all 6.<br />

<br />
Druid earring and the Solstice earring for my druid, and the Solstice earring for my shadow knight.<br />
<br />
The worst part is all the combines, might take a couple of tries to get the final pieces completed, even at 250 skill it seems.  The final combine at the end is said to be no-fail also.<br />
<br />
The major timesink is all the foraging.  Spent about 3 hours in plane of growth foraging up 4 of the planar oak things.</div></div><hr />
