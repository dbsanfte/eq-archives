<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Darkadian Dy'Shaynn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok here is the scoop,  I go to Toxx and have a necro dude i know turn in Souleech and Blade of Abrigation(sp?) then i turn in my decrepit sheath and my ghoul's bane...... then nothing? I mean WTF you people said the swords could be MQ'ed why did he eat my crap we are both DE and both Apprehensively to Bloodpool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Khat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">[i]both Apprehensively to Bloodpool. [/B] <br />
<br />
Apprehensively != Indifferent or better</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kyrkii Sa'Kyttn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Keep hearing these stories; it's simple, you didn't research thoroughly.  If you'd done what &quot;us people&quot; have said countless times it would have been fine, ie using hide trick to raise faction to indifferent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Darkadian Dy'Shaynn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">ive done all my other turn in's with this faction not to mention I read all over this board and didnt see anything saying turn your faction indiff to turn in.. all i saw was quick walkthrough and invis trick which none of them ever said you had to do for MQ's it just said basically that you could do them to skip ahead in the quest or save faction</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shaedii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Then you didn't research very well, or you don't read very well. It has been stated a million times that there are different levels of apprehensive. Just becuase your neco buddy cons appre doesn't mean shit. He should have had someone invis him after initializing the trade to be sure he had high enough faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dachande</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Wow, look here!  That was hard! (http://forums.shadowknight.org/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=7112) <br />
<br />
My walkthrough has been on the first page for a while now, I don't know how anyone looking for info could miss it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Darkadian Dy'Shaynn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">OK as retarded as i am GM had compassion and gave my items back... now i got one final question<br />
<br />
I know how to do MQ now have him put stuff in trade window get invis make sure he is indiff and then trade but what i want to make sure is if this still work and if Bloodpool will say anything when he does turn in like<br />
<br />
i asked for the decepit sheath and ghoulbane also.. or will i be able to know if it works<br />
<br />
GM said if i mess up again they will not refund.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dachande</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You're lucky you even got your stuff back.  Make sure that he cons indifferent before you hit trade and it will be fine.  Same with your necromancer friend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Darkadian Dy'Shaynn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">thank you so much and sorry im a noob :\ i did it and all i could think was F me i knew i should have been more carefull</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Azaryl LVeldrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Wow...you got a lucky break there.  Glad to hear it worked out in the end.  Not all GM's would be so forgiving when your actually cheating the quest.<br />
<br />
Good luck with Lhranc :)<br />

In darkness,</div></div><hr />
