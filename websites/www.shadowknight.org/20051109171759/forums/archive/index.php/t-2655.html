I was wondering about the Bone Mail Quest for Dark Elves.  I know how to make silk thread (which you need plenty of) I know where to get wolf pelts of various qualities.  But where can I get calcified bone parts?  And at lvl 9, will I need help (as in a group) obtaining them?  I have a friend I play with and he is a lvl 9 wood elven ranger, could we do this part together? <br />

your wood elf friend might find nek forest a little hot at level 9, make sure you keep an eye out for the guards, they will not be well-disposed to him, on the other hand it's a nice challenge<br />
have him bound in west freeport and you should check for guards wandering near zone-in for him, go immediately left along wall and follow zone wall round, carefully avoiding sundry nasties (orcs, shadowmen, undead,etc), the piranhas in the river are nasty watch out for them when you cross, keep heading north until you hit the uticle<br />
there is the lavastorm zone nearby but it is guarded, also it occurs to me the inkies at the fire might chase your friend too<br />
anyway i really like the new nek forest, lots of variety and things to do, best of luck</div></div><hr />
