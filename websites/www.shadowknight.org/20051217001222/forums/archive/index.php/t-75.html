<br />
Due to the increased costs of running the EverQuest game service, and constantly adding new and challenging content, we will be increasing our subscription rates in April. Effective April 25, the new monthly subscription rate will be $12.95/month. We will continue to offer discounts from the new rate plan on multi-month subscriptions. The new price for a 3-month subscription will be $35.85 and a 6-month subscription will now be $65.70. You don't have to do a thing; you will automatically be migrated to the new billing structure under your current subscription plan when your current subscription plan expires.<br />
<br />
However, for a limited time, extend your current subscription for an additional 12 or 24 months by signing up for the EQ 12 or 24 month plan and reap great savings.<br />
<br />
Between April 10th and April 24th we're offering a huge discount on the new monthly subscription price:<br />
<br />
A 12-month subscription costs only $109 US -- that's a huge 30% discount off of the new monthly plan!<br />
<br />
Even better, a 24-month subscription costs only $190 US -- a 39% savings off of the new monthly plan!<br />
<br />
Now is the time to lock in these rates, so don't miss out.<br />
<br />
For more detailed information go to www.everquest.com/rates<br />

WTF do they think please. Not enough customers for their Stormhammer-Server to pay the Gms on that server ? Or do they need more and better Hardware ? <br />

<br />
1. other games are getting away with it, so there doing it to, in order to increase profits... say with the 10/month 7 of that goes towards expenses and 3 is pure profit, increasing to 13/month doubles the profit.<br />
<br />
2. inflation means that prices need to raise</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cephas</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 05:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Grrrr. I knew DAoC charging 12.95 was going to be a bad thing.<br />
<br />
Now I need to start cancelling out my mmorpg accounts to make sure I only have 2 active at a time :/ (I like to be able to log into ac/eq/daoc depending on my mood... no more. just one eq and one daoc *cry*).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mystina</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 06:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">EQ is well worth it anyway, they know it, they increase profits from it.<br />
<br />
Lets just hope it would increase service too ( less bugs, more extra-revamped zones, guides that know something else in EQ that how killing a fire beetle with a lvl 2 warr )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaeldavan</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 06:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Im paying my own and my GFs account and the increase isnt really that hard. Was just wondering and a bit shocked to find a email from Sony in my Mailbox. Eq is still a good game and I will play it on. No game held me for more then 2 weeks before I got Everquest. Im playing now since 23 Months (28 April will be two years) and im still not finished yet.</div></div><hr />
