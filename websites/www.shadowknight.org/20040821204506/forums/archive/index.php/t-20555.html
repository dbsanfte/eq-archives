<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kebsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey, here's what I'd like to do.  I'd like to record a couple of hours of Windows Media Player visualizations and burn it to a DVD.  Does anyone know of a way to do that?  Preferably with keeping the resolution as intact as possible.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>brian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">are you planning on tripping someplace that only has a dvd player?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kebsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, me and a couple of friends are setting up a show at a dance club.  The place has a bunch of televisions circling the dance floor and we were thinking of stuff we can put on the screens when the music is playing.  We decided the visualizations from WMP would be pretty cool but we have to figure out a way to record them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nikab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">you will need to do some video capture. The best thing to do would be talk to the DJ at the club and see if you can set up a machine to input the Dj's music into WMP at the time of the party, then output the machine to all the TV's that way the visuals match the music. Otherwise i would put on some fucked up discovery channel stuff with like lions eating baby elk's. Thats always a big hit :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kebsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well one of the friends I mentioned is the DJ, so I'll talk to him about that.  Thanks.  But, if we fail to be able to hook the TV's up to the machine, the next best thing would be to just make a handful of generic DVDs of the visualizations.<br />
<br />
edit: note, we are all temporarily poor so we can't really buy any new machines.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nikab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If your video card dosnt have video out then your best shot it to hook up a ps2 or somthing for visualisations. Most video cards have some form of video out weather its S-video, RCA or somthing else. If you think linking your machine up to the TV systems is a good idea but your video card wont support it you could always spent $100 on a new video card that has video out. I know your to broke for a new machine but a new vid card is fairly cheap. <br />
<br />
          Not to mention the money you could potentially make from drug sales with in the club :D</div></div><hr />

Free download, and will record directly from whatever is on your screen.<br />
<br />
Probably won't match up, but if I'm picturing some of those images, it really won't matter. (at least I can't tell what swirl or whatever matches up with which beat)<br />
<br />
Hmm...actually....<br />
<br />
this is really gonna depend how good your machine is.  There's an option for time sensitive recordings, but it makes my machine freak out (p4 1.2 tho &gt;&lt;).<br />
<br />
Enh, might help you, might not.  Give it a shot and play with the settings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>natus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">if you have access to a laptop that would probably be best due to space and shit connecting to the video system, just make sure you have cables that are long enough.<br />
<br />
use winamp and get the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.arkaos.net&quot;&gt;arkaos&lt;/a&gt; plugin.<br />
<br />
for some decent dvds with grahpics, check out:<br />
Chillout Experience (Cold Front/Ktel) - the trance portion of the dvd works fairly well, a little repetitive but with some creative video mixing and effects can be overcome...the downtempo stuff is more environmental/airy<br />
<br />
Also, try the MFS (Made For Success) videos, they're a little older but very, very good...MFS I features a Paul Van Dyk audio mix with CG video mixed over top, quality stuff.  I believe they went to 7 or so but it's been awhile.<br />
<br />
For general video background noise, I like to use Clockwork Orange, House of 1000 Corpses, 2001, DMC DJ Champonships vids, or random anime.  I think Q Bert has a pretty trippy dvd out too but I might have the wrong dj...was a little cooked on New Year's.<br />
