<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Pelter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I´m in a rather slack guild that raids parttime in the EPs and is slowly starting to move into GoD. The best geared people (and more imporantly - holy trinity)in the guild are now mainly exping in RSS and getting some decent upgrades from there. My question is basically what it takes for a SK to tank decently in here? Getting guildgroups here do not seem to be possible atm, warriors are considered a must as tanks (and might very well be considering our level of gear).<br />
<br />
Considering my gear and AAs, how much will I have to improve before tanking RSS is a viable option?<br />
<br />

Thankful for any replies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kelefane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You could probably tank RSS...But would need a damn good cleric w/ a nice mana pool b/c they are gonna basically have to chain CH on you the entire time...I'd try and get my AC over 2k+ before even attempting it if I were you...But how your gear is atm, its doable but may have some down time if your not w/ a cleric thats atleast Time + Geared.<br />
<br />
Edit: I'd try and get to 2k+ AC 8k+ HP unbuffed before even trying to tank RSS. Im 2.2k AC / 9.1k all unbuffed and if my cleric isnt that greatly geared and doesnt pay attention, I'll go splat....But only camps ive done there are 70s/65s...Not sure if there are any other camps w/ mobs that dont hit as hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Elkar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've been able to tank for extended periods of time at as low as 10.5khp/2200AC buffed.  The healer has to be good and attentive, and you want a fearless slower.  Still, it's easy to go splat, but I think the risks are worth the rewards.<br />
<br />
Watch out for wandering enchanters, they like to haste other mobs.  Pull the ones you think are hasted with a nulify if you are pulling too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kelefane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah, as Elk said the rewards are in RSS are hella nice and well worth a rocky trip w/ deaths if you can get a solid group there....Aug all your ear/finger slots w/ 70hp augs in 70s camp and a pretty good BP drops in 65s called Celestial Lorica (EP Quality), 72ac / 140hp ect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Menon Lifeblight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It's going to be rocky with you tanking in RS.  Even with a great slower and healer, and perfect single pulls, you will die occasionally anyway.  These mobs will quad + bash/kick for close to 1300 a pop.  A couple unlucky rounds before the mobs is slowed and you're toast.<br />
<br />
Three pieces of advice.  First, get your OoW defensive AAs.  You put them off too long already.  Second, learn to pull RS like a pro.  Although snare splitting isn't real important in most camps, it's easy to mistime a wanderer and bring back two mobs.  Learn the number of wanderers, pathing, and spawn points of the mobs, always bring singles, and you'll start getting a lot of group invites.  Intelligent pullers make or break groups in RS.  You don't have to tank to be useful here.  Third, if you're going to tank, bring a necro.  The necro can keep the mana up on your cleric who will be fast healing, and can FD/rez when the shit hits the fan.  As Elkar said, the loot in this zone is worth a few wipes.<br />
<br />
You can check my magelo.  Even when I buff to 2.3k AC/12k hp, with full defensive AAs, this zone is no picnic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xanathol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You should be able to tank there. A lil low on the HP, and you'll want a chanter and necro there to make sure the cleric always has some form of crack on, and the necro to twitch if a mob gives you a bad time. Plus, MW helps tons. As long as your group is decent, you shouldn't wipe, unless you have a bad run with charm or a gating mob. With your stats, I wouldn't suggest CHs for your cleric - use the 'Light' line of heals. It costs more mana to heal ya, but it costs even more mana to res &amp; rebuff the group if ya'll wipe bc the tank dies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>sothy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">best way is to try it if you can get a grp.<br />
i think you can tank there now or very close to it. GL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Silvershadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I tanked with a good deal less hp and ac just fine (only the buffs available at camp), no real problems or downtime (until a named started charming us... but that's a different story altogether), but that was with a druid doing backup heals also. The point being that you can, it's just hard and you might need backup heals. Theft of pain endlessly cycling certainly helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>zentaran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm pretty similar geared and have the same problem: MPG is fine but RS just isn't possible. I did try 1 mob in there once with a reasonable group but the cleric had to spam the heals and used far too much mana to maintain. I'm working on the OoW defensive AAs as they are a must and I'll try again once those are done. Even then, I can't see it happening as in a Time/Ikkinz level guild, I have got 0 invites to that zone, independent on what AAs I have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>kilst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Im able to tank there with a cleric and shaman as backup healer. Yes I die a few times, but like its been said, the risk is worth the rewards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">RS is hard.  Give it the respect its due.  If people arent on the ball you will wipe...even good group still wipe there due to bad luck.<br />
<br />
Honestly, a well aa'd 9k unbuffed 2k ac sk should be fine there.  There are excellent upgrades there.  And the exp is good and pulls are easy once you get used to it.  After I leveled up the 70 in elementals I spent all my aa time in RS.<br />
<br />
You need a solid healer.  You need to garner agro before the mob is in camp.  You need a slower that trusts you to do the later and slows asap.  Those are the things you need.<br />
<br />
As you get higher in AC/HPs you can pull it off with a crazy slower and druid healer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I've tanked there some... reasonably well with 8.3k/2200 AC unbuffed (11.5-12k/2500 buffed while exp grouping).  While it's a bit rough, it's doable... really the less you have, the more your healer(s) have to be on the ball, and the more of a mana sponge you will be, but if you're determined I'm sure you can do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Mriu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well I finally got a group in RS today, and 5 mins after I got there, the tank had to log.  So I got to be the new tank.  First time I had attack on by accident, and it sucked.  40% mana for the cleric we were scared.  Second mob didn't attack.  Snare didn't land on the pull, so I got whomped on the way in with a few pre slowed hits, then went to town casting cd and ac/atk taps and an occasional lifetap.  Ended up with me taking about 10-12% of the clerics mana a pull, and never having a danger of dieing (unless I got stupid and attacked).<br />
<br />
Was in there at the toppa the stairs (sure there's harder places, I was just happy to get a group in the damn place), and before I got taps off I was at 9650hp and 1810ac (1977 with tap landing).  Easy time just need a group that's willing to let ya tank and a healer that can do his job...<br />
<br />

<br />
Oh, my magelo isn't updated atm, having a time with it lately.  I think I have all my aa's and gear  good, just have a bunch of augs gotta put in...</div></div><hr />

<br />
By this, do you mean attack was off to avoid ripostes?  Not being a smarty here, just curious (I haven't set foot in RSS yet myself).  But if so, it's startling that ripostes made that much difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hrmmmm tanking without hitting mob is sad panda !</div></div><hr />

<br />
They don't make that much of a difference.  Mobs in RS can hit from &lt;300 to about 1300, so damage is very streaky.  He had a bad streak on the first mob, turned off attack, and then attributed his better results to the lack of ripostes.  I've read that RS mobs riposte a little more than normal, and possibly this is true, but it's certainly not enough to make a visible difference.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Our definition of easy is clearly not the same.  With &lt;10k hp, 1.8k ac, and 130ish aa, there is nothing easy about tanking in RS.  Sounds like MPG would be a real challenge.  I don't care how much your healer 'can do his job', you have zero margin for error (or just bad luck) on every pull.  I don't believe that even chain CHing would keep up a tank with those stats, and being forced to use fast heals on every mob, with the resulting frequent med breaks, does not qualify as 'easy'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Mriu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Sorry fer lack of responses, had to go underway for a couple days to escape the wrath of a typhoon (which missed us anyhow).<br />
<br />
erm yes, I didn't attack to avoid riposts.  And yes, I tried turning it on again after a couple mobs to see if it was a streak that I hit, and no, it wasn't.  Avoiding the riposts at my hp/ac was a better choice for me.<br />

Please accept my humblest apologies for not being as uber as you.  You play your game, let me play mine.  I like challenging scenarios, and am happy when I can achieve things that others say are tough.  I can understand you like things safer (and I guess you're on a blue server as well?), and you don't see me here telling you that you can't do something that you remember doing do you?  One mob we had the cleric die on the pull (tossed a hot on me when the snare I was pulling with didn't land and got whomped).  With slow, stuns, and shaman healing, I was able to tank that one as well.  So don't tell me that it's too hard for someone with my hp/ac to do and there's no margin for error.  And don't tell me that there's no way I could do something that I obviously did either.  I posted this to answer a question that was asked on the first post.  It takes skill, a good group, and moderate gear.  The better your gear, the less of the other 2 it takes.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kaotix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I tank there at 10k/1700 buffed.<br />
My guild is pre-elemental and there are only a handfull of us that go there.  We have done some named just past the top of the stairs and to the right..Neuromancer or something like that in one room, plus another that is not far from there.<br />
We havent wiped or lost anyone (yet), but the people I group with know their class well and we know what to expect from each other; that probably has something to do with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Ravilicus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I tank RS with my SK bot (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=240672) grouped with a Shaman and Cleric.  The extra HPs from the Shaman buffs along with the support healing makes it alot easier, and of course having Slow is vital.  If your cleric can handle the extra mana tax, getting buffed with Panoply of Vie also helps smooth out damage spikes and makes the initial pull (before Slow has landed) safer.<br />
<br />
The only difficulty I have had is with mobs that Charm or mesmerize.  I haven't tried the self-dot potion to handle mezz but I assume this would be just as effective as always.<br />
<br />
I never tanked it before level 70 or with less than max defensive AAs through GoD (excluding OoW AAs), but I suspect it would be a serious challenge to a toon lacking VT+ gear.<br />
<br />
If you only have a single healer (Cleric), I think you would need at least 10k HP and 2k AC, and at least the &quot;basic&quot; defensive AAs for dodge and mitigation to pull it off without frequent downtime.  Shield Block makes a difference too since dodging even 7% of the time is remarkable when the mob can quad for up to 1.3k damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Valkyria Grymreaper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Tried RS for the first time the other day. Buffed was 11.1K hps &amp; got to 2200 AC and did all named at the statue camp. Guild healer I was with was kick ass though, but it didnt seem as hard as I'd thought it would be. /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>brokenlimit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">friends and i have been trio'ing the prefect camp, sorta difficult but not that bad.  i play myself and a decently geared/aa'd 70 cleric, friend plays his monk, other friend his bard.  you just literally have to chain ch yourself, and pay attention, because the dps is really really spikey.  i've seen quads for 1100x4, and then the next 3 rounds does about 250 dmg total, it just varies.  playing a cleric really isn't difficult, it's actually easier when you're tanking because you pay attention to your hp, heh.  one other thing to note is how much dread gaze helps.  we were duoing prefect camp in the hallway near taromani, and every now and then we'd get 2.  if i was fast enough with gaze i could get the add on me while the bard mezes.  it helps immensely when there are adds, though, for the most part when you learn the spawns/camps, there really shouldn't be any.  haven't quite finished the oow defensives, but with 2400ac ish and aura of pain it's not difficult.  really, it's just all about your healer, slower, and puller.  a ranger could tank it fine if the others are good.  maybe the DoN discs will help too.</div></div><hr />
