<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Krassus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">should i keep PLing which is slow ? or should i just group him and let him leech ? Any ideas where ? BoT, Tactics, PoN, PoD ?<br />
<br />
Hes 55 has Vindi BP, Ornate greatblade, rest ornate, cowl of mortality and some NtoV gear</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ugloid foo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">With that gear do you really need to ask?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>yuggoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">In anticipation of so many others to come, I will start the flaming...<br />
<br />
Die, please...  or go somewhere (Lguk, Seb, HS maybe?) and learn how to play an SK.<br />
<br />
<br />
What is it about putting &quot;PL&quot; and &quot;SK&quot; together that makes me cringe?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">showing off?<br />
<br />
I have been playing almost 2 years and don't have that kind of stuff. Just be happy you have nice gear and enjoy playing. <br />
<br />
Why is everyone always in such a rush to get to the end game anyway. Just relax, have a little fun, and enjoy the journey.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It bothers me that by reviewing all your posts you appear to be a player with knowledge of the high end game.  You are PLing an incredibly multi-faceted class to that level quickly (you've only been on the board less than 2 weeks so I assume you started the SK then.  <br />
<br />
Please take time, and 55 seems to be a good spot, to learn and play with the sk and learn what he can do, and more importantly, what he should be doing.<br />
<br />
He'll need to learn: FD split, agro control and a hundred other things.  Having him leach exp will leave him with awful skills.<br />
<br />
HS is great exp, you can start to master the FD split.<br />
Seb works, CoM works.  Take some time to play him and learn what it is like not to have the crutch of a high level bailout.  Heck if you want to avoid those grueling training area, take him to pov and be an off tank and work his way up to MT for the cgroup, at least you'll learn and exp is fast.<br />
<br />
An SK without scars and balls doens't seem, well, very skish.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>ugloid foo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">This is more of a bragging post than anything else. He lists all of his gear, is a guildleader of a guild that is NToV capable so obviously knows where to hunt, makes a statement that powerleveling is slow so does he really need an answer?<br />
<br />
Heres your anwser to your real question, yes you have nice gear for a 55 sk twink.<br />
<br />
kkthxbye</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Krassus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well thanks for the great advice dicks !!! didnt come here to brag but for advice and actually i know how to play a SK fine, im asking WHERE is good in your opinions. This is my 5th 65 char and everyone i have leveled differently pertaining to the specific characters skills.<br />
<br />
Pulling well i use Torrent so far b/c of range, but i keep a BIO orb in bags to split range pulls. Proximity pulling i have loved the SK more than my monk just because of his tanking ability. I dont need anyone to teach me anything about playing him i have read these boards way before most even started playing but registered when i started my SK 2 weeks ago. I like the versatility of playing a SK pulling, tanking, self invis, self healing, fear kiting.<br />
<br />
In my experience when someone asks me for warrior advice about where to go i ask, what AA, lvl and whats gear like ? If gear is good id say goto Fire C1 or Tactics, maybe gear lacking PoN. Please forgive me for posting gear, so sorry i tried to be informative so i could get better advice. I have enjoyed the game for years thanks and i like to play all different classes to understand them and have fun. I got plenty of scars on my Warrior and monk from starting a guild from scratch and working hard to get where i am.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Krassus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Keevel thanks for the advice btw, ill have to try PoValor once i flag him. As far as splitting goes SK seems awesome so far havent really split much high end but i did split ToV flurries and random mini named. I have a 65 monk with 100+aa i leveled so know the pulling dynamics and prox and range pulling. On SK i have to get used to the cast time but snare splitting combined with bio orb on SK &gt;&gt; monk. Just wish SK had a insta FD button like FD. I warped Vindi easy with SK much easier than with a monk just cause of the range i could cast from =D not to mention pulled idol through the floor in arena by sitting on top of his area and taunting, something a monk cant do<br />

<br />
So why again are you asking for people to tell you where or how to level?<br />
<br />
It seems to me with 5 level 65s and getting your sk twink to 55 in 2 weeks you would be able to answer your own question.</div></div><hr />

Every class is different for casters FD Pling with monk in velks, CoM owns. For a warrior who can DS tank PL maybe sebilis with a train. For Enc leaving in group in PoInnovation rocked. Just in my opinion some classes are better in different zones</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was hoping that you had an appreciation for the differences between classes.  <br />
<br />
The only thing PoV won't give you is the exp vs. undead.  Didn't do undead on my sk until the mid 30's and DAMN!  it's bit of an ego builder.  Also think PoV you just need 55, don't think you need a flag.<br />
<br />
Not sure where to go do the undead thing though if you want Planar....(sorry I avoid Planes with my chars for the most part)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Xikuliz Litecleaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">PoV mobs hit too hard for a 55 SK.  You'd just be a crutch for the group, unless you get a guild group that doesn't mind I guess.  <br />
<br />
Charsis is cool.  I'm in there alot.  Pulling isn't bad, alot of things can still be pacified by us, at least one mob in a room, around the beginning of the wings.  Take a gate potion or some way to get out with you.  Chardok would be good too, can do short fears around the zone in.<br />
<br />
If this is weak to you, then go to Torgorian Mines and toe to toe things.  The XP is awesome, but I have a hard time doing it.  Save all the shackle keys and turn them in to resistance miners for more XP.  If you kill your way to a bridge, just past there is the entrance to Nadox.  The bridge in Torgorian Mines and the part of Nadox you zone into from TM is good hunting grounds, Nadox being more realistic then deep Torgorian.  There is alot of undead around LoY as well.  Luggalds in Gunthank and Dulak would be good XP too.  All LoY zones have a 15% xp bonus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Krassus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Tried PoValor last night got him trial and i had to bring warrior to tank at 55 he was getting rocked, exp was decent with him in a full group he has just hit a plateau. Gonna try LoY out tho</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jodgrim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Tried Droga yet?<br />
<br />
Lots of Kunark style casters so not many hps, burn most of thier mana on pull, pussy melee, and run early, nice big ZEM there too. With a good group you could grind out most of the zone with little trouble and maybe even get the other group members some AA.<br />
<br />
edit: bazaar loot isnt bad either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Mythicle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">try the deep it has nice XP bonus and is easily the best xp spot cause it is so quite except for the people who come in for shards.<br />
<br />
the +40% xp mod rocks.  at 65 i am gettin 2.5% blue AA for LB and solid 3% or close to 4 from DB mobs and this is duo'ing with my hydra which is a 65 shamie and 55 SK my SK is gettin 1.5% normal XP a kill from both or very close to it  while grouped if you cross the bridge and go alittle deeper the xp gets alot better for my Hydra.<br />
<br />
-Mythicle</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sithanator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Try VP, sub 60 that was good exp. and still very good post 60. Also sound like you have resources to get the key completed in no time at all.<br />
<br />
Edit: Generally speaking you will have greater enjoyment playing your Sk in area where creature don't have retarded disease resists(or felt out immune). At 55 you will feel this alittle, the higher you get the more you will notice this.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Atlis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Maiden's eye is the opening to uber SK practice.<br />
At any moment someone can and most likely will train ten skeletons, xi vius, wolves, and bats right through your hunt.  This is where you learn to exp in the midst of catastrophe.<br />
Practice your high end splits by using the goranga scouts anywhere in the zone.  They're level 55, so decent exp.<br />
You've been PL'd, try fear kiting.  Learn what kind of mess you can make by fearing once too many times.  Also, appreciate fear kiting while you can.<br />
I don't care how many 65's you have, the SK is not something you learn in 2 weeks.  SK is a completely self sufficient class in that it can survive and prosper in just about any circumstance, but it takes practice and skill to do.  Quadding with a druid is not the same as kiting with a SK.  Pulling with a monk is not the same as pulling with a SK.  Tanking as a warrior is not the same as tanking as a SK.  DPS, likewise, is not the same.<br />
Once you graduate from Maiden's Eye, go to the exp zones you've gone to with your other 65 chars.  Without knowing how to split higher end mobs, or how to get OR manage your aggro (getting PL'd says you haven't practiced tanking in groups enough), your exp zones will suck no matter where you go.<br />
<br />
When I was level 59, a level 65 shadow knight asked me how to keep aggro.  I hold him in the same regard as I do those who ask me for ports, rez's, and shaman buffs.<br />
Stop PL'ing, learn how to solo cleanly, then practice grouping in low danger areas such as Plane of Justice before you hit zones that kill your groupmates in three seconds.<br />
<br />
Expect a flame when you've done this 5 times and still do not know how to do it on your own.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Grarg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Bah.<br />
<br />
I pl'd my sk to 65, hd fun, played enough necro's/monks/warrs to not need a lecture on fear kiting etc.<br />
<br />
55, if you have healer and slower backup you should be able to cut it well in POI, after that BOT. Beez in BOT are lvl 61/62, great xp, and easily singles without harmony type spells. They cast like #$%#$ and can be long fights with the heals, but they are great xp.<br />
<br />
As an indicator, if you can tank an archaic and live you can xp tank beez in bot.<br />
<br />
I still spend time huntng Beez in BOT with my shammy, got all my EP's and SP's for spells from there, rarely had to buy spells.<br />
<br />
Tried a few zones but no others really compete. And tactics mobs mitigate slow unless your in the pit, and the pit has roamer issues and needs crowd control.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
