<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">If level 70 is the new cap:<br />
Are skill caps raising after 65?<br />
Will stats be capped at higher than 305?<br />
<br />
Just wondering if anything has been heard, didn't find anything on the SoE boards.</div></div><hr />

I never ever heard anything about skill caps being lifted at all. ;( Maybe AA will reflect that?<br />
<br />
I heard rumors that stats cap would be increased to 400. JUST a rumor.. Also, I heard rumor that new SHM stat spells would be only spells that could go over stat cap which can make their stat spells more useful than before. Remember.. Just a rumor. :D That's all I know so far.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Askeer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I dont know about you but our shaman(s) just cast mgb focus and thats it about buffs really, with the exception of a ToT here and there. Pretty slim for the supposedly best buff class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kemora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hehe, most of our shaman get anoyed if you ask them for anything but focus :p &quot;You mean you aren't 305 in everything?? /sigh&quot;<br />
<br />
The other half of the time they have no mana anyways cause they felt like slowing on inc~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grimrod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Try being a shaman in Uqua.  Unlike your shaman, the ones in my guild keep FA up on the melees all night long.</div></div><hr />
