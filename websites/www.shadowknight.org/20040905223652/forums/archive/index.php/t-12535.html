OGRE faction Sucks.  Rallos Zek faction Sucks and SK faction Sucks.  The worst of the worst hate me.  As far as a Tank goes.  Ogre not stunning is priceless.  I started a ranger the other day and i had to delete it because Getting Stunned constently Sucks, Expeclly for a caster.  Experence SUCKS. lvled with a guildie Gnome SK who passed me up 3 Lvls' in the Same Group in the same zone in the same week.</div></div><hr />

Oh, and by the way, faction doesn't matter a whole lot in the grand scheme of things.  We work on it when we must, and ruin the rest with reckless abandon.</div></div><hr />
