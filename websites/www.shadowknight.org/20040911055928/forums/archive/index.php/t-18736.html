<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kelefane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering if its possible to have a race change? That maybe a dumb question.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Calamity_Daemon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I thought about that once...but I dont think so...If you did you would have to take all your gear and put it in the bank slots or whatever. Dunno, try asking a GM...they need to be bugged anyway...bastards</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I know another post here said they don't do gender changes so I'm guessing they don't do race changes.  Once you choose your base model (race/gender) there is no going back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Considering the different starting stats and special features of the different races, I'd presume that getting a GM to change your race would be impossible, not even considering the PITA it would be equipment wise.  And if they're unwilling to change gender (which should simply be a flag of some sort designating which model to display), I'd say that you're S.O.L.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>ZarrosLivinglight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It could be done, but you'd want to do it as such:<br />
<br />
Change to race with xp penalty (or penalty greater than your old race): Lose the appropriate amount of total experience.  Meaning if you had 100,000 experience points at level 50, and were an inkie and got a race change to iksar, you'd immediately drop to (100k/1.2)xp and likely delevel a few times.<br />
<br />
Change to race with no xp penalty (or less of a penalty): Nothing happens.<br />
<br />
Factions: Your factions become the worse of your current factions, and base starting factions of that race.  Factions never go up.<br />
<br />
New race can't use some of your gear: too bad.<br />
<br />
Change races enough time and get to be KOS to everyone for free! ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm pretty sure he was talking about practical possibility, Zarros, not &quot;can it be done with an infinitely perfect system that I can change at will&quot;.<br />
<br />
And the short answer is:  Most likely not.<br />
<br />
Sure, what you listed makes sense in an abstract way.  With the current system it is possible for someone with enough access to the code and enough knowledge to change an existing character's race.  However, the likelyhood of this being done in practical terms is very very low.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Calamity_Daemon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Not to mention...<br />
GM's tend to be jackasses telling you they can't do something when they darn well can...</div></div><hr />
