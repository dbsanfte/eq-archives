<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I figure I'd better ask in this forum rather than add to a thread in The Armory regarding the faction needed to do the above quest in Katta.  I am a DE SK worshipping Inny and started out KOS.<br />
<br />
From killing vamps in Tenebrous, I maxed Validus Custodus faction, which I believe is just Katta guard faction, and capped at Kindly.  My druid, who started out Indifferent, capped at Ally.<br />
<br />
I am KOS to the quest giver, Phenic Dionicas.  My druid is Indifferent.  I set out to work on what I think is the correct Katta faction: Magus Conlegium.  I have been killing in Sanctus Seru for only two days (which I know isn't enough, of course), so I am still KOS naturally; however, my druid's faction has not advanced beyond Indifferent (I would have guessed he'd at least be Amiable by now even though I am still KOS to Phenic).<br />
<br />
So I am now starting to second-guess myself and wonder if I am working on the correct faction.  There is only one other significant faction that I know of in Katta, and that is Concillium Universus.  Is that the faction I should be working on, rather than Magus Conlegium?  The current mobs I am fighting do not give positive Concillium Universus hits.<br />
<br />
I am not bothered by mind-numbing faction work -- UNLESS it was for nothing.  Does anyone know for certain what faction Phenic Dionicas is on?  Invis/Hide tricks, Harmony etc. won't work here as I must initiate the quest via dialogue.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any advice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I cannot believe I hadn't thought of this sooner.  I'm going to have my druid do the entire quest up until the final turn in, then do an MQ (since I have the droppable ashes).<br />
<br />
I can use the harmony / invis trick (I was able to do the Amulet of Grey Wastes in Katta this way long ago for my SK and even Iksar Warrior).  I also have access to the services of a 65 ENC if need be and charming seems safer (hard to say which is riskier).</div></div><hr />
