<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Astrakan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Have it.  Useful?<br />
<br />
Any real benefit in lowering resistances of mobs?  Raid Encounters?  Don't use my spells like that much in my raid encounters I've been in so far (limited #) because of buff slot limitations, but wondering if it would be useful in the sense that tash is useful?<br />
<br />
Thanks for input,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I use it on Quarm and on some GoD fights with Prismatic/Chromatic resist checks.  Pretty much the only ones where having all resists at 500 matters.</div></div><hr />

/agree<br />
<br />
Most things that I get resists on simply resist AoD as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah.  Been trying it out some lately, and find it almost never lands on the stuff I need it to work on.  It's resist rate will be the same as spears, except there's no chance for a partial.<br />
<br />
I don't think it's gonna be massively useful as a debuff unless you're missing some of the serious debuffing classes like chanters and shammies.  Even then the debuff is small enough it probably won't help a ton on mobs where resists are really an issue.  Remember, it only lowers the mob's resists by 10/all, even though it gives you 30/all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>kuruk_xev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have been using it in Time and generally it works well. My resists kinda suck still so AoD will usually put me very close or at 500 in the needed resist when stacked with all the other buffs.<br />
<br />
It would be very nice if it could go into the bard buffs window but. Sometimes others in your group prefer not to have it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Space</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Don't use AoD much cept for when we got no malos/malosinia or tash in group.  Stumbled onto it cause a wizard asked me to 'sk tash' the mobs as his nukes werent landing well and after i started he said he had no problems after that.  How much was him having shitty luck on resists beforehand I dont know but it keeps him happy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I used it on a few mobs when we were doing Time, when we were doing some of the harder LDoN raids, and for a few other selected fights. Never really use it for the debuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ravenar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have been using it through 1 and 2 tier flags.  Been working great.  Especially during the Grummus raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Oh the power of holgresh elder beads...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Chania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'd still prefer a minus resist on them. Casting them on beads is a pain and the duration is so short, you have to recast midfight and it's inevtiably resisted at that time. If your group members are depending on it, they're in for some pain mid-fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Orthogonon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Usually don't use AoD, but found that it is semi-useful in some situiations.   For instance, in xp groups in GoD, helps a bit to get some resists on the annoying procs that you get from the mobs (i.e. in Ferubi).  From what I understand, the procs use multiple resist checks and use the lowest one.  <br />
<br />
The proc is just an annoyance for tanks, but for the casters is not nice.   I mean, my resists are nothing to write home about, but often in groups with people who really could use the +30 to all resists.  The mobs usually don't resist AoD either.  Just one example where it can actually be a benefit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>nnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I was fighting the mummy during the SK epic that is supposedly unslowable. well I landed AoD and then our shaman was able to slow it. booya.</div></div><hr />
