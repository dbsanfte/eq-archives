<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Protection of Calliav type spell except it works on us, make a line out of it since mobs hit more/faster as they get higher level.  Say levels 30, 42, 53, 58, 63, 68, each level could increase the number of hits it takes (1-6).  Make the line a .5 cast 36 recast, mana cost equilavent to a similar levels stun, and link them.  There we go a semi scaleable damage reducing spell.<br />
<br />
For those unaware of what the spell I'm talking about does, it's a nec/mag/bst pet buff that absorbs the next x hits/dd's that hit you regardless of the damage done</div></div><hr />

A level or a hit number is missing somewhere in there.<br />

Sounds like a great idea, though.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I like this idea quite a lot.  The only possible argument against it I can see is that it would work on every mob in every encounter, unless it was one of those recourses tied to a nuke or 0 second stun or something.  Still, an ability to improve our defense, that scales, is something we have been lacking for a long time, and this idea is more original than a line of stuns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xanathol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Had no idea that a spell existed as such...VERY nice idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rhumba_Kween</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">This idea was discussed back while we were discussing a SK version of defensive.<br />
<br />
If memory serves, the one thing that most did not like about it was, that it was a spell, therefore needed to be cast and take a spell slot, and buff slot.<br />
<br />
I'd also have to say that I dislike your idea for how it scales. I don't really think spells like this should last longer as you level. Unfortunately, the scaling should probably be mob level based, but I'm not sure how I like that either. SOE, has done a bad job of giving mobs appropriate levels in the past. Making it level based would let SK's be able to tank old world content as well as equally geared Warriors, but would limit SK's from tanking new content Bosses. By simply putting a large reagent on it (which is another reason I would dislike this idea), you discourage its use at lower levels.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, this is better than nothing. But certainly has lots and lots of less than desireable side effects, but overall would be a benefit to SK's.</div></div><hr />

Being linked and only one line, paladins would retain an avoidance advantage on blue and white cons.  However, while paladin secondary and tertiary raid abilities are IMO more desireable than ours, would the advantage on yellow and especially red con raid adds shift balance too far?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its duration doesnt have much of an affect on its scaling. The spell is coded to absorb a certain number of hits, rather than damage, befor it fades, and assuming that the spell is cast in combat, it will only last a couple seconds anyway. As for allowing knights to tank as well as warriors at lower levels; no more, and probably less, than stunning allows pallies to do so.<br />
<br />
Brael's level increments basically will allow a SK to avoid one, mabey two combat rounds against level apropriate mobs. Even at the max level of 6 hits absorbed, quad + bash/kick + proc would strip it for the next 30ish seconds befor we could recast. I don't think we will be putting too many warriors out of business with this one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Xanathol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Actually after thinking about this a lil bit more, I'd say lower the recast time to 10 seconds or below. Ancient Force of Chaos is a 4 second stun, recast is 12 seconds. In the first 1-3 seconds, this idea / buff would be gone, with the next rounds incoming, while Pally's could stun for 4 seconds, then follow with Que for 10. We'd be better off than they ( if we actually channeled it ), since ours would lack a resist check, so I'd say carefully scale the number of attacks absorbed ( not 6, but say 4, at 65 ) and maybe throw in a DS to be more 'SKish'.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">The way I see it, this idea is for us to be able to compete with Paladin stuns, and bring us more into line with them.  For that, I do like it.  It still leaves a very large gap between SKs and Warriors, so I don't see it as cure-all to our tanking problems, but at least it would help to separate us from Rangers in terms of tanking ability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Good idea. <br />
<br />
Our proposed spell WORKS in any situations and against any mobs while stun doesn't work on any mobs especially those unstunnable mobs. To get stun to its reasonable power, paladins had to pay AA for it. We get spell like that and paid no AA for it to be &quot;equal&quot; to paladin stuns. Plus, stun requires resist check to make it to stick. Our spell is benefitical type that requires no resist check and will work EVERY time. All of those.. Will paladins scream?<br />
<br />
Ah while you are at it.. Make sure that our deadly DS still is working with that spell. Once mob made a successful hit, Mob hit got absorbed fully but still get DS'ed..That would be nice little extra damage.. :) But not a must though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>zatd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Maybe something more like a recourse?  Same effect of absorbing hits, but has a resistance check AND requires you to cast it on something rather then a self-buff of sorts.<br />
<br />
Just to keep other folks from screaming 'NERF'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Does that spell have a set # of hp it mitigates?<br />
<br />
any time I see a suggestion with a hard coded  flat # I think of the terror spells and cringe.  That includes Brael's latest Protection of Calicov (SP) idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>zatd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Does that spell have a set # of hp it mitigates?<br />
<br />
<br />
If I recall it's a number of hits - regardless of dmg.  It's a very nice way of having it scale.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Aye, that's why its better than darn skin lines we got that we hardly used cuz it doesn't even scale.. I'm glad that skin line got stopped when POP came. It would be nice to see our skin line to be ENTIRELY replaced with this proposed spell line and have it extended to 70 instead of 60. Absorb number of hits &gt;&gt; absorb damage..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Visvires</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Decent idea, except paladin stuns = hate + mitigation.<br />
<br />
If you're going to compare to paladin stuns, its lacking.<br />
<br />
If you're going to compare it to defensive, then it sounds like a good idea.<br />
<br />
<br />
Only thing I could think of would be to give it a big +hate modifier similar to FB, OR make it similar to force shield, or other rune esque spells, which generate decent aggro. Only problem with that is, i'd imagine in most circumstances you'd like to have that on before uber_mob_01 hits camp, so the aggro would be null.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Rhumba_Kween</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">If you're going to compare it to defensive, then it sounds like a good idea.<br />
<br />
I don't see how anyone could make any comparison between what is being proposed and defensive. This spell will not smooth out damage intake, if anything it will make it more spikey.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>NorrynNoir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">that sounds like a fantastic idea. could it be put on our top 10 list, put to a vote, something?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Avatar of Spacetime</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Sounds good to me<br />
<br />
Plus since the effect would last a few rounds am sure we would still keep aggro<br />
<br />
Am all up for this, good idea</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Lynxal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I agree this is a good idea in relation to Pally stuns....it has nothing to do with bringing us in line with a mitigation disc.<br />
<br />
The mobs in GoD are so damn streaky you might block 500 dmg with this then get one rounded the next round.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Krudler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I like it, but the only problem I see with this is that if we get it the devs say, &quot;Ok, SKs are fine now.&quot;<br />
<br />
This spell would be a great help, but we would still need something else, especially since I see this as having a long recast timer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Maicom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">this is exactly the sort of thing we need to bring us in line with pallies in terms of tanking ability(really what does a stun do, prevents the next __ # of hits).<br />
<br />
this doesn't make us les prone to damage spikes, but that's not the purpose of it(sk/war parity on 1 group content)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I'm not sure tha I have enough faith in how it would actually be implemented to call this THE fix.  As it's envisioned here, maybe, but that might be seen as overpowered by devs.<br />
<br />
also the fact that it's based on a pet buff makes me cry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Yeah well true but... I'd take Augmentation of Death (our pet buff) as a self buff any day!  For um, when I'm soloing... er, which I haven't done for a couple years... but STILL!  ;)<br />

As for the original idea; at first it didn't sound that hot -- but it's growing on me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Uggliey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I like the idea,  I don't see it as being over powered as long as it keeps a somewhat long recast time.  30ish sec is about right.   Have it eat 6-8 hits.   I'm not sure how hard this would be to code into the game, as they do things on HP base and not a per hit base.  If this could be done it would bring SK's back up in tanking ability, would be very sweet.  <br />
<br />
Or make it an AA ability but still eat a buff slot (maybe bard box?).   Get one in class, upgrade in pop, and again in GoD, and then in OoW.    It would increase the amount of hits it can take each upgrade.  Start base 4, 5, 6, 8 for amount of hits it can eat per upgrade.<br />
<br />
Good idea!</div></div><hr />

It's not hard to code at all, there is already a pet buff that does exactly this.  Protection of Calliav or something along those lines.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Kyfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">The problem with this idea is that some mobs in GoD will fire 6 hits off in under a second. So while pallies avoid let's say 30 hits with their 4 second stun, we cap at 6. IE it compares very poorly with Paladin stuns on fast hitting mobs.<br />
<br />
Throw in their 12 sec recast vs your proposed 36, and they might avoid 90 hits vs our 6. Balanced vs stuns? I would say no.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>nytemyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">stuns can be resisted this can't. Can anyone think of something better? i can't atm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Difference being this could work on any mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Aye, I rather to have &quot;fewer&quot; hits than stun to be able to be NON-resistable AND work on ANY mobs even multi mobs on me than stun that works on one mob only. Heck,  This spell ROCKKSSS for pulling for Sk as well. Stun on pull only made mob to stay in one place. <br />
<br />
Let paladins to be powerful against stunnable mobs and let us be powerful against unstunnable or high resist mobs. I think that's a fair trade... We still can do well on stunnable mobs as well if paladin isn't there. Heck! If paladin is with us, paladin can stun and we tank mob for added mitigation. That is even better. However, I met lot of paladins with HUGE pride problem with their tanking role. They might not like having SKs in their party cuz SK would say, &quot;Let me tank and you stun for added mitigation&quot;. Paladins would groan at that notion.. However, I never bothered to ask for them to stun on easy mobs like HARD/normal LDON runs so my DS of 74 with druid DS can work better against non-stunning mobs for added dps. ;) Our spell would serve well PLUS our DS still would work well assuming that it can dish out while spell is in effect.<br />
<br />
I rather to have that spell recast (which is 12 sec) to be EQUAL to paladin stun recast cuz the benefits are basically similiar with some good trade offs and 12 sec is IDEAL for cast one per pull session.. <br />
<br />
More I think and talk about it, more I can see benefits of it, more I like about it. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Chania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">The beauty is it's scalable. And its a tanking AND pulling tool. I like it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If we get this I highly doubt we will see any fixes to our mitigation issues. In fact I'd feel fairly confident that there is no chance in Hell that we would. I dislike this idea because it helps us where we are not entirely broken, and does not address the reason SK's have issues in GoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Eh? This spell only address our gap against Paladins BUT not against warriors. Paladins has tank improvement request against warriors on top 10 so are we..<br />
<br />
Also, if paladin ask for tank improvement in their top 10 then its most likely will affect us as well. If we ask for same thing that Paladin ask then its highly likely we get it even though we got stun-equiv spell.. two-fold for us and one-fold for paladins on tank power and it will bring us back to paladin level for tanking (they still tank better against stunnable mobs but we will tank better against unstunnable or high resist mobs. HOWEVER, we will finally be able to tank better against stunnable mobs if paladin not with us which is even added benefit)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Pretecf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">I like it a lot.  I agree that the unresistable portion is the factor that makes this match a pally stun.  I believe the number of hits that it absorbs is low, so I would like to see an AA improvement available for it.<br />
<br />
But, the coup de grace on this spell, I love the fact that a poorly trained SK would use it poorly and get next to no benefit from it.  A well trained SK would find it a saving grace in many situations.</div></div><hr />

100% agree--I had the exact same thoughts.<br />

It would be unfortunate if this solution didn't generate much agro.  We can't cast 2 spells at the same time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Xanathol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">One problem is on stunnable content, the Pally still owns us, whereas with the proposed recast time and linking, on non-stunnable mobs, we avoid a round or two...whooptie-fuckin-do.<br />
<br />
In a 1 minute fight, on stunnable mobs, using just the 4 sec stun, a pally will make the mob not swing for 20 seconds out of the 60 its alive.<br />
<br />
On unstunabble mobs, the pally has jack, as we do now.<br />
<br />
With this, we can avoid roughly 2 rounds in a 1 minute fight on any mob.<br />
<br />
Just pulling number out of the air, if a mob quads once every second, in a one minute fight, the pally can, if stunnable, avoid 20 of 60 rounds. With this, we'd avoid 2 out of 60.<br />
<br />
I'd say either lower the recast time or unlink the spells - least get half the rounds avoided that a pally would on stunnable mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Zero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">I think this is the start of the very good idea.<br />
<br />
To the people saying that this could be a good fix for this, but not for this, yada yada, no shit? Do you expect all our tanking problems (us in line with pallies, sk's and wars, and sk's and non-tanking classes) to all be solved with one solution? If you do think so I must say your are horribly wrong.<br />
<br />
Its true the devs might think if they gave us this they have no need to give us anything else, but what the hell else are we going to do? Do you want us to wait until we have a solution that can rectify every single problem completely, at once? If you do I can tell you we will be waiting a long time.<br />
<br />
I think with a 15 second recast, 5 minute duration, 4 hits regardless of damage absorbed per cast - it could be a very good spell. It would roughly equal paladin stuns enough to put us at a balance point, at least for a while.<br />
<br />
I definetely agree that this should have a considerably large amount of hate tacked onto it, as the main place you'd want to cast this was at the beginning of fights (when you need to establish aggro), and as pointed out, we can't cast two spells at once. Without making it so its a recourse off a spell, and not a self-buff, I can't really see any dead-on way to put a good amount of hate on it. I'm not really sure how the rune-type spells establish how much hate they give, but i'm sure it can be programmed to have this spell generate a set aggro #.<br />
<br />
Normally, rune spells affect aggro in an &quot;ae radius&quot; correct?  Well I think that that might be detrimental to this spells use as a pulling spell, and I think it has good possibilities there. Possibly, have it programmed so that as a secondary function after the selfbuff being cast, (as in not a recourse)  you hit the target with a 0.0 second stun, or a 1% slow, or +2000 hate etc. etc.<br />
<br />
Overall, a very good starting idea for balancing us with paladins, and possibly a good start on fixes for our pulling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Xanathol, we're hit roughly 50% of the time, lets do some math level 65 mob average/above average SK (no uber one thus no ancient in equation)<br />
<br />
Standard mob, quads at 15 delay unslowed, slowed 8 seconds into fight, 52 seconds of seconds of 22 delay.  Thats 20 swings unslowed+92 slowed, 112 swings, lets say 114 with ripostes (high riposte rate), with mob accuracy that means we would take about 57 hits in the fight.  Assume you use the spell twice at level 65 (5 hit version) that would be 47 hits.  Same thing for the paladin, stunned 4/8 seconds unslowed so 8 swings+84 slowed (76 optimal but thats not realistic, it's like taking our spell+melee dps without factoring what we lose to cast in the first place), so 92 swings.  With the same accuracy roughly thats 46 hits.  Looks good to me, if not possibly too much because of AoP.</div></div><hr />

Would the buff block spells? (If so of course they detract from the number of hits blocked)<br />

If you have harmshield up, would the hits still count againt the ticker of this buff, or would harmshield completely negate the ticker from going down?<br />
<br />
If the buff blocks spells, could they code it like monk AA when FD? (IE prevents FD from breaking while buff is on you from blocked damage.) Should they?<br />

If you have harmshield up, would the hits still count againt the ticker of this buff, or would harmshield completely negate the ticker from going down?<br />
HS first<br />
<br />
If the buff blocks spells, could they code it like monk AA when FD? (IE prevents FD from breaking while buff is on you from blocked damage.) Should they?<br />
They could but I don't think it would be like that originally</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Uggliey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Make it a recource spell.  You cast on a mob for like 100 or 200 damage, have it give some fair amount of aggro (maybe add a 0.0 stun component).  It gives you the buff.  <br />

I do not think it should block DD spells cast on you, and if it does block spells it would need a 60+ sec recast delay for balance otherwise you would be immune to all AE DD casting mobs.<br />

This will also make SK's the rampage tank of choice, and if it's got a fast re-use, you can be the rampage tank and never need a heal!    So as you can see there are some balance concerns, but it mostly sits around the recast timer.  I still think 30+ sec recast time would be right.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Uggliey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">If it generates no aggro, then it becomes somewhat useless.   On an INC pull I'm going for high aggro so the debuffers can do their thing.  If I gota stop, cast a non-aggro buff just as it hits me, then the slower and such are a spot on the floor.   An aggro component is an important factor in this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">I disagree that an aggro component is important to this spell, depending on how long the buff lasts when you're not getting hit.  If it lasts 5 minutes or 5 hits, whichever comes first, then you can cast it as soon as the mob you're fighting dies and be ready for the next incoming in plenty of time.  If, however, it is a recourse buff, then I think it would need an aggro component.  I'd rather it was just a fast casting self buff, personally.</div></div><hr />

Best thing i think they could possibly do... link our terrors so we can only mem 1 akin to zbite then add 4sec stun 8sec recast to our terror line.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Xanathol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">Brael,<br />
The pally would take 10 unslowed swings or less ( stun on inc ), whereas we would take 20. After the initial 8 seconds, the pally is going to get in at least 3 more stuns, baring resists, just with 1 stun line. That's 12 more secs of a stunned mob, otherwise 21 swings - double what we would avoid and that's just 1 castable stun spell. If the pally stuns were all linked, then fine; pro &amp; con for the usability of the spells. Until that actually happens, though, its still far favors the pally, especially since those numbers are counting on mob accuracy, vs stuns that simply stop the mob from hitting, regardless of accuracy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Ghismonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">I see a lot of comparison to paladin stuns, but paladins are capable of having stun rotations on stunnable mobs to essentially keep mobs from hitting anyone at all.  In that regard, two paladins won't function the same way as two SKs would.  There is added benefit for a second paladin in a group, but none for a second SK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>cames</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">WRU bubble.<br />
<br />
Okay, this idea is very similar to (not the same as) an effect that occurs in DAoC.  It has many spell names but is basically called by the player base &quot;bubble&quot; (Albion Theurgists - greatest class of all time).<br />
<br />
Bubble has the effect of absorbing the next melee hit no matter what it is.  The effect progression goes Self, Target, Group, Pulsing (various speeds).  Pulsing is the same as we would see for a bard song.  This allowed the &quot;bubble&quot; to refresh as fast as once per 6 seconds (it covered the group).  The spell was so popular in PvE that classes that got this could turn on the pulsing effect, auto-follow, and afk for the rest of the group.<br />
<br />
Now why do I bring all this up?  Balance.  We just need to make sure that the idea is not so good that others hate it.  I think instead of a spell, it should be an AA (potentially a disc - making endurance an issue for us?).  This removes the mana component and any issues revolving around aggro (plus it won't take a spell gem).  I think 15 second refresh time is too short perhaps 24 seconds (4 ticks) would be better.  This effect will provide us a significant advantage over Paladins against non-stunnable mobs.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Kether</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">Visiting Paladin here:<br />
<br />
I have *always* held that all tank classes should bring to their group an equal-as-possible probability and potential reward of success.  The magnitude of the variation in situational tradeoffs is much more important than a mere count of their occurances.<br />
<br />
Ok, preamble stated, my point being:<br />
<br />
There are only two factors.  Group maximum capability and group efficiecy. <br />
<br />
Currently in group settings SKs outperform Paladins on mobs that aren't stunnable (via immunity, mob level, or exorbitant resist rate).  On single 'named' mobs that are stun immune the SK aresenal brought to the group as a whole has a decided advantage via the relative greater power of AoP, HT, personal DPS, etc. over the paladin's heals and anscillary abilities.  On a string of same the bite spells offer far greater group efficiency benefits (taps/dps) than what a paladin could provide via his heals.<br />
<br />
Currently SKs also outperform Paladins on the low-end where healing (and therefore the ability of stuns to meaningfully reduce the need for same) isn't a significant factor and 'dps' is the prevailing limiting parameter.<br />
<br />
Currently Paladins outperform SKs on content other than the above.<br />
<br />
As it relates to fight duration and therefore success the dps of a tank and their group is a relevent parameter.  Plainly stated hypothetically if group with Tank A did 1kdps and Tank B did 1.1kdps then to have an overall 'balanced' case then Tank A would need to be more survivable than B on a per second basis.  As a longer fight allows more room for RNG variances, repops, etc. it would be reasonable to conclude that the slower fight should be somewhat (if only to a small degree) safer than would be predicted by the exact equivalence of Xa^Ya = Xb^Yb (where &quot;a&quot; and b&quot; are tanks, X is the per interval survival estimate and Y the fight duration in intervals).<br />
<br />
I am not stating that the current situational strengths for knights are overall evenly balanced or in favor of either class.  However if SK are to be generally better at the extreme high-end fight (from which all 'best' rewards originate) and at the low-end (to which all encounters eventually proceed to) I would expect that Paladins would possess a rather significant advantage in the transitional case.<br />
<br />
However my preferance would be for SOE to grow some balls.  Either state which content level which tank is to be good for and allow a X-class change or (much better idea) buff/nerf the tanks abilties such that from easy, moderate, to hard content all tanks offer to groups a very equivalent amount of capability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">An SK's dps is about equilavent to a Paladins CC abilities, our pulling is equilavent to your healing, our tanking is not where it should be, fact is stuns&gt;0.0 seriously screw balance up.  Both our classes would be better off if all Pally stuns were 0.0 and we were balanced from there.<br />
<br />
A tank that did 550 dps could be equal in tanking ability to a tank that did 500 dps because of additional benefits they bring to a group, the more dps you have on a mob the less meaningful the tanks dps is.<br />
<br />
BTW, Paladins are the most broken overpowered rampage tank there is, so in higher end content you do outperform us in a tanking area.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">No recourse - the only advantage this has over Pally stuns is the irresitableness of it.<br />
Longish time duration- 5 hits or 5 minutes sounds good for a pulling tool<br />
Short duration/recourse/resistablitity all could make this an unattractive spell (though the duration could be considerably shorter and still be useful ofor pulling)<br />
If duration is long enough there doesn't have to be innate agro on the spell/buff as long as we can cast when buffed with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>roxxyy0</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">We won't be anywhere near the best ramp tanks Paladins have that by Far, if you don't know why u prolly shouldn't know. This sounds like a good idea sorta like ripo/parry disc but with more utility long as the recast isisnt made horrible/it isisnt resistable (geez leechtouch pisses me off). This won't make aggroing a problem if it has a duration of a few mins some one said 5 that would work (pre pull fire this then aggro when its inc like normal). Would help a ton while pulling long as they don't restrict casting while its on, plus they can make an aa that makes it into a monk stonewall type skill with these aa's and they gain bonus points from that. Be better if its a disc for pulling purposes.<br />
<br />
If its possible the coding for spell ae's will havta be played with or its insanly overpowering maybe have it eat a 10% or 15% of incomming ae/spell dmg, if not make it not count towards spells(still far not as capable at taking ae's as a paladin with it setup like that just helps us a little). If they tie it into endurance we would finally have a use for endurance and it might be a way to balence it a bit more if the end cost is alot dunno. Plus won't lose a spell gem which is so win.</div></div><hr />
