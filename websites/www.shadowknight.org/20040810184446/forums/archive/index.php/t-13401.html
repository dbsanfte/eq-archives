<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Quiggley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm haveing trouble finding this guy, I know where he wanders, have a tracker parked there.. is there a mob that I may need to wack in order to get him to spawn? If not, what would his spawn time be? I'm wanting this spell kinda bad =\ I have my 3k and all items ready and waiting there to do it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kormus the Dark Angel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If I remember correctly he wanders around the south eastern part of the zone.<br />
If you zone in from Feerrott take the narrow valley left at the first crossing - he should wander the wide open area ahead of you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Paradox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Nope, he's not a triggered spawn.<br />
<br />
On THIS MAP (http://www.eqatlas.com/rathemtnsmap.html), he wanders around the points marked 21, 22 and 23.  Hang out there and you should run into him.<br />
<br />
Also keep an eye out for Rharzar near the area marked 20.  He's a nasty little dude, but the group you bring to do the Life Leech battle should be able to take him too if he's up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nixpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Remember to buy fresh food now and then :)<br />
<br />
Apart from that... I recently went to Permafrost to get the pear drop from the ice terrors. I cleared the mobs in room #2 on the map, then cleared the area straight from the gate, no terrors...<br />
<br />
Map: http://www.eqatlas.com/permafrostmap.html<br />
<br />
I somehow missed the tunnel to the trapholes /boggle :(<br />
<br />
My question is: does the ice terrors spawn up in the top area where I was or do I have to drop down? If so... what drophole should I chose? Lastly is the pears nodrop? Since I have a 63 mage it might be faste for me to go with him next time :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I just finished my Life Leech quest last weekend, and I can confirm, he does indeed almost always wander in that area.  I have no idea what his spawn time is if someone kills him, but he is unlikely to be killed very often.  I did have to wait around 15 minutes one day to catch him wandering through the valley again.  <br />
<br />
If you find the two undead camps (the first one is a tower, the second is a ruin) and set up on the hill with a tree between them facing south, he'll path right over top of you as he wanders along.   <br />
<br />
Good luck, this spell was the best 3k I've ever spent. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Yarg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">When i first went to RM to get my life leach spell he wasn't up. Me and a lvl 65 necro friend just killed everything near where he wandered until he popped. It took about 20 mins.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Hatre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">As the title says.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Aelali</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It's not too bad to find the necro in RM, after you zone in from Feerrott go south to the hill that's east of &quot;HG Hill&quot; He wonders around there. If you don't happen to see him run up to the top of the hill and use sense undead, as he keeps a pet up. That's how I found him when I did the quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sadyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">No Nixpus, the pears are not nodrop.  They are tradeable.  Have fun with the mage :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>lorddaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i did the quest with my then 49 SK and 54 shaman. <br />
<br />
the icy terrors are able to be gotten from the top, just a few giants in the way.<br />
<br />
the dude paths all over that little area. the hill in the middle will give you the best vandage point. or bribe one of the dr00ds camping the HG to track him down for you for like 50p donation (kill a HG or two to get the donation).<br />
<br />
shaman slowed the giant skellie easy, he fear'd my SK but my dog and dot's did pretty good on killing him</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I thought you couldn't start the quest until 50.<br />
<br />
/shrug <br />
<br />
I didn't have the money or the time for it until 55 anyway.</div></div><hr />
