<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>BetrayerofHope</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello, all. Its been awhile since I've posted, and I have question.<br />
I was recently guilded, and left, as the guild did nothing together, but I did make a few friends with whom to hunt with.<br />
My question is this, where could a 52 SK, and a 51 Necro go for decent exp and, of course, some loot worth a damn? I realize that this has probably been asked a billion times before, and that you're all annoyed with these type of posts, but what the hell, I'll give it a shot.<br />
I think my equip is decent, and the Necro is a frickin machine of death, so I'm hoping for some place off the beaten track, I am absolutely sick of LDoN.<br />
Thank you in advance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eansdad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Veksar maybe or good old KC? Necro can agro kite while u and pet beat the crap out of mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dkhar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Gunthak Initiates. With the necro you'll be able to slaughter them. You could even go to Nadox and duo the Bruisers probably.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kazadeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Give some of the old world zones a try.  Something like Lower Guk or Sol B.  Mobs are easy and with ZEM's it's not that bad xp.  Try the AM room or the Frenzy in LG or the BnB or the LDC's in SolB.  Loots not that great but not too bad either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>BetrayerofHope</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for the suggestions. I like the old world idea, since we don't have a healer with us, but I use a Fungi to regen while the Necro meds.<br />
 We did find one zone that is virtually unpopulated on our server ( Bertox) Maidens Eye. Its not a great loot spot so far, but the experience is flowing nicely. Necro pulls with Darkness, and we fear kite the shit out the mobs on the edge of the zone near the entrance, pets doing alot of the damage for us as well. I havent been hit but a few times, its kind of weird. We even managed to kill a red ( to us at 52) wolf with the Necro aggro-kiting it around, its been fun.<br />
 I prefer dungeons for the modifier myself, and have been trying to talk my buddy into a Hole excursion, so it remains to be seen if we will make the attempt.<br />
 I'll have to keep harassing him about SolB and LG, I like those zones myself, and I'm thinking we could do well there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>nickola thedark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You can Solo Sol B by yourself if you like you will get Hit so keep your pet up and dont fear kite there just duke it out one at a time. if ya want. only thing I would stay away from is the Sonic bats. if there all up they will argo ya and hit hard. but its up to you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The Hole, Gunthak, Dulak, LGuk dead side (might be a little low for you can't remember that one well just remember CR's :p ). Velks, CoM (revamped and rocking), Nurga is cool again if you go deep.<br />
Wander lot's of fun places try them all twice and go back to the ones that didn't pwn you</div></div><hr />
