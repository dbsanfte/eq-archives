And how long will it probably take till i have the faction to even start questing?<br />

So first kill a thousand or so iksars and gobos... I leveled on em for 20 levels so I am already amiable with Legions of Cabalis... After that do the bone quest... about 2200 hits should get you in good with Shammy guild and Crusaders guild... <br />
<br />
Then go and commit mass genocide on Iksar outcasts (bandits, footpads, etc). This and the bone powder quest in the necro guild are the only 2 ways to raise your faction with them... I don't like the bone powder quest... though I may do it a few times if i get the required supplies but I think you need to be indifferent before you can do the quest anyway... You NEED necro faction because a necro in the sk guild is the one who hands out the Greenmist quest... On top of that you then need to complete the 7 Khukri quests (See alakazam for quest details). The Lord of Pain's Khukri is one of the components for the Greenmist...<br />
<br />
Like I said am already amiable to legions of Cabalis so I have just started on the bone chips... have about 220.. hehe only 7300 to go :p<br />
<br />
**NOTE you cannot group up for this faction YOU have to turn in the bone chips in order to get the faction hits.. I have tested this...<br />
<br />
good luck</div></div><hr />

Mordeth, did they fix/change the issue where once your faction with one entry on the list caps, none of the others will gain anymore?</div></div><hr />

Just need to figure out if indifferent is good enough to get the khukri quests now</div></div><hr />

You mention that Indiff is good enough. :) You have my hopes up. Is this true? Is it also true for the Greenmist?<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Esclava_Detristeza</div><div class="date">04-23-2002, 03:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not sure indifferent will work cause I couldn't even get started on the quests till I had amiable with the Crusaders.<br />
<br />
I had my Cabilis faction long before they made the changes to the Greenmist quest because my husband made an iksar monk. We made it a point to become non kos in each other's home cities.<br />
<br />
I did the rounds of killing goblins and outcast iksars...along with doing the bonechip quest, pincers, etc. This all got me to being nonkos, which was fine until they made the changes to Greenmist.<br />
<br />
I talked to Lord Gikzic with my faction at indifferent and he would talk, but said I needed to prove myself more worthy. So, I went back to the marauder caves and killed them over and over again, while also collecting the marauder snout rings &quot;mm&quot; and handing those in to the Warrior Trainer for more faction. I also killed more skellies to hand in bone chips. <br />
<br />
I am now amiable and started the quests. I am only dubious with the necros though, so I am going to assume I can't do the final quest till I have amiable with them too....only time will tell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vecktor</div><div class="date">04-23-2002, 05:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok, indiff works for iksars, but unfortunately not for others, and that means you need at least amiable to kotiz to do greenmist<br />
...btw, u might not want to mq anything, or buy a hero's khukri, since actually doing the quests gives big plus hits on faction, in other words, turning in lord of pain's khukri is prolly worth killing 1kish worth of iksar outcasts</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmmm what factions are actually involved in the Khurki quest?<br />
I thought only &quot;Crusaders of Greenmist&quot; and &quot;Legion of Cabilis&quot; got a positiv hit? If so, you would still have to kill a lot of outcast for the necro faction.<br />
Could someone confirm the faction hits for the Khurki quests, please?<br />
If the necros are indeed upped by the Khurki quests it would be better to fix that in the end of the series, just before you go for GM itself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mordeth</div><div class="date">04-24-2002, 03:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">From all the information I have gleaned you will need 3 factions... 2 of them ar linked fortuantely...<br />
<br />
Scaled Mystics and Greenmist Crusaders (if you can do the khukri's you can deal with the Shamans as bone chips take care of both)<br />
BroodofKotiz Lots of iksar outcasts..<br />
<br />
Thats all ya need</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vachir</div><div class="date">04-24-2002, 09:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just get a necro with FtB and stock up on 8 backpacks full of meat, you can max all the factions except necros very quickly.  For necros go to the bandit lord spawn in WW and kill all the iksar mobs around there for a while.  Supposedly the bandit lord gives a pretty good faction hit as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mordor</div><div class="date">04-25-2002, 03:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heya,<br />
<br />
on Xev i asked 10 high lvl Necros if they have FtB.<br />
They all said that this is a crap Skill and spend np points<br />
in it. So good luck to find a nice Necro who have FtB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Numzaz</div><div class="date">04-25-2002, 05:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lol, yes I talked to my favorite Necro, too.<br />
Sounds like they would not invest in this unless they have lvl60 epified toons on all their 8 character slots on all possible servers lol.<br />
Oh, and even then only if they get to bored playing tetris :P<br />
<br />
But back to my question: What factions get upped when you do the Khurki quests? Does doing the Khurkis help with Necro faction?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mordeth</div><div class="date">04-25-2002, 09:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Only 10 necros eh?? HAHAHA... I have spoken to 40 level 60 necros on Karana... Notta one will ever invest in it :(<br />
<br />
Sigh 5400 bone chips to go... hehehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vecktor</div><div class="date">04-25-2002, 02:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">:confused: what's ftb :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mordeth</div><div class="date">04-25-2002, 03:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A necro skill... have a stack of meat on your cursor... use this aa skill (costs 3 points) and it will turn the stack of meat into a stack of bone chips..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zrenree</div><div class="date">04-26-2002, 04:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I started the quests at amiable to Crusaders and ended up ally.<br />
Dubious is all you need for Brood of Kotiz.<br />
<br />
If the mob will give you the quest, you can do it.<br />
<br />
The faction hits are pretty high when you turn in your previous khukris.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nagashe</div><div class="date">04-28-2002, 03:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just posted this under another thread but it works<br />
<br />
Hello <br />
<br />
Today i decided to raise my faction with cab so i started with the bone chip quest. After about 4 levels of fighting sarnaks in ot and loio as an Inny Troll SK I was indif to troopers. <br />
<br />
I turned in 420 Bone chips and the crusaders were still kos. <br />
<br />
Then i learned of the explorer knife quest. <br />
<br />
I bought 7 bags of 20 stack knives from a merchant in the sk/necro guild under the inn in east freeport. <br />
<br />
I turned in 640 daggers and maxed my faction with everyone but necros, which u already have. <br />
<br />
It will most likely take less than 6 bags of daggers for u to turn in. Much easier than bone chip quest since u can buy the daggers. <br />
<br />
You turn in the daggers in 4 sets of 4 to Trooper Vaurk in LOIO at pos 4575 neg 3095 <br />
<br />
I am gonna go slaughter the manslayers in the cave now to get my necro faction up.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ueuelr</div><div class="date">04-30-2002, 02:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Easiest way to increast Brood of Kotiz faction (necro) if you are 58+ is to make a pet and sit in Warsilk Woods where the Iksar bandit lord spawns, and let your pet kill the Iksar. You can do this while you're afk (sleeping, at work ... whatever). There is a very small risk that your pet might get killed. I have actualy tried this with the (52?) previous pet. He actualy died and I got back just in time, I was on one red bubble with 3 greens wacking on me. If you're a troll or have high regen, even 3 greens will be hard pressed to kill you, they only hit for 1 or 2. Hope this helps, I know I went from Scowling to threatening, and should be dubious by the time I get home, if my pet is still alive ;).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Numzaz</div><div class="date">04-30-2002, 06:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looks like the knife quest has been nerfed yesterday.<br />
The vendors are gone and the turn-in NPC is said to be removed, too.</div></div><hr />

without Vendors ?<br />
I have still 30 stacks in my Bank )<br />

Man, i cryed yesterday as i stand with 30 stacks of knifes at NPC loc and he wasnt there.</div></div><hr />

I'm in FoB right now killing the marauder cave over and over.  It'd be easier if my pet would kill the things when they spawn, but it just stands there looking at them.</div></div><hr />
