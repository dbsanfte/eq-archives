<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Iosif_McCloud</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Camped the rooms for about 3 hours, got 4-5 named.. he poped not enuf ppl to kill so i got ppl together in AM droped him pretty fast...  Used 3 Time+ / EP groups... 1 SK, 1 Pal, 2 ENC's, 2 Clerics,1 Shammy, Rest was all DPS Ranger/Rog/Wizards/BL's/Druids<br />
<br />
Named seem really common in that camp droped both mino / Lesser Runes and 100hp range items</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Keuven Nightstalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Camped it for 4 hrs got 2 named ( deathsting murkglider i think ) no breeder spawn tho :( but the named and exp will bring everyone back to camp it later ;p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hemlocc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">was 3 groups really needed? i haven't tried camping it yet but was gonna bring 1 group prolly half time half pre ele geared</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Iosif_McCloud</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">3 groups was not needed but i got a few ppl then a few more then ppl started inviting them self befor i knew it i went from 3 - 18 people.. Alot had a grudge with him from other attpemts trying to kill him befor we knew he was for Epic.. and thay ALL wanted a pice of his ass now<br />
<br />
So i just decited to give them all a pice of his ass and man did thay fuck him up.. we only had 5 adds when the fight was over.. means we droped him in les then 30 secs...  <br />
<br />
If you Clear the room then train him up the far Hall and train him outside till all th pops are done and CoH back he will reset then you can kill him solo...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rimgruk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Did him easy with 1 group today (qvic geared peeps mind you) but we had no evac'r.  Group make up was 2 sk's, cleric, chanter, ranja, shammy.  1 sk trained the whole room around including breeder till he shit out the 6 adds, then ran out to back hall and flopped.  killed a few roamers then grabbed breeder along with one of his adds.  Mezzed, fought the breeder for almost 8 minutes and happy days after!</div></div><hr />
