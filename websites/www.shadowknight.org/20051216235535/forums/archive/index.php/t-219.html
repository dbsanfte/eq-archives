<br />
I've got my lvl 51 spell sitting in the bank.  All I need now is about 8 more blue exp bubs.<br />
<br />
I can't remember where I got this idea but can I self summon with no coffin??<br />
<br />
Second thing I wanted to know is what is the exact name, Wt and approx price of the coffins I need to use with this spell.<br />
<br />
Are we going to get the stackable coffins so we can become more useful on raid wipe outs?<br />
<br />
If anyone could clear up the new lvl 25 spell that would be helpful also.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Large coffins that cost 175pp give or take a bit. And weight is 10 and there containers so cannot be stacked.<br />
<br />
Nothing to indicate we will ever have stackable coffins.<br />
<br />
Level 25 spell uses a 35 pp coffin that is not stackable and does not work on targets over level 35.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Walil</div><div class="date">03-29-2002, 02:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just to clarify, the large coffins are Large Jade Inlay I believe. Also since they are containers you can't fit them in a bag at all. They have to go in a root slot in your inventory or bank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Byttorr Ebonknight</div><div class="date">03-29-2002, 03:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For those who weren't aware of it, coffins are a bit easier to find nowadays. They can be purchased in Fungus Grove and Katta (which I found strange seeing as necros and SKs are unwelcome there). I don't know if the low level ones are sold there, I haven't been by to check since the patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drakvar Shadowstalker</div><div class="date">03-29-2002, 05:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks kindly for the info.<br />
<br />
I did find the Large Jade Inlay coffins in the Baz for 175plat.  Now I just need to find were the cheap low lvl ones are just incase I need to help a lower lvl player.<br />
<br />
I'm assuming here that I can still summon a low lvl player at 50+<br />
<br />
I'm going to look around and see if I can find were I heard that you can self summon without coffin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Attyla</div><div class="date">03-29-2002, 06:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Drak, when Luclin was coming out, there was a spell in the spdat file called personal summon corpse.  It originally listed SKs as one of the castable classes.  Eqcastersrealm took FOREVER to update that info on their site (heh, SK's suck the hind teat everywhere is seems).  At any rate, it was erroneously listed as an SK spell coming out with SoL for about 3 months.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i thought that when Luclin was released EQCastersRealm and others saw an extra Summon Corpse effect in the spdat and listed it as a personal summon for SKs and Necros but it turned out to be the Necromancer AA skill.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Castaa</div><div class="date">03-29-2002, 06:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know for a fact that the cheap coffins (&lt;35) are sold at the Paineel SK guild.  Off on the spell vendors there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Efugia</div><div class="date">03-29-2002, 07:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh, coffins (tiny and large) are sold right in the bazaar now at the vendor closest to the west bank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vaeluur</div><div class="date">03-30-2002, 07:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i was running my level 11 chater alt around in rivervale (i like to go there more often, now that we have killed the mayor a few times hehe) and i found the cheap (&lt;35) coffins there on a merchant that was sellig bags and boxes and casks etc<br />
<br />
was wierd to se sk/necro only stuff forsale in the village of the asslings.  i would think (but have not checked) that you can find the cheap ones in any city, as part of the plan to make CR easier all around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alhazro</div><div class="date">03-30-2002, 01:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh and since coffins sell in bazaar practically next to the bank, what I did was put some charisma gear in the bank, just 3 jewelcraft items (bracers and neck) that boost my charisma to almost 100. coffins sell for around 145 with that )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rabdos</div><div class="date">03-31-2002, 01:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you get ally faction with Dark Bargainers, you can buy coffins there for 145pp also.</div></div><hr />
