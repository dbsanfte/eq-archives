<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">googaba da troll</div><div class="date">03-25-2002, 06:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">any real difference between the low level summon corpse and the lvl 51 quested summon corpse?  Also heard coffins were supposed to be cheaper, but  I do not think that is the case.  Anyway, havent had any time to check on this and was wondering......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pajita</div><div class="date">03-25-2002, 06:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe that Lesser Summon Corpse has cheaper coffins and can only summon corpses up to level 35... haven't tested it though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Utterance Unholy</div><div class="date">03-25-2002, 07:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The level 35 limit is retarded to an unprecedented degree.<br />
<br />
VI says, ok, kids, we want those pre-level 50 peeps to get inside and out of the outdoor grind.<br />
<br />
So, we will make it easier for you to get rezes and corpse summons.<br />
<br />
Now, we are the only of the 4 classes effected by these changes to only get our ability for a limited time test trial.<br />
<br />
I don't see Paladins LOSING their new rez when they ding 36, then waiting till 50.<br />
<br />
Its moronic beyond measure for VI to give you a spell that is only good for 10 levels in the middle of your career, w/o a replacement for 15 levels after that.<br />
<br />
What good is the ability to summon level 34 players when you are level 40, how does that help you be emboldened to go deep in a dungeon, knowing you can summon some person you don't know's corpse in loio, great.<br />
<br />
Sorry, its just shows such a lack of foresight that it drives me crazy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maldar</div><div class="date">03-25-2002, 07:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, I think it shows that Verant does not really consider the SK class much at all.  If they had bothered to put much though into it, they could have come up with a better solution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brael</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 02:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Had this brought up to the dev team the other day and they agreed that it doesnt make sense, expect it to get fixed somehow in the future, i dont think they realised our summon is at lvl 51</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cephas</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 05:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh, at least its nice to know it might get fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarkWyld</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 09:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, I think they created this spell with the Necro in mind since they get the high powered Summon at 39.  Giving it to us was just an afterthought, and they did not consider the implications.  Considering the restrictions they place on use of these spells, it would make more sense to give this whole line to use at the same time as the Necros, but I REALLY don't see that happening.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Attyla</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 01:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How I'd fix it:<br />
<br />
Set lesser summon corpse to 39 limit (doesn't make more sense for Necros to lose ability for 4 levels any more than us lose it for 16).<br />
<br />
Add new lvl 39 SK only spell with increased component cost.  Timing coincides with spell we normally get (not this lvl 25/29 get a spell garbage).  Lord knows they CAN make Hybrid only spells and are not averse to introducing them (/wave pallies).<br />
<br />
But that's just me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">yuggoth</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 02:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So where all can the new coffins be obtained?  I have heard Neriak and Paineel... and couldn't find them on Luclin, tho I may not have looked hard enough.  It would be really nice if Cabilis had them....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khar</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 06:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Any &quot;fix&quot; that includes the level limit is just wrong. The way it should be handled is with the components and the costs. Unfortunatly all 3 spells need to be tweaked slightly.<br />
<br />
The main difference should be that lesser summon corpse uses the heavy container coffins that cant be stacked. The normal summon corpse should use non stackable coffins that are not containers but are large sized, so they can be stored in bags that can hold them. The last one would stay mostly the same, with the tiny stackable coffins...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xarshaaz Dreadbones</div><div class="date">03-27-2002, 04:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just give us the current summon corpse at 39 or something and the necro summon with the cheap stackable coffins at somewhere 55+ I guess...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drakvar Shadowstalker</div><div class="date">03-27-2002, 11:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Where is a good place to find out where I can buy this spell and where can I buy components?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Viconia deVir</div><div class="date">03-27-2002, 01:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Found spell in neriak, didn't look for coffins there though.  The spell was on the necromancer spell vendors in the lodge of the dead.<br />
<br />
Was cruising around with an alt and saw a 75pp coffin in HHK or HHP, forget which one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yangn</div><div class="date">03-27-2002, 02:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I found a merchant in Akanon that sold the new coffin. Was outside the ramp up to the bank under one of the tents. Do not recall name, but coffin sold for 37pp at apprehensive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nikumu</div><div class="date">03-27-2002, 02:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The gypsy lady in the Neriak Foriegn Quarter sells the new coffins for the low level summon corpse spell.  She is the one next to the soulbinder and that way out of place halfling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lizardium Soulstalker</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 07:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got the lesser Coprse summon spell in West Cabilis in the cave near the PvP arena. It sold for around 22pp and some change, If I remember right. I got some a couple questions, though.<br />
<br />
1) Has anyone seen any of the vendors in Cabilis selling the coffins needed?<br />
<br />
2) Is it true that you can only use this spell on LvL 35 Player Character, and that there is a lvl limit on it? (that would suck!)<br />
