I usually only go on raids, so I'm not sure exactly what the minimum amount of people would be.</div></div><hr />

Look there for a short look at the armour that drops in Plane of Fear.<br />
<br />
The armour drops from Amygdalan Knights - those are around level 50, got some 11k hps (my guess), HT accordingly to their level, use the SK spell line and can be handled solo by a regular ~50 xp group.<br />
<br />
Most of those (between 8 and 11) roam the Temple inside the fire ring so make sure this is cleared too. *g*<br />
<br />
A typical PoF farming (not clearing) raid that has to break the zone (North wall breakin now not usable anymore due to two added roamers I heard) needs around 30 people to make it.<br />
<br />
As usually: 0.02€</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thenger</div><div class="date">04-19-2002, 11:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kormus, are you saying that 30 people are needed to do the break in Fear?  I went there what last Sunday, and did the break in with 2 groups, and he had one enchanter, one shamen, two clerics and one wizard, rest were melee.  I was also attacking some mobs to keep the enchanter from having to mezz them, make her life easier.  But then again almost all the 12 people were level 60 so it was easy.  As for the fire wall, you need one 60th to creat a train, most likey a Paly since he can heal himself while having a train behind him and a SK to tag off him.  Easy zone in general, just painfull break in for those that have never done it before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nephtu</div><div class="date">04-19-2002, 04:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm guessing, but I think our colleague was suggesting a force of 30 or so for those relatively new to the plane, and probably at lower levels.  Given all 55+, good gear and extensive fear EXP, it can doubtless be done with vastly less.<br />
<br />
PS North wall break is still quite doable - you just need a feigner *cough*SK*cough* parked at the camp telling people when to log back in after the pat patrols by while you're getting your camp prepared after break-in.  We had a crummy break in to a full spawn with my (relatively) inexpert guild, and the north wall camp worked great.  We had no click sticks, so it was rez a few, med, camp, log back in, rez a few more, camp, etc.  <br />
<br />
I still prefer it to that oogly west wall break, but it is largely a question of preference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kormus the Dark Angel</div><div class="date">04-19-2002, 09:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Indeed - I am referring to the usual raid that goes to PoF to farm armour for the participants - and for those (around 50th level) I suggest 30 people for a fast rolling raid.</div></div><hr />

The last time, our group of 6 killed 90 percent of the zone before it became boring.      This isn't a brag, just a statement concerning how things can be easy with a group which knows what it's doing. :cool:    I still want to do that damn Chardok queen with one group though.       To me, that's uber. ;)<br />

if it werent for the fact ive seen other sks walking around with it id believe it was a myth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Syfon</div><div class="date">04-23-2002, 12:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">you might want to ask the raid your attending if they intend to clear the plane when you go as well. On Brell it was common practice to leave the Amy temple for last. This meant that if everything didn't go perfectly smooth and any time was lost then the Amy Temple did not get done at all. I cant tell you how many Fear raids I have been on when the only thing left uncleared was the Amy temple. By this point the other classes have their armor drops, people are a little tired and they dont want to do the break for the 1 or 2 sk's on the raid.<br />
<br />
In any case good luck to you in your quest for Umbral.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Groobash</div><div class="date">04-23-2002, 04:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Learn to pull the temple yourself and it'll be a lot easier to convince them to stick around for another 15 minutes to clear it. Good luck convincing anyone else to step up and eat a bunch of HTs for the lone SK on the raid.<br />
<br />
There are other ways, but I usually grab myself a Shiny Brass Idol, some JBoots (sometimes a Glare Lord will be parked inside with the Amys), and a tagger...click the Idol, approach the door until you see the HT messages, run around a bit and kite them around Cazic's hill while your tagger pulls them off a few at a time for your group to kill, or bring them all in yourself and AE them down. <br />
<br />
You'll probably die halfway thru your first time or two until you get it down, but it's damn fun and can be rewarding for younger SKs. I make sure it gets pulled when someone needs it because I remember the frustration of seeing it go unpulled when I was collecting Umbral. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drakang</div><div class="date">04-23-2002, 08:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My favorite method of doing the Amy temple it to convince a paladin with Divine aura to run in there.  Sow them have the hit DA right before going through the fire.  They eat all the HT's and then either run around like a chicken with their head cut off while you peel off mobs to kill or run to the zone out leaving all the mobs easy to pull for a few minutes while their HT recycles.  Have to be quick as I think you only have about 10 minutes before they start getting HT back.   Sometimes you get lucky and the Paladin dies.  Nice bonus to see a Paladin  die in an effort to get you your armor...hehe</div></div><hr />

<br />
you have been farming the wrong part of POG. you need to farm the lake camp for cleric/sk drops. sk drops are piss uncommon, cleric are utter rare.<br />
take a druid with ya, to harmony the thiflings, then its the easiest farm you can ever get :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">yuggoth</div><div class="date">04-26-2002, 02:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used to think that the only time SK armor dropped in PoG was when I was buried deep in some dungeon, so guildies could send me tells that I could have it if I got there in 10 minutes or so :P<br />
Then the other night Nocti legs dropped and I won the roll :)  Can you say &quot;Happy leezard&quot;??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Orthogonon</div><div class="date">04-26-2002, 08:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess i am in the same boat as Trysbrina.   I have been on about 6-7 PoG raids...not a single noc drop.   And it ain't the areas we've done.  We've done the wolves/horses at zone in wall.  We've done the lake.  We've done thiflings.  We have dropped the damn tree twice.   Nothing.<br />
<br />
Certainly these drops are random, and, it is not just SK armor.  I have seen probably 1 or 2 pieces of any class drop (not including stonewood mail/non-class stuff) per trip.  The tree dropped berzerker BP both times.   Not exactly raining on the Rathe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ganaith</div><div class="date">05-01-2002, 03:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">thats nuts, they drop of thiflings like candy. we at one point had 3 bp's dropping and rotting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CanizMortem</div><div class="date">05-02-2002, 03:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A guildie of mine referred to Pog the other night as PoVT, and it seems to be true at times.  Monday night no armor drops, the time before many including a Noc BP from a Thrifling.  So it comes and goes, but don't go expecting any and you might be surprised of by getting something.<br />
<br />
I've yet to go to fear ever, but some say the Nightmares do get pulled and many pieces of Iksar SK armor rot raid after raid...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vecktor</div><div class="date">05-02-2002, 04:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yea, i've had the gm bp rot once /cry</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drooska</div><div class="date">05-03-2002, 06:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">:) :) :) :) :) <br />
My first time to Fear last night and a Greenmist BP dropped!<br />
Sadly I was the only SK there so the Umbral BP, gloves and helm that also dropped rotted.<br />
Still I'm very happy with my new BP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ainya</div><div class="date">05-03-2002, 07:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">/sigh weve been trying to get our one and only iksar SK in the guild fear drops.  Believe out of the last 4 times in fear, (one was a special 2 group strike team formed just for him) we got a zilch :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">synnoira</div><div class="date">05-03-2002, 06:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Vaeluur got me to go on a PoG raid a while back<br />
we did the lake camp, Noct arms dropped and he won, uber guild called Thunderwalkers was going after Tunare, Noct leggings dropped off a mob over where they were and they very kindly offered it up, i won roll hehe<br />
needed a rez to get there and a CoH to get back but i'm very happy with them<br />
so it does drop but i think the crucial thing is that the zone hasn't been cleared already, previous times i had been and seen nothing<br />
then again it probably all really is random <br />
beastlord armor seemed to fall like rain when i've gone and yet i know beastlords who have never seen their stuff there</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Orthogonon</div><div class="date">05-05-2002, 03:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, went on 2 more PoG raids since previous post.   Finally got a drop...arms dropped off of thifling.  So, another 14 hours, one item.    Bezerker gloves dropped also.  Trees were not up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shasz</div><div class="date">05-14-2002, 04:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We went up to fear last night and there were only 2 of us SKs on the raid, me and a troll.  Umbral leggings dropped twice, and of course he already had a pair, and out of 6-7 nightmares I picked up Greenmist leggings and a Greenmist mask.  We didn't pull the temple, this was just on the random Amy's that wander and up with the golems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sakazadroz</div><div class="date">05-14-2002, 05:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been on four Fear raids.  The armor drops seem pretty bursty.  The first two (non-guild, pickup raids) never got around to pulling nightmaresat all.  The third pulled all the nightmares, 0 GM drops (but 4-5 pieces of umbral dropped from the amys).  The fourth raid there were 0 umbral drops, but I got GM bracer and hat.<br />
<br />
Went to Pog once.  Huge warrior drops, but only one piece of Noct dropped from thiflings - arms that I lost the roll on to the only other SK :(</div></div><hr />
