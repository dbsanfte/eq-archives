I know that people have read about the AC and Jboots thousands of times, but hey, whats one more?  I decided to write about my AC experience since it happened 2 days ago.  I am sitting in the bazaar, selling crap while waiting for an item to come up for sale, and have nothing better to do.  <br />
<br />
Over the past few months, I have read all the posts for the Ancient Cyclops in South Ro, and they are all different.  Of all the posts, nobody has ever mentioned they have successfully made him spawn multiple times while trying.  I got my 1st ring on my 1st attempt trying a few months ago, and only after reading a post on Allakhazam’s a long time before that.  As a level 48 Shadowknight, I ventured over to Sro and I was the only one in the zone.  At 6PM EQ time, I killed “a Ghoul” in the sunken tower.  I cleared the desert, killing all undead, named mobs, and spiders 1st, and anything else 2nd, without KEI.  I also killed the Necro Moldrak Drin that spawns by the sunken tower every time he spawned.  After killing 3 SGs, I was oom.  I saw a 4th SG in the distance.  As I was medding up to kill it, all the sudden, I heard what sounded like a giant walking close to me.  My 1st instinct was that it was that SG in the distance.  It was pretty far though, and this was close.  I stood up thinking it was another SG when low and behold; I turned around to see the AC.  I was at 45% health and no mana, but I saved my HT for him, and boom, tanked him to death, no prob.  I look at my location and the EQ time right after this, and I was in the NW corner of Sro and it was 8AM EQ time.  So I felt I was finally done, never bothering with the AC again.  My brother and my roommate always yell at me cause of my Jboots, saying that if I were really good then I would get the Jboots for them.  So I decided that I would get them the ring just to shut them up.  On June 24th, 2003, I decided to venture again and test my strategy before I got the ring for them, and again I was alone in Sro. Now a lvl 52 SK, I tried it out again.  At 6PM EQ, killed “Crypt Mummy” in the sunken tower, was going thru the zone, killing the same way, when I turned to face the merchants and the AC was fighting a dark elf merchant.  HT, both spears, 1 swing of the sword successfully KS’d the AC from the merchant.  EQ time was 12AM.  Looted ring, gave merchant the finger and decided it was time to camp him for my roommate and my bro.  The next day, June 25th, 2003.  Parked my bros 47 Rogue and my roomys 36 Necro and began to go to work (with KEI this time).  I was not alone in the zone, mostly lower levels, but it didn’t matter.  All day people were in and out, but they actually left me alone for the most part except a lvl 56 Druid that wanted Jboots.  What the hell does a 56 druid need Jboots for besides MQ’ing them?  God I hate druids, go to RM and hunt for the cash you low-life druid.  Like they have such a problem getting around.  Anyway, I’ll give you a walkthrough below, but I got the AC to spawn 3 times in the 9 hours I spent doing my strategy, which I’ll post that below as well.  Only reason I stayed after the second kill is that the merchants killed the AC.  Even thou we get no exp for killing the merchants; I did wack the one that killed the AC.  The other 6 times that the AC did not spawn, something else spawned that is not a normal mob in Sro. So, here we go, I made sure what the EQ time was for all events…<br />
<br />
(All times are EQ times)<br />
<br />
1st attempt:<br />
Killed “Crypt Mummy” in Sunken Tower at 6PM – left mobs in tower alone after this<br />
Killed the undead sitting just west of the tower 6PM <br />
Desert killing – 6PM to 8AM – My killing spree was sporadic, but I was killing undead, spiders, and any named mobs I came across more that anything else.  I would see an area where there was 4 or 5 undead, kill them, wack 2 spiders, wack a madmen, then move to another area wacking things along the way.  Just keep the desert clear as possible, and target any named mobs, undead, and spiders before anything else.  The named mobs that I saw were: A jackal, A rattlesnake, A young ronin, A sand mummy, A mummy, A madmen, A terrorantuling, and all were random.<br />
Killed the Necro “Moldrak Drin” every 2 hours, 8PM start timer on him, sitting just west of the tower where the unnamed undead is sitting.<br />
-AC spawned at 12AM, AC down, my bros 47 Rogue loots ring, I stopped killing after that <br />
<br />
2nd Attempt:<br />
Killed “a ghoul” in the Sunken Tower at 6PM<br />
Killed the undead sitting just west of the tower 6PM<br />
Desert killing 6PM to 8AM - was getting cocky, so I was farming spider silks more than killing undead this time, still took out any named mobs<br />
Killed the Necro “Moldrak Drin” every 2 hours<br />
-One “A terrorantuling” spawned at 12AM, then Terrorantula spawns at 1AM, almost kills a lvl 30 Mage in the zone, saved him, killed more until 8AM but no AC and no other special mob spawned<br />
<br />
3rd Attempt:<br />
Killed “Crypt Mummy” in Sunken Tower at 6PM<br />
Killed the undead sitting just west of the tower 6PM<br />
Desert killing 6PM to 8AM – when back to my method from attempt 1<br />
Killed the Necro “Moldrak Drin” every 2 hours<br />
-Four “A terrorantuling” spawn and 4AM, Terrorantula spawns at 5AM, killed more until 8AM but no AC and no other special mob spawned<br />
<br />
4th Attempt:<br />
Killed “Crypt Mummy” in Sunken Tower at 6PM<br />
Killed the undead sitting just west of the tower 6PM<br />
Desert killing 6PM to 8AM – when back to my method from attempt 1<br />

Killed the undead sitting just west of the tower 6PM<br />
Desert killing 6PM to 8AM – when back to my method from attempt 1<br />

<br />
6th Attempt:<br />
Killed “Crypt Mummy” in Sunken Tower at 6PM<br />
Killed the undead sitting just west of the tower 6PM<br />
Desert killing 6PM to 8AM – when back to my method from attempt 1<br />
Killed the Necro “Moldrak Drin” every 2 hours<br />
-Around 20 “A terrorantuling” spawned at 7AM, and nothing happened after that.<br />
<br />
7th Attempt:<br />
Killed “a ghoul” in Sunken Tower at 6PM<br />
Killed the undead sitting just west of the tower 6PM<br />
Desert killing 6PM to 8AM – when back to my method from attempt 1<br />
Killed the Necro “Moldrak Drin” every 2 hours<br />
-Around 20 “A terrorantuling” spawned at 7AM, followed by Terrorantula at 8AM.<br />
<br />
8th Attempt:<br />

Killed the Necro “Moldrak Drin” every 2 hours<br />
AC spawned at 8PM – 2 EQ hours later, 36 Necro loots ring, end of adventure.<br />
<br />
What I believe is true about the AC:<br />
   1. There is an invisible rectangle area to kill mobs for the AC to spawn. This rectangle is the north and south gullies, and just before the east and west Derv Camps.  I never bothered venturing past this area to kill any mobs, but I did kill the ones in the gullies.  The Merchants are just about in the center of that rectangle.<br />
   2. There is more than one way to spawn the AC, Sandgiant Husam, and Terrorantula, and all are rare spawns<br />
   3. Regardless of any other posts, I believe that there is a direct correlation between the tower and the AC.  I believe that it is the trigger to start the spawn cycle, which leads me to believe the spawn cycle theory does work.<br />
   4. I do not think the AC will spawn between the hours of 9AM and 5PM EQ time.  People have stated that they have killed the AC during those times, but did they see him spawn at that time?<br />
   5. There are at least 3 to 6 different locations that the AC, Sandgiant Husam, Sand Giants, and Terrorantula can spawn at.  One in each corner of that invisible rectangle, and in the middle of the rectangle, just north or south of the merchants.<br />
   6. Sand Giants are not place holders for any of these mobs, I have seen them spawn in the middle of the day in Sro after I have not killed anything for 30 minutes real life time, and the 1st time I killed the AC I saw one in the distance<br />
   7. The Sunken Tower mob is on a 8 to 12 hour spawn cycle<br />
   8. Leave Anuman Dathry alone.  He was up all day, never despawning, and he cannot be feared, rooted or dotted.<br />
   9. This information added with others might solve the riddle of the AC, but…<br />
 10. The Ancient Cyclops will never be figured out completely  <br />
<br />
<br />
What I am not sure about:<br />
   1. Moldrak Drin probably has nothing to do with the AC, but since I am superstitious I did not want to jinx this by not killing him.  He only spawns between the hours of 6PM to 6AM<br />
   2. If the AC, Sandgiant Husam, and Terrorantula are on the same spawn cycle, meaning that one will spawn after one has been killed.  Possible, but I never saw it<br />
   3. I never used my method of killing “A drybones skeleton” in the Sunken Tower at 6PM, I just killed that guy and waited for the mummy or ghoul.  There might be a 4th mob in the tower, but I only killed either of the 2<br />
   4. The exact EQ time to kill the undead in the tower. I have read posts that say anywhere from 6PM to 10PM, but Attempt 9 was the one that baffles me.  I killed the &quot;crypt mummy&quot; at 6PM and the AC was up at 8PM, that is about 8 to 10 minutes of playing time…<br />
   5. What, if any mobs besides the named mobs or the tower have anything to do with the AC.  I kept the desert as clear as I could, but for the most part I was alone in the zone, and my pet, althought a good fighter, is not one for conversation.  I could only do so much.<br />
   6. If this is the longest post ever    <br />
<br />
NOTE: A GM did come into the zone when I was alone, stayed there for a few minutes, then left.  He did not talk to me, but I was not sure why they stayed, maybe just passing thru.  This may or may not mean something, thought I would mention it.<br />
<br />
NOTE II: mobs will fight each other.  I had to save the “crypt mummy” from dying once at about 4PM.  He was almost dead, and I killed what he was fighting, then I had to kill my pet and FD because he was attacking me.  That’s the thanks I get, some mobs are so ungrateful.<br />
<br />
In summation:<br />
I am not claiming to be an expert, but I feel that I am close.  I had the AC spawn 5 times out of 11 tries, and 3 times in one day.  With all the problems he has created, I will take this ratio any day of the week.  <br />
<br />
Someone try this and post a follow up: <br />
Kill the mob in the Sunken Tower at 6PM (If I had a choice of what mob to kill in the sunken tower, it would be “crypt mummy”. This is a strangely named mob in a spot that has a longer spawn rate that the rest of the zone)<br />
Kill the undead sitting just west of the tower 6PM (your choice, but why not, your right there)<br />
Desert killing 6PM to 8AM – read attempt 1<br />
Kill the Necro “Moldrak Drin” ever 2 hours (your choice)<br />
<br />
Try it for 3 or 4 hours, then post here and let me know.  If it works, grats! If it does not, well then I’m sorry for wasting your time and mine.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jabbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've done this about 10-12 times now.  Here's my method.<br />
<br />
Kill all the spiders by 6pm in game.<br />
Kill tower spawn, whatever it is.  Tower spawn generally spawns 'something'.  Either more spiders, an SG, Terrorantula, or the AC.<br />
Whatever tower spawn creates, kill it fast.<br />
Kill tower spawn again (making sure there are no spiders anywhere) and clear what pops.<br />
<br />
I agree with your 'invisible rectangle'.  It does indeed seem to be the nameds (AC, Sandgiant Saddam Hussein, Terrorantula) spawn in that exact spot.<br />
<br />
He's only ever popped at 'night' for me.<br />
<br />
The necro who pops near the tower has nothing at all to do with the AC.  He's for a Pally quest for the Ring of Piety (for Marr worshippers).  I think it's Piety, might be something else, but I did it on my little froggy Pally twink (kill me now, yes I made one) so I know it's for some lame Pal ring.<br />
<br />
Anuman, or however you spell it, is an evil prick.  We hates him, we does, my preciousss.  He's killed me or chased me out of the zone a few times when I've 'F8'd' him thinking he was a madman.  I HAVE killed him however...  took a 65 wizzy, a 65 cleric, and me tanking at about 60ish.  He doesn't hit particularly hard, but he's got umpteenbillion hitpoints.  Took about 15 mins to take him out, but die he did.  Dropped some stone of some kind, and at the time we didn't know what it was about.  Pretty sure my two friends figured out it was for a spell quest of some kind, but I never got the straight of it.<br />
<br />
Every time I've spawned the AC I've limited myself to killing spiders, whatever SG's popped, the nameds, and triggering them all by the tower spawn, all at night.  Doing that I've gotten 2 AC's in inside about a four hour period.  However, I've never been able to duplicate a back to back pop like that again, so I think the first time was a fluke.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not true, he does spawn inbetween.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jabbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I agree OOT is a lot easier than SRO, however it can be a long ass camp either way.<br />
<br />
First time I tried Jboots for my main (Then a Necro) it was in OOT.  I camped for 20 hours or so, he finally popped, and at lvl 45 handed me my head.  Someone came along and killed him before I could get back, and I lost my shot.  Tried again there a few days later, and after hours and hours, finally got him with the help of the person waiting behind me.  From then on, if I was getting the Ring for another char or for a friend, I did SRO.  SRO is more work, but it is a lot faster - or has been for me at least.  I've heard of far too many 'nightmare' camps in the OOT spot to try that again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Floppy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I had a friend camp for well over 24 hours at the OOT camp.<br />
<br />
It was one of the few times I questioned another person's sanity, without feeling hypocritical.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Itzena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">How to get the AC to spawn in South Ro in one easy step:<br />
<br />
Kill all the placeholders and hope that you get lucky.<br />
<br />
That's it, no trick.<br />
Placeholders are the mobs with slightly 'off' names, sand giants, and wandering uncommons and named rares (young ronin, Terrorantula, etc), and probably one or two more on top of that.<br />
<br />
No gimmicks, no 'Kill mob X at time Y and then do the Lambada with the dark elf smith'. Just kill the placeholders.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Eatbugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Itzena's right - I've done the south ro camp about 50 times over the years and tried all the gimmicks, none of them work.   Like any random spawn, as long as you keep tagging the placeholders (they spawn in the four corners of the desert) he'll show up eventually, and sometimes you'll get lucky and have him show several times in a few hours.<br />
<br />
Of course, you'll end up doing the lambada with the smith anyway from sheer boredom.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Puurrdy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I finally did this to get jboots:<br />
<br />
Made friend camp spawn<br />
<br />
MQ drop with me<br />
<br />
He was farming spider silk anyway so after his 5th ring, he said, hey, want a pair?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Stugein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Saw the AC and got the ring for the first time last night.  Didn't use any special methods or anything to spawn him, but I did make a note of a couple things in case it could be helpful to someone:<br />
<br />
- I ran in from Innothule.  Just before I got to the desert section of SRo I did a /time.  In-game time was 9pm (real time was shortly after midnight, Eastern time).<br />
<br />
- As I ran past I killed the undead tower mob on a whim.  It was a Drybones skele.<br />
<br />
- I ran to the hill just north of the DE vendors, set my clip plane to max and slowly started scanning the area (you can see damn near the entire desert from that spot).  I wasn't interested in the AC, I was there for Sand Giants so that I could score some Essence of Sunlights.<br />
<br />
- About 5-8 minutes after I killed the tower mob and got to the hilltop, the AC spawned in the corner of the desert that has the SolRo derv quest/vendor folks (NW corner).<br />
<br />
I was the only player in the zone at the time.  I rushed over and mashed the AC.  Got my ring.  Sent a 'Woo-Hoo!&quot; to serverwide.sk and to a few friends that were on, bragging like a fool.  Tonight I will go do the turn-in.<br />
<br />
I don't know if it was the whole &quot;killed the sunken tower mob at night&quot; theory that did it or if it was just random luck.  I'm guessing the latter.  But thats the info in case it helps out anyone else.</div></div><hr />
