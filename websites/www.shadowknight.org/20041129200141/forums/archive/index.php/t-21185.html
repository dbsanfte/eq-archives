<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">uh-oh, it must be Friday and I am bored at work which means I am posting ideas again. <br />
<br />
Based upon all of the conversations, everyone believes knights are unbalanced, not just in GoD, but everywhere. Warriors got significant upgrades, while knights got nothing. Everyone seems to believe we fell further behind in <br />
<br />
DPS <br />
Damage Mitigation <br />
Hit points <br />
<br />
I posted my thoughts on one way to create balance, now I am thinking about an AA way to do it. Some ideas have been &quot;borrowed&quot; from other people <br />
<br />
Knights Specialty - 5 Levels, 4 AA per level...A knight must choose 1 weapon type and for every level they would get a +4 to skill in that weapon. If the knight chooses a 1 hand weapon they also get a +4 to bash skill. <br />
<br />
This would improve our melee dps and max our skill at 245, still a little less then warriors. However, choose wisely because you only can choose 1 weapon type. And for those that do like the shield, the bash improvements help a little. <br />
<br />
Leeching Banshee (Shadowknight Only) - 3 levels - 3/6/9 AA - Each level gives your banshee aura the ability to direct back 1% of the damage you take plus heal you for 1%. Banshee aura must be on. <br />
<br />
If a mob hit you for 1000 points, the mob woud take a 30 point hit via your damage shield and you would be healed for 30. This gives you a 3 percent mitigation and also increases your DPS a little (psst, an offensive based tank) <br />
<br />
Yaulps blessing (Paladin only) - 3 levels - 3/6/9 AA - Each level allows your yaulp to absorb 1.5% of damage taken. Yaulp must be on. <br />
<br />
If the mob hit the paladin for 1000 points, you would absord 45 points but no other damage would hit the mob. (psst, a defensive tank) <br />
<br />
Now for our hitpoint issue, something a little different... <br />
<br />
Dark Bretheren (Paladin Only) -1 level - 4 AA - Allows Brells to stack with shadowknight cloaks (and ONLY shadowknight cloaks). The shadowknight also needs to have the AA skill Holy Sibling. The Shadowknight and the Paladin must be in the same group and remain in the group. If one leaves, they lose the cloak or Brells. <br />
<br />
Holy Sibling (Shadowknight Only) - 1 level - 4 AA - Allows Cloaks to stack with Paladin Brells buffs. The Paladin also needs to have the AA skill Dark Bretheren. The Shadowknight and the Paladin must be in the same group and remain in the group. If one leaves, they lose the cloak or Brells. <br />
<br />
So if a Paladin and Shadowknight worked together in the same group, both tanks would improve in hitpoints and AC, and the Paladin would get a little benefit from our damage shield. <br />
<br />
Toughts? Comments?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Weapon skill raises won't really add much dps, especially specified raises. Other classes will want their skills raised also, so this would be a 0 sum game, most likely.<br />
<br />
Enhancing Banshee Aura specifically ignores the existance of overwriting DSs, and the effectiveness doesn't scale very well in any case...it would be strong vs. easy content where it isn't needed, but very weak on newer challenges.<br />
<br />
Stacking with BSS/CoL would require CoL to not be a self-only spell for the Paladins to want to do this, and then there is the issue of ranger and beastlord stacking also.<br />
<br />
There are some interesting aspects to all of these ideas, but they don't seem to really do much for the problem areas that SKs are concerned about in the high end GoD trials, etc. Knights aren't badly off in the pre-Ikkinz content, if they are on the ball with their gear and AAs. The balance problems are not so general that they should affect casual L65 SKs very much, if even at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Paladins can already stack AotC with Brells. I dont think we need to give them cloak as well. Being able to stack brells with cloak however would be nice.<br />
<br />
Banshee aura is overwritten by all the other DS buffs (mages and druids).  In PoE for example the trees proc Sheild of Bracken which overwrites Banshee and would effectively kill the point of having it up.</div></div><hr />
