<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dravok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering since PoP is gonna come out soon, if there were gonna be items and quests that will be for classes and races that worship Rallos Zek and Bertoxxulous?  I was kinda curious so I decided to make me a human SK that worship the god of disease just to check out the guild hall.  Man was I struck dumb :eek: .  I was thinking it was gonna be like the hall in Freeport which is pretty close to literally being a hole in the wall.  The guild hall in Qeynos puts the Dismal Rage to shame IMO.  Walls scribbled in blood with odd writings, NPCs with reapers as pets, a very nice looking sacrificial altar, nice lighting to give the while ominous feel that it needs.  I mean it just completely rocks.  Guess I'll have to try out that character I made to some hehe.<br />
