For the math-impaired, the Verizon service equates to:<br />
<br />
3.75MB/sec down<br />
625KB up<br />
<br />
I can't wait until they make this available in my area, that's some amazing speed.<br />
Verizon Fios service (http://www22.verizon.com/ForYourHome/Fios/packagePrice.asp)</div></div><hr />

Maybe someday you'll learn to differentiate between the sexes.  In the meantime, I hope your boyhood shrivels up and falls off for the sake of humanity.<br />

I hate verizon. Sure their DSL was the ultimate fast, better than the cable I curretnly have, and I cry every night wishing I had the DSL again.  <br />
<br />
BUT... <br />
they are complete fucktards, I move, they say they will install DSL in new home, shut down old phone number, ... 3 months down the road, There is no phone call saying they can't install in my current neighborhood, they are still charging me for old number (Even though the old number clearly states it was shut off and the new number is...)  And ontop of that, they give me the run around about the 3 months of DSL they charged to a dead phone number, that they also insisted that even though they know the number was a dead number, and that we moved, they didn't care.  So, threaten to shut down my phone line, because of these DSL charges that was their incompetent doing... So I went with a new phone company and haven't heard a thing from them since.<br />
