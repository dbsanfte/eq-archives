<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Holog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all sorry if this has been covered did not find it via searching like I have every other question I have had. I’m a 65 SK with almost 150 AA. I’m Sol Ro flagged but missing Rallos Zek and Sol Ro for EP access and don’t think that will change for a while. I am interested in obtaining The Cudgel of the Oppressor from Vexed, unless you all can tell me of a better SK tanking weapon within my reach. I am only an 8.45K Knight and I don’t see how I am tanking Vexed. I do have a 9.9K Warrior in my guild who will tank and the rest of the group I will need but I would have to be the puller. So my question is has a SK pulled Vexed? And if so how? I heard a SK on Tunare did it Sunday night but don’t know who it was.<br />
<br />
BTW thank you Brael and Slein Jinn in some post some ware on these boards you have answered every question I have had on how to play my class.<br />
<br />
I can’t spell and my grammar is horrid I know this poking fun at myself now please move on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>StruzorGnome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Pretty much everything in Vxed and Tipt are a joke to pull if you have some common sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Agreed, nothing special here....   Since you don't have to tank, I'd pull with AoD if your group is bothering to slow.  I know with a charmed pet it's not really worth it due to such short fights.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, i was pulling Vxed for a little bit Sunday night, don't know if maybe I'm the SK you heard. But anyway, I've never done any raid pulling, can't break 7k hp buffed, and for the times I did pull (until the chanter started just nuking shit to pull and siccing pooka) it was piss easy, just take a look to make sure there are no roamers before you pull the mobs. We stayed at ent for the longest time, and had to end it before we finished (had a slight 'incident', and then people needed to log). Basically, except for farther down I think, all the mobs are just singles.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>TwobittRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have the cudgel I xp there with friends all the time. It's easy to pull we usually just use a chanter or druid to pull using paci or harmony. If you can't use that method to single then we just pull one with a debuff or small nuke and root the adds on the way down to group. Btw very happy with the cudgel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nazak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I find vxed pretty easy to pull as an sk.  If you're just going for the flag, Umbiki, or Chavoor the Trickster, only normal fd splitting is required.  No real tricks are necessary.<br />
<br />
The one time I've seen the Ukun Bloodbeast pop, he was in the middle room straight ahead, but in the back.  It seemed easiest to me to crawl around to that room from behind.  When we did this, the Bloodbeast came with another Ukun, as he was unsnareable, and I didn't want to try to get the add first.  Our chanter had no problem keeping the add locked down while we killed the named.<br />
<br />
I imagine pacify/harmony would be a great help with some of this, but I'm not sure if you can pacify Ukuns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Holog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Nazak thanks for the info i know the Ukun room is packed i will give it a go by travleing around the zone rather than heading up the middle. Whis me luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>uaell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">not to get off topic too much, but does anyone have a pic of this thing (cudgel) equiped? i would love to see what it looks like.</div></div><hr />

Pretty much everything in Vxed and Tipt are a joke to pull if you have some common sense.  <br />
<br />
In tipt the undead room can be tought to split, aggro range is very big.<br />
<br />
Some casters room are not a joke to pull as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Originally the mobs were much more densely packed. You can practically prox pull now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ashrai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Just pulled Tipt for the first time tonite- in fact was my first time even entering the zone. Bowpulled mostly, agro range on ghosts was so large I could prox pull the ones closest.  Got nasty surprise with the ones in the buildings, had no idea they'd all add the instant I stepped in the center of the area. Got FD off when all 4 came but unfortunately group was a bit too close and the 4 agro'd. Looking forward to trying that part again- main problem I ran into was not having Line of Sight on the ones in the buildings until it was too late.  All in all, was ten billion times easier to pull than Sewers.  <br />
<br />
Did Vxed after that, just had chanter pull cause he likes to, and I tanked. Well...more like I was something to keep the mob occupied while chanterpet beat the hell out of it. Like everyone's said, if you've got a chanter with a pet then that changes things drastically.  I'm not even 8K buffed and was able to be &quot;tank&quot; for Vxed cause the mobs were dying so fast it didn't sap cleric mana. <br />
 <br />
Only thing we encountered that I couldn't tank were Trickster and then some nasty Noc thing that got 10 hits off on me before I could even blink.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>StruzorGnome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I pulled the ghosts in Tipt before any nerfage or making easier of anything, back when you could move the end guy and he wouldn't path, and just flag 30 or so guildies from your instance =O.  I believe I ran Tipt like 3 times just to flag a ton of people.<br />
<br />
Anyway, when I did it, you had to snare split them or just pull 2 at a time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Parasite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Pull with festering, FD if more than one comes, wait for the add to go back to its spawnpoint... stand up.... Repeat FD'ing and waiting until snared mob is single.. Else #1 and pet is a nice alternative as well in Tipt and Vxed. :D<br />
Guildies doing it mostly for the Bracers that can drop and the Augments that drop off the Cragbeast named.<br />
<br />
~3 hours of clearing without charm pet.. ~1 hour with pet.</div></div><hr />

It looks like the mace that the Anueks carry.</div></div><hr />
