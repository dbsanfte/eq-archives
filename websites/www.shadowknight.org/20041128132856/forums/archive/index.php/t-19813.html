<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>gruupie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I mostly soloed my bard through these levels and don't want to solo much anymore unless I have to. Where do people find pickup groups for these levels. I would rather not do dreadlands because of overthere faction and am just bored woth the place anyway. Where is the action for these levels now days. It has been a year at least since I have had a character at this level.</div></div><hr />

LDoN is a great suggestion.  /nod Mortekai</div></div><hr />

I don't think you lose OT faction in the Dreadlands.  KC is where you do that.<br />
<br />
40-50, you can try Dawnshroud Peaks or the Great Divide, not the best places to find groups, but most other places are pretty empty.  There's also the Overthere, if you have good faction with the outpost there (and your post implies that you do) it's a short trip to sell/bank when you need to.<br />
<br />
Other than that, LDoN like the others said.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>petras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm going to say 44+ try JPF, or maybe even CoM due to the fact that they gave CoM a dungeon exp bonus, yet it's outdoors.<br />
<br />
Enjoy :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>gruupie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks for the ideas. I forgot that dreadlands was ok faction wise. Il'll do that through the mid 40's. I have never hunted plane of justice. I am fairly well twinked, at what level can i reliably tank there? I am already halfway through 44 since I posted this origianlly.</div></div><hr />

CoM is awesome for that level.  Not only is it an outdoor zone with a city modifier, but you can be bound there, which is infinitely helpful for those rare occasions when you pull a train down on yourself with some of the screwy pathing.  I spent almost all of my mid-40's through mid 50's there with a shammy friend.  Defined, separated camps rock too. ;)</div></div><hr />
