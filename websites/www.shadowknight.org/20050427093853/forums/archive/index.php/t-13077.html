<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Adzagu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings all,<br />
<br />
I had petitioned to have an older character restored on FV (one char per account) and the GMs revived my necro--and I lost my troll SK in the process. The problem is, I was having fun with my SK but dont want to bug the GMs again. With all my gear lost, I´ll start over again as a SK.<br />
<br />
Now considering either to go for a gnome or ogre. The maximizer in me says &quot;go with the ogre&quot; but I dont have PoP and was thinking maybe gnomes have less faction worries--is this the case? Can I take the BB - FP boat or travel in GFay freely?<br />
<br />
As I said, I lost some armor and all my weapons :( I know ogres dont get newbie armor quests and thats anotner thing to consider.<br />
<br />
Many thanks in advance,<br />
ex-Adzagu<br />

PS: my necro was/is naked &amp; copperless so no hope to transfer funds either</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ZarrosLivinglight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think gnomes will have faction issues on par with human shadow knights, in other words not severe.  The problem is that without gear a gnome doesn't make the best natural tank, although they do have good intelligence for spellcasting.  The big advantage to being a gnome is that they are close to the Gfay spires, and if you are going to want to xp in Luclin, thats going to be a big advantage, especially if its faction you are concerned about.<br />
<br />
Of course, once you get to Luclin, just bind in Shadow Haven and you're good to go for Luclin xping anyway, so I wouldn't worry myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Adzagu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks a lot Zarros! That´s good to know... <br />
<br />
Though I must admit, I want to be a big, mean ogre (any class) ever since I returned to EQ. But with no PoP, I´m afraid I´d get stuck on Antonica for a long long time... Hence my hesitation. <br />
<br />
On the other hand, a gnome SK would be somewhat unique. Not that ogres are dime a dozen on FV, but still...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Toltanus Thule</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Why would not having PoP hinder you from being an Ogre?   Most level 60+ Ogre SKs did not have Planes of Power when they got started.   ;)<br />
<br />
Erudites don't have much of a faction problem either, BTW.  You might want to think about them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grizabelle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have a 51 gnome SK on Veeshan.  I absolutely love her.  Besides the factioning being easier at those low levels so you can get around (before I started killing in PoG I could walk anywhere in GFay, Qeynos or Freeport, the only places I know that I am KoS are Kaladim and inside Neriak past the foreign quarter - not sure that the neriak part isn't because of some killing I have done). <br />
<br />
I group regularly with a 52 warrior, 51 Bard, 56 cleric, 39 Rogue, 48 Druid, and 52 chanter.  We did not really start worrying about assigning a MT until we hit the high forties and I have at last been officially named MT for the group.  I traded an Ceremonial Iksar Chestplate for a 2 tined corpse pitchfork....  At the time it was a fab deal, not so fab deal now as the price of the forks has dropped dramatically but I do not regret the choice at ALL.   Even when I stop casting to let mana regen a bit I can hold taunt like no one else can.  <br />
<br />
I love my choice to play gnome.  I know that they will all come out even in the end but I am in a small guild and while I DID twink with Crusty and got to paludal at level 1, it will be one heck of a long time before any of my stats get over 200 much less 250 unbuffed.  Being a gnome has given me an edge on casting abilities (I started with 1 point less than a DE) and the faction to be able to run with a good aligned party without too much worry.<br />
I also am constantly reminded by the ogre warrior  that I do not have to hunt down shrink potions or a shammy or batteries on a regular basis which he does and more of a pain no more shrink running out at a really bad time (he has died several times because of this happening)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Chavo Guerrero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">az that doesn't help him :p <br />
<br />
definite faction issues with kaladim, they should have thought this through if expected to stay on gfay without a port.<br />
<br />
spires to luclin, in turn spires to erudin, get level 15 in warrens, can use trainers eventually in paineel once you get indifferent faction or apprehensive I think, just have newbie open door for u if possible.<br />
<br />
pretty tame issues with antonica in general except ogguk etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Drynnious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">buy pop. make an ogre. it's what 30 bucks? so don't eat next week!<br />
<br />
Anyways, not having pop doesn't make it harder. plenty of 60 sk's  before pop. It just doesn't make it as convinent. Or however you spell that word.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Cistin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Gnome faction isn't that bad unless your talking about faction for Epic, but epic is out dated now anyway.  Kos to Ogres, Dwarves, Halflings, Barbs, was to trolls but haven't checked in their new home, Frogs, and to the evil Erudites.  Never checked the high elves but was cool with the wood elves at first at least.  The rest of the towns were np<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Antihero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Your an idiot or a liar not sure which, but at this point i dont care..<br />
first off you cna have up to 8 toons transfer from one server to another for that $50. second if you lost a toon cause you didnt make room then your even more of an idiot..and your a complete moron cause you would rather just go ho hum I dont want to bug the GM's even though you lost gear AND a toon..in the prossess. I bet you didnt even take everything off the necro before transfer it to an toon that was not going anywhere...<br />
<br />
Please deposit another quarter, cause you suck and cant play..Thank you for playing...<br />
<br />
<br />
Toon for those of you that dont know is a character...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Antihero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">also, just incase this isnt covered...if that toon(the SK) was not that important to worry about getting its gear back why bring it up here?? for what sympathy or poor me?? either way I still think your either a liar or dumb ass..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Krushum Gudended</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">whos the idiot Antihero? only 1 char per acct on FV, read the damn post!<br />

Maybe your dumb ass should look this shit up before posting someone else is a idiot..and when i did a transfer about a year ago it was $50 for 1 to 8 characters..but now it seems to be 2 for $50..seems he can still move more then one. <br />
<br />
another thing that was the issue DUMB ASS eh clamed it deleted his SK with gear..that is why iwas saying he was moron he didnt clear a spot AND he is to stupid to talk them in to getting his SK back, seeing he is saying something about it figured it meant something to him...<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Uukeral</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Antihero never really posts anything of any real value, does he?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Hekk Fire</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I played an ogre before Luclin came out, and play a troll  now.  The travel is really not a problem in any case.  Make yourself an ogre on one of the regular servers and head on over to Freeport.  Go into the secret area all under the city.  Go exploring!  Learning my way around under Freeport was very exciting.  You can swim onto the boat going to Butcherblock, and jump off before it gets to the butcher docks.  <br />
<br />
  This is not as simple as being a gnome and simply boarding a boat, but to me it is much more fun.  I feel like I'm actually doing something daring when I head out to Ocean of Tears or something.   I still kind of get a kick out of evading the guards and stowing away on the boat from time to time, even though PoP has made me lazy.</div></div><hr />
