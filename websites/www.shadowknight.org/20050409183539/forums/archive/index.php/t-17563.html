<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>lyanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does it help VE proc more often?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">yes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lohki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">In my somewhat limited experience in the SK procing spells, I have noticed that Vampiric Embrace does proc more often when my Dexterity is boosted over 155 (With the Shaman buff Harnessing Spirit). I have toyed with dex gear, but I would strongly suggest against such as thing. Considering that most of this gear will usually reduce your more vital stats (i.e..hps, Ac, Str, Sta.) IMO which are far more important. If you are into the proc'n thing, by all means donate to your local shaman or beastlord and get a HOS, Focus, Dex buff, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Cikul Bloodscourge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">yeah, though dex is nice it is hardly worth getting dex gear for, dex on an item is great but at the loss of another stat would make you less valuable in groups and so on<br />
<br />
but shammy buffs work fine for my SK</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>lyanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thankyou for your responses, it answers my question.  Just wanted to ask before investing in some gnome cultural plate boots that have clicky +30 dex on them that I can keep in inventory when I need the buff and there's no shammy in the group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ikarikun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">if you are high enough level use scream of death.. it procs TONS more than VE.  I don't remember what level SoD is... maybe 30 or 39.. but either way.. it owns VE hard... makes blood ember vambs i have tons less appealing too.... but yeah higher dex will help with either of these spells, and thus generating more aggro for MT'ing</div></div><hr />
