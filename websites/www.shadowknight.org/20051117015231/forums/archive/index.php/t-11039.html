<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ceptic</div><div class="date">02-06-2003, 09:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have spent some time surfing all the various class sites, since I play a couple of them, and the one commonality that I frequently come across is the constant bickering over (insert race/class here) can solo better then others.<br />
<br />
(Note: I used a new paragraph to avoid flaming of my abilities to construct a proper document.)<br />
<br />
Wasn’t the basis of Everquest to provide folks with an environment that fosters grouping to further advance each class, utilize the strengths of some to off set the weakness of others, and to HAVE FUN?  The constant comparisons, bickering, and flaming of races due to any advantage over another for pure solo capabilities boggles me.<br />
<br />
I play Everquest for two basic reasons.  <br />
<br />
1)	I have yet to discover another game that provides me with the same addictive qualities, challenges, and opportunities to meet folks from all over the globe who share the same fundamentalist viewpoints that I do with regards to fantasy gaming.<br />
2)	Try have a great time while wasting countless hours in front of a computer screen ignoring reality, even if for a little while.<br />
<br />
<br />
I do not understand the desire to play a MMORP, if the sole intent is to exist in the virtual world alone.  I understand that with the amount of weapons and choice items currently available in the bazaar today, one can move upwards in levels much faster at times alone then while in a group.  But to me, what is the point in rushing to achieve (insert level here) all the while missing out on learning HOW to play a race/class?<br />
<br />
Let the flames begin…..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lizarde</div><div class="date">02-06-2003, 09:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think that part of it is the herd mentality.  People see some high-level players and guild leaders complain about class_X, and they think that the 'in thing' to do is whine about other classes.<br />
<br />
Another is that sometimes, when complaining about their own classes' deficiencies, people will compare their class to another, as an example of how they suffer by comparison.  Other people, not understanding the purpose of the comparison, start to whine about why the other class has it better.<br />
<br />
And yes, sometimes you get people who play EQ as a solo game, and want to be the only class that can solo, so that they can monopolize spawns.  But I think that they're actually the rarest of the bunch, most of the time the best solo classes are too busy fending off 'nerf whines' to bother complaining about other classes.<br />
<br />
Finally, any time someone mentions the power another class has, people immediately get nervous and defensive, because they assume that it is a call for a nerf, and that SOE will read it and respond accordingly.  So you get people trying to defend their class by pointing out that another class is more powerful.  Then people assume that THEY are calling for a nerf.  And so on and so on.<br />
<br />
So mostly, I think it is because people are trying to deflect criticism in the hopes of avoiding a nerf . . .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nnod</div><div class="date">02-06-2003, 09:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only reason I have to solo is when I pick a zone or two that I want to exp in, go in, shout &quot;54 SK looking for group or partner&quot; and then... nothing. Not all nights, but about half the time.<br />
<br />
No one else in LFG mode in there, so I wouldn't know who to ask to start a group. So to pass the time, I try to solo. Sadly, half the time I find myself running to the zone because Fear sent my mob into another mob and I got agro. Or I get trained. Or whatever. <br />
<br />
Ideally, I'd much rather be in a group. They say exp is faster soloing, but you know something... I can't get ANY fucking exp when I am running to the goddamn zone over and over! So I'd rather have at least one other person with me to share the exp. <br />
<br />
Besides, as stated above, this is an online game. Which means there are people to meet and greet. Why go online and then solo all the time? Grouping is often very fun and I find myself meeting some really cool people who usually know their shit. <br />
<br />
Hell, me and another SK grouped in Maidens Eye the other night and ripped the place up. We even let our pets take out a mob by themselves, just to see if they could. That was a riot! It's people that make this game fun. <br />
<br />
And yes, as much as I hate the quadders, I'd much rather have that druid or wizard in my group than see them taking 4 mobs at a time that a whole group could have used.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kiztent</div><div class="date">02-06-2003, 10:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Unfortunately, even if you do want to group, it's still a pain.  I have 3-4 hours a night to play best case. If I chew up an hour of that (which isn't unusual) waiting for slow zoners, waiting for people in guild to sell, buy food, running across three zones because they got lost, or whatever, experience grouping will need to be a LOT better.<br />
<br />
To overcome this slack time, you need to have zones where there's lots of people in the right level range who can easily make it to wherever you are, and integrate into a group because perfect group composition isn't necessary.  Thus was born blunark.</div></div><hr />
