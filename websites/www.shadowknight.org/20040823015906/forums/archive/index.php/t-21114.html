<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>nezzka is bad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">no, not perhaps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Eigen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Q: How stupid do you have to be to keep believing that Al Qaeda has anything to do with Iraq?<br />
<br />
A: As dumb as Bush would like you to remain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brehgan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Good enough for me<br />
Commence operation glass parking lot</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Androsulach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I wonder if there's any way to test that stuff and find out whether it's Soviet stockpile or if it was from Iraq's stockpile or if there's another supplier of WMD's who isn't picky about who they'll sell to.<br />
<br />
I find it ironic, the assumption that since WMD's weren't found in Iraq that Saddam Hussien didn't have any.  The amount of trouble they gave UN inspectors over the last decade makes me wonder if it wasn't a smokescreen to cover them moving WMD's out of the country.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Francosis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You fucking tard.  Where does it say anywhere in either of those articles that these weapons came from Iraq?  The horribly right slanted journalist writing the 1st article you provided can only speculate that the weapons came from Syria.  He goes as far as to assume that maybe Saddam hid his WMD's in that country and that's how these Al-Qaida chumps got ahold of them.  The BBC article doesn't make any mention of this.<br />
<br />
I have some advice for you:  <br />
<br />
Before you go to an obviously heavy right-wing website and start posting the ideology that you are being blasted with and unfortunately believing, take a moment to consider your source and the information.  If the website that is telling you something that would benefit the Bush adminstration has this posted right under the article you just read:<br />
<br />
Editor's note:<br />
Urgent: President Bush needs your support – Click Here Now and show your support to your friends and family  (http://www.newsmax.com/jump/suggestions/bushcollection.htm)<br />
<br />
Then you are probably looking at a source you shouldn't trust.  This will help to keep your dumb ass from spreading mis-information in the future.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Even ignoreing how saddam and osama hated each other, unidentified chemicals to make a bomb (like oklahoma city maybe?) in the hands of al-quediaidiueiaiudiaudi5000eieo doesn't prove anything at all relating to iraq. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Grim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">But it's not all about oil! I mean... <br />
<br />
Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the United States, Prince Bandar bin Sultan, promised President Bush (news - web sites) the Saudis would cut oil prices before November to ensure the U.S. economy is strong on election day, journalist Bob Woodward said in a television interview on Sunday. <br />
