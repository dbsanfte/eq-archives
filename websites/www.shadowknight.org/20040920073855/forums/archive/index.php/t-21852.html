<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I love two handed weapons as much as the next knight (well maybe not as much as Karmie), but after reading this (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=7643&amp;page=1&amp;pp=15) and similar threads, including the hinting of adding a block mod of some sort to shields, it's hard for me in good conscience to equip a 2hander over a superior tanking set up of 1hander and shield.<br />
<br />
If we can put role playing aside for a moment, and suspend the &quot;coolness&quot; factor of the look of a big 2hander, are we not better off as a class with a 1handed epic and possibly a corresponding shield (perhaps epic 1.5 the shield and 2.0 the sword)?<br />
<br />
Ask yourself, are we first tanks or dps?</div></div><hr />

<br />
and even so, whats wrong with a red scabbard type deal like wars had?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Making our epic a 1h wouldn't be a &quot;balance&quot; issue - it'd be an issue of giving us the most useful type of weapon for our epic.  Shields are already preferable to 2h in many situations at the high end, and it's possible they may become even more advantageous in a tanking role.  <br />
<br />
I'd like the option of a scabbard type setup allowing you to switch from one to the other, but if I had to choose, I'd pick a 1h.  Our epic 2.0 drawing looks like it'd make a better 1h than 2h anyway IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think it would all depend on the weapons stats really optimally I would like it to be a 2h but make the ac on it function as if its shield ac.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That'd work - you could bash with the old epic, I don't know why they couldn't let you gain shield-like benefits from epic2 also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Chania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Having 2 items instead of one doubles the effects that can be on them... or 1 proc one click... Would they be balanced by being crappier than 1 effect on a 2hander? Dunno, the Rangers got nice effects on both their original epics for the time. Cons, can't use any of our 2hand AA's, but as Siilvir said, are tanks or DPS? If you take away the oohh factor of a 2hand, 1hand looks pretty darn good I'm afraid to say.<br />
<br />
Course best deal would be a switcheroo like the Warriors got.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Askeer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm all for epic being 1h+shield, or even just 1h and I'll equip a good shield with it.<br />
As long as stats and ratio are good AND the sword even if 1 handed must be huuuuge.<br />
But anyway I think we need more tanking power so a 1h epic, with +8% shielding, and defensive skill mods would be cool.<br />
I don't want to have to bag my epic when I'm tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thats a valid point, I would rather it just be a good weapon to use while tanking as a 2h weapon.  The weapon just looks too good to force into having a 1h swing animation</div></div><hr />

augs, the red scabbard idea is no longer around~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zobb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I said it months ago, make it a true bastard sword. One set of stats for one-handed, another for two-handed. I used to be a 2-hander or nothing guy, but I love my shield and 1-hander combo now. It just makes a lot more sense when tanking. If they do make shields have innate blocking and the epic was 2 handed, I would be back to situational weapons, I'd love to have one weapon that covers it all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>scpio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">they have stated on a couple of occasions they dont/wont want to make a splitable epic again.<br />
<br />
the tradeoff is usualy 1 handers and sheilds are better overall stats then a 2 hander which has better dps. <br />
<br />
making a 2 hander with 100 AC just isnt likely at thats the way sheilds are now. mind you the swd of ssra was 50 AC with good stats at the time it was near the best sheild so who knows....<br />
<br />
considering what the 1 hander crew is basically asking for is 2 epics (1 wpn 1 sheild) that will make the other 1 handers bitch endlessly (think casters) therfore 2 hander is more logical. <br />
<br />
My concern is stats oveall - they stated the 1.5 version will be time level and the 2.0 full will be insane. consider that the end game wpns of luclin were clearly 2/3rds of what elemental wpns alone were and less then 1/2 of what a time wpn is i can see the people bitching non stop allready. most of us in kodtaz and beyond are allready using wpns far better then time allone. right now its sounds kinda undergunned. knowing sonys track record on itemization i am concerned.<br />
 <br />
Im hoping for insane stats with wicked AC on a fine 2 hander.</div></div><hr />

It must involve shields. Knight have shields, can't come back with shield or on it if you didn't have one to begin with.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Powa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Easy solution, makes our Epic 2.0 like the warrior's one, which can change to 1h/2h anytime they wants (or through an easy turn in, but make them interchangable). Of course, the 2h will have slightly better ratio than the 1her, and maybe add a strikethru 10% on 2hers, while shielding 5% on 1h.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Then you can't aug your epic.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Items are destroyed/created not converted.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Yslaath-RZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Personally I've allways preffered 1-handers and would love for our epic to be one.  However, what would be best I think is either to have something like the old warrior epic where you essentially get both, or at some point in the quest you should get to choose between getting a 1-hander or 2-hander.<br />
     I don't think it would be hard to implement or balance, and I think other classes should get similar choices too.  . like for Rangers I know some like to melee more and would like a sword, and some preffer a bow and would like that.  Why not cater to all play styles?<br />
     Additionally I dont think any epics should be augmentable.  They should be made as if they were the best weapon plus the best augments available anyway.  That way you can do warrior epic scabbard thing and not worry about losing anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">You can get a second proc via augments.  It's not possible to code two procs on one weapon without using an augment unless they rewrite the code, so that's not entirely possible.  The potential for customization allowed by augments is nice too.</div></div><hr />

Is weather they would like to do it or not. As for the aug thingy on epic, is it hard to &quot;copy&quot; the existing &quot;aug&quot; to either from 1h to 2h, or the other way around. Don't think u can get around any cheat/duplication going on with that, and it's not a rocket science programming to do IMO. So, aug the 2h, turn in for 1h epic, aug stays the same.<br />
<br />
To those that mention 1h+shield, and interchange with 2h:<br />
Gives the 1h a Type: 8 slot, shield Type: 3 Slot.<br />
<br />
when it changes to 2h.<br />
2h gets both Type 8 and Type 3 slot. Easy enuf to code, and won't be getting aug conflicts. :D</div></div><hr />

That marks the third or fourth time that's been suggested and responded to in this very thread.  People not being able to be bothered to search is bad, but people who can't be bother to read the thread is fucking rediculous.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for being able to code it with augs, yes, they probably could, but it'd require inventing an entire new system.  Currently the only way to do it would be to code it like a tradeskill combine, and in such a scenario the components (the 1h and the shield, for instance) are destroyed and a new item (the 2h) is created.  They'd have to code an entire new system so that the original item is changed rather than creating/destroying the items, and it's simply not worthwhile for them to do this.  For the same amount of effort, they could balance the tank classes and just give us one or the other, or hell, give us both - it's not like we could equip them both at the same time anyway.  I'd rather have balanced tank classes than a transmutable epic...    :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

i've always found that to be a far more realistic alternative, and have thought so since the epics first came out<br />
<br />
rangers have, as it stands, about 1.5 epics to complete... and quite often you'll see a ranger with the offhander who never bothered to get the main hander.<br />
would this not be a viable method for an sk epic? have part of it be getting the 1h and part of it getting the 2h... able to get both, not having to if you don't want to</div></div><hr />

<br />
Probably even harder to code than the augs being destroyed on a scabbard-style combine issue, and without any real benefit other than from a realism standpoint than simply giving us a 1h AND a 2h - it's not like it's more powerful having both than having the ability to switch between the two, you can't use both at once or anything anyway.</div></div><hr />

For that matter, I care about fisability - I'd rather them use their resources on something more imporant than making something &quot;make sense&quot;/be more realistic when doing so has no real advantage from a gameplay/balance/etc. perspective.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its not that they &quot;haven't bothered to get the main hander&quot; its that the Shatterd Emerald of Corruption (which is needed for the final turn in for the other epic) Is just about as rare (if not more rare) then the drake hide. It used to only drop of innoruuk himself, instead of trash drakes like the hide does.<br />
<br />
Trust me, its not a choice that any ranger makes, to not get his other epic.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>vilesoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">To me the tanking order went<br />
<br />
Warr -- takes the most damage overall, adequate but not special amounts of DPS<br />
<br />
Knights, lower pure melee DPS, but each have a role<br />
<br />
Paladin -- middle of the tanks in terms of taking dmg, but is primarily a healer hybrid.  Stuns are used to help reduce damage, as well as hold aggro if the pally is tanking.  Only time their DPS is anything of note is with slay undead.<br />
<br />
Shadowknight -- bottom of the three for tanking, has no way to mitigate damage.  His DPS is acceptable, but his true forte is aggro.<br />
<br />
Now as far as i'm  concerned, aggro is not something to make a class revolve around.  If pallies get better defense, we should get better offense.<br />
<br />
As far as epic 2.0  Make it a sword and shield...teh shield is a one slot container...put the sword in, hit combine, and it's now a 2-hander.  I really think the 2-hander should be a DPS weapon, while the one hander and shield should be a mid DPS defensive setup.  Give the sword a nice AC bonus, and maybe a skill mod to defense and dodge.  The shield can have a mod to parry and riposte.  The two hander can have a doublwe attack and offense modifier to it.<br />
<br />
At least to me, taht layout would actually make some sense.  Now trying to make it and have it desirable yet not overpowering is a whole other can of worms.</div></div><hr />

The SIMPLEST thing to do (actually, I'm no programmer, I've no idea HOW simple it would be to code, but it sounds simple) would be to give us a 2-handed epic 2.0 but allow us to put a shield in the secondary slot.  The ONLY thing tht would change would be the damage bonus would drop to the max of 14 for 1 handers.  Everything else on the sword would stay the same . . .<br />
<br />
Sounds pretty straight forward to me.  Want the DPS from the higher damage bonus?  Don't put a shield in your secondary slot.  Want the added AC/stats/etc.?  Drop a shield in the slot but do less damage.  Whaddaya think? <br />

If you were allowed to equip a shield,, and the 2 handed stats stayed the same except damage bonus, it would be overpowering, unless the epic had gimp stats.  Imagine a 100 AC sword, 70 30 ratio, 20 to all stats, 300 hp/mana, then ADD IN a 50+ AC shield and raise the &quot;ac softcap&quot;, and you'll have Warriors screaming Nerf.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now, all the sudden.. Now 1h/shield? Good! :) About damn time.. Of course, I surely want epic 2.0 to be 1h or maybe add shield to have its look to go with its 1h. <br />
<br />
I agree with Slein that its ALOT easier just to get BOTH 2h AND 1h out of epic 2.0 quest so you can aug them and you can carry both and switch whatever you feel like it without having entire weapon morph into other weapon that can complicate the aug system. Same graphic for both 2h and 1h (smaller look) that won't even cost add'tl global memory.<br />
<br />
Perhaps SOE can add a quest step or 2 to be able to get both if they wanna. :) OR you can re-do entire quest to get 2nd one. For example, when you do first quest and, at the end, you CHOOSE which type 1h or 2h? Then you pick 2h, then you can re-do quest to go for 1h.  I know it would suck. I would prefer just do 1 quest then get BOTH at once. :) Lazy aye but why not? :) We suffered from epic 1.0 and we should be able to do epic 2.0 easier..</div></div><hr />

&quot;Ok lately I've seen a number of posts saying that you definitely CAN use Epic 1 as a short cut thru some parts of the Epic 1.5 and Epic 2.0 quests.  I would like someone to link me to where SOE has said this please.  I just want to know if it's true or just another case of ppl not bothering to read what is said in a thread.<br />
 <br />
Also has anyone seen defenitive statement from someone at SOE that specifies if Epic 1.5 is a 1/2 way stop on the way to Epic 2.0?  Would like links to any of these statements too, thanks.<br />

&quot;Hello Xianzu,<br />
 <br />
The answers to your questions are yes, yes, and yes.<br />
 <br />
The epic 1.0 weapon is not required to work on or complete the new quest.  However, having the first epic will allow you to skip a few steps.<br />
 <br />
There will be a mid-quest reward at the halfway point just as you described.  This was discussed at the summit briefly.  I don't think it's ever been posted by a developer until now.<br />

Imagine a 100 AC sword, 70 30 ratio, 20 to all stats, 300 hp/mana, then ADD IN a 50+ AC shield and raise the &quot;ac softcap&quot;, and you'll have Warriors screaming Nerf. <br />

I AM imagining it . . . Let them scream all they want.  I'm sick of all this, Class-envy, My-class-has-to-be-better-than-your-class-at-everything BS.  Scream all they want, but we STILL wouldn't be able to tank in GoD . . . <br />

Is there a site other than the Soe OOW official web page to check info about the epic 2? And is there any truth in the fact that having epic 1 makes getting the second easier?<br />

This has been answered as well.  Will say it again, Read the entire post.  <br />

As far as changing the Aug system, they are already doing that.  All that would need to be added is that the Epic combiner would also add/remove augs.  Include a reagent that is not consumed to act as the &quot;solvent&quot; and you would be able to remove the aug, then create the other verions (1h/2h) then add the aug back.  It would be a pita on using it, but the coding changes are already in place.  just needs another recipe added.</div></div><hr />

Maybe if you took you own advice you might read that the issue was already dealt with but thanks for your concern  :)</div></div><hr />

I'd say get rid of the idea for using epic 1.0 for anything involving the epic 2.0. Reason being is that the old Epic 1.0 content will then again be fucking crowed and camp can be fustrating (i donno if soe really want this or not, but feral Jboot is an example)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Sibrius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">Hey, why don't they make it like warrior epic where u can swi.... Oh, I actually read the whole topic and won't say that for the _th time  :)<br />
<br />
The solution to me seems quite obvious after all this. Scpio / Brael and whoever else are right.<br />
<br />
2 Hand sword all the way, Give it sizeable AC and have it act like a shield in that aspect, give it some good tanking mods %shielding is a must. Don't forget a assload of hit points, so that you dont lose any there from using a 2her. That would unbalance it and negate the bonus of using 1h'er + shield you say?<br />
<br />
This is our new EPIC. There hasn't been one since Kunark, that was like 3 fucking years ago. Do you REMEMBER what it was like to see a sk in kunark era weilding Inny's Curse? I shat my pants every time I saw one in admiration. There should be NO WAY IN HELL that ANY SK should feel like using a 1h'er and shield &gt; Epic 2.0 in OOW. This is supposed to be the SINGLE BEST piece of primary/secondary equipment you will ever own as a SK, so it should be! (At least for the entire expansion)</div></div><hr />

nice sig  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Sibrius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">Hi Askeer, been a long time. Nice posky raid. I came out of retirement finally after 7 months leave  :D I see you havn't stopped growing at all. :cool: <br />
<br />
Thanks, I just made it 2 days ago. The first sig I ever made that I actualy used =p Mara helped.. if I didn't say that I'm afraid she would beat me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Radahsam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">Personally, I am completely with SJ on this one.  In fact, I see no reason at all not to simply give us TWO epic weapons as the end result - a 1h and a 2h.  As stated, you can't use them both at the same time.  Heck, you could even give them seperate effects, focusing the 1h on a tanking effect (stun/aggro proc) and the 2h on a DPS effect (high DPS DD proc or something).  They could both share the same clicky effect.  I don't even really care.  But giving us TWO would be the easiest solution and would not require any extra coding and workarounds.<br />
<br />
I really don't think the idea of giving us an uber 2h with shield-like benefits will work.  It probably could, but you'd either end up with a weapon that is too overpowering on the DPS or too overpowering on the defense characteristics.  Knights that choose a 2h weapon *SHOULD* sacrifice some tanking power.  Knights that choose a 1h weapon *SHOULD* sacrifice some DPS.  We've been screaming for balance against the warrior class for a long time, but one of their biggest arguments is that we shouldn't be able to do the same DPS when we're tanking.  I would prefer to see us move towards situational use of both 1h and 2h weapons, giving shields a really useful defensive purpose.  This would also free them up to make our knight-only 2h weapons much better at DPS by removing some of the awesome defensive characteristics we've seen on 2h weapons in the past (50 AC on Sword of Ssra, for example).<br />
<br />
Even worse, I really hate the idea of splitting a 2h into an epic 1h+shield.  The last thing we want is to be tied to an &quot;epic&quot; shield that will become obsolete within 6 months.  Shields can be upgraded with each expansion.  I'm currently using a Blackstone Buckler from GoD, aug'd with a 30 AC aug from GoD.  An epic shield from two expansions ago would likely be a waste of inventory space for me.  Just give us two useful weapons, a 1h and 2h, with appropriate stats and procs/clickies for each.  The original warrior epic had a different proc for the 2h vs. the seperate 1h'ers.  They could do a very similar thing for us, but just give us both weapons as the final prize.<br />
<br />
Seems like a simple solution, really.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>nezzka is bad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">they should make it so a shield just multiplys your ac, like a good GoD shield would be 1.3X your normal ac etc.</div></div><hr />

Ok, so it's not 100% accurate, but they are pretty damn close :D<br />
