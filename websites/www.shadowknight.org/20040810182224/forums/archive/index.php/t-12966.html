Farmed the pelts 3 times<br />
Failed &quot;trivial&quot; combine 3 times<br />

Someone shoot me please I'm going back again</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Toltanus Thule</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">if you go to Luclin and farm some Greyhopper hides and make some Greyhopper armor, like masks and what not, you should be able to easily get your tailoring to the 50s and 60s and maybe have a better chance of making Garadain's blanket.  I think the further away you are from a trivial, the less of a chance you have of not being able to make something.<br />
<br />
In other words, if the item trivials at 41 and you are at 41, your chances of failing are higher than if the item is trivial at 41 and your skill is something like 91 or 130.  At least that's my observation of the skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>PingGuy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Save yourself some trouble and do this:<br />
<br />
Before you try the combine again go to Marus Seru and Farm Greyhoppers for an hour or two.  You should walk away with 5 billion LQ Hopper pelts and maybe 20-40 Greyhopper hides.  Then go to the Feerrott and hit the NorthEast corner of the zone.  Make sure you have your tailoring kit with you to save time.  Farm the spiders and take their silk, once the mobs get sparce you can make silk threads until they repop.<br />
<br />
Basically you combine 2 spiderling silks to get a Silk Thread, then combine 1 Silk Thread with a LQ Hopper hide to make a Leather Padding.  Do this until you hit 56 in tailoring and then leave the Feerrott and hit the Bazaar.  Buy enough Mask patterns to match your inventory of Greyhopper hides and combine them (1 of each) to make masks until you run out.  This should put you somewhere above 60 or 70 in tailoring which will make your next attempt at the 1st ring combine much easier.<br />
<br />
Then just sell off the extra LQ Hopper hides and Leather Paddings in the Bazaar and go do your ring combine.  Greyhopper hides can take you to 95 in tailoring if you want to go that high.. but the pelts for it drop somewhat rarely so don't spend too much time on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>PingGuy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Damn, 3 minutes too slow. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Saruton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you dont want to hunt for the hides go to SH and buy your skill in tailoring up to 76. Picnicbaskets. Search for the recipe at www.eqtraders.com. Oh and the last thing i new about the 1st Ring was that it isnt trivial at 41.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>EdgeOfDetroit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Method</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Found a loophole in tailoring to crank out easy skill ups.<br />
<br />
Its called Mandrake. You go to your local shaman alchemy vendor (used the one in SH by the nexus zone) and buy two. Combine in tailoring kit. Maybe 500p from 1-66? I spent less<br />
<br />
This makes woven mandrake.<br />
<br />
Woven mandrake + steel boning = picnic basket.. doesnt matter i dunno wtf its for, but it ups tailoring skill to 76<br />
<br />
for steel boning though you have to smith<br />
<br />
metal bits: water + small ore<br />
<br />
file: file mold + water + metal bits<br />
<br />
steel boning: file + small peice of ore + water<br />
<br />
always get file back. its easy to make a bunch, just make as many boning as you have woven mandrake left over, and then combine till its trivial.<br />
<br />
Skill 76 tailoring now, my 4th attempt at the ring combine worked. Thank the lord</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>PingGuy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Good call on that, I'm gonna give it a shot.  I'm at 63 currently and have 9 Greyhopper hides sitting around.  They will do me more good if I can get to 76 first through vendor stuff.  I already have a file so it should be easy.<br />
<br />
The sooner I get off of Greyhopper Hides the sooner I can ignore that zone and settle into the hell of Wu's. :\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Method</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">yeah just note its the non stackable small ore for boning. cabilis forge is nice for this the vendor is right next to it</div></div><hr />
