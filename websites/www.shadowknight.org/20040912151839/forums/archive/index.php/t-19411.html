<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Laymon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've got a feeling this post will disappear response-less off the bottom of the page in record time since I'm guessing not many of you guys are on VS.<br />
<br />
Thought it was worth a try though.<br />
<br />
Is there anyone out there who can help me with the Fear, Hate and Sky drops? I’ve been trying for weeks to pick up a group going there and although I’m guilded they’re more into raid tier progression. (Don’t get me wrong, they’re a great guild but all this talk of 400+ dropless drakes is very depressing given the trouble I’m having organising a single trip there).<br />
<br />
So if anyone has a character(s) on VS, or knows someone that does, I’d very much appreciate the help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bratticuss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Depending on your level you can do Hate or Sky with just a group. All you need is a healer, porter and slower and your set for hate and sky. Heck get more folks wanting to come to hate because they think the zone is cool.<br />
<br />
Fear does require more then one group but I have managed to get a couple of groups to go with me there. Get some of your other guild mates to go with you for epic drops. The only hard part of fear is the break in.<br />
<br />
Good luck on your epic drops.<br />
