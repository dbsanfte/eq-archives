<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ukbar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm a lvl 61 SK with base HP of about 3500, AC 1280, ATK 1180, which all changes when buffed with various Cleric, Shammy, and self buffs to approximately HP 5600, AC 1300, ATK 1200.  I'm using the WMBS when MA, and the Long Blade of Vitality and Atrementous Shield when MT.  When I'm the MT in POV with a good group -- cleric, shammy, chanter, and two other dps classes we do well, but for some reason when there's only the chanter to slow -- and this is especially true for the under 62 lvl chanters -- the chanter gets aggro right after an attempt at slow, and this with me having cast a spear dd and then jumping right on the Golem with pet, and then I finally get aggro and then as the Golem beats me down, 60%, 50%...etc...down to 20% ....etc...still waiting for the cleric heal...and then....boom I'm dead.....the rest of the group still alive and I&quot;m getting rezzed but they all beat down the single pull golem no problem.  It seems to me that this is more a cleric needing to heal me faster, but I also seem to wither so quickly in the face of the POV (WW or EW) Golems.   So, the questions are 1.  Is getting off a spear to the Golem (400pts) and then hitting with pet, hitting taunt button all the while enough to get aggro?  It doesn't seem to be as the mob goes after the chanter trying to slow it and then I struggle to pull mob off chanter, who's running all the while at times making it difficult but I do get aggro back.  As a new lvl 61, I've just started using Festering Darkness over CD, so am hoping that will help aggro too. Also, is Festering Darkness resisted less than CD? CD would usually stick once mobs were around 40% HP, but what a mana hog, so looking forward to Festering Darkness.   2. Also, which of the Voice line or Terror line of spells do Knights prefer to use in these situations?  And, 3. as Main Tank I use the Long Blade of Vitality and Atrementous Shield, but would the Adjutant's Sabre be better for aggro purposes when being the MT?  Any Tank weapon/shield combo suggestions appreciated.  I was using the WMBS when tanking, but found the 1HS/Shield Combon helpful when being MT and WMBS good when Main Assist.<br />
<br />
Sorry, I don't have a Magelo, but my gear is decent and as I mentioned, buffed I'm approximately HP 5600, AC 1300, ATK 1200.  I also have the Soulscream Belt with 31% Haste, but as my gear is all bazaar bought, I will need to better gear, but was wanting to get to level 65 before beginning AA exp and going for the highend droppable gear.  Thanks for any input offered.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Get Twinge of Pain 1, which is available for Tribute, which is Affliction Haste (33%).  When they pull that golem, spam Clinging Darkness.  With the first Clinging Darkness (whether it sticks or not), you'll have comparable agro to the chanter, and the mob will go for whoever's closest so stand a bit closer to the mob than the chanter, or ask him/her to stay behind you.  Immediately following, cast Festering; the 2 snares at the beginning of the fight will ensure way more agro than your previous methods.  Using this method, you can tell your chanter to slow as soon as it's within range of him/her.  This in turn (having the mob slowed at the very beginning) will help with the healing problem.<br />
<br />
If you're getting a lot of resists on Festering, an alternative is to open with 2 casts of Clinging, then Aura of Darkness, (meanwhile your chanter tashes, or shaman malos), then Festering.<br />
<br />
Then, do whatever you like for spells.  Spears if you like, or a Touch of Volatis when you hit 62, but forget about Voice or Terrors, they're not worth it.<br />
<br />
I haven't looked up those weapon/shield details, but the bottom line is: You're the tank.  Staying alive is your top priority.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Have the chanter give you a MR buff, you can resist the shards of glass proc the golems and spiders proc.<br />
<br />
1. no, a spear and taunt isn't enough. Cast festering or CD for initial aggro, and if the mob still turns then use the spear/taunt. If you use festering at first, it buys extra time for heals and slows.<br />
<br />
2. You could Voice yourself with the best one you have, but changing your initial aggro lineup it may just be using up a spell slot. I wouldn't bother with terrors at all.<br />
<br />
3. How much ac/hp are you gaining by going to 1h/sheild over WMBS?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you use festering at first, it buys extra time for heals and slows.This is definitely a better choice once you get to a point where you have a better chance of it landing than being resisted.<br />
<br />
Btw, now that you have Festering, you'll never want to use Cascading again.  Clinging and Festering are the two to use.<br />
Festering = snare + damage (duh)<br />
Clinging = cheap agro, regardless of whether it sticks or not, even if it's already Festering'd.<br />
<br />
Incidentaly, there have been times when I just use Clinging because of how cheap it is.  I just recast it when the mob's at 30%.  The mob will still run a few feet before stopping, but it's good enough for a lot of situations.  Handy if you have no mind candy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Oagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I two box those golems quite a lot with my sk/shaman.  The reason you're losing aggro is that you are not tagging with either Clinging Darkness or Festering Darkness before the tash and slow attempt.  <br />
<br />
If both are coming from the chanter, then you really need to hit them with FD or CD before they reach the camp, otherwise, they're gunna pound the slower.<br />
<br />
I know with my shammy, FD will out aggro malos and slow, which means he never gets hit.  When a buddy chanter is along, he tash'es, and shammy slows...they never get hit either.<br />
<br />
FD, CD are your aggro weapons, far over and above taunt and terrors.  Hell, with either of those, there's rarely a need to use taunt unless you have a a group member that is doing incredible damage.  Hell, when I pull, I just tag em with that, that way I have time to malos and slow before they get to the camp spot or within the first round or two of melee.<br />
<br />
save the spear for later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The first and obvious part of the question about holding agro has been answered well.  I use the spamming Clinging Darkness on incoming and it hold agro great.  The only time I ever have hit taunt is when I ding to bring it up to max for that level otherwise I have no use for it and I see taunt as a bad thing because other people abuse it too much.<br />
<br />
Think of taunt this way (even though it's oversimplified).  A sucessful taunt will bring your hate equal to the level of the person with the highest previous hate +1.   So yes you have agro now but by a slim margain, and if the person who used to be on top of the list is still doing something to piss off the mob you are not going to have agro for long.  This makes taunt unreliable and inefficient.  It's better to spam clinging on pull to get as much hate worked up as possible.  That way your group have plenty of hate room to cast and beat up on the guy without you losing agro.<br />
<br />
Spears are not efficient for agro.  Terrors don't generate enough agro to be reliable and are proximity sensitive, so you have to be right on the mob to get the full effect.  (think of terrors like casting on onld world dragons, you have to be in melee range to land or in this case to get full effectiveness out of it) Even then the terror line isn't the most reliable.<br />
<br />
The other issue that I see is you dropping fast and dying often.  This may be an issue of you not having as good of gear as you think.  We will need a Magelo to determine that and the sucess rate of advice you get from here will improve if that can be looked at.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ukbar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">This is all great advice.  I'll skip the Terrors and will start with Clinging and Festering Darkness as suggested.  And will also need to get &quot;get Twinge of Pain 1, which is available for Tribute, which is Affliction Haste (33%).&quot;<br />
<br />
I've been in POV since lvl 55, with a few forays to the Plane of Hate, POD, and one venture into the Mines of Nurga, which means that I have not engaged the Tribute system yet, but will need to look at that soon enough.  <br />
<br />
Regarding Magelo, yes I do need to do that, went there once, and got hung up on some error page, then never went back to it, but need to do that for a gear evaluation soon.  <br />
<br />
Thanks all for your advice.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Putrid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I only use Clinging for a agro and just chain cast it.  I think the cleric is not giving you the heal quick enough.  I did some tanking in POV with AC and Hp numbers rather similar to yours.  <br />
The cleric seemed to have no problem keeping me up and had no complaints about mana problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>velourea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">all you need is to chain cast clinging darkness, and maybe an odd fear now and then. this cannot be stressed enough.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Dkhar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hey man, had the same issue with going down like a sack o potatoes in PoV at that level too. The problem was I was not pulling. Be the puller if you are tanking, even if there is a monk. Tell the monk to bugger off and let you do your thang. Pull with CDx2, slam it with a Festering on inc a bit before the mob hits camp. That way the chanter/shammy can have that fugger tashed/slowed before you engage in melee. The problem with the golems is they are really frickin mean to SK's unslowed, able to just totally annihalate you through 5500 hp in 3 rounds, given of course they have a damage spike. They can quad for close to 2k so the cleric/druid must be on their toes constantly. If they move to put out a cigarette, you can die to a damage spike. It gets a little easier as you level and get more hp to play with. I keep touch of volatis up along with soul siphon for those times I think the cleric is staring into space or alt-tab'n to look at goatse. pics.<br />
<br />
EDIT : just to point out, you can successfully pull and tank the golems with 5000 hp and 1200 ac flat if you pull right and the chanter and cleric are good. I've gone as low as doing them with 4700 hp with a druid healing and chanter slowing. Gotta love the times when there are no buffers around and you've been pounding away for so long all yer buffs drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ukbar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Agreed, pulling the golems, spider, crawlers....in POV....with Festering/Clinging Darkness combo gives chanter, or shammy, enough time to slow those beasts down.  I'm keeping aggro so well now that I haven't tried the fear combo but will test that out at some point too.  In any event, Festering/Clinging casts are the aggro tools, no doubt about it. <br />
<br />
Dkhar's point about the slower and healer staying focused in POV is soooo true, when Festering sticks, which it did about 90% of the time, the slower was hitting it just as the mob hit me, but I &quot;suggested&quot; to slow the damn thing before it hit me, which naturally worked better.  However, was in one group where the cleric just didnt' get off quick heals and CH at right times and me and chanter ended up being the ones who died too many times with a few group wipe outs from unslowed Golems ravaging the group after me and chanter found ourselves returning to bind points. After a couple of those deaths, I tried to offer advice to cleric about using remedy line of heals, asked for regen from BST or Shammy during fights, and CHing me at 40%, heh...heh...and then finally cleric sent a message after one wipe out....&quot;oops..fell asleep at computer&quot; ....arghh...  I could have just left group, but thought to stick it out -- keep those 96% rezzes incoming -- to help cleric get better, but falling asleep at computer was just tooo much and it was the cleric who we all bid a g'nite too.  Then group re-formed with a new cleric who kept me alive no problem and we just rolled with the exp as I pulled golem camp, then went for spiders, wanderers, and crawlers until golems re-popped.  I told the cleric and slower that &quot;I'm able to keep aggro, so slow it and keep your attention on keeping me alive so the group can take down the beasts relatively damage free and we all can live from now on.&quot;  And, we did.<br />
<br />
Heh..heh..but you're right Dkhar, an unfocused or inexperienced cleric means death as those golems hit furiously...within a matter of seconds they can do well over a thousand hit points of damage and without well timed heals....&quot;Loading please wait....&quot;<br />
<br />
At this level, groups really shouldn't be a workshop for basic cleric healing, but then again I had to learn about Festering/Clinging combo, but I think that's a tad different than learning about when to remedy and CH.  Oh, also useful is to ask Clerics to give you Protection of Vie, but have found if i have to ask they usually don't have it.  <br />

Here's to the SK advice given here: /cheers and looking forward to lvl 65!!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ziglug D</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">lol i didnt read other posts :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Forget my suggestion that you NEED to post a magelo.  (sure it's still good to have one), but I think maybe part of the healing issues you were having was that the cleric would switch to the chanter when you'd lose agro.  So as soon as you'd get the agro the cleric was prolly healing the chanter (like an idiot) and you'd die before the spells could refresh and they could cast again.   Not sure but seen too many newbie clerics pull shit like that to assume that wasn't it.  I have PoV, it's like the new Dreadlands.  (Thankfully Keevel can't even go there yet)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Dakkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I'd suggest:<br />
<br />
Hit the mob with festering at max range while it's inbound then follow it instantly with fear or clinging darkness.<br />
<br />
If it's too close to you when you first catch sight of it, or unsnareable, use clinging then immediately follow it with fear.<br />
<br />
Keep casting clinging at intervals through the fight.<br />
<br />
When trying to prise mobs off aggroed casters, run up close to them, hit taunt and immediately follow with clinging.<br />
<br />
Bottom line, if the slower sees the snared mob crawling toward you while you're spamming aggro spells on it before it arrives in camp, if he's remotely competent it'll be slowed before it reaches you.  (Or you can ask him to do it.)  Not having to take unslowed hits compensates for a lot of gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Immortality</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I can safely say that the problem with you dying is your healer, as I have tanked everything from Inner to Wastelands in PoV on my 56 Shadowknight no problem while boxing a druid healer and a 56 shaman slowing.  It got more difficult when we got a real, single-boxing cleric healer in the group, really...they tend to not know how to compensate for hp at those levels(or any level for some people...people can level too fast these days).<br />
<br />
For refferrence, my SK sits at ~2700 hp, ~1220 ac unbuffed, and was tanking with buffing getting him to around ~4700, ~1275.  You simply have to CH early to compensate, and have fast heals ready for spikes.  Another option is having the cleric lead off with celest upon inc (/chuckle...when I told this to my last cleric they kept trying to cast it before i went to pull a mob so they &quot;wouldn't get agro&quot;...like celest has that much agro, or a shadowknight couldn't keep it off them..).  They can then CH if you start dropping in hp a lot easier, or just wait till its slowed to Ch, as a good celest would probably mostly sustain a decent tank in these circumstances until the mob is slowed.<br />
<br />
As for agro, Clinging Darkness and Fear are the only way to go.  Without any form of manaregen outside Mental Corruption while tanking, I tend to ONLY cast those two spells and sometimes ATK tap, depending on the group lay-out.<br />
<br />
Goodluck, and find better healers :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Ukbar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Thanks for comments to all.   I've used the Festering/Clinging Darkness combo (will also try fear at some point) to great success.  I have no problem keeping aggro no matter what the slower or healer cast.  The only problem now is getting the slower to hit the mob before it starts wolloping me and to get the healer to cast CH sooner not later.  I've also asked healers to put on celestial healing as fight begins, and to CH when i'm down to 30 - 40%.  Been working fine to date.  <br />
<br />
One side story, was in a group last night in POV when a 65 Warrior appears and fills a vacant space, and then takes over as MT/puller, which I had been doing for about two hours, and was set to leave soon.  I had kept aggro with no problem with a good healer and chanter casting away with no fear of aggro from beasts.  Heh..heh...was interesting to watch the 65 warrior have a little more difficulty getting aggro back after chanter cast slows.  Anyway, just an observation on a warrior's aggro vs. and sk's in this one particular situation.  <br />

I dont think characterizing this as a basic workshop is a fair description. Personal experience here, the POV Golems are going to be a first taste for many clerics of DPS burst damage in group fights. I had a lot of diffuculty adjusting my first couple times. Particularly when a healer is used to working with Warrior tanks, PoV and BoT with a Knight tank takes an entirely different approach. &lt;B&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1014325&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kragarth Archon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Ukbar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Yes, good point, POV is an adjustment to damage spikes for both healers and tanks alike, but have seen warriors go down in groups with CH landing too late and no use of remedy line, too.  However, as you write, and for what it's worth, POV does represent a new experience for damage spikes for many, so it is important to communicate with healers at the outset.  However, when you send a tell to the cleric -- not in group chat mind you -- that the mobs hit fast and furious with damage spikes especially if slow doesn't land first time, so please throw a celestial on me as I return and then start the CH between 50% to 60%, and they still wait till 20% to 30% to start CH, etc..well....after a couple or so deaths like that in a row....let's just say it gets old very quick.  And, yes, I'm only operating with about 5700 HP, 1280 to 1300 or so AC depending on buffs, so no Warrior HP here, for sure :D <br />
<br />
It's important to let healers and slowers know up front that aggro will be had before arriving...etc....so slow em and heal me without fear....well....maybe a little fear is good.   ;) <br />
<br />
Anyway, in BOT and HOH....heh..heh....damage takes on whole new meaning once again.....not to mention trains....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Winkles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Back while I was still playing my sk, before SOE killed him permanently with rollback, I found that switching to a slower weapon while mob was unslowed seemed to help a little with riposte damage.  Not sure how much it helps but one riposte from a golem in pov can be 600 damage.  <br />
<br />
I'm not sure if anyone has done any parses to check it out but I do remember that I seemed to take less damage when I used my great sword of discipline 51/54 while being mt.  CD and fear will hold aggro easy even when using such a slow weapon.  Heck sometimes I would even turn off attack till mob was slowed.  Just gotta have some faith in them spells LOL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Grarg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Duoing various mobs.<br />
Pre 1200ac and 65, the dmg spikes from a golem with the shards proc can kill you.<br />
<br />
My advice is this.<br />
<br />
The MR debuff/recourse is invaluable here, because it allows the shaman to slow reliably without using malos.<br />
<br />
Till I hit 65, to reliably tank the golems (and inner mobs) without being a massive mana sponge I used to do the following.<br />
<br />
Pull with the MR debuff (pre 65), at 65 festering stuck reliably enough to use it to pull.<br />
<br />
Run around in circles untill it was slowed.<br />
<br />
Engage AFTER slow.<br />
<br />
Yes it seems funny. But I could run a SK tanking and sham healing group filled with dps classes using that method.<br />
<br />
We could keep inner and outer clear.<br />
<br />
This is bazaar gear on the tank.<br />

Once I hit 65, I learned to love the beeeez in BOT but thats another story 8)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Ukbar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Thanks, with FD/CD pulling, with few resists, most slowers were able to slow golems before they arrived to wollop me.

Haven't had any trouble getting groups, but I also intend to find a good zone for soloing AA Exp until called for a group.
