<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tharivol Nailo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I don't know if I was drunk, high, or both but I made a Human Bertox Sk. I played him to level 15, liked him but he just didn't feel right. He was kinda weak with only 100 Str and he had like 80 Int, so, I'm making a new sk but I have no clue what race I should be, preferably a race that's lots of fun. Any suggestions from the pros?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aaoogaa Soulhunter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well the only races that are going to be stronger than a human are the troll and the ogre.  I play an ogre.  Now I am not suggesting you play an ogre I am just giving you information.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gwenix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Nothing is wrong with a human sure not the strongest race but we are well balanced in everything. All that really means is no weak stat to start out with (int for the biggies and str sta for the smarties)... If you want a brute str char go with an ogre or troll. I'd say ogre tho cause the troll exp penalty is quite noticable.<br />
<br />
Personally I'd stay with a human.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hekk Fire</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I made a few different SK's and the troll is the only one that felt right to me.  Sure, there is the XP penalty thing, but I still seem to get levels just fine.   In fact 51 so far has been a breeze.    Slam and regen are nice to have also, but the best ting abbout da trollz iz dey get ta skare da hummies an EET DEM!<br />
<br />
  I like the oggies too, but they seem just a tad TOO big.   I have a bit less trouble getting around as a troll than I did as an ogre.<br />

 Shadowknights are supposed to be evil too.   The big guys are evil.  The blue guys are evil.  The scaley guys too.    The gnomes are just too tiny and cute, kind of like a nice piece of cheese that you find and then when you take a bite...EWW! That's rotten!  Evil little cheese-gnome thingy!  Ok gnomes can be evil too in a way, heh.<br />
<br />

   Also, do yourself a favor and don't go try to make friends with the goodie goodies.   A friend of mine made his first ogre char and was all worried about factions until I showed him the delight of killing bards .  Next thing I know, he's asking me where to find more bards, he was having a blast actually BEING evil.   He's still having fun at level 61 (shammy), after ditching about a dozen chars that just weren't as fun for him.</div></div><hr />
