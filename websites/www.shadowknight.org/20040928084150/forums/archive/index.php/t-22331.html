<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Satist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm new to Windows XP.  With my old computer, I had Win ME.  With ME, I could shut down any/all extra crap programs, such as virus scanners, etc, to free up ram and the page file, in order to improve game performance.  I still lagged in the Bazaar, and during busy times in PoK, but came to expect that, and lowered my clip plane, and looked downward some to counter the effect a bit.  What am I able to shut down on Win XP, to have the same effect, or am I just sucking?<br />
<br />
To answer the next questions, I have an AMD 2800+ at 2.08 gig, with 512 mb of DDR PC2700, and a ATI Radeon 8500 SE. I know I need to upgrade the video card, eventually.  Also, eventually, I will be increasing the ram, to about 1.5 gig, if not 2 gig (all the MB will handle).<br />
<br />
My page file is set with 1000mb min, and 2000 mb max, and have somewhere around 40 or 50 gig free on my HD, so know that my crappy performance is not from a lack of space for virtual memory.  I also have all &quot;new&quot; models turned off, and don't play during normal primetime.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">right click on the task bar and open the task manager.  From there you can click on any running process and end it.  Can kill virus scanners, spyware, trojans, whatever is bogging you down.<br />
<br />
Also set the min and max size for your virtual mem to the same size- prevents the swap file from becomming terribly fragmented.</div></div><hr />

<br />
make sure to defrag your hard drive too, it may speed up your zoning times a bit.<br />
<br />
also you can right click on my computer and go to manage, that will allow you to do all kinds of system tweaking and so on.  be careful if you toy with your services...some like messenger can be disabled with no ill effect, but some like RPC can be disastrous if shut down.  If you tweak it right, you can possibly cut ram load by about 12-20mb.</div></div><hr />
