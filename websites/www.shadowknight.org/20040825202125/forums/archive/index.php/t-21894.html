<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dignitas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This originally was intended to be a posting for the Fahrenheit 911 thread, but I decided to answer this one thread briefly and make an own thread with my rantings about the United States.<br />
<br />
 [Fahrenheit 911] Worthless propaganda, how could it pass as a documentry?<br />
<br />
Michael Moore does it again!<br />
<br />
<br />
Moore has done more source research on this documentary than on any other film he has made so far, to steal the thunder of those people who started the attacks on him after his last film that called him a liar.<br />
<br />
It's generally a good idea to hear both sides before you claim someone is telling lies and not just trust the source that is telling you what you want to believe because it's in line with your political attitude. Here's what Mr. Moore has to say about the recent attacks on the authenticity of Fahrenheit:<br />
<br />
http://www.michaelmoore.com/words/latestnews/f911facts/<br />
<br />
<br />
Fahrenheit 911 has recieved the highest award a film can win in Europe: The golden Palm in Cannes, and it was only the 2nd time a documentary won this award. Believe me, there are politically educated people sitting in the jury, not a bunch of biased journalists like those on Fox and a handful of other TV Stations that sit on a political neo-liberal agenda, trying to conceal every unpolular step of Bush as good as a &quot;news&quot;-source is able to: <br />
<br />
Example: <br />
Make a 30 second report about torturing in iraq, show an &quot;expert&quot; who relativizes this for 2 minutes, hear Rumsfeld's statement for another minute, then quickly switch to another news report about two headed cow that was born in Kansas since that is what uncle sam's children really want to see in their news.<br />
<br />
<br />
You dont have the slightest idea how much your government messed up the opinion about your *chuckles* land of the free. Are we all communists here in Europe? Are we all swayed by propaganda? If yes, who is staging this propaganda and why are they doing it? Remember, we can't vote for or against your president. (Not that he does care for votes anyway). Isn't it much more likely that you are the people who are swayed by FOX et al.?<br />
<br />
Why would Fox do something like that? Besides the fact that most international companies are generally on the side of the republicans simply because of their much stronger neo-liberal agenda than the democrats, Fox has a special interest in supporting Bush and his crew because he is preparing new media ownership laws. Laws that would enable Rupert Murdoch to become the biggest media Mogul in the world. Bush stands deep in debt of Murdoch. You'll see it happen.<br />
<br />
Now you'll tell me I hate the USA, like you've done before with others posting stuff you did'nt like. Do I hate it? I'm not sure, it depends on your definition. I definately hate your current government. Put me, a rusty dagger and Bush/Cheney/Rumsfeld/Wolfowitz into a room, and the only person you'll see coming out will be a bloody german guy with a Bush/Cheney/Rumsfel/Wolfowitz pelt. Ok probably not, I'm a peaceful guy, but that should give you an idea of how much I hate them.<br />
Do I hate the american culture? No way, how could I? In the last few decades, your culture has become our own. We hear your music, we wear your clothes, we play your online games and regrettably we eat your food. I prefer american culture over the traditional german one.<br />
Do I hate the american people? No. I regulary get upset about those Fox news watchers and their unqualified comments about world politics and I regulary get upset about the still too strong american racism. I regulary get upset about american companies and how they recklessly exploit ressources and workers of developing countries (yet other countries do that too, including my own's). I regulary get upset about most americans attitude about environmental protection, yet I am still aware that there are at least 20% americans that are not either to lazy or to uneducated to watch real news, read real newspapers and have a progressive attitute about how people should live on this planet. So I cant generally say I hate american people.<br />
<br />
Do I think the world at it's current state would be a better place without the USA? Yup, I do. For obvious reasons and the reasons I have named and a few others.<br />
<br />
Reasonable people are invited to discuss. Flamers will courteously be ignored if I feel like it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Daqar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Tell me what you think of Bill Clinton's presidency before I decide what I think of you unbiased opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dignitas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Clinton was more harmless but he's also responsible for the bombing of innocent people, the supporting of dictators (Gyanendra in Nepal comes to mind) and he recommended not ratifying the International Court of Den Haag. Those are a few points that make me dislike him too. <br />
Still peanuts compared to George W. Bush. At least he didn't break loose two large scale wars of which at least one was unjustified, break the Kyoto Protocoll treaty and trimmed US civil rights bringing it dangerously close to a police state.<br />
<br />
Edit: Please note, when I mention Bush, I mean his whole cabinet. Bush simply is a puppet. I'm not saying he is stupid, but i sometimes feel he'd rather be back in the 70s, being a lazy alcoholic and burning his daddies money on luxuries and easy girls. Behind Bush there's a movement pulling the puppet strings: http://www.newamericancentury.org/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Krudler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Another jealous European tried the whole anti-american thread thing and was exposed for the ignorant hateful person he is.  Quit while you're ahead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Krudler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It's also funny that you attack Fox news.  Fox covered the Abu Ghraib scandal ad nauseum, but you're too biased to notice that.  You take one 4 minute clip from Fox and use that to &quot;prove&quot; your point.  You defend Michael Moore but there were several factual flaws with his last movie and it was proven that he manipulated clips to create speaches that didn't happen.  If that's not lying I'm not sure what is.  There are also several of his &quot;facts&quot; from his current movie that are under investigation, so it will be interesting to see how that turns out.  <br />
The fact of the matter is you do hate America, whether you want to admit it or not, and that makes your positions on America biased.  Nowhere in your post do you mention that America is the largest provider of humanitarian aid in the world, most likely because that would really hurt your argument.  <br />
<br />
You say that you are aware that 20% of americans are too lazy to read or listen to &quot;real news&quot;?  Please back this up with some kind of facts.  Also define what &quot;real news&quot; is.  Apparently we Americans are not as smart as Europeans so we can't tell the difference between what is real and what is fake.  <br />
<br />
Just an FYI so you know my positions:<br />
 I love my country.  Does my country have flaws?  Yes, but give me one country that doesn't.  Will any of your hateful posts change my views?  No.  Do I believe removing a murderous dictator was the right thing to do?  Yes.  Do I believe that since we remove one we should remove the rest?  Eventually.  Do I believe most European countries are too weak now to have a say in what we do?  Yes.  Do I believe that America should put its own interests and safety above the interests of European countries that don't like us?  Yes.  Do I believe that the &quot;enlightened&quot; Europeans have forgotten everything America has done for them?  Yes.  Will I vote for Bush mainly because people that hate America want him out of office?  Yes.  If you hate America, I'm voting against the guy you want in.  Do I believe many European countries undermine the U.S. simply because they're jealous that we are what they used to be?  Yes.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, those are my views, and neither you nor Michael Moore or any other socialist will change those views.  I don't rely on people who hate America to change my views, I rely on current events and the state of America.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well I really don't know how a german can hate the Americans.  After all we rebuilt your country after World War 2.  <br />
<br />
If anything Americans are very forgiving people despite having seen the atrocities the germans were capable of in two world wars we still maintain a good relationship with the German people and consider them to be allies.<br />
<br />
I don't think any other country would have rebuilt their former enemy.  I don't think any of this was ever repaid.<br />
<br />
I am not saying that I agree with what our government does because for the most part I don't.  But these issues are many sided but this euro hatred of the USA is absurd.  <br />
<br />
Please try to read some history and look at the world war 2 reconstruction efforts and reconsider your opinion of North Americans.<br />

I have provided some  links for you to aid your in your research<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Krudler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Inferna, not only did we rebuild their country, but we saved them from starvation from the Communists during the Berlin airlift.  It's nice to know those deeds have been forgotten.<br />
<br />
Actually just got back from Germany, and I can't say I've ever been treated so badly in my life, save for my trip to France in the 90s.  <br />
Among some of the highlights:  Being harrassed in a restaurant by 3 Germans who told me that in America we have government sponsored death squads that go around torturing and murdering blacks, that we kill our old people, that president Bush is planning on dropping nuclear weapons on Iraq, and that Americans are trained in school how to use guns.  I also enjoyed the worker at hotel telling us he hoped we would leave his country soon.  There other unpleasant situations but I'm not going to get into it.<br />
Very enlightened and kind people indeed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Please specify, jealous about what? Average living standard in germany is higher than that of the USA. Our welfare and free healthcare is superb. You comment shows again how ignorant you are about how people live outside of god's own country. heh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I believe what actually happened with the European debt to the USA after WW2 (the financial one) is that it was &quot;forgiven&quot; and wiped clean a few years later, most likely on the grounds that repaying it would impoverish the country we were using as our &quot;buffer&quot; against the Red Menace of the USSR.  So saying that it wasn't repaid is technically true, but the reasons behind it weren't exactly the Europeans (mostly Germany I believe) saying that they weren't going to pay us.  I'm a little fuzzy on my European history post WW2, so if anybody else knows anything about this situation and what happened, please feel free to let me know.<br />
<br />
That being said, I've seen a lot of hostility towards the USA from people that live in Europe.  Some of it is justified, as we certainly come across as arrogant bastards who will do whatever we want because we can, especially with our most recent administration.  It also seems like some of it isn't justified at all as well, but I suppose that's just human nature.  The USA isn't perfect, but I think that if you look at our country as a whole with an honest, open mind, you'll see that there is more good than bad to us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Krudler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Please specify, jealous about what?

<br />
Jealous of America's military and economic influence all over the world.  Jealous that our country is growing economically while yours is not.  Upset that we don't have to listen to what Germany says because Germany has rendered itself insignificant?  Jealous that America is the only superpower left?  Upset that President Bush embarrassed Germany in front of the whole world by denying its request for contracts in Iraq. <br />
Yes you have free healthcare, but you understand that that is a zero sum game?  Probably not because you're ignorant.  That money spent on healthcare comes from somewhere else...taxes?  Canada has free healthcare too, but that is becoming a problem because our drug companies are beginning to stop selling in Canada because they can't make any extra money for R&amp;D.  Their once mighty healthcare system is beginning to crumble.  This is the natural progression of worldwide economy.<br />
And yes average living standards are slightly higher in Germany, but we don't live in a nanny-like society in America where if you don't want to work the government will take money from people who do and give it to you.  We have welfare, but it's not nearly as much as it is in Germany.  In America we believe that you should earn your money.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dignitas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Funny how you always try to muzzle europeans and especially germans about their history and how the USA are such a good and caring country...

I can come up with historical atrocities the USA have done. Hey, let's talk about native americans for a while if you desire to escalate the history debate. Then let's talk a bit about slavery. When we're done with that, we can talk about atrocities in the 2nd half of the 20th century that our countries committed. You'll find a bunch of them for the USA. None of Germany.<br />
<br />
Well I really don't know how a german can hate the Americans. After all we rebuilt your country after World War 2.  <br />
<br />
The USA contributed 13 billion dollars for economical and technical help to rebuild europe, not only germany. 16 countries got funds out of that pool.<br />
<br />
Europe was devastated after WW2. A dead Europe would have been very bad for the USA too, since most of american exports went to europe. Who would have bought them? Dont think you live in an altruistic country. The whole reason the USA entered the war in Europe in the first place was that they were seeing the russians advancing fast. Germany was losting after Stalingrad. If they had not entered the war, the whole European continent would have been overrun by Russia.<br />
<br />
Lastly, the USA learned from World War 1 experience. Germany was heavy penalized, economically and military crippled and left on its own. That's how Hitler could seduce the people and raise to power. They did'nt want to have that again and decided to educate the germans to be a democratic society. I appreciate that, yet I dont think they did that because they are so loving and caring.</div></div><hr />

You obviously ran into a bunch of uneducated idiots then. We have a lot of them here too. :) Yet I can confirm, that this is the first time I heared of this crap (nuclear bombs, gun classes in school, torturing blacks etc.). This is not what the average german thinks.</div></div><hr />

Well going by your quote I don't feel any guilt about slavery or the treatment of native americans either since I was not alive then and my family didn't even arrive in the USA until the 1900 from Italy.<br />

Do I think this was bad thing yes.  <br />
<br />
Were the concerns over russia and the end of WW 1 Factors in the formulation of the Marshall Plan factors in it?  Sure they were but were they they only factors?  No.  Would the US have done this without those two threats?  I am sure they would have/<br />

See?  No gratitude.  So maybe we didn't do it because we're loving and caring, no nations really are.  The fact of the matter is we did it and it's been largely forgotten.  We then were the only force protecting you from Russia.  <br />
<br />
And you mention 16 billion like it's a drop in the bucket....you also forget that we just finished fighting a war as well and that 16 billion in 1940s dollars was an enourmous amount of money.  <br />
<br />
You also mention that Germany didn't commit any atrocities in the 2nd half of the century....yeah you didn't, but it would be kind of hard to without a military.<br />
<br />
You also keep forgetting that evil America is the largest provider of humanitarian aid in the world, contributing more to third world countries than all of your beloved enlightened European countries combined.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I seem to remember that at the end of WW1, the USA was opposed to the crippling penalties imposed on Germany.  Obviously our opinion didn't care much weight with France, who had spent the previous four years or so helping to demolish its own countryside, and didn't much like Germany anyway.  So yes, the lessons learned from WW1 certainly influenced the decisions made at the end of WW2, but like others have said, I think we would have helped to rebuild Europe anyway, both because it was to our advantage to do so, and because it was the &quot;right&quot; thing to do.  I think we learned plenty about what to do with a defeated foe after the American Civil War and the mess that the South became afterwards.</div></div><hr />

Damn bro, get off your high-horse. I didn't see a reason, at all, why his post would resemble a jealous rant. Many, many Americans hold that same position and would you consider them jealous? <br />
<br />
<br />
And saying: <br />
Well I really don't know how a german can hate the Americans. After all we rebuilt your country after World War 2.<br />
IS really pretty stupid. You need to take into consideration that at least 2 generations have been born since then. I am also pretty sure they don't teach &quot;Let us give thanks to America for helping us rebuild Europe after WW2 so you should have no reason to hate the U.S.&quot; in German classrooms. <br />
You can't expect History to teach that or show Germans they should be greatful to us, the U.S.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your economy is growing on the back of the lowest class, while the upper class is getting filthy filthy rich. See some statistics about wealth distribution in your country. I think this is pretty sad. I'm also not a fan of military actions. I'd object any military participation of my country, except for peace missions of the United Nations. I would very strongly object that my country starts a war for economic and geostrategic reasons like yours does at the moment. So would a wide majority of the germans. Do you really think all those war protesters that the world saw last year would have stayed at home when it would have been their own country that conquered Iraq? And I'd like to emphasize the word &quot;conquer&quot;.<br />
<br />
Upset that we don't have to listen to what Germany says because Germany has rendered itself insignificant?<br />
<br />
Upset is not the same thing as jealous, and that's what we're talking about, right I am upset that the USA are overriding decisions of the United Nations and does'nt hear what they say. The World community has agreed upon a few easy to follow rules, and the USA has along with some other country even a much stronger voice in the UN, yet they are still overriding decisions whenever they think it might be to their advantage.<br />
<br />
Yes you have free healthcare, but you understand that that is a zero sum game? Probably not because you're ignorant. That money spent on healthcare comes from somewhere else...taxes?

<br />
Yes, our welfare and healthcare system is crumbling. It's hard not to notice it. Globalization is leading to the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer. Your country is a few years ahead of mine in that matter. Our health system will be cut more and more too. <br />
BUT, I never stated our health system is the ultima ratio of all. I was stating how it currently is, and that currently there is no reason to be jealous. Right now there's no reason to be jealous. Germany is doing more for me, than the USA would if i lived there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For whatever reasons the war was started, the net postive effects will be worth it.  Let's see, a democracy in a region filled with murderous fanatical dictators?  An ally of the west in a region that hates everything both our countries stand for?  Emphasize the word conquer all you want, it just makes you even more of a demagogue.<br />
I'm sure you're in the camp that says we started this war for oil, but I want a number.  How much oil have we taken from Iraq without paying for it?  So far the people benefiting from Iraq's oil are the Iraqis.  They pay 5 cents a gallon.<br />
There is a wealth gap in our country, but that is the natural result of capitalism.  You don't like it, tough.  And our economy is not growing on the backs of the poor, it is growing as a result of the tax cuts and new business being created.  More white-collar jobs have been created than blue-collar, and those are the jobs that pay.  <br />

<br />
It was a little bit more complicated that that, Historyman. It was your President Wilson who strongly supported the Treaty of Versailles. I suppose you get your point that you &quot;were opposed to the high penalties&quot; because your senate never ratified the treaty. Simply this is not true. The person sitting on the negotiating table, President Wilson, was in favor of it. The treaty makers could'nt care less what the senate means.<br />

I'm talking about the other things you bring up, like the war in Iraq.  I'm sure most of the people on this site were not materially involved with the war, so if it hypothetically was wrong why should they feel guilty about it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Dignitas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">For whatever reasons the war was started, the net postive effects will be worth it. Let's see, a democracy in a region filled with murderous fanatical dictators?  <br />
<br />
A puppet government in a country that is a powder keg. A people that is not yet ready for being forced into a democracy. A guerilla war that every single expert predicted before the conquest (that's the reason by the way why George HW. Bush did'nt go for Baghdad). More people that die every day because of the ignition of a political power struggle than before under Hussein's rule. Of course I hated Hussein, just like i hate all misanthropic dictators in the world, yet removing him with force was a terrible strategy. Hussein was well under control by the United Nations since the first Gulf War. <br />
<br />
I'm sure you're in the camp that says we started this war for oil, but I want a number. How much oil have we taken from Iraq without paying for it? So far the people benefiting from Iraq's oil are the Iraqis. They pay 5 cents a gallon.<br />
<br />
I think you did'nt understand the Oil thing. Stealing the Oil is a different thing from having access to this Oil. No educated person would expect the US Army coming with huge tank ships, hauling the oil to the States. Having a puppet government in Iraq simply enables the USA to have Oil free from OPEC price pressure, because sure as hell Iraq wont go into the Opec. So Iraq Oil will not be subject to OPEC prices and drilling rates.<br />
<br />
And one question: what exactly do you hope to accomplish besides pissing people off by coming to a site like this and ripping on America and Americans?<br />

I read a lot of so called patriotism here in threads and felt like sharing my opinion, maybe even showing some americans that not everything is true they hear on the news and giving you insight on what the majority of the world population thinks of you and why.</div></div><hr />

I feel like they are doing wrong by thinking the Iraq war is a good thing, supporting their president, their troops and generally producing a nationwide feeling that everything is allright when it is not. <br />
<br />
(I didn't consciously bring the Iraq war in conjunction with the feeling of guilt. That wouldn't be an appropiate word, since a person who thinks he is doing right or support the agenda he thinks is right does not have a feeling of guilt.)</div></div><hr />

Yes Iraq has a puppet gov't right now, but they need one.  They can't run it themselves so they need us, and they've said so.  The real test will come next year when they have their first real elections.  <br />
<br />
You say Iraq is in chaos right now, but that's only because the media reports bad news.  There are a few major cities where there are problems, but much of the country is under control and the people have much more than they did with saddam.  You say more people are dying now than under saddam, where are your numbers?  Hussein killed over 1 million people during his regime, and those are just the ones we know of so far.   You talk about how bad of a guerilla war it is, but we've lost far less troops than any other &quot;guerilla war&quot;.  <br />
<br />
Your statement about Saddam being under control by the UN is laughable.  If by under control you mean he was allowed to kick out weapons inspectors at will, continue the slaughter and murder of thousands of people, allowed to gas his own people, allowed to pay the families of terrorists in Palestine, allowed to shoot at Coalition planes patrolling the no-fly zone, and allowed to maintain the terrorist training camp at SALMAN Pak where training was done on jetliners, then yeah, I guess he was under control.  And oh what a wonderful job the UN did with that oil for food program.  That worked out well.  The strategy of appeasement and containment has failed throughout history.  I remember similar arguments being made before WW2 about how Hitler would not be a threat if he was contained.  And oh what a wonderful job the UN did with that oil for food program.  That worked out well.</div></div><hr />

Seriously though, you're not going to change any opinions with these tactics.  This is not the right time or venue for that.  Really the only thing you'll be able to accomplish is getting a lot of people angry, even ones that may agree with you.

He lobbied for the Senate to approve the Treaty of Versailles because it was that treaty that created the League of Nations.  It was his belief that US membership in the League of Nations was essential to a lasting world peace, along with 13 other points laid out in his &quot;Fourteen Points&quot; address.<br />
<br />
Anyway, Wilson isn't exactly my favorite of the Presidents we have had in our history, as he was most certainly a racist, and a lot of his worthwhile ideas failed to gain support.

The body count for iraq civilian casualties is currently at a min of 9436 to a max of 11317. Most of them children under 13. That's not counting the people dying by lack of electricity or water supply.<br />

<br />
Carpet bombing the country would have been contraproductive to the (secondary) goal to build up trust, trying to tame the iraqi people and not make them terrorists and guerillas. Also imagine what the reactions of the international community would have been to a flat out carpet bombing run.<br />
<br />
Also back on the Saddam Hussein issue. Go read the reports of Amnesty International between 1991 and 2001. S. Hussein was a tame dictator compared to others in the region. All the civilian killing you quoted, happened before Iraq War 1, in a time where Iraq was your best Ally against the Iran. When the world protested against the civilian gas killings Saddam Hussein did with US supplied gas (!!), the US smiled and turned away.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is why I'm posting, because you're posting false &quot;facts&quot;.  You say he was a &quot;tame dictator&quot;, yet after Gulf War 1 there was an uprising that was put down in the most brutal way.  Thousands were slaughtered.  Saddam then sent Chemical Ali to gas the kurds, of which 5000 were killed.  Very tame, but I guess acceptable in the European community.  People were routinely murdered and tortured, and this is a fact.  <br />
<br />
Again, if we were so horrible on human rights and were so evil, why would we bother trying to &quot;tame&quot; the Iraqis?  All they do is get in the way.  We could have just eliminated them all and set up shop there for our oil.  And since we're such a bad country, why would we care what the international community thinks about what we did?<br />
<br />
You list the body count of civilians.  I went to that site, and it is clearly against the war in Iraq.  It puts the word &quot;noble&quot; in quotes, right away showing its stance.  Since it is not a neutral organization, its numbers cannot be trusted, especially since it did not list its sources or how it acquired the info besides saying it got it from &quot;news reports&quot;.  We don't even really know who these people are.  You need to be more skeptical of things you pull off of the internet.  Also, even if that was the real number, which I highly doubt, that number is very small considering the densely populated cities in Iraq.  Compare that number with the number of civilian deaths in Germany due to allied bombings.</div></div><hr />

You seem to be someone who's more educated about this specific issue. I withdraw my statement about the USA supporting the idea to impose serious penalties on germany. Thanks for your insightful contribution. :)<br />

I dont care for my country because basically I think countries are not a good concept at all. Countries fight for their own interests most of the time, not for the good of mankind alltogether, so they are often counterproductive. I'm very glad Europe is uniting, creating a larger block where countries can sit together and discuss their common future. One day I hope there will be a federal world government with all people having an equal voice. I realize we're a long way away from that, but nontheless we should work towards that.</div></div><hr />

Way to make a bunch of ASSumptions about someone you haven't met.  It isn't easy to get your way out of poverty, but if you work hard you will be rewarded.  If you sit on your ass all day feeling sorry for yourself about how you lost your job then the government is going to give you a small check but you're not going to have much of a life.  And yes a lot of poor people are to blame for their condition.  When you simply don't want to work and just want that government check or decide to drop out of school, then yes, you are to blame.

Wow, you sure like to presume a lot about me. And nearly everything you presumed was wrong.<br />
Without going into detailed personal history, suffice to say that while members of my family were indeed well off, my mother and I were not. I lived, at times, in a van, growing up. (Note that we did not at any time recieve government aid, my mother was too proud to go on the dole.)<br />
I was fortunate enough to be born with a good mind, and was in advanced classes throughout school, until i graduated highschool at 16. The education here is available for those who WANT IT.<br />
I lost my best paying job, making 150k+ a year, due to outsourcing and a greedy union (fucking socialists), and the entire industry pretty much moved out of the states. I will not be able to find another such job.<br />
I have to pay for my own medical insurance. It's a good investment. When I didnt ahve it last year and had to go the the emergency room, it's a good thing I had put some money away to handle situations such as that.<br />
Thats how I take care of myself.<br />

We'll see how well those 15 troops serve you when you're targeted for terrorist attacks.  And you'll say, oh, we're not involved with that situation so we won't get attacked.  Well Spain thought they could hide from the terrorists if they pulled their troops out of Iraq.  Too bad they just found another bomb near a train a couple weeks ago.  Be passive and naive all you want, but it will happen.  Bear in mind Canada is involved with Iraq.<br />
<br />
And saying not getting any contracts was inevitable shows your lack of knowledge.  Every country that helped America during the war was given contracts, and eventually and more privately Bush did decide to give some contracts to America junior.  But if you were knowledgeable about the Iraq situation you would have known that.</div></div><hr />

I 3. Then I made a mistake by defending germany. Pretty stupid actually, since I dont even care for my country. I just could not stand that someone was posting lies, making the USA look better. Just to clarify this, I see myself more as an European citizen just as human.<br />
<br />
 <br />
I really don't know what to say about a person that doesn't even care for their own country.  I can't imagine what that would be like.<br />
<br />
My point about bringing up WW II was not so much that you should feel guilty about it but that you should be more careful about throwing stones against the US.  Like it has been said we have provided more aid to countries in need then all the european nations combined.<br />
<br />
One lesson we learned from World War II was not to let these dictators go on and get out of hand.  If anything we should have acted sooner.  To say that Sadam was under control after the Gulf War is crazy.  He was gassing Kurds and rounded up everyone who provided or was even though to have provided any assistance to the US during the war and tortured and killed them and their families.</div></div><hr />

Still peanuts compared to George W. Bush. At least he didn't break loose two large scale wars of which at least one was unjustified, break the Kyoto Protocoll treaty and trimmed US civil rights bringing it dangerously close to a police state.<br />

  Ratification of that International Court would have undermined the sovereignty of all law in North America.  I don't want to be extradited to answer charges or face stiff penalties for something that ISN'T illegal in U.S.  That kind of centralized control from across the Atlantic and it's ability to levy taxes is one of the reasons the Founding Fathers fomented revolt in the first place.<br />
<br />
The first Americans extradited to face charges for something that isn't illegal in the U.S. will likely spark a world war.  That or it'll spark a new revolt in the U.S. and the idiots that allowed it to take place will be lined up and shot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. I read &quot;Stupid white man&quot; from MM (not Mithaniel Marr!). First it was cool cuz he flamed G. W. Bush. Then it was cool cuz he didnt stop and flamed Clinton too. I thought: &quot; Cool this man really tries to show all the bad and doesnt stop with Republicans.&quot; Then i read on and saw that the whole book was about how good America could have been if all had voted for Nader.<br />
That was the moment i realized Michael Moore is fat idiot.<br />
2. I dont like George W. Bush i didnt like his father back then but thats my personal view of politics. <br />
3. I liked Clinton, till he started to lie to his own people. If it would have been something of importance .. well all politicians Lie... but a Blowjob from the ugly Lewinsky ? He must have been very desperate ...<br />
4. I dont think it was right to invade the iraq a second time. Dunno the exact reason of the US goverment, but nearly all of &quot;Bush's Gang&quot; :rolleyes: were deep in the oil business before.<br />
5. IF the newly installed iraqi goverment manages to keep peace and bring the Iraq to be a real Democracy i think it was worth it. but i dont believe the will happen ... looks to me we will have iran 2.0 but im not a expert in those matters<br />
6. Patriotism has a very differnent taste for Americans and especially germans. An American is suppossed to be proud of his Country but if a Germans says: Ich bin stolz Deutscher zu sein (im proud to be German), first he will hear is : You are a Nazi! Same thing if a German is crazy enough to criticis Isral. One wrong word here and you a Facist for the rest of your Days ...<br />

I appologize for my abrupt interupption into this discussion. I also appologize for reading nothing beyond this particular post before replying, but I felt that I must. I question any country that listens to the decisions of the UN. First off because Cuba is on the board of human rights. Secondly because because of many, many decisions made by the UN in the recent past that have lost the UN the respect of myself and many others that I know.

I know it's hard to argue with that, but those people that are all RAA RAA about their country have the right to be that way, and I don't really see it as all that bad as long as people can keep an open mind.  Maybe they actually believe a lot of countries suck ass compared to the U.S., and certain times I would agree with them.  <br />

I don't think we have to consider something that none of us were involved with and that happened 150 years ago when we are being patriotic.  If that is the case then just about every country in the world should not be patriotic because they all were involved with terrible things.  Other countries should also then consider their histories before criticizing us because they committed atrocities in the past.  This logic doesn't work.</div></div><hr />

Yes this is true but you don't understand that times change and people change...We cannot compare ourselves to the Americans of the revolutionary war, the civil war, or even WW2.

Or possibly insinuating that I do not realise that even poor people like I was, get the benefits of public roads, school and water from taxes.<br />
This is simply not true.<br />
The fact is, I have paid and paid and paid my entire working life (near 40% taxes at one time), without asking or recieving anything in return except for a free country in which to live in.<br />
Besides which, you have taken what I have said somewhat out of context. Mr. Germany implied I was born well-off, growing up without seeing or realising the plight of the less fortunate. <br />
To put my situation in line with crack whore mothers that keep popping out kids to recieve larger welfare checks, or with the hand-held social medicine programs of other countries (which are breaking these countries backs) is ludicrous.<br />
I take responsibility for my actions by paying for them with my own time, sweat and blood. Not any one elses.</div></div><hr />

Indeed, I do refuse to take responsibility for slavery. I also refuse to take responsibilty for the freedom of our country. I had nothing to do with either.<br />
You assume, however, that by me saying this, that I feel neither compassion for the plight of the slaves that existed nor pride in my countries accomplishment of independence. Is it impossible to appreciate a painting that you have not painted? You seem to presume so.<br />

Not any german citizen, the particular german citizen who wants stuff done for him. The difference between American governmetn assistance and German government assistance may be small on a whole, but then again, the government assistance I have recieved in my adult life (none) in contrast to many other Americans is huge. The fact of the matter, is that as an American, I have the freedom to work hard to become more than I am, to get more than I have, and yes, get more than another American.<br />
This also can mean that if I do not work hard, I can live an impoverished life, and not be able to pay for things like medical care.<br />
Mr. Germany, in this case, seems  to prefer a situation where rewards for hardwork or penalties for laziness are met with far less impact on ones way of life, as long as he is 'taken care of'.<br />
America makes these things possible. So yes, I am more independant, and my greater successes or failures are almost entirely dependant on me.<br />

<br />
I think it's fine to talk about being independant and such.  I'm glad you've reached the measure of success you have.  I think, when you eliminate the rhetoric and the hyperbole, it comes down to an argument about where the &quot;safety net&quot; should be set.  In making choices about this, I think most people agree that success should be more reflective of one's choices, and less reflective accidents and circumstances.  (Perhaps this is a controversial point, I don't know.)  The debate comes in striking an appropriate balance.<br />

History is an incredibly important part of who we are and why we are here.  There is no doubt that one needs to consider their own History when judging another.  When you are calling yourself an American you are not calling yourself an American as of June 29th, 2004 @ 3:37 pm etc etc...  You are referring to yourself as a member of a group of people who have been in a specific locale for a certain time and you should acknowledge the responsibility of the actions of that locale.  That flag you are so proud of flew over the murder of thousands of Native Americans just as it flew over the White House when Reagan spoke of the end of the Cold War.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u106"><b>Krudler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p106">What would you about a Mexican American?<br />
<br />
Going by Francosis' logic I'd say a Mexican American is an American and if he shows pride about America he needs to consider the atrocities &quot;Americans&quot; before him committed.  You should feel a sense of guilt and responsibility for what people did 150 years ago even though your ancestors most likely were not even in this country.  Your pride for America should be softened by the fact that blacks were once slaves here.  All of America's actions here and overseas should be put into the perspective that people that are now long buried once allowed slaves...over a century and a half ago.  Showing pride should make one the subject of ridicule and derision with pictures of bound slaves because slavery existed in this country and &quot;we&quot; wiped out most of the Native Americans.<br />
<br />
In summary: American pride is bad, mmmkay.</div></div><hr />

Nazak, while preaching &quot;Explicitly state the principle guiding your opinion. State the facts you find applicable (positively and negatively) to that principle. Show how these connect to reach your conclusions. Then we have a basis for discussion&quot;, does exactly the opposite.<br />
While the third world country issues he brought up were in fact true, they had no relevance to the topic at hand.<br />
He being obviously more skilled in rhetoric and derailment than I, I knew what he was doing but having trouble pointing it out.<br />
Using the vast differences between an unrelated subject and part of the subject at hand to change the perspective of the whole subject being discussed is effective if you are seeking to seemingly discredit an idea that cannot be argued against rationally. Turning an item of discussion into something it is not so that it can be manipulated to your own liking is irresponsible and dishonest.<br />
It's unfortunate that the majority of information available to all of us is treated in that way to one degree or another.</div></div><hr />

Yes you should recognize the good and bad, and you shouldn't forget history.  This does not mean, however, that you cannot have a strong sense of pride in your country and it should not mean that whenever someone shows pride the issue of slavery should be brought up.  It also does not mean that our actions overseas are illigitimate because there was slavery in our country.<br />

I am not saying that you should not be proud of your country.  We have many accomplishments that we can be proud of.  I'm just commenting on the fact that too often people do not consider that bad has occured and seem to take great offense when someone points out that yes, the United States has committed evil.  Just as the person who stereotyped the US as a bunch of Redneck hillbilly's needs to consider the strengths and weaknesses of their country we need to consider ours.

Again you're confusing &quot;affecting&quot; you with &quot;controlling&quot; you.  I was never required to take a Black History Class.  In this situation, it is your school that is controlling you, not history.  History affects your college's decision to make that a graduation requirement, it does not force your college to do so.  <br />
<br />
You say that the civil war controlled where I live, that if the North hadn't won I wouldn't be living where I am today.  That may be true, but the North winning the civil war isn't the reason I'm here today.  My parents didn't choose to live here because the north won the civil war, and they could have easily moved back to our ancestral country.  If they were controlled by history as you say they would not have had the option to move if they wanted.  History affects us, it does not control us.</div></div><hr />

You keep argueing for the lack of social care in your country with stereotypes like &quot;crack whore mothers that keep popping out babies to recieve larger welfare checks&quot; or with people that are to lazy to work. There are those people, but they are a minority. The real problem is, that there's simply not enough work for full employment.  And don't you think the crack whore might be a product of the social coldness in your country? You rarely see middle or upper class ladies smoking crack and selling their bodies. <br />
Grats, you have made it out of your miserable life in your van, maybe because you learned the right job, maybe because you're a smart brain and maybe because you have not yet given up yourself, but not everybody is as lucky as you. <br />
Instead of spitting on the poor crack whore or that homeless guy at the train station your country should help them to regain perspective in live. If you are proud for what your country does, and you think they do it right, why are there still so many unemployed and poor people? Why are your jails full of people who lost perspective? (No country in the world has such a large percentage of it's male population in jail)<br />
<br />
What your country does instead, is spending a huge amount of money on a totally inflated military apparat, tax cuts for the upper and middle class and wars that violate international law.<br />
<br />
Another interesting fact you should not ignore when thinking about social welfare is that no western country has such a large child poverty rate. Your country is the only one where children make up the poorest social layer. Do you tell the kids to get a job? Interesting enough, you also have the highest youth suicidal rate and the world.</div></div><hr />

While there are still problems in Iraq, atleast you dont have Saddam trying to exterminate the Kurds.  Those people suffered the worst at his hands, he routinely used chemcial weapons on them.<br />
     Your a bit full of yourself, as are most Europeans when it comes to matters that deal with America..  Americans are the same way with matters concerning Europeans, and most notably the UN, the antiquated organization that it is.<br />
     Most people, when put to the question will support theyre country.  Your judging the American people by what youve read, or seen on tv.  I challange you to come and meet them.  They are a decent hard working people for the most part.  Sure, they have some really rotten people, but most arent nearly as bad as you are so desperatly trying to paint them.  <br />
     To the Amercians I say, most Germans arent nearly as arrogant or obnoxious people as some who post here are.  They are a solid, hardworking, supportive people who are desperatly seeking to rise from the fires built on the sins of theyre fathers.  Bottom line, its the people who sterotype and label others who make the world a crappy place.</div></div><hr />

The problem w/ that film is that too many people believe anything that they see. It's hillarious when someone walks up to me and says, &quot;That new movie Ferenheit 9/11 proves Bush knew 9/11 was going to happen and did nothing&quot; or something close to those lines and brilliantly also adds that it was ... yes of course &quot;for the oil.&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u126"><b>Krudler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p126">If you are proud for what your country does, and you think they do it right, why are there still so many unemployed and poor people? <br />
<br />
What your country does instead, is spending a huge amount of money on a totally inflated military apparat, tax cuts for the upper and middle class and wars that violate international law.<br />
<br />
Another interesting fact you should not ignore when thinking about social welfare is that no western country has such a large child poverty rate. Your country is the only one where children make up the poorest social layer. Do you tell the kids to get a job? Interesting enough, you also have the highest youth suicidal rate and the world. <br />
<br />
<br />
High unemployment rate?  The world average is around 6.6%, and currently America's unemployment rate is hovering around 4.9%.  The fact of the matter is that America embraces capitalism, and if you can't get a job the government won't save your ass and get one for you.  You have to get it for yourself.  <br />
<br />
Wars that violate international law?  Name one please.  And don't say Iraq because that war was perfectly legal as America had a legal right to go in after Iraq violated 17 UN regulations imposed after Gulf War 1.  <br />
<br />
You can go on and list all of the things you think are wrong with America, but give me one country that doesn't have problems.  I don't expect you to understand why we're proud of our country, seeing as you don't even like your own.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u127"><b>Nazak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p127">Two points:<br />
<br />
It looks to me like I owe a degree of apology.  What appeared to me to be a discussion between Howlitoezis and Dignitas about the similarities and differences between how various contries serve their citizens, in fact turn out to be a pissing contest over which country is &quot;better&quot;.  Moreover, it does seem like Dignitas is doing most of the &quot;pissing&quot;, and others are reacting.  I still maintain that the two countries being compared are more alike than different, but it's clear to me that, at least here, the pissing is more important.<br />
<br />
Second, there are many issues surrounding unemployment figures and how they are calculated.  In the U.S., at least, they don't count people who have been unemployed long enough for their benefit to run out.  They also don't reflect the concept of &quot;underemployment&quot;.  Unless figures are corrected for these and other factors, comparing them has little relevance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While this is true, in any true capitalist economy you will see higher than average unemployment figures.  This is something Americans have accepted knowing that while they may fall flat on their faces and won't get the government support they may get in other countries, they also have the opportunity to succeed in ways not possible in many other countries.  <br />
<br />
You also need to take into consideration that the US is still a growing country with hundreds of thousands of immigrants coming here each year.  This is going to affect the level of unemployment in any country.  This is not happening in European countries for some reason.</div></div><hr />

Hmm, you got me curious. And would you please give us some sources for this blanket statement. I found this site:<br />
<br />
http://www.menstuff.org/issues/byissue/suicideteen.html<br />
<br />
But it clearly shows that the US does not even remotely have the highest youth suicide rate in the world.<br />

So are you getting your info from Michael Moore? Please get us the details.<br />

This is what's funny to me.  You make some cogent points, that are worth discussing, but then you can't resist relieving your bladder a bit (and you might note that countries have varying immigration laws, which may account for differences in immigration as much or more than the differences in percieved opportunity.)</div></div><hr />

I said what I said, take it as a slam against Europe or me pondering the reason why it's not happening in Europe.  If you want to interpret what I said in a negative way that's up to you.

Yes, our welfare and healthcare system is crumbling. It's hard not to notice it. <br />

Globalization is leading to the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer. Your country is a few years ahead of mine in that matter. Our health system will be cut more and more too. <br />
