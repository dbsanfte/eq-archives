<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Simu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Few questions (aka spoilers) if you dare answer thou'd be thanked by the mighty SOE itself (eeech)<br />
<br />
Wall of slaughter : Hulcror : RGC isn't good enough for curing 36 disease counter, our clerics don't have the necessary aaxp as well, how could we deal quickly with that debuff on the MT (mainly) ? Spam it with pure blood ?<br />
<br />
The Hivequeen : Any idea if getting her out of her lair, I mean tanking her in the corridor to her lair just far enough so we dont aggro the respawning Guards and eventually the Eggs ? Or will she warp back ?<br />
<br />
If you don't like giving away strats and spoilers NP, I understand. We are a small family guild (that just killed RZ with 50 bazaar geared toons on our 3rd try weeeee!) and we do have very few time for experimentation so I like having a good strat before engaging a new mob. <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>nytemyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hulcor:basically what you said but he constantly mem blurs himself. so good luck. fun fight.<br />
<br />
hivequeen can be pulled out her lair. Will warp if no aggro is on her and is pulled to far.She will spawn eggs where ever she is at.You can figure out how to deal with the eggs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Simu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hulcror memblur himself ? Velitorkin does it for sure and has a shitload of hp when you're low on ppl and Stuff but he goes down easily. I didn't knew Hulcror memblurred as well =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>cames</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yes, Hulcror memblurs himself.<br />
<br />
Hivequeen lays her eggs at the fight so there is no way to separate them from her.</div></div><hr />
