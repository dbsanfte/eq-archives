<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Silku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Looking for something new to do to bring back my excitement in the game.   Tired of duoing in HOH, storms, poi.   Seems there are only a few zones to GOD that you can duo in so unless I do Barindu or Feribu, Feribu being on the risky side, I'm kinda stuck out of there.  Ldons are gettting boring after 200+ of them.  Any suggestions? Level 65 sk and shaman, both decently equipped, 150+ aa each.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Razs Meows</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Duo the dragons in WW if you don't like dragons...<br />
<br />
Duo quest pieces for flags.  IE the CoD key.<br />
<br />
Go find weird random zones for duoing, a la Charasis or Siren's Grotto or The Deep or whatnot.<br />
<br />
Get into a raiding guild and take down some named and find some new planes to play in.<br />
<br />
Are you duoing with the shammy or 2 Boxing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Silku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Duoing with a shaman, my wife to be exact.  Am in a raiding guild, but need something to do during offtimes.  Lately been exploring tipt in guild groups.  Good exp, and fun to try and get through the trials.   That first Dragon is a little bit much for me to tank yet, but one good sized HT and a mana  burn from one of our wizards takes him down almost before he gets into camp.   Good augments there too.  <br />
<br />
Been duoing Ferubi a bit. It's a risky, but keeps some excitement.  The odds of that mantle dropping keep me there.</div></div><hr />
