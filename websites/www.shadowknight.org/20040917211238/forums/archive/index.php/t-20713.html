<br />
Thanks for help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Arkis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">mental horror in Sewers (maybe Vxed/Tipt too)<br />
Spear in Vxed (maybe Tipt and Sewers too)<br />
Shroud in Kodtaz/Ikkinz/Yxxta (via turn in)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>VeyRonZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks Arkis :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>VeyRonZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">btw what about miasmic spear? where it drops?<br />
<br />
Thanks for infos in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gruulgrul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Am I just having bad luck, or did they make getting spells stupidly hard this expansion?  I have been farming Sewers, as well as the harder trials (Vexxed, Tipt, Kod'Taz), and have yet to see a single SK spell drop, and only one generic turn in rune.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nasiir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Who is the named in Yxxta that seems to drop SK spells? Are any trials required to access that zone?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grimknot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Over 100 sewer4 named dead and hardly any spells, much less a single SK spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>aress</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">hahaha,<br />
<br />
in our guild no SK has new spells so far.<br />
<br />
Nothing dropped in trials, and the inkinz raids usually give only one rune per raid, and every class wants it :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Arkis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I forgot Barindu, where Mental Horror or spear should drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gruulgrul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have been killing in Sewers since GoD went live, and I used to see spells (but never an SK spell).<br />
<br />
However, since they patched to make them more &quot;common&quot;, and add the 5 minute timer between instances, I have not seen a single spell in Sewers.<br />
<br />
I guess I could be having really terrible luck; but it doesn't seem to me like they made them more common at all.  It is starting to frustrate me.<br />
<br />
Does Vxed drop spells more often?  We farmed Utimbi last night, and got a Bard spell from him.  (I have seen him drop bard spells twice, but nothing else.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I got MH in Ferubi.  Dont remember the mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Since the patch, we've had the following spells drop in the Lair sewers, from the named fly.<br />
1 sk spell (MH)<br />
1 cleric spell<br />
2 wizard spells<br />
1 mage spell<br />
<br />
I think a few others.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think it is Hexxt N`Vak Tkan that drops MH in there, might be on others though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Daerkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">In the last couple of days farming various sewer names in different zones I have seen:<br />
<br />
3 Wiz spells - Black Ice<br />
2 Cleric - Holy Light<br />
2 Paladin- Light of Order<br />
1 mage- Rock of Taelosia<br />
1 necro- Night Fire<br />
1 Ranger - Can't remember name<br />
2 Druid - Sylvan Infusion<br />
<br />
This is over a 3 day period, so they definately still drop - and in fact I think the the number of times I have had 2 of the exact same named (usually right next to each other), has actually increased.<br />
<br />
No Sk spells yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gruulgrul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">That's good to know; at least it is just my bad luck.  I shall continue to farm.<br />
<br />
What do you guys who have had more sucess estimate the ratio to be?  Such as, on average 10% (1 in 10) named drop a spell?<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Synapticus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Does it take an uber raiding guild or trial group in order to get these spells?  Or can a casual player get to them with some work?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd like to know the answer to this too - as a member of a small guild, I was wondering if I could take a well-balanced group in to get these... also are the zones they are in instanced like LDoNs or regular zones?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>UGLA</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Anyone can farm the  sewer trials for spells.  Yes they are instanced like the ldon zones.  You should bring a tracker with you and just have them track at zone in for a named fly and if you don't have one then its best to just zone out and get another mission till your named fly is there.  I think a named fly drops a spell 20% of the time or somethin.  Mobs only hit for 400-600 i THINK...named may hit for 800-900 but with slow dont' think its a real big deal.  <br />
<br />
I think it was said that our spear spell and our mental corruption upgrade spells drop here.</div></div><hr />

<br />
GoD sewer trials #1 trash mobs hit for 1400.  Named mite at the end hits for 1550, flurries, and is unslowable.  Never seen the named fly, so I can't comment on him.<br />
<br />
If you are a casual player in ornate gear, you might have a chance with warrior/tracker/cleric/shaman/cc/you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The Lair is the sewer trial with the named fly.  Mobs near the entrance hit for around 800, the named fly around 900.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Gruulgrul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Some of the sewers seem to pop easier mobs, though.  I don't remember which; creamatory maybe?  It's the difference between mobs in the 50s, and mobs in the 60s.<br />
<br />
The easy sewers (50s mobs) are about the same as an LDON normal assasinate, I would guess.  Maybe a little harder.<br />
<br />
The hard sewers (Lair, Pools for sure) are somewhat harder than an LDON hard assasinate.<br />
<br />
Of course, there are no timers.<br />
<br />
On another note, I have been farming sewers for days more, and have killed probably 30 or more named, and seen two spells:  One ranger, one bard.  It's getting rather frustrating.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>8full</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Plants has the 1000-1200+ hitters, Lair has 800-1000+ hitters and Pool has 600-800+ hitters and Crematory has 400-600+ hitters.<br />
<br />
That is if I remember correctly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Menon Lifeblight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Yeah, but casual players have to get past the first trial to access the second one, no?<br />
<br />
Kinda pointless that they can handle 600 hitters if they can't handle the named in trial one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>dagelbauer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">some guildies had mental horror drop for them off a rare in a Vexd trial and they sent me a tell to haul ass there to loot it. Looted it with 30 sec to spare and its an awsome spell, proc does 270 damage with SA3 and i assume gives me = that in mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4909&amp;source=Live</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Aenamael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Got Mental Horror over the weekend off a sludge eating fly in the Lair sewer trial.  We also got 2 enchanter spells and a shit load of masks and arms for guild twinks.  We just spent 6 hours respawning the trial over and over again, and killing any named that pop up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Darko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I have seen several copies of Mental Horro drop in Lair of the sludge eating fly, have yet to see Miasmic spear, and from what i hear the only people that have the spell got it from vxed, so anyone seen spear drop in the sewers?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Soul Abraision does not effect mana tapped you just get the base amount.  SA effects damage and life tapped only.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Eclipsia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Has the named spawn changed now? I know you could keep entering and quitting a trial until your named was on track, but don't you now have to kill a set number of mobs to spawn a named?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Prevost</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Having only spent my time in SNLair spell-farming I can only share my experiences there.<br />
I think that one of the roamers in the first hall acts a trigger to spawn the named. I usually clear the first room and then start clearing the hall because it leads to the potential for three named/PHs all pretty close to the zone in.<br />
After killing anywhere from nine to twenty or so mobs (it varies) the named/PHs spawn.<br />
<br />
This is different from the very beginning of GoD where people could send a tracker to spawn an instance and all mobs, named and PHs included, were up at the time the instance was created. The tracker could leave the zone if no nameds were up nearby and, iirc, instantly request a new instance, where now there's a five minute or so timer til you can make a new request.</div></div><hr />
