<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Auron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, so im gonna be playing on the new server thats coming out soon and decided to make a shadowknight.  For my credentials I have been playing EQ since it was first released and Have played almost eveyr class to a respectable lvl and my current character is a 65 shaman on Zebux.<br />
<br />
So The only class ive never REALLY played alot was a SK and being good classes I decided this was what i was gonna go with. The real problem has been what race. So here is what I see in the races:<br />
<br />
Gnomes:  Funny to play.  I mean lets face it, your not gonna tank for shit, your not gonna hit for shit, and basically your just gonna be there.  I dont think ive ever seen a gnome shadowknight out &quot;expin at inner pov.&quot;   If you want to be different be a Gnome and have fun, but dont expect to be uber at high lvls.<br />
<br />
Human: Bleh, Humans suck.  They have sucked since day one and always will suck.  Their armor is bland, their stats are bland, and overall they are the most boring race of all.  If ya wanna be a Jim Bob be a Human.<br />
<br />
Dark Elf: WTF is the craze over a DE shadowknight? Sure they do look good in armor, but EVERY DE Tank type i have talked to say the exact same thing, what is that?  DONT MAKE ONE.  At 60+ they cant tank for crap and they are generally pretty pathetic on their dmg.<br />
<br />
Iksar: Heres the toss up with me.  Iksars get a nice regen, but at 50+ regen doesnt really mean shit. People are all like &quot;BUT WHAT ABOUT OUR LICH LINE&quot; who gives a rats ass about our lich line.  One lifetap hey you just got back 10 min of liching, or just ask the nearby Druid or Shaman for a regen and theres always a shaman in your group at 55+.  Iksars do look cool though, but I dont think their stats/Regen make up for that.<br />
<br />
Troll:  Interesting.  Why would you make a troll when you could make an ogre?  For the Regen ... See Iksar.<br />
<br />
Erudite: See Gnome<br />
<br />
Ogre:  This is gonna be my choice.  Why might you ask?  Because Ogres are better tanks.  Period end of story.  Ive had Warrior Ogres before and 10 times out of 10 they will out tank a Troll or Barbarian or Whatever obscure class you wanna talk about.  Ogre's make the best tanks period. <br />
<br />
Now, i wanted to address people who say one thing: &quot; AT LVL 60 STATS DONT MATTER CAUSE EVERYTHING IS GONNA BE MAXED&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
How many lvl 65's do you know that have max STR,STA,AGI,DEX?<br />
<br />
I bet you cant find 10 Sk's with both max STR and STA, and the 9 you do are gonna be Ogres/Trolls unless they are fully raid buffed (even then most tanks dont have all stats maxed). Also that 9 you do find are gonna be in the Uberest of Uber guilds on the server getting the best gear in the game.  Saying that your gonna have max stats at 65 Is pure BS.  Sure if you ARE gonna be in the uber Guild (which 95% of the server population is not) then go ahead and bank on that idea.  If your like the 95% that are in guilds that their hardest mobs after a year or 2 is Avatar of War (And thats a big accomplishment for 75% of that 95%) then You better start looking for your stats elsewhere -- IE Starting Stats.  Oh and BTW, you base HPS come off of you BASE STA.  Not that uber little Talisman of the Boar spell you have going on that adds a whole 250hps at lvl 65.  <br />
<br />
Ask any tank ANY TANK what the hardest stat to get is.  I can guarantee you 9 times outa 10 (and the one who says otherwise is a freakin moron) your gonna get Stamina.  Stamina is the hardest stat so starting out with 150 Sta as an ogre makes a HUGE difference.  So If your banking on the idea that your gonna be in the best guild on the server (which is fine to do that) then go ahead and make your Dark elf or Erudite SK, but dont come crying to me when the Tanking order comes out and some High Elf Paladin is higher then you are.<br />
<br />
P.S. these are MY thoughts on the races, and i Was NOT trying to be Objective :) And the only reason i said Iksars were a toss up was cause they look nifty.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Azraelwrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Deja vu anyone?  At least this one isn't by a retard.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway, your choice to pick an ogre is great, since race does matter in the beginning if your starting out without uber twinking.<br />
Your basically having those set of stats for about 55 or so levels so if you want the superior stats for most of your playing times, ogre is a good choice especially when it comes to looting.  The only downside I can see is the low mana, and since its a new server there isn't really anyone to KEI out there so it might take some time soloing if your going to try that.  If your gonna be grouping a lot then your fit the job greatly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jobrill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well Excuse the crap out of me for wanting to be original and look good.<br />
<br />
I mean, I'm such a fucking gimpwad.<br />
<br />
If you wanna be a min-maxer, why not just go the whole way and make a freakin Ogre Warrior, cuz who the hell wants a frickin SK to Raidtank when they have a Warrior?<br />
<br />
BTW, Your base HP is based off your total stamina, or else stamina buffs would give you 0 hp. <br />
<br />
In Short, Yawn, I've heard it all before, you're a loser, you do not get a years supply of Rice-a-Roni The San Francisco Treat, you don't even get a copy of our lousy home game, but thanks for playing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Auron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Actually Jobrill, I dont think i really said any race is horrible.  It all depends on what you want to do.  If you wanna be unique and original and Cool be a gnome, cause lets face it gnome tanks are cool and funny.  In the end each class/race combo sacrifices soemthing for somethign else.  I want to be a tuff sob that can hold his own as a main tank and such.  You might wanna be the cool gnome or erudite Shadowknight.<br />
<br />
Now if your a human then theres only 1 excuse for that, it was your very first character.  That is the ONLY excuse I see viable for being a lvl 65 Human Anything.  I take that back, Human Paladins are ok.  But please, be a dorf, even if they look goofy as hell.<br />
<br />
So Im sorry if I offended you, but calling me a loser just shows your own ignorance.  tell me, is it really blissful?<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh yea, I dont want to be a Raidtank, Or else I would make a warrior.  What i want is to do Decent dmg, and when needed can be the main tank for a regular EXP group. And if REALLY needed I could ALSO be a 3rd or 4th Main tank for a raid (after the warriors are dead), where as you'd be the OSWDT or Oh Shit We're Dead Tank. <br />
<br />
Oh yea, and the STA thing.  your base STA effects how many hps you gain per lvl, thusly someone with 100sta is gonna have more base hps (Before buffs) then someone with 80STA.  Buffs just add to that base, so thusly an Ogre with say 250 STA (after buffs) is still going to have more hps then a Gnome with 250 STA (After buffs)...<br />
<br />
So if you didnt understand what i just said, My ogre has say 150Sta base.   DING! Lvl 2 &quot;You have gained 41 hps&quot;  <br />
<br />
A Gnome with 100base sta: DING! lvl 2 &quot;You have gained 21hps&quot;<br />

<br />
Honestly I don't see why human is considered as boring. If anything to me then boring = unoriginal. And really, human SK's are quite original. I dont know about what server you're on atm but when I do a <br />
<br />
/who all ogre shadow ........too many to list<br />
<br />
/who all dark shadow .........too many to list<br />
<br />
/who all troll shadow  ........less but still too many to list<br />
<br />
/who all human shadow ....8 including me, lol. wtf.<br />
<br />
To hell with making characters worrying about stats and what possible armors you're going to be able to wear. Thats like reading a walkthrough before you even play a game. Already know whats gonna happen or whats gonna get thrown at you. <br />
<br />
Mix it up a little. Be original. After all. Variety is the spice of life <br />

<br />
You' re entitled to your opinion, you can think I am an idiot....but I still love my Human SK (4th character btw!, flame me more :D )<br />
<br />
Granted I am only 60 and I will never be in some uber guild but I haven't had a problem tanking yet. I usually get picked as Raid MT over 60 WARs with more HP if I am not 2 boxing. Why? SK are awesome at maintaining aggro and I believe I play my class well. Excuse my ignorance because I havent made 65....but when push comes to shove STA isn't going to mean jack squat if your CLR and healers arent in syn. Stepped in more than once for the MT War that just went down, gained aggro and finished the fight.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Calamity_Daemon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">At least their nice to you Auron. I do agree with you on most aspects of the little &quot;Low down&quot; of the races. Oh HP is affected by STR and STA so you and Jobril are right. I made a troll because I'm a hard ass and wanna bomb the EQ scene but, an ogre or Iksar is what I'm almost wishing I made....up to the point where I put the smack down on a froglok and then with a trollish scream of victory, feast on the tiny innards of the itsy bitsy being...Good luck man I hope you too nuke the screw outta anyone/anything in your path</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Vuloshek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yeah, I have to strongly disagree about your view on humans.  You said the only excuse was that it's your first character.  I started playing EQ sometime last year (not very long compared to many), and being the insatiable person I am, I've played just about everything, just never a human.  I settled on the shadowknight, and played every type of shadowknight out there.  Except human.  Recently when I rerolled, I thought, hell, I'll be a human.  At least on my server, I turned out to be a pretty rare specimen.<br />
<br />
Yesterday I was running around in Qeynos Hills doing my newbie errands, and some people were shouting this nonsense about destroying the &quot;vile evil&quot; or such.  I was about to yell back at him, and realized that not only am I the sole shadowknight in the area, I'm the only evil person period.  Nobody to back me up (Now, I would have taken this guy on alone except 1, he was an UBER twink, lvl 6 with a horse and everything, and 2, he was camping mobs I wanted things from, so I had to play it cool and see if I could make use of him).<br />
<br />
It was a nice change of pace - at least when you play a gnome SK, good gnomes are pretty nice to you simply for being a gnome.  And erudites start in a city with only their own kind (nice town, too).  I like the feeling that I really am a disease on my own people, and it solidifies this feeling that I'm KoS to a few NPCs in my own newbie zones.  Besides that, the stats are nice enough not to hurt my sense of maximization too much (100 sta isn't so bad).<br />
<br />
But hey, you said yourself, do what you think is fun.  Maximize with an ogre, and enjoy playing an ogre.  It's certainly a lot of fun being the ogre, it's just not for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Auron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Caziel, you take me outa context.  I said I believe each race sacrifices something for something else.  The only exception to this is Humans IMO.  I just dont see what they are getting out of having mediocre stats.  Thats just my opinion though, if you think a human SK is gonna be cool, then by all means be one.  The thing is I look at EVERYTHING in the long run.  <br />
<br />
This is true for 90% of people, if you do a /who 65 Shadowknight for just a regular EXP group, and you see 65 [Shadowknight] Human, and 65 [Shadowknight] Ogre, which one of the two are you going to choose?  Thats saying you dont know either person at all and are just choosing by that information.  I can bet 9/10th the time they are gonna choose the Ogre Shadowknight.  <br />
<br />
Alot of people look into how much they like the race, what they look like, or the challenge factor of it.  When I look at races I look 100% on stats and how to maximize those stats.  Maybe thats cause ive been playing since day one and have done the &quot;Fun class&quot; before and now I look technically at new characters, maybe not.  <br />
<br />
If you wanna be a Human, Erudite, or Gnome, Then by all means more power to ya, you just wont catch me dead as one nor will you catch me looking at you first for an exp group.  Thats just the fact of the matter.<br />
<br />
Also Im not talking about pvp servers here.  On a Team PvP server being a certain race can also be a strategy and the rules are all different, so that doesnt have much merit here.  Im just talking about a regular old server.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ancatdub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I see your point Auron about picking a 65 Ogre over a 65 Human. And think you are a brave soul for doing pick-up groups post 60. <br />
<br />
This is just my experience so keep that in mind but just about any pick up group in PoP has been more or less a wash if not outright dangerous. Lack of MOB control and a save-my-own-rear mentality have pretty much sworn me off from pick up groups. More productive exp-wise for me to go solo. Maybe I am used to good if not great AA exp rate with my regular group /shrugs<br />
<br />
So while I see your point I think it is limited to your game play and possibly server mentality.<br />
<br />
And even a gnome SK has a better chance of getting a exp group than a WAR :D</div></div><hr />

You have documented proof of this?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Secondly, I agree with you on one thing, the guy who said Str has anything to do with HPS is a moron :)<br />
<br />
I cannot prove anything, but I will say this, my guilds Barbarian 65 Warrior has more hps (completely naked) then our guilds Human 65 warrior.  That in and of itself is proof that the higher base STA you have the more HPS you'll have in the end.<br />
<br />
oh and I usually never start a pick up group (Anymore, I used to everyday), being a shaman I can go lfg in PoTranquility and in 2 or 3 min I have a group, but i am usually the one who finds replacements, and thats how I ge tmy replacements.  When i was making pick up groups everyday I know exactly which classes I want and I will not even start the group till I have all those classes signed up.  That is usually:  Warrior, Cleric, Shaman (me), Enchanter, Shadowknight/paladin (preference on SK), and then a Dmg doer, preferably a Melee (Ranger or Rogue).<br />
<br />
I start with /who all &lt;class&gt; lfg<br />
<br />
if that doesnt work it goes to /who all &lt;class&gt; and i look for people who are in zones like Tranq, Knowledge, Nexus.<br />
<br />
Maybe zeb is differnet from your server, but 99% of zeb players are good players and pick up groups are really common.  In fact 90% of all PoP groups (besides maybe BoT) are all pick up groups, at least thats how it is on Zeb.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Vuloshek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">No, those stats are off.  A gnome with 85 stamina still gets 31 hp per level for the first few (until HP per level changes, don't know what level).  I once had a gnome SK when I was a newbie, and I had all points added to str.  I spent all my time with an Ogre SK that put all points into sta.  He had about 60-70 more HP than me around level 20, with a stamina difference of about 60-70 points.  Takes a long time for that STA to start kicking in.  And, hey, if I'd been smart and made my starting stamina 95 like I could have, even that small difference would shrink.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Auron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Your right Vol, my example was just that, an example.  But the theory is still sound that at 65 the Ogre SK with 150 base STA is gonna have more then the Gnome SK with 90 base STA.  Whether it takes till lvl 50 for it to become noticable is irrelevant.</div></div><hr />

It ALL depends on your playstyle, and if someone wants to be a Human Shadowknight, so be it.  <br />

Someone else's choice for a race will never EVER affect you.  If you play an Iksar and someone else plays a gnome, YOU'RE STILL AN IKSAR.<br />

These threads seem to be more about justifying your choice for a Shadowknight race.  In the end, NO ONE GIVES A FUCK ABOUT YOUR RACE.  In the end, YOU ARE THE ONE THAT HAS TO HAVE FUN WITH IT, NOT EVERYONE ELSE.<br />
<br />
If you play a Shadowknight solely based on racial numbers and stats, you have missed the entire point of the game.  A character with gimped stats in the hands of an expert player is 1000x more desirable than a character with great stats and a fucktard playing him.  In other words, a good player playing a Human Shadowknight, whom is somehow viewed as having mediocre stats, will be 1000x better than a player with an Ogre Shadowknight and maxxed STA who has no clue about how to play the class.</div></div><hr />

Take a starting tier like PoI or PoN.

<br />
I've grouped with many ogres who toe-to-toe everything like a warrior and use no technique.  I assume this is because, for a good portion of the game, this is perfectly effective.  I played an ogre back before I learned the more magic-based SK disciplines, and straight tanking is what I did.<br />
<br />
Later on in life, that scrawny dark elf who worked hard on his technique to make up for his lack of an impenetrable skull ends up knowing his trade much better, and keeping the others alive better (especially when working with a warrior).<br />
<br />
The real debate - is an ogre with flawless technique better than the dark elf with flawless technique, and if they end up being the same (aside from no-stun), at what level does this occur?  I think most people agree that, at the end-game, just group with the one you like to hang out with and/or trust more, but I'd actually like to know when, in most people opinions, the difference between them becomes largely cosmetic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;I cannot prove anything, but I will say this, my guilds Barbarian 65 Warrior has more hps (completely naked) then our guilds Human 65 warrior. That in and of itself is proof that the higher base STA you have the more HPS you'll have in the end.&quot;<br />

Holy shit--are you kidding me?  The only thing this *proves* is that the BAR WAR has a higher starting STA then the HUM WAR--that is ALL.  This has absolutely NOTHING to do with how many HP each would have at 305 STA.<br />
<br />
I shutter to think that this even needs to be explained, BUT, all races (of the same class) will get the EXACT same benefit at a certain level of STA.  To suggest that a higher BASE STA on an ogre (for example) will yield more HP at 305 STA then a HUM at 305 STA is Neanderthal in its conception and completely UNTRUE.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Iksar: Heres the toss up with me. Iksars get a nice regen, but at 50+ regen doesnt really mean shit&quot;<br />

100% Grade A bullshit.  You dont have to like the regen ability to benefit from its usefullness.  It pains me to even have to think of wasting my time posting the benefits of regen again...its a NICE ability to have, regardless of whether you think its worthless or not.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;How many lvl 65's do you know that have max STR,STA,AGI,DEX&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Ummm--a LOT?  Hell, every swinging dick in PoP seems to have a primal weapon from ST now and once avatar procs, maxing str,agi,dex is REALLY easy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ask any tank ANY TANK what the hardest stat to get is. I can guarantee you 9 times outa 10 (and the one who says otherwise is a freakin moron) your gonna get Stamina. Stamina is the hardest stat so starting out with 150 Sta as an ogre makes a HUGE difference. &quot;<br />
<br />
NOT ANYMORE.  STA used to be the hardest stat to increase.  It seems not to long ago that we had a lengthy discussion about this very topic.  While a very good argument can be made to make it your highest priority, way too many items are in the game that give STA now.  It is NOT that hard to raise anymore.<br />
<br />
&quot;Buffs just add to that base, so thusly an Ogre with say 250 STA (after buffs) is still going to have more hps then a Gnome with 250 STA (After buffs)...&quot;<br />
<br />
100% incorrect.  See comment above.  As a matter of fact, where did you come up with this?  Oh, the flawed BAR WAR vs HUM WAR BS *proof*....<br />
<br />
<br />
One thing that you have conviently SIDESTEPPED in your analysis was your ABSENSE of evaluating the XP penalty.  As an ogre, you WILL level slower then your, say, HUM counterpart.  You want to explain to me how a, say lvl 60 HUM SHD is inferior to a lvl 57 OGR SHD (everything else equal)?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Toltanus Thule</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Wow, he knows how to use curse words. And I thought this was a family board!<br />
<br />
A family that HarmTouches together stays together. ;)<br />
<br />
er... <br />
<br />
anyway.<br />
<br />
Luna made al the points I didn't have the energy to make again, like I did for Calamity Jane's post.<br />
<br />
The real debate - is an ogre with flawless technique better than the dark elf with flawless technique, and if they end up being the same (aside from no-stun), at what level does this occur? I think most people agree that, at the end-game, just group with the one you like to hang out with and/or trust more, but I'd actually like to know when, in most people opinions, the difference between them becomes largely cosmetic. <br />
<br />
There is no doubt that the races do make for different play styles.  Erudites tend to have more mana, so they can do afford to cast an extra spell here and there.  An Ogre has less mana, but with the brute force of his race, that evens out.<br />
<br />
I think this is pretty much the way it goes until you get into levels like level 52.  At this point, we start doing things like going to Karnor's Castle, Sebilis, Burning Woods, etc., etc., and we have to do a little less tanking at times and a little more casting at times.  Still, in the end, with end-game gear, the differences between the races are small.  The differences in races make for different approaches to the beginning game and the mid game, but all races pretty much converge to the same play style in the end.  As we get to levels 50+, especially 52+, we begin to raid more, and whether we are Ogres or Gnomes, we get into our raid role, which is a support tank and aggro control.  Raid roles are pretty different from group roles and you have to do things like take a mob off of a cleric or wizard while the main tank stays on the main mob and that's the role we are best at and that's the line of spells we have in the 50+ world.  Variations on that depend a LOT on the player.    Basically, say an Ogre starts at Point A, and an Erudite at point B.  What I am saying is that while their paths and approaches are a bit different, they will both end up at Point C at some point and continue from there, pretty much along the same paths.<br />
<br />
None of that is set in stone though, and I am not sure I should generalize the whole class, but that's the 10,000-foot view from what I have learned so far.<br />
<br />
Main point is-- your race is not going to matter much in the end-game, which is what you will eventually get to.  What will matter is how you play the class and what you have learned from 1-50.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Id actually take this a step further and expand it to say that race (unless you want to split major hairs) wont matter at any stage, even early on.  The XP penalty is involved from minute one and benefits those races without it and hinders those with it--yes--even from lvl one on up.<br />
<br />
I always chuckle at the race discussions that avoid talking about the XP penalty.  How on earth can you have any meaningful discussion re: races and NOT talk about that?  Its a key factor that should be considered when picking any race.  All things equal, a race without the XP penalty will ALWAYS be *ahead* of a race with one.<br />

<br />
Common Knowledge? This is the first I've heard of it in my 3 years of playing Everquest. I wonder why? <br />
<br />
Oh yeah, cuz it's NOT TRUE.<br />
<br />
Stamina determines HP, not race, and I'd bet if you made a Gnome and a Ogre and made sure they had the same Stamina, give the same  class and equipment, they would have the same HP.<br />
<br />
Similarly, Given an Ogre with X Stamina, and a Gnome with Y stamina, if you buff the Gnome to X Stamina with spells, he will have the same HP as Ogres. <br />

Common Knowledge my ass. Dumb Assumptions that would fall with basic testing.</div></div><hr />

Godamn these motherfucking race discussions and the newbie posters that come here and think that they have some deep revelation about the races and decide to post about it.<br />
<br />
FOR THE LAST MOTHERFUCKING TIME:<br />
<br />
ALL SHADOWKNIGHT RACES ARE VIABLE.  ALL SHADOWKNIGHT RACES HAVE STRENGTHS.  ALL SHADOWKNIGHT RACES HAVE WEAKNESSES.  SOME PHYSICAL, SOME SOCIAL.<br />
<br />
It ALL depends on your playstyle, and if someone wants to be a Human Shadowknight, so be it.  <br />
<br />
Someone else's choice for a race will never EVER affect you.  If you play an Iksar and someone else plays a gnome, YOU'RE STILL AN IKSAR.<br />
<br />
These threads seem to be more about justifying your choice for a Shadowknight race.  In the end, NO ONE GIVES A FUCK ABOUT YOUR RACE.  In the end, YOU ARE THE ONE THAT HAS TO HAVE FUN WITH IT, NOT EVERYONE ELSE.<br />
<br />
If you play a Shadowknight solely based on racial numbers and stats, you have missed the entire point of the game.  A character with gimped stats in the hands of an expert player is 1000x more desirable than a character with great stats and a fucktard playing him.  In other words, a good player playing a Human Shadowknight, whom is somehow viewed as having mediocre stats, will be 1000x better than a player with an Ogre Shadowknight and maxxed STA who has no clue about how to play the class.  <br />

<br />
lets talk about Xp penalty.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Im a Power gamer, XP penalty doesnt mean shit to me really.  If your a casual gamer and think that the penalty would mean something to you then make a human.  Im still gonna beat you to 65 regardless.  <br />
<br />
The reason i didnt mention the XP penalty is cause it doesnt factor into what I take into account when making a character.  Im not saying Id much rather have some 20% exp penalty on every character, It just wouldnt bother me if I did.  As Long as im in the top 10 of my class to reach 65, and I will be I always am, then im happy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Very valid point here.  XP penalties are a big part of your character in only one way, that you *might* spend more time on each level, and have to kill more.  You could even argue that this is good because you stick around, get more skill practice, gain more plat (while spending marginally more on supplies, big deal).  You could also argue that you kill that much faster and really won't fall behind.  I read that XP penalties were actually removed from group activity, so perhaps falling behind your regular clique isn't an issue.<br />
<br />
More importantly, if you DO spend 20% more time levelling with that Troll, you might enjoy your Troll 20%+ more than you would a dark elf, so it's not time wasted.  XP grinds get monotonous no matter what you are, and if you're not enjoying it, it will seem much, much longer.<br />
<br />
Though I made a human, the XP bonus had nothing to do with my decision.  I wanted balance because I can never decide what I like, and I didn't want to be decidedly lacking in any stat.  Plus, I didn't want any warts or harmful odors.<br />
<br />
By the way, I'd read somewhere that the penatly is 20% for ogres, 25% for Troll/Iksar.  Is this true and/or has this changed?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Auron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Actually I dont think Ogres have an eXp penalty at all. Im not 100% on that but all my past ogres never hjad any exp penalty, or at leat not one that was noticed.  <br />
<br />
Then again I could be wrong on that.  I do know that the biggets penalty comes from having a regen, so iksars and trolls have the worst</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Manslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Ogres have a 15 percent penalty, Trolls and Iksars have a 20 percent penalty.</div></div><hr />

Alright here is my explaination which I know will go ignored, but it's worth a try. Firstly, my information on the second thread I started WAS mostly correct. If there was something wrong then you should have just said so, and i would have changed it. My first thread was my opinions which I said where indeed MY opinions. If you don't like it then SCREW OFF! Secondly, I DO NOT think so highly of myself that I would shake my fist at God and declare all my wrath agaist him and his eternal kingdom. Lastly. Am I not allowed to be wrong? I say one thing wrong from my recollection and you attack me like a dog. I am nowhere near perfect, I'll leave that to God. Neither are you or the rest of the people in this forum. I don't wish to seem as the &quot;Bad Guy&quot;/&quot;Iksar&quot; of the forum. If you don't agree than why not do it in a way that isn't so childish. I don't know. It seems that if one person dosn't agree in a thread that the majority of everyone else will be agaist the starter as well. Auron, I am glad you decided on your race. Don't listen to these half-assed hypocrites. Only thing I can say is this. Defense will raise on it's own accord. If things get out of hand just start him over as something else. Plus, (sarcastically) With all the Uber damage you can do then you wont need it. Heheh good luck man! Be a model to all those little youngster ogres that being evil does pay ;)</div></div><hr />

Where you went wrong is that people disagreed with your opinions and you went apeshit.  <br />

Take at the look at where your posting. In a forum a person can be as big of a dick as they want and not have to worry about any reprucussions (sp?) so naturally it becomes one of the biggest homes of trash talking around. <br />

When you post your opinions on a subject you can't expect everyone to agree with you. Add into the equation the trash talkin aspect of forums and you can't expect to have a completely flame free topic. <br />

Looking at your post, however, sorry, but it cracks me up.  Saying that the XP penalty &quot;doesnt factor into what [you] take into account when making a character&quot; is completely moronic.  Granted, the words come across far more harsh then I desire them to, but its truly stupid to ignore the penalty.  You *WILL* always be ahead playing a race that doesnt have an XP penalty then if you play one that does.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, you didnt answer my question---how is a, for example, lvl 60 HUM SHD inferior to a lvl 57 OGR SHD?  According to you, if I understand correctly, the ogre would be superior.<br />

What cracks me up most of all, however, is that you are making a distinction between a *power gamer* and a *casual* player, as if the XP penalty affects them differently.  In case you havent figured it out, they DONT.  The XP penalty is there if you have chosen the appropriate class.  It affects you, if you choose to acknowledge it or not, and it does so without bias.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Vuloshek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">Alright, let me derail the impending flamethrower trench warfare here, and pose this question.<br />
<br />
Are the XP penalties for Ogre, Troll, and Iksar fair 1-65, and if not, at what level would you consider the penalty to outweigh the benefit of regen or no stun?  Conversely, is it fair to give humans a bonus?<br />
<br />
I haven't made it far at all with a regen class, so I wouldn't know how nice it is later on.<br />
<br />
Aside from being no-stun, an Ogre has a lot more stat points total, especially relative to the stats that matter as a melee class, but that advantage is diminished towards the end as well.<br />
<br />
I don't see what horrible handicap a human has being an SK.  Maybe they're not AS good at many jobs as other races are, but they handle the shadowknight job just fine.<br />
<br />
Should the XP penalty taper off at some point?  I think the penalty/bonus should be related to your race/class combo instead of just race. If that's already the case, I never heard about it.<br />
<br />
In any event, I think modifying how fast someone levels is a terrible way to tool with game balance, especially in a setting where you might fall behind people and not be able to group with them.  This game is all about the social aspect.</div></div><hr />

The reason i didnt mention the XP penalty is cause it doesnt factor into what I take into account when making a character. Im not saying Id much rather have some 20% exp penalty on every character, It just wouldnt bother me if I did. As Long as im in the top 10 of my class to reach 65, and I will be I always am, then im happy.<br />

<br />
Very valid point here. XP penalties are a big part of your character in only one way, that you *might* spend more time on each level, and have to kill more. &quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
There is no point here whatsoever.  The fact that he chooses to blindly pick a race without considering all the facts doesnt make it valid.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;And yet you still want to undermine ogres unstunability by giving that to all other races via aa's, sigh&quot;<br />
<br />
Utterly AMAZING.  Ogre WAR werent undermined when SE was given to all WAR classes---so how in the hell could it undermine ogres if it was given to SHD?  Actually, dont answer--I dont think you understand anyways...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Vuloshek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">I'm not much aware of the AA abilities of warriors.  Is SE a no-stun AA for warriors?<br />
<br />
I would only agree that having no-stun is a good reason to give ogres a (small) penalty, but what I was talking about earlier was - would we rather have these differences in races + a penalty, or have the penalty go away and let the races become identical at high levels?  If AA's can solve any racial difference, then the penalty should disappear on the level where that AA becomes available... seems nearly fair.  If I was a no-stun human, the only advantage an ogre would have is more base stat points, I'd hardly say that's worth 15% more XP.<br />
<br />
And by the way, you cut my quote short before the point was made.  If he doesn't care about penalties, don't say he has to.  If you want to spend more time with an Ogre, rather than less time with a dark elf, that's up to you.  If you'll get from 1-65 faster than anyone you know with an Ogre, you'd get from 1-65 MUCH faster than anyone you know as a human.  And if you're already fast enough to level that Ogre at mach 4, why worry about the bonus?  Hey, I couldn't do it, I'm not that efficient, that penalty would bother me.<br />
<br />
Verant/Sony, whoever, was probably thinking that ogres/trolls/iksars can get things done much faster with their powers, so they needed to be halted with a penalty.  Most people seem to agree that they just take more time to play.<br />
<br />
So back to what I asked.  Is this fair?<br />
<br />
Hell, maybe all penalties should be taken away, all &quot;racial&quot; abilities should be made an AA, and how it works is when you pick that race, you automatically have points in that AA from lvl 1.  Then, you only have to balance the values of AAs, not the entire race, because all races would have an AA of some sort.  That would be fair with a little tinkering, but maybe that lacks character... too nuts-and-bolts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Lunaticfringesk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">&quot;I'm not much aware of the AA abilities of warriors. Is SE a no-stun AA for warriors?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
There is a gigantic thread where this is discussed in detail, so no need to re-hash it all here.  To answer your question though, Stalwart Endurance (&quot;SE&quot;) is an AA ability given to WAR that will reduce stuns from all angles, not just the front.  It is not, however, no stun.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;If he doesn't care about penalties, don't say he has to. If you want to spend more time with an Ogre, rather than less time with a dark elf, that's up to you. If you'll get from 1-65 faster than anyone you know with an Ogre, you'd get from 1-65 MUCH faster than anyone you know as a human. And if you're already fast enough to level that Ogre at mach 4, why worry about the bonus? &quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
The guy can do whatever he wants to.  To completely disregard the XP penalty, however, because he is a *power gamer* (whatever the hell that is), is completely foolish.  Anyone who says that *speed* doesnt matter is completely full of it.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Izzy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">Way back in the beginning of this thread people were talking about Gnome STA versus Ogre STA and was one treated differently from another.  Here's some numbers.<br />
<br />
Using the testbuff feature on the test server, I was able to compare the HPs for different SK races at level 1 and level 25, butt-naked and armored.<br />
<br />
Tested Gnomes, DE's and Humans at 90 STA and all three had identical HPs at level 1 (32 HPs) and level 25 (687 HPs).<br />
<br />
Tested Erudite at 95 STA and got 32 HPs and 696 HPs.  Armored at level 25 with 138 STA he had 771 HPs.<br />
<br />
Tested Troll at 115 STA and got 34 HP's and 731 HPs.  Armored at level 25 with 151 STA he had 794 HPs.<br />
<br />
Tested Ogre at 145 STA and got 36 HP's and 783 HPs.  Armored at level 25 with 176 STA he had 838 HPs.<br />
<br />
The math.  Ignore level 1 and just look at level 25 - Human, DE, and Gnome are identical STA and HP's at a ratio of 7.6 HPs per point of STA (687 HPs/90 STA).  The Erudite's 5 INCREMENTAL points of STA netted 9 HP's, or about 1.8 HP's per point of STA at level 25, and that 1.8 ratio applies whether the STA is &quot;base&quot; or is added through armor.<br />
<br />
The Troll's base ratio at level 25 is not as good.  The Troll only gets (731/115) or 6.38 HP's per point of STA.  The incremental HP ratio is the same as Humans, DE's, etc, or about 1.8 HPs per point of STA, again regardless of whether the STA is added to base or through armor (Troll has 20 more base STA than Erudite and has 35 more HPs, about a 1.8 ratio, and armor STA shows the same ratio).<br />
<br />
The Ogre has the &quot;worst&quot; use of base STA, netting a 5.4 ratio of STA to HP's (783 HPs / 145 STA).  Incremental STA points get applied at the ~1.8 ratio, just like all the others.  However, if you &quot;scale back&quot; the Ogre's STA to match the Gnome's STA (90) using the 1.8 ratio, you see that the Ogre and Gnome would have exactly the same HP's.  So there is no difference in the way the game treats Ogre STA and Gnome STA.<br />
<br />
In addition, contrary to what was said earlier in this thread, small races actually get MORE HPs per point of base STA (at least, up to level 25).  Incremental HPs are added at exactly the same ratio, regardless of race.  Based on this data, an argument could be made that the Ogre's STA &quot;bonus&quot; is not really a bonus at all, since the smaller races can have the same HPs with STA buffs.<br />
<br />
Even though they track one another up to level 25, it's possible that the races have different curves after level 25.  I know my level 51 Erudite SK nets about 4 HP's per point of STA, so the curve definitely changes as you level; what sort of HP/STA ratios do the rest of you have?<br />
<br />
Izzy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Vuloshek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">The curves aren't bqsed on race, they're based on the STA rating itself.  The higher it is, the less another point matters.  Use magelo profiles to check this, it's easier than making test server characters.  Make an Erudite and get him the same STA, you'll get the same effect.<br />
<br />
Overall, the stats have a pretty puny impact past 100.  INT has a much bigger impact by proportion, but then again, it's still only 1 or 2 extra spells.<br />
<br />
Next time I reroll, I'm making an Erudite.  Screw all the min-maxing stat crap, I just want to be one.</div></div><hr />

human was what the xp standard was set upon.  humans do not have a xp &quot;bonus&quot;, as much as people like to think otherwise.  the only race that has a bonus is Assling. and it's like +5%<br />
erudites, barbs, and half elves have a bonus of -5%<br />
elves, as i recall, are at -10%, that being wood elf, dark elf, and high elf.<br />
ogres are at -15%<br />
trolls and iksar at -20%<br />

gnomes, also have a negative xp bonus, and, if memory serves, it's at -5%, but i can't be positive on that.  i'll have to hit up a friend of mine, to see if he remembers, so that i can edit this later with correct percentages.<br />
<br />
the way things used to be, long, long ago, hybrids had another 20 or 25% &quot;negative bonus&quot; (as VI termed it, which we all think of as a penalty, now) that was added to the racial penalty.<br />

<br />
150 - 75 STA = 75 STA difference between the two.<br />
<br />
75 STA * 6hps/STA = 450hp difference at lvl 65 with those AAs AT THAT STAMINA (assuming neither has gotten any +STA items on their journey to lvl 65.)<br />
<br />
Tier 1 PoP mobs do 300 to 500 hits (in general) a hit.  At level 30 I remember escaping trains by running to the zone-- escaping with 1 or 2 hps sometimes...lemme assure you, I haven't had a close call like that since then.  Now it's:  One bub of health and FD don't go off, you're dead.<br />
<br />
Sure, more HPs = GOD, I know...but, if any class has max STA...it's at the same HPs as a max STA Ogre.  Hell, I don't have access to good gear at frickin' all...never do camps and such, and my STA isn't TOO bad.  <br />
<br />
I've NEVER been turned from groups being a non-Ogre...matter of fact, at the time I play sometimes....everyone JUMPS on me when I put up LFG....I seem to be the only SK lfg at 3 or 4am :D   You'll NEVER find people excluding someone because they are a &quot;Human.&quot;<br />
<br />
In the end, Damage output or damage absorption doesn't differ between any race...it's all in the stats....and stat difference between starting stats for each race makes little difference in the high end.  Remember you also have to factor in AAs and gear.  If a Gnome SK has gear &gt; Ogre SK...then the Gnome is a better tank.  If a gnome has better tanking AAs than the Ogre, the gnome is a better tank.  <br />

<br />
The main poster clearly doesn't understand the power of regen. As a Troll, I have grouped with many players especially ogres who were one town away when we had Grobb. (*Gzian cries over loss of Grobb*)<br />
<br />
Almost every time, I was ready to fight while the ogre was still regenerating hp. At upper levels we get 2 and 1/2 times what most races get on regen. If you combine with our new mana regen spells, this is very nice. For soloing, this may be one of the best racial traits around. I can't imagine much better for soloing.<br />
<br />
Trolls also have some of the better dexterity around when compared to other shadow knight races. and especially is better than that of ogres. This helps in procs. <br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I like ogres,but a troll is very very viable and perhaps more viable than an ogre if you do a lot of soloing. In fact, my only complaint with my troll at level 48 is his size. I would have liked a small size since all fatties tend to get stuck in some places.<br />
<br />
One final advantage of troll SK is that there are very few of them. I belong to the guild, Enchanted Souls on Karana,which has about 100 members or so. There are only 2 trolls, and I am the only troll SK. We are unique indeed. <br />
<br />
Bottom Line:If you want to be one of the many hoards of players be a DE SK. If you want to stand out, beat the living crap out of most mobs, and be able to solo better than most malee types whether or not a Sk, be a troll!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I like Trolls too, but I wouldn't call this a sound argument.  Troll dex is 75 natural, same as human and dark elf.  5 more than erudite or ogre.  Not going to make a difference.  If you want regen and dex, go iksar.  85 is pretty nice.  Gnomes have 85 as well.  Either way, it's a small difference.  I have a Troll BL on the side with 128 unbuffed dex and crappy gear... not even sure where all of that comes from, only that dex is cheap to upgrade.<br />
<br />
I have noticed, however, that players are getting older, and the idea of &quot;there's no real difference&quot; is spreading, so people are going out of their way to (attempt to) be different.  I see more gnomes and erudites (still VERY few... most people are soulless min/maxers who only see the G in RPG)... nobody is flocking to the Troll bandwagon.  They're getting rarer.  I'm playing my first serious Troll character now (though not an SK), and it's an awfully fun race to play.</div></div><hr />
