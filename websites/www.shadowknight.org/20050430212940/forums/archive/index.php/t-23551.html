<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tachyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">While the masses seem to be off testing the waters in EQ2 or WoW, I have actually recently returned to the fold after a long absence.  My 52 human SK is naked except for his trusty gate hammer, a few pieces of ldon smithed plate, and that 2hs that drops like candy in PoJ.  He's also minus the benefit of the dual boxed shammy he grew up with (gone to another server).<br />
<br />
I don't dare group in my present state of disrepair--might have difficulty tanking an orc pawn--and the solo spots mentioned will most likely be too tough or too slow for practical purposes.<br />
<br />
Any ideas where I can solo to start building up a pp reserve to re-gear?  Mass slaying of greenies is ok if they're loaded, although at least a little xp would be cool.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any suggestions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ziglug D</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">buy plat from ige! u r t3h screwd!<br />
<br />
but seriously, I have no ideas of what you could do...most people are never in that boat... I actual qwould consider buying like 100k from ige or something... :confused:</div></div><hr />

You know you wanna be a cheap giggolo. Find them horney bitches and get their money with your sex.</div></div><hr />

Those seem to sell quite well on many servers.  Also, with a little legwork you could also make your own Grobb's liquidized meat and sell that.<br />

Upgrades - LDoN's are your friend here.  Try putting together your own group, and make sure that you're set up as DPS rather than MT for the group.  At 52 you'll probably earn 38 points or so per adventure.  Work on the BB adventures and for 150 points you can equip yourself with Death Embracers armor.  <br />
<br />
ex. Breastplate: AC:+40 HP:+25 MANA:+25 STR:+6 STA:+6 WIS:+6 INT:+6 FR:+5 DR:+5 Slot1:type1 Slot2:type1 Slot3:type3<br />
<br />
Once you have a few pieces you should be in a better position to do some MT duty within your own groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Sell tradeskill supplies and do your home city's newbie quests.<br />
Newb quests get you something<br />
Tradeskill selling gets you enough money to buy player made gothic armor (150-300 per peice)<br />
Gothic armor is good enough to LDoN in to get the Butcherblock stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">What I'd personally do (not saying it's the best or easiest or whatnot) if I found myself without gear, be it at lvl 50 or lvl 70, is I'd head over to Eastern Wastes and first stock up on Ry`Gorr chain armour... just to get beefed up and fill a few slots to improve on my naked AC (I'm assuming zero plat available).  You can fear kite a few Ry`Gorr around the fort and pick up a few random pieces of chain.  Get a few bone chips beforehand so that Jabobner can help out.  The pp from the orcs isn't that shabby and you might be able to pick up some cheapo gear in the Bazaar afterwards.  Now if I recall, some of the orcs in the fort were DB at 60 so you might start out on roamers outside, they can still drop Ry`Gorr.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Arikash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Or get some newbie gear, and farm the CC miners for velium, and sell it in baz.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Scuzz Zilla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Weighty polearm is your friend. should be abel to get one for under 100pp in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
for cash. go the old world way to get your first hundred or few hundred. Camp Gornit in Ocean of Tears.<br />
<br />
and yes. Gothic Steel armor is the way to go. after you get some pieces of that you should be able to show a bit of your face around.</div></div><hr />

More like 20 pts. on Drinal, maybe 30 at 55+,,, I think I was getting 23 sometimes, but I think at 50-54 you get around 20 pts...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Varrius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Scuzz.. &quot;That 2hs that drops like candy in PoJ&quot; is.. the weighty Polearm<br />
<br />
As for making plat.. it depends if your patient enough to sell in bazaar or not.  TS stuff like silks and swirling shadows (twilight sea) usually sell real nice.  If you don't want to do bazaar at all, looks like hill giants for you.  If you can get a group, the mobs in Sanctus seru drop like 10-15p each.  You should be able to tank them, not really that hard.  Probably better straight up plat than HG's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Gornit and the cyclops', being old world, don't hit hard, but drop descent buck.  Once you get gothic hit there, you'll still get some exp too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Kill the lizards outside of Cazic-Thule for plat and fine steel perhaps, it's almost never camped and you might get lucky and get some pieces for darkforge armor.  Also, goblins in Solusek A or frogs in Upper Guk might also be worth doing.  Hill Giants are a possibility, they are fearable but often camped on my server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Mred</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Not sure what server you are on, if its The Nameless then give me a shout (Mred or Jonni) I am working on my smithing, currently making ldon stuff, would be happy to donate to fill your empty slots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Culdahl1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Two things - 1) You can solo the nobles in HHK fo really good XP + loot and kill the greenies as well for extra cash.  2)  I made a lot of $ selling jboots MQ's...just camp the cyclops in SRo (MQ still sells for 'round 4K i think).</div></div><hr />

Sell your body. It's the only way to go. <br />
<br />
These 2 ideas are sounds,but you will be bruised and beaten, the spirit would be willing though,buying play from IGE, in your situation wouldnt be a bad idea,(myself i cant let myself give money for fake money in a game though) but you could spend the minumum to get yourself out of the rut youre in<br />
<br />
you could look to join a small guild that has a vault they could share with you, but all other options are looking grim my friend as to doing this yourself,if you do have  oow you can do the instanced zone or quest system and get items from there etc(i'm not too sure if im right about it though)</div></div><hr />
