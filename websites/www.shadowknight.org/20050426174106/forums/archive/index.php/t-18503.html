<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>LoganHex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Did a search on this and found many threads but none contained the information I was looking for (could have missed it as I am rather tired so apologies if it has been covered before).<br />
<br />
Real quick simple question. Is Goxnok triggered? Do I have to speak with him in Cabilis to get him to show up in Firiona Vie everytime or once I have the coin can I just pop up in Firiona Vie any time and check for him. I got the coin a while ago but could not find him when I went to look. Would like to try again and need to know if I need to trigger him or not.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Merias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have the same question.<br />
<br />
I can't find tracker Azeal in FV. The only one who spawns stay in outpost and is kos.<br />
<br />
I already did this quest on another server about 2 years ago and i did not have any problem at this time.<br />
<br />
May be the quest has changed a bit and you should now talk to Goxnok, take the coin, and run to Firiona Vie as soon as possible to catch the spawn ? May be its timed now ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Merias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Its me again.<br />
<br />
Tracker Azeal despawns at around 8pm but doesnt respawn during the night.<br />
<br />
I have been cheking him for more than 3 weeks now and i never saw him ;-(<br />
<br />
Did someone see him recently or is it a problem with my server (Sebilis, french server. we have not the same updates as american servers).<br />
<br />
Can someone confirm the quest still works as it did ? Or should i petition or bugreport ?</div></div><hr />
