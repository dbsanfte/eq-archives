<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KlowdKill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a love for doing the murk caves, been grinding in them for a month now, but unfortunitly people we invite start trying to put together their own group and basicly just infest the caves now and never able to beat the respawn.  Discussed a few places, tried them (mostly WoS areas) than the instant zone came up.<br />
<br />
I can tank murks easily w/ shaman, 6 spawn I need a cleric.  MPG is rough, 9khp 1700ac fully buffed doesn't seem to cut it atm.  What do these instant zones resemble with a full 70's group, do they drop glowing/greater runes, and are there any useable drops that upgrade bazaar geared tank.  <br />
<br />
Second question, havn't found any direct sites or info on this backflagging.  Are there any sites with full list of all the quests for the backflagging.  Alla's not being helpful, and just finding the original progression charts.</div></div><hr />
