SOmething funnny happined though.  He gave the tradesman the mirror and he of course turned into Dalnir.  He tried to give the mirror to Dalnir to do the MQ and he wouldnt take it.  I went ahead and gave him the rest of the quest pieces and got the Greenmist plans.  I didnt get the mirror though.  I want to make sure:  Do I need the mirror to finish Greenmist?</div></div><hr />

You were never supposed to give the mirror to Dalnir.  You get it back the first time (as the cracked mirror) because you really shouldn't know what Dalnir wants ahead of time and therefore you might need to respawn him again at a later time.  Of course, since we've all read the walk through, we are prepared the first time Dalnir is spawned, so the cracked mirror can later be used to help another SK.<br />
