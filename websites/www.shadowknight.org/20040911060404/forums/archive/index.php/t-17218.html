<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Covi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I tried scouting around for him and my lvl 1 rogue always gets whacked by a gargoyle when i try going down a ramp past the undead city...is it past the gargoyle or in the city with the &quot; Chests?&quot; any help is much appreciated</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Milon-MT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ghost of Glohnor spawns in one of the courtyards of the under tower at end of zone</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nenadar W'Vern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Should be around loc 760, 590 provided you are on the right floor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hudroponik_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">He spawns in the left side of the graveyard .. out fron of the &quot;tower&quot; .. jsut got him on mith marr tonight .. the &quot;mummy&quot; thats actually a skele takes a min to be seen, he was on track but couldnt find him.  He jsut kinda appeared at one point durring a pull , hes chump.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aoninie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Saw him yesterday on the left side. EQ atlas map has him on the right. I was there helping out on the Shaman epic. Wish I woulda had the turn-in piece. I did get the key for Caradon and the dusty tome though. <br />
<br />
Getting the courtyard cleared can be troublesome. Have a melee heavy raid force. The more dps the better. Also a good puller is a big asset. A mage is good to have for pet dps and the eye of zomm to spot him and see where to pull from.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vadrigar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well... actually he has several spawn locations.  I have probably seen him near 20 times.. +/-, back when rogues could roam freely.<br />
<br />
I have seen him in both courtyards.. and the basement.  He can basically spawn in any coffin there.  He will be the only mob seen sitting upright in one of the coffins.  He is in an undead Erudite form.<br />
<br />
Once to tower.. just run through on your improved ITU... and scout him out. <br />
<br />
[list=1]<br />
 Do right courtyard first (as its a dead end)<br />
 Do left courtyard next<br />
 Check downstairs if not there (entrance to basement is foundin the left courtyard)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Vadrigar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">No Auronan.  I've basically given up on it.  With the new weapons its only value would be that of a quester completing a very difficult quest.  I have recently MQ'ed a few of my items to one of my guildies.<br />
<br />
If it werent for the time.. I would still be in search of it.  With a full time job, and a family that is very important to me... I must allocate my time.<br />
<br />
If I am correct.. you are still the youngest on Torv to aquire it.  Well done fellow Knight of Dark.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Drakang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Need to wait 72 hours after patch to be safe. then head down.  Last time I did it after the changes he was up when we zone in we fought down did the turn in killed the mummy waited about 20 minutes and he repopped in the exact same spot.  On the left side so easy access to the basement.<br />
<br />
Noticed that all the coffins that use to have skeleton PH's in them were now empty so Maybe he repops with out a place holder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Aoninie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Did the turn-in last night. He was laying down in a coffin (not sitting up) in the far coffin on the right side. Did turn-in and went back out to the center courtyard. Before I could have the ranger track the mummy came barreling out of the left courtyard entrance straight to me. We threw him a beatin at that time. Only reason we took 3 groups is because clearing that courtyard can be a bitch. Good puller is a must or be ready for lots of adds. Went there once with a 65 chanter that had a hard time mezzing these undead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>velin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">im ready to do this part but had a question ....could a 65 sk 115 aa, 65 warrior 150 aa's, 65 pally w/ slay undead 2, 65 druid 73 aa's and a 65 shamy with 32 aa's do it?<br />
