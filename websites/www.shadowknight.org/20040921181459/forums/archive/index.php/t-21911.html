I didn't. I just had nothing else to say but &quot;hiya&quot; so I used a different font color to hide all my &quot;....&quot; <br />

I'm so sneaky!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Yeah, I noticed - I'm sneaky too, I clicked &quot;quote&quot; and looked at what came up lol.  <br />

<br />
you need to go into update character and change it from centered to &quot;none&quot; or &quot;tiled&quot;, then it should be fine. also with your current background i'd use background color of black.<br />
<br />
here's my magelo with your background pic not centered:<br />

and no, no bad experiences lately.</div></div><hr />

<br />
agree with you but tbh ive never had much trouble with going low mana, not enough to make me desperatley want it any how. :p <br />
<br />
More than your belt  Which I could see being something you're having difficulty replacing because of haste, slot, and dkp maybe.<br />
<br />
as for my belt welll........ I have a girdle of restoration in my invent which ive never used. Why ? i got it in atisipation of getting the earth haste bracer which sadly will never be now as all of a sudden the fucking thing stopped droppping we dont raid those zones any longer :( . I could always aug the girdle with a 36% haste aug but thats just sucky. so im waiting on a nice fat waist haste item to drop  :D Any thing else Darkmourn ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
hehe..<br />
<br />
That was the last one I made, because I got fed up with it not fitting just right.<br />
Thanks!<br />
Now I can actually make the one I wanted in the first place, and  not have a MSpaint cheesy one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>^UGARK^</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Chayde,<br />
<br />
Try adding &amp;resize=true to the end of your magelo link .. this forces it to resize and can make it easier to setup the background image :)<br />
Forces the window size to 800x600 from memory .. so makes it cake to place a 800x600 image in there :)<br />
<br />
eg:<br />

http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=128458&amp;resize=true<br />
<br />
(mine doesnt have a background image atm as I'm lazy .. but you get the idea)</div></div><hr />

Now, all I need to do is put something in the empty area, and find someone who knows how to shade my mspaiting (of chayde), and I will be so hyped!</div></div><hr />

Seriously? Any good at shading? I always mess things up when I try to shade them... <br />
<br />
I drew her in MSpaint, and I think she looks loopsided, with a mop on her head. (LOL)<br />
<br />
<br />
http://www.wickedages.com/chayde.bmp<br />

(I think her hair could stand some shades in it, and her armor. But I am not good at that stuff.) <br />

There's one problem...the kitten on it is still alive.<br />
<br />
What you need is a nice crispy kitten on rye...or jsut a cat getting zapped by a taser...either one would suffice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">The old version was better (where the cat is getting chased down).</div></div><hr />

I know this isn't exactly what you meant for me to do with your drawing but I got a little carried away in some 3D progs.  I did try to keep the way you wanted it to look with the colors and stuff, though.<br />
http://mywebpages.comcast.net/khat7/chayde-new.gifhttp://mywebpages.comcast.net/khat7/chayde-master-copy.gif<br />
The same size uncompressed .TIF file is here (http://mywebpages.comcast.net/khat7/chayde-new.tif).<br />
<br />
Here's one with Jabober thrown in.<br />

Jabober (http://mywebpages.comcast.net/khat7/chayde-jabober.tif).<br />
<br />
(I am trying to learn my way around 3D stuff and using your character as a reference.  I hope you don't mind. :) )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Cameela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Damn Khat, thats some impressive work there.  :) <br />
What software are you using for that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Chayde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">(I am trying to learn my way around 3D stuff and using your character as a reference.  I hope you don't mind. :) )<br />
<br />
<br />
Nope, don't mind at all, not like my cartoon was a work of art. =oP<br />
<br />
(not trying to be a critic because it's way more than I could have done... but... )<br />
 Can you make her shorts into knickers, so her boots don't cover her knee caps?<br />
And something looks off in body structre, her top is too long for her bottom, or that could just be me, because I'm not an artist, I really don't know how to factor that in. (just the length from belly button to crotch just seems a bit long... heh, but don't listen to me, I generally feel everyone is misporportioned and there is no correct way)<br />
<br />
She is pretty though.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, if you are feeling really ambitious, I can send you some blue red and black clay, and you can make me a real life model? =oP</div></div><hr />
