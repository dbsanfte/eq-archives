<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Joobee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First of all, let me introduce myself. Im Joobee, 45 SK on Stromm server. Played for many years on Fennin Ro.<br />
<br />
Im in kind of a dilemma now, I used to play a 64 Ranger (icky), but I decided to start over after a 3 month break on a new *fresh* server. I am now 45 and finding myself having ideas about switching classes. I know, I know, play what you like. I like my SK alot, but get frustrated at times. Mostly getting frustrated by not having any soloability. Now let me explain this.<br />
<br />
Yes, we can fear kite, but at 45 I dont have Invoke Fear or Dooming Darkness, so I find myself getting annoye by fearing repeatedly and such. I am very well geared for my level (and server mind you) but I still find soloing to be rigorous (sp?). Currently I am soloing in DSP Large Zels and wolves.<br />
<br />
Can anyone please give me tips/inspiration to continue on? I dont want to throw my SK away because I know I will love him 55+.<br />
<br />
Also, back on my Ranger when I fear kited animals they never ran in a straight path, they would turn eveytime I hit, Ive seen other SKs/Necros doing this, is this something that comes later on, or just pathing in some zones?<br />
<br />
Thanks a ton in advance, I read these boards alot, always have, just as a lurker though.<br />
<br />
Heres magelo if you are curious. Worked hard for it all =).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>cames</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">They have changed fear kiting and it won't work anymore that way for your ranger.  Load him up take him to the Karanas (or if your are that uber maybe EW) and try it.  Now feared mobs continue on there path even when you hit them.  That is not a class issue, its a change.<br />
<br />
If i was going to solo, I am certainly soloing in the old world not Luclin (where mobs have gobs of HPs).  There are plenty of outdoor zones in Velious and Kunark that will not make you fear kite as hard.  <br />
<br />
However, please be aware that SKs are not the best soloing class.  Necros and Beast Lords are both much better soloers.  In particular, xp changes in recent months favor grouping dramatically over soloing.  This will become more evident at 60+ where kiting turns to aggro kiting.  I solo during LFG times (might as well do something).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dakkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Learn to time fear and snare, at least roughly in your head, and run back when fear drops so the mob chases you to a safer starting point again before you re-fear.<br />
<br />
In many respects the game becomes less trivial as you level up, and your role often changes too.  Different classes have different frustrations, but the basic issue remains the same.<br />
<br />
As an SK you have the advantage that (till you hit GoD and upper tier PoP anyway as a new starter) you'll at least be in demand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You get Dooming in FOUR FUCKING LEVELS.  If you want to play an SK, you'll suck it up and cope.  If not, you'll re-roll. <br />
<br />
Either way, I don't give a shit, but quit coming here and posting &quot;moral dilemmas&quot; that no one cares about.<br />
<br />
If you're thinking of quitting your toon and re-rolling, you probably should.  Always.  End of story.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kenshi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I did lots and lots and lots of giants in GD and EW at 45 to around 51. Can also prolly kill orcs near the bridge to ICO in EW. and the wolves in ICO.  Could also fear kite beside the ent to KC in DL. You'll get useto the timing of snare and fear. Stick with it, once you get doom and invoke it goes alot smoother.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>ZilshasisEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Build a network of people by grouping with them. Thats the way into Decent guilds. While you may prefer soloing for some reason not known to me It's always good to have a network backing you up, and you will without doubt level faster once your network is established.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kyfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Soloing really isn't that efficient anymore in the days of the 80% group bonus. And SKs aren't the best soloers. Buy a pair of Blood Ember Gauntlets for a couple k, then at least the snare will be mana free. I don't recall what I soloed at 45, maybe the bugs in Echo. <br />
<br />
You should really just hop over and group in PoJ at 46 if you can.  Levels 45-48 are the worst stretch in a SK's career in terms of power. 49 it gets much better.<br />
<br />
<br />
Kenshi: You might want to pick a font that is readable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Oagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Having the ability to do limited soloing is one thing.  Relying on soloing is another.  We can solo, but we're weak at it, comparatively, especially at the higher levels.<br />
<br />
If you're going to solo, or if you enjoy soloing over grouping, raiding, etc., then re-roll a soloing class, which would be a druid, wizard, or necro (not necessarily in that order).  The ability to quad and charm (post 60) may put the advantage towards the druid (which makes me sick, but wth).<br />
<br />
I wonder why you went to 64 with your ranger and then backed off?  Rangers are viable pullers in Tier 2 and 3 PoP.  You do more DPS than we do.<br />
<br />
It's your 13 bucks, do what you want.  If you just want to solo, however, re-roll another class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nambkab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I soloed from 41-49 in DL at the temple on the skellies.  Experiment and you can find &quot;tricks&quot; to help, or you can do what I considered ping-pong kiting, where you spook em, beat away, run back, let em come back to ya, then spook em again.  Either way they are good xp, and not too difficult to kill.<br />
<br />
From 49 to 55 you can solo the nobles in HHK via kiting, just clear the guards on the path they take.</div></div><hr />
