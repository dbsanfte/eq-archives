NPCs will notice your magical activities 5, 10, and 20 percent less <br />
Cost: 2, 4, 6 <br />
<br />
I wonder why  this skill is even available?  One of the reasons we exist is to generate agro.  What is the point of having an ability available for us that would danger our existance?<br />
<br />
Would it be possible to change this ability into increasing agro instead of decreasing?  Say being an active ability (turn it on for X time duration) and in that time your spells would generate x% more agro?  Or if you think its overpowering could it be removed?  I could imagine having an affliction haste spell added to our abilities instead or say a quick damage type?<br />
<br />
Let's discuss.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lejina Bloodbath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Unwanted agro is bad on raids.<br />
<br />
A SK casting 2 spears, Blood of Hate and Touch of Innoruuk is maximizing his dps but also has to deal with a good load of agro. <br />
<br />
Spell Casting Subtlety makes it easier to control your agro on raids when being in a damage dealing role.<br />
<br />
Does this ability is &quot;dangerous&quot; to the SK training this?<br />
Hardly.<br />
<br />
Currently the SK have the ability to taunt much more than what is needed. Unless you are being very cheap when it comes to cast agro spells when tanking, you would hardly notice a change once you train this when you are trying to hold agro.<br />
<br />
Im not saying this ability is great and thrilling or anything, but its far from being useless.<br />
<br />
<br />
Does an affliction haste or quick damage ability be of any use to the SK class? No.<br />
At lvl 65 we are naturally spell hasted by 45% on all detrimental spells. The haste cap is at 50%. Virtually all our spells are detrimental (at least, those we cast more often then once every hour), so a SK has really no need for any kind of item, spell or ability that enhance our spell haste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Trysbrina67</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">This has been discussed many a time before on the boards.  While people probably arent going to buy this skill until after 200 AA, its still valuable for the reasons Lejina pointed out.  It also doesnt affect the &quot;Terror&quot; line and knights who have it notice no decrease in the ability to hold taunt on a mob with stuff like clinging, invoke fear etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kaeldavan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">How about the ability to turn it on and off ?<br />
<br />
Off for normal tanking.<br />
<br />
On for Damage dealing.<br />
<br />
Hard to implement ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Trysbrina67</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Why?  There doesnt seem to be a need to, people who have the skill report no trouble at all taking and holding aggro when they need to.</div></div><hr />
