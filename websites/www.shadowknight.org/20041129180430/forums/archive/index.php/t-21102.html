<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KLeTuS_KaSaDy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">there isnt one, there are non available they are all currently used, tell dev's to figure out a role for us when we cant even figure one out for ourselves is pointless. we need to step into a role that is currently existing and the tanking role has room for a few additinal classes, theres no reason that 1 class and 1 class alone should hog a role be it group content or raid.<br />
<br />
chanters and shamans beastlords can slow, bards and chanters can mez monks and bards can pull, clerics and druids can heal (druids need a better CH atm ) rangers rogues monks wizerds mag beastlords necros can dps<br />
<br />
and warriors can tank .. warriors paladins and shadowknights should all be sharing the tanking role be it group or raid content. im sorry but its time for the warriors to exept it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Androsulach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">How do you propose to get the warriors to accept that knights are tanks too?  After all, with everything they got from that melee upgrading, warriors have become rather selfish and have forgotten that the knights supported them on the aggro thing.  They are acting like they got their due and don't owe any of us who supported them a thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Makkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The majority of the SK spellbook is useless, especially when compared to what warrior disc's can do. Tell me you wouldn't give up MC or the gimp 64 pet for a defensive disc..<br />
<br />
Such a bullshit argument on their part. <br />
<br />
&quot;SK's get spells and utility!&quot;<br />
Monks and bards pull better. Stonewall, insta fd and fd AA advancement, lull and FM &gt; casted FD, sorry. Not to mention all their discs are exactly the same as spells, with endurance for a mana bar.<br />
<br />
&quot;SK's can do a lot of dps with their spells!&quot;<br />
Yeah, and it puts a top end SK on par with a warrior's pure melee dps if we're lucky.<br />
<br />
&quot;SK get a lot of utility with their spells!&quot;<br />
Yeah, except for stacking issues with atk, zev bite pretty much the best SK spell is a whopping 100 mana/min. Not exactly overpowering..neither is HT, burst damage is burst damage it doesn't matter a hell of a lot most of the time.<br />
<br />
&quot;SK have snap aggro!&quot;<br />
Warrior aggro generation is higher than hybrids now, with the exception of building more aggro before they touch the mob. When they're quad proccing hate procs + aggro discs, there's no competition. They also don't lose DPS / melee aggro like knights do to build aggro.<br />
<br />
Knight classes should tank differently than warriors, but equally or damn close to it. Watering down content if you're unlucky enough to have a knight tank instead of a warrior is the most asinine idea ever. SoE has never had a reasonable role for SK, it's clear to me they really don't give a damn and think warriors should be The Tanks period. I just don't see this changing with the large warrior population dead set in the mentality that no one but them should be tanking high end raid encounters. There are too many Furor-esque warriors who are dead set against anyone but a war tanking.<br />
<br />
This is kind of a dead horse though, EQ as a worthwhile game is long since gone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>KLeTuS_KaSaDy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">im not sure if any you remeber back when we were getting spell upgrads but from what i recall allot of the &quot;caster supieriors were very against us recieving certian spell upgrades and this lead us to weaker verions of the orginal - everyone said taking spells from another class &quot;doesnt work&quot; makeing shadowknight specific spells. well in truth in my eyes this KILLED the hybrid, were no longer hybrids were shadowknights and paladins, the only hybrids left in the game are bards since they can fill ALLOT of roles.<br />
<br />
make us tanks, make us DPS i dont care just give me something to work for</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>aress</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">they should not care what the warriors think, they should balance the game in a logical way best for all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">They will never give us the kind of sustained dps we need to be competitive against the other dps classes.  And that role is already way over crowded.<br />
<br />
Tanking is clearly the only role for us and there are only 3 tanks classes.<br />
<br />
We really need to focus on getting our ability to tank back.</div></div><hr />
