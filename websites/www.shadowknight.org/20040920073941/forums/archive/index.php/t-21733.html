<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I am not really fired up about this, just barely &quot;perturbed&quot;. In the last patch they stated they improved the damage output and duration on many damage shields.<br />
<br />
Did they forget the SK / Necro Banshee Aura Damage shield. I noticed last night it has the same damage and same duration. Was this an oversight or did they purposely omit this from their Damage shield overhaul.<br />
<br />
I am not really fired up about this since most times I would have a nice wizard or druid DS anyway, but there are times when it comes in handy.<br />
<br />
Forgotten again?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Maicom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">they did up the damage *proportionally*....<br />
<br />
shield of bracken was changed from 6.5 to 15 minutes<br />
<br />
maelstrom of ro got changed from 7.5 to 15 minutes, damage uped from 45 to 48<br />
<br />
EDIT: they got shit for upgrades, if we were to get an  upgrade that scaled to what their's were it'd be like an extra .5 dmg per hit. duration wise ours is 9 minutes so they prolly thought that was okay(I never bother castin the spell because of the long time it takes to pop, and its short duration... so it could be argued that its duration should be upped)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Neric Ikolis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I use it all the time in Rathe Mnts...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kahntun Derstand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'd say we need a much overdue upgrade to Banshee Aura in OoW.  They might have forgotten about it in this round, but they can fix that with a better spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>vilesoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">agreed.  Ilove banshee aura.  It's a great solo spell, and has helped me get out of a good many &quot;oh shit&quot; moments.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Oh shit! Cleric died...quick quick cast Banshee Aura!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I was pondering that too... still pondering... I'll let you know when I think of an &quot;oh shit&quot; situation where banshee aura would help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>DConquest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Oh Shit... I'm being attacked by 200 Decayed Skeletons?  In all seriousness though, it was a nice spell to put up when in a small group or duo and you know the fight is going to take forever.  I wouldn't mind an upgrade to that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">even a improvement in duration would be beneficial. When in small groups I still use it quite a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yes, although certainly I can't say it's ever saved my life, I do like to have some sort of DS on at all times (of course, mag/dru preferred) and usually have CoL and 8th ring on along with at least Banshee Aura.  Working on Intense Hatred 5 atm too, so when that's finished it will give me 47 pts of self-only DS.<br />
<br />
I too would like longer duration, and/or increased damage, plus a new upgrade down the road.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">(Oh, shit!  I forgot to use pit-stick this morning, and here comes Lill!  Good thing I have Banshee Aura memmed!)<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Gash, what's that wonderful scent you're wearing today?&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The thing about upgrading spells like banshee aura is that we have a limited amount of new spells that we will get. On the current list are some good ones, and some that need to be further improved, and some scrapped all together.<br />
<br />
Since BA doesn't stack with mage or druid DS lines, it presents some limited use, mostly soloing or pvp. The rare times that we straight tank solo, having an upgrade to this spell isn't going to make a huge difference. Personally I would rather see other spells introduced that have broader application.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I just had a good look at dru DS Legacy of Bracken.  The damage stayed the same (40) but duration went from 6.5 mins to 15 mins.  In looking at mag DS Maelstrom of Ro, damage was increased from 45 to 48 and duration from 7.5 mins to 15 mins.<br />
<br />
So ours lasting 9 mins wasn't that terrible; or am I missing something?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kahntun Derstand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I never thought about it that way Siilvir.  I agree with you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>vilesoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">heh not oh shit moments like that....more like the 20 light blue skellies in the room aggroed and I cant get FD off since one of them is a freaking caster...usually if your the only person around, that spell can possibly add enough dps to turn it around in an event like that.<br />
<br />
Since i do go fucking around in random zones on my own..that spell does often find itself in my spellbar...given it's not the universal ass-saver..but it's worked enough times to be worth it.<br />
<br />
I do see where Siilvir is going with it though...it might be worth leaving as is for a better spell elsewhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Androsulach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">While it would be nice to have an upgrade to BA, I'd rather see an upgrade of Grim Aura or stretching Grim Aura into a short line of ATK buff spells that scale properly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">We have enough ATK buff spells at this point, go look at Lucy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I would like to see upgrades to our DS. That's for sure. I surely enjoyed having 82 DS (only have 2nd level of intense hatred) with mage DS plus 34 DS from cleric mark. That surely chewed NORMAL ldon trains. We fought unslowed 1-3 mobs in normal ldon. DS surely shined there.. It sped up killing rate.. Never need chanter or slower for that. God, sure enjoyed the independence from damn CC or Slower for a change!  I had to switch target among mobs to keep all on me and they say, &quot;OUCH! OUCH!!&quot; every time they touch me. <br />
<br />
My BIGGESTTTTT wish....  AE Taunt spell. :( Then I wouldn't need to switch target every time.. AE taunt spell would be a god send to SK IMO. Heck, AE DD (darkness or fear equiv taunt) spell would be fun. I surely missed AE spell. Our highest is lvl 49 and it definitely doesn't do its job well cuz it can't even taunt well and I have no time to use it cuz of switching targets trying to keep mobs to myself (I had no other tank in my groups most of the time, that's why). AE no damage taunt and AE damaging taunting spell would be fun to have and a viable upgrade to our lvl 49 one.. Then pulling trains would be more efficient for SK.. ;) <br />
<br />
SK is excellent choice for tanking multi-mobs due to its deadly DS to support DPS while tanking. :) Yes, I would love to see more DS AA for OOW. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">hmmm, AE Taunt. I got to admit I would not really be pushing for that item. While it would be a valuable tool, I always considered AE taunt the domain of warriors...<br />
<br />
...but that is just me.<br />
<br />
However, I would like the damage shield. The point of &quot;we only have so many spells&quot; is well taken, but I think that a upgraded DS is important enough to make the cut.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">We get better DSs from gear and from buffs than we'd ever get on our own, and the stacking issues would make it useless. Get a druid, a bard, and bring your own DS clicky item...we don't need a spell that will just get overwritten.<br />
<br />
AE Taunt would make Warriors go apeshit...<br />
<br />
AE Damage = Coral Hilted Tulwar...great little 1 groupable toy in Water, and it has an absolutely ridiculous range of 200'...<br />
<br />
What is the point of adding crap to make Normal LDoNs easier at the expense of more versatile spells? They are too easy already...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Making COD (cloak of discord) DS stronger than just 13 and add more DS AA that will still stack with druid/mage DS that will make our DS stronger. <br />
<br />
Dain ring has nice stacking buff with druid/mage. We could use upgraded banshee to be ON frostreaver blessing stacking slot. Don't care if it overwrites dain buff. dain buff is lvl 60 and 3 years old after all. :) And not every SK has that.. Getting new banshee buff maybe 20-30 DS that stacks with Druid/mage DS and can FINALLY use hp regeneration buff to go with upgraded banshee is what I would take over dain ring anyday. It sucks that hp reg doesn't stack with dain ring..<br />
<br />
Hey, we don't even live in Normal LDON long. :) We would enjoy fighting harder mobs and still train them when we are 70. :)<br />
<br />
I understand that AE taunt is &quot;warrior's domain&quot;. I only stated my wish for SK to have AE taunt spell. Nothing wrong to wish or dream for it. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Might as well wish for an upgrade to Dark Empathy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>vilesoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">yeah...30 hp ghetto heal...WTF?  it was almost useless back then...its still useless now.</div></div><hr />
