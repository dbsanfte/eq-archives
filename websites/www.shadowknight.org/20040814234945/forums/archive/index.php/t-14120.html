Interesting, the U shaped symbol. Not only is it in Lesser Faydark, but it is also in the Gorge of King Xorbb. All the minos and evil eyes hang out there.<br />
Nixx's surname I do not remember, I believe it starts with N also. Like Nixx Nxxxxxxx. I was about to take screenshots of him but I got a visit by a GM to test out the guild code (remember how buggy the guild code was?).<br />
<br />
It is kind of funny, because we were all alone in Paw, and it was the first time we killed Kurpoc Splitpaw. After I killed a bunch of people under Nixx's charm, the GM Vashaar  showed up. Vashaar is a Dark Elf, and I immediately started asking him why he charmed me and killed my friends haha. Of course it wasn't him, but all Inkies look alike.<br />

Another famous graveyard is in the tutorial. You can find all sorts of people there, including Dyne the Diligent (Pour Homme), Mixxy the Bitter (death was always in her wake), Vashaar the All Seeing (his eyes are at last shut), Binelen the Pathweaver (we are as lost children without her), Aradune the Green (his flaming sword was a beacon to all), Ssra (snuffer of worlds), and Xectia the Tardy (even unto the grave).<br />
<br />
<br />
and finally Urath Online (http://www.google.com.au/search?q=cache:zPoOwc90WuMJ:www.razors-edge.net/urath/+Vashaar&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8)  is apparently a group working on a NWN world. this link is a google cache of their news page (the actual page seems to be dead) in which they claim to have Hutch aka vashaar in their employ. They cite his credentials as being one of the original designers of everquest.<br />
<br />
from all this I'd say your looking for a GM avatar and one that no longer plays/works for everquest.  What leads you to be looking for this guy?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Leyl D`Korrosin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you mean Vorshar, you're looking for Vorshar the Despised. He's in Neriak Commons, in one of the buildings near the dock. <br />
<br />
However, he's not for a quest per se, he's part of that Realm of the Heros thing; meaning that you turn in GM awarded coins to him to get the result of being involved in a GM event.</div></div><hr />

There are Realm of the Heros npcs in the old world cities and in Cabilis (never bothered to check Shar Vahl, and they're only in PC starting cities). They all have rather long stories they'll tell you if you hail them, but they all boil down to 'My god decided I was special, and wisked me away to the Realm of the Heros. I've been sent back to the material world to reward others who have been deemed worthy. Give me the coin, I'll give you your reward.' <br />
<br />
Entirely too many people engaged in conspiracy theory-esque discussions of what 'The Coin' was, and how to get it/them. It all turned out to be the new (this was what? Kunark era added content? I forget exactly) way VI had set up GM event rewards. They put one in or around the starting cities to make faction not an issue for people who had been involved in the events. The stories the guys tell you are actually pretty interesting if you feel like sitting through them. <br />
<br />
As for whether I have first hand experience; no, I've never won anything from a GM event. I'll spare you the boring 'I know a guy' stories, but yes, people have confirmed their function. Of course, what was really the last interactive GM event? The Malevolence thing, I'd guess... and that's a good while back now.</div></div><hr />
