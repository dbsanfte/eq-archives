It involves getting agro on a mob without doing damage until a mezzer can mezz it. Of course the SK will take a beating until then. I can see this working with our terror line as it does no real damage or maybe even fear. Has anyone ever used this tactic and does it work? <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vici</div><div class="date">09-08-2004, 08:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use fear, taunt, and sit if I have to.<br />
<br />
It works very well in quite a few places</div></div><hr />

Also get used to warriors' and paladins' idea of tank mezzing to involve turning on attack and completely defeating the point.<br />
<br />
Fear, both fears if necessary.  Use CD when you know the stuff is snare immune.</div></div><hr />

Hell, if you can get the mobbed slowed, you just turn off attack and cast on the sucker.  This is not something new to people that progressed through Luclin.</div></div><hr />

Unless you like seeing your chanters beaten to a bloody pulp as you hammer that Terror spell and realise it ain't doin shit.....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cames</div><div class="date">09-10-2004, 08:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">To add just one simple comment here, using Fear is better than Terror.  In fact, in cases where I am doing this I will often load both Fear and Invoke Fear to allow me to have 2 spells that I can cast back to back to ensure I have hard aggro.  Generally, I have Fear/Dark but if mobs are snareable then Dark of course can't be used.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scabben</div><div class="date">09-15-2004, 07:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I keep fear and invoke fear loaded.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't know how much it helps, but disarm does seem to generate a small amount of aggro as well, and does not break mez.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Inevub</div><div class="date">09-17-2004, 05:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just use fear.  Don't use the terrors.  Ever.  When I'm meztanking I also use a hotkey to announce to the raid that I'm doing it so the other jackasses don't attack it if I'm waiting for a chanter to mez it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ashrai</div><div class="date">09-17-2004, 06:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Same. I have two hotkeys: one for offtanking and one for tankmezzing or holding for mez. All our guild chanters know that when they see the TM key it means I'm not damaging the mob in anyway and attack is off. Pretty much all our knights who've done Time trials to any extent have gotten into the habit of announcing if they're holding for mez or if they're truly offtanking the mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shadowknight adeklias</div><div class="date">10-29-2004, 09:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">anyone that said not to use terror should clarify themselves.  Our whole line of Terror blows ass....until Terror of Discord.  I keep Invoke fear and Terror up when mez tanking and it does the trick. In fact it seems that TOD has more snap ago and it usually takes 2 casts if im just using fear.<br />
<br />
Another suggestion....try using your AC tap on INC if you can get your target fast enough.  The damage and Tap is usually plenty of agro to keep from tash/malos etc stealing agro and the added AC bonus will help you when getting beat on.<br />
<br />
more helpful hints if you are trying to mez tank. <br />
<br />
1. make a Mez tank hotkey so enc and healers know what you are doing.<br />
<br />
2. make sure a healer is in your group to help with quick heals ( i usually prefer shammy so i know my OT mobs are slowed while im mez tanking them)<br />
<br />
3. if your healers and enc arent awake, and you are getting beat on try healing yourself with taps.  Sure you might break a mez if they finally decide to mez it but you will be alive and still on agro for them to mez again.<br />
<br />
4. dont by any means dot mobs....a loose broke mez to a tap is usually fine but a 2 min dot on a mob that is supposed to be mezzed will have your encs pulling their hair out every raid.<br />

<br />
It's not my experience that this will out agro tash even with the chanter behind me...only malos because the agro is so low on it.  You aren't tapping the mobs AC you are gaining a recourse, it's just a weak DD and doesn't generate much agro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This tactic has been utilized forever and still gets utilized alot.<br />
<br />
Its very effective and will save enchanters lives esp when they get a resist or two or need to be tashing first.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I disagree, Terror of Discord is very very good for this tactic. Why you wouldn't use it is beyond me.</div></div><hr />
