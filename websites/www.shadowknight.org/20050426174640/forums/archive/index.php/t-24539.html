<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Brazlaag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">If I got a decent shield, would this be worth upgrading to, or should i stick with my current wep?<br />
<br />
here is a link to my char's gear: http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=993904</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brazlaag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">sorry for a useless thread, i saw a great deal last night in bazaar and snapped it up, i have an upgrade for my primary slot, move along</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Poote</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">just a silly question, why on earth does yer magelo show you using Crushbone Shoulderpads.<br />
<br />
i'll link my 39 SK when i update her, but i use the Obulus Death Shroud ( mana preservation III) at least until i can obtain something better.<br />
<br />
other than that i like most of yer gear.</div></div><hr />

because that's what i'm wearing, basically it's cause i don't wanna spend a few 1000pp on something that will last me till about 50, and then i'll have to spend another load of money upgrading from it, i'd rather spend a lot of money now on something that will last me till the high 60s (like i hope a lot of my stuff will), and if that means wearing crushbone shoulderpads untill i'm level 42, than so be it, same goes for my orc fang earing and my crappy necklace</div></div><hr />

Christ I hate Fucksticks like you, why the fuck make a magelo if your lvl 41'ish  and every item is bazaar bought?  Daddy makes you suckdick? Mommie not give you enough titmilk?<br />
<br />
Let me save you some time,go to playerauctions.com and buy a lvl 70 epic SK then you can be one of those idiots that run around in PoK asking people to duel you in front of the bank because you didnt get your &quot;respect&quot;.<br />

edit- since this is a usless post as braz there puts it,can a Admin move this to the flame section? I rushed the first flame,think I can do better</div></div><hr />
