Does anyone have any parses to prove or disprove this? 7dps or 40 percent seems quite high to me. And if it is 7dps, that certainly makes this AA more appealing to me.<br />

Thanks,</div></div><hr />

I don't have any parses though but the crits don't seem to happen that often.  I would guesstimate the added dps to be around 1 percent maybe.</div></div><hr />

That's why I ask, I figured that it probably was about 1.5dps tops at level 5. Certainly no 7dps. I also know that I group with a mage who has several levels of Pet crits, and his pet certainly is not doing this much more dps, although it is doing more dps now. I think with all of his Pet AA's with GoD, his pet is doing about 10 more dps usually. And that is with Pet affinity and and at least 3 levels of Pet Crits.</div></div><hr />

You can't really put any weight into that.  Parses I've seen/discussed indicate it's more in the negligable range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">From what I've seen it's worth about 1.6 dps on our pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">That qualifies as negligable.  :(</div></div><hr />
