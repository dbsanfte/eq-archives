<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>SweetMeef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I want to do more dps. <br />
I currently am knocking out LR5, and have ND3 CS3 ToL1.<br />
My tanking roles aren't usually so difficult that I run the healer oom.<br />
I'm definitely doing SCF3 after LR, but after that, what are the best offensive AA's to get for the AA's spent on them?<br />
<br />
For instance, would I be better off from a dps standpoint dropping 18 into SA for the extra dmg from the procs (disregarding the nice crit heals for now), or spending those same 18 AA on something like CF3 &amp; Fury of the Ages2; or something w/ Knight's Advantage and Speed of the Knight.<br />
<br />
Those AA's (CF, FotA, KA, SotK) are the main &quot;increase your dps&quot; AA that I see.<br />
<br />
Since I'm not in dire need for the added healing from SA:<br />
1) Should I put off SA till later?<br />
2) which of the above AA provide the most dps/AA?<br />
3) Are there any offensive AA I left out (excluding IHT/UT) or &quot;passive&quot; AA that would increase my dps significantly also (for example some may argue that unholy steed gives you more mana with which to nuke, so is therefore an offensive aa)<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">With maxxed dex SA3 using SoC adds about 4.5 dps... however, <br />
if you're really aiming for DPS you should be using MC instead of SoC, which lowers that a little.<br />
that's about .25 DPS per AA.<br />
mental clarity 1 should add about .5 DPS per AA, and MC2 should add about .25 DPS per AA.<br />
<br />
CF1 increases your melee DPS by .5% per AA, so if you do 50 melee DPS normally, it would give you .25 DPS per AA. <br />
<br />
SoTK &amp; KA combo give you about a .35% increase in DPS per AA, and are the next best things after CF1.<br />
<br />
combat AAs in the most efficient order are:<br />
CF1, KA1, SoTK1, SoTK2, SoTK3, KA2, KA3, CF2, CF3, double riposte 1, FoTA1, FoTA2, FoTA3<br />
after KA3 and CF2, the DPS gain has significantly dropped though.<br />
<br />
so... all together, the ordering is SCF3, MC1, CF1, SA1, SA2 &amp; SA3, MC2, KA1, SoTK1-3, KA2-3, CF2, other junk</div></div><hr />

 <br />
<br />
So toss SA in there b/t CF1 and MC2?<br />
Also, I've heard that double riposte is about as worthless as they come... are there stats to verify its worth as well?<br />
<br />
Thanks for the info tho - I'll most likely alter my AA route to be more dps-oriented, and maybe toss in a Steed or HT grind in the mix.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Two things<br />
<br />
1)  Mental clarity 1 and 2 increase your DPS not your DPS(melee) and as such are more valuable if your only fight 10% of the time they raise your effective fighting dps by 5 and 2.5 for example instead of .5 and .25<br />
<br />
2)  If your dex not maxed dex can also affect your dps.  I figure something like .3-.4 dps per AA point in dex based on 2.6 damage per mana using MC and having a 50 pt proc on weapon.  I only get 50 mana at my level so the MC mana would give more DPS at lvl 65.  I got the data used to calculate the gain for me from windows proc post =)</div></div><hr />
