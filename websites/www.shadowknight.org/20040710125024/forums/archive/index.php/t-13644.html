<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jabbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">While you're mounted on Unholy Steed, you cannot get flags for events by Hailing mobs, at least on two encounters.<br />
<br />
1)  We're doing Xanomech and fighting our little hearts out.  We kill him and as I was low on mana, I had summoned horsie towards the end of the fight.  The gnome for the flag pops, and I ride over to him and hail him.  I had him targeted, I wasn't invis, and I was nearly standing on top of him.  I hailed him two times, no response.  Thinking maybe I would log out, come back, and try again I dispelled my horse.  On a lark, I hailed him again, and got my flag.<br />
<br />
2)  We're doing Behemoth event in PoI.  I run in with my raid and hail the first gnome before leaving the first chamber in the Factory.  I'm not mounted, and I get my pre-flag.  We finish the fight against Behemoth and I and many others died due to dots.  I left my corpse at the Graveyard after I'd ridden from bind point, and dashed into the Factory.  I rode all the way through naked and reached the gnome where he'd been stopped right outside the Behemoth room.  I was still in raid, I wasn't invis, and again I was right on top of him, but on my hail, I didn't get the flag.  It didn't occur to me it might be the horse, so I left the area (we had a pretty big raid) and got my rez.  On a lark, I went to the Seer in PoK and 'unlocked my memories'.  I received my flag then, getting the message from the gnome that he'd 'forgotten' I'd promised to 'test the machine'.  <br />
<br />
This is only two instances, but in both cases I was mounted and it's about the only thing I can possibly think of which could link both together.  In both cases I did exactly the SAME thing as everyone else on my raid, but I had issues getting the flag, while they did not.  If you're having trouble getting a flag where you 'hail' something, dismount and give it another shot, or go 'unlock your memories' with the Seer in PoK.<br />

Just a heads up, make of it what you will. :)</div></div><hr />
