<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hemlocc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i'm in a guild that me and my friends started lately we've been having a rough time raiding because of stupid mistakes from others. so when i brought up the idea of getting my epic i was basically booed off the stage. this makes the epic look unatainable especially since i'm having a hell of a time dinging 52. ne way i was wondering if there are ne &quot;small&quot; parts of the epic that i can complete by myself. thanks for the input<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aoninie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You can scrounge up the darkforge armor you need to turn in. Other than that at 51 you really can't take anyof the mobs solo ( at least I don't think so). You could do the Ghoulbane quest easily yourself. Took me a few hours to get that. Now I'm in the same boat as you, casual guild with not many members (although they want to help bigtime and already have a bit, just not on line with killing cazic-thule and the more powerful mobs). Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>yuggoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">In the old old old days you had to kill Cazic, now the Soulleech can drop off any of the 3 golems.<br />

There always seems to be Hole raids - see if you can start getting in them and doing that.  At the least you will be learning the zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Atlis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Exp in the Hole.  Hopefully your exp group can get to the jail area for Dusty tomes.  If you are here all the time, you can catch raids passing through.  See if they'll pull the mimics as they go by the vaults for you.  When you are 55+, see if your xp group will venture into Hate for exp on drakes.</div></div><hr />
