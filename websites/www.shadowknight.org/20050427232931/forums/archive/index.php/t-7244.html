<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cykyk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all.  I'm new to the boards, and I wanted to ask a race question.  I played EQ about a year ago, and had to quit due to RL conflicts.  I'm coming back, and some friends are willing to help me start a new account with a SK.  I understand that stats can be compensated for over time with the proper gear, so I'm probably going to base my decision on something kinda off the wall:  Coolness factor.  I'm basing this on screenshots that i've seen on the boards as I dont have luclin yet, but plan to get it soon.  <br />
<br />
I'm trying to decide between Human, DE, and Erudite.  DE just cause they look really cool in some of their armor.  The only thing taking away from the cool factor is the large number of DE SK.  Humans look pretty good.  I was thinking of being an Erudite to be different since there are very few on my server.  The downside is that I'm not really sure I like the loin cloth or the big head.  <br />
<br />
I would appreciate any advice anyone could give as to how to make a cool looking character that will be somewhat unique.  Although they dont have to be COMPLETELY unique if they look badass.  If you think I'm a fool for choosing a race based on looks, that's understandable, I'll take it into consideration.   If you have pics of a SK that looks really cool, I'd appreciate that.  I've seen many on the boards, but I'm just trying to get as much variety as possible.  Thanks in advance for the advice.</div></div><hr />
