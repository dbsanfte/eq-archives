<br />
The Planes are over run with 60+ char's who wants a damn 55 Sk.<br />
<br />
Everyones like &quot;Go to PoJ THE XP ROCKS, AND YOU CAN SOLO!&quot;<br />
<br />
Went, soloed 3 mobs, got trained, died. Got rezed, re-ding 55, got trained while looting corpse in the GRAVEYARD.  Got rezzed again, just barely ding 55.  <br />
<br />
What dumb F*#K trains the GRAVEYARD??<br />
<br />
Say screw this, go and look for a group for 2 hours, and then say F#*K that S*#t and log on my necro.<br />
<br />
Go back to PoJ on a non-weekend day, the same stupid S*#T.  <br />
<br />
I now remember why I solo where no one else does.<br />
<br />
Only problem is at 55, where to solo in places that retards wont train you.<br />
<br />
Ive been doing the guards at the TS zone inside katta.  Not great xp, but no one there to screw you up either.<br />
<br />
The frustration is building everytime I play my SK, and I find myself logging on my necro, more and more.<br />
<br />
Ive viewed the Hunting grounds area of this board, and they have some good suggestions.  Problem is finding the right duo, or group of Non-retards to go with.<br />
<br />
Then when you do get the group of non-retards, a group of retards trains ya.<br />
<br />
How do these people make it into the 50's is what ive been asking my self.  <br />
<br />
I acctualy heard a guy shout: &quot;Help&quot; in PoJ.  LMFAO, holy S*#T, you dumb F*#K, go back to Crushbone.<br />
<br />
Jesus Christ, where the hell do these people come from????  <br />
<br />
Its taken me 3 years of casual play to get 55, and even I know not to do stupid S*#T like that.<br />
<br />
What evah, dumb F*#KEN A$$holes screw S*#T up for everyone.<br />
<br />
Tumy Monster<br />
55th Ogre Revenant<br />

<br />
<br />
P.S: Any suggestions that havent been mentioned in the hunting grounds forum where a 55 SK can solo in peace???</div></div><hr />

<br />
I HATE Other people. So if I can't get a group with my friends, I can still get exp without having to deal with fektards.<br />
<br />
Staying out of DL helped a lot too. Now if only I can make it through the low 50s without stepping foot in Karnors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Moongarm</div><div class="date">01-29-2003, 12:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree completely Tumy. Some of these tards running around PoP zone's shoulda been a stain on a bed sheet.<br />
<br />
I gladly accept lower exp output in places like Seb/Chardok/HS solo or duo'd with my cleric, than to go into PoP with some of these idiots running around higher level zones.  They should administer IQ tests before you can enter 50+ zones.<br />
<br />
PoP kicks major ass if you can get a good friend/guild group. If dealing with the general moron population, no thanks I'd rather gouge my eyes out with the talon of an eagle encrusted with duckbill platypus feces.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NeurottSK</div><div class="date">01-29-2003, 01:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">its truly amazing how many trains there are in PoJ. at any given second there will be atleast 5 SKs soloing &quot;the ph3@r sp0t&quot;, and ive seen up to 11. generally the trains are from non SKs, namely rangers/druids doing rats. those rats chewed the piss out of me untill lvl 57. after 57 the rats dont really agro. then your only problem will be trains from Mav.s hall usually<br />
<br />
with reguards to &quot;who wants a 55 sK&quot; the correct answer is :<br />
EVERY NON SK<br />
<br />
poJ is AMAZING pre 60 xp, SKs can solo easily and necros cant because of the pets agroing rats issue. i would get a tell every few min asking if i wanted a partner. think twice before saying no. it ALWAYS helps to make friends with another cleric or enchanter for later down the road. <br />
<br />
i also suggest pumping out run3 and regen3 while youre there pre 60. once you hit 60 alot of its light blue con. i took a break from normal xp while soloing PoJ for a couple days, but did full normal xp while grouped in other zones.</div></div><hr />

<br />
PLAYERAUCTIONS <br />
<br />
It only takes a credit card and any mental midget can buy someone's gimped character on playerauctions. Idiots see that they can't go to the Planes with their lvl 5 Human Monk so they spend their money on a character that can go, and end up /shouting &quot;Help&quot;. <br />
<br />
I saw stuff like it in Karnors the other night. There was a bard who didn't know how to unequip an instrument to do actual melee damage. He just said &quot;I must be really lagged, I'm not hitting anything&quot; while singing Selo's in a group with 3 cursed hands attacking everything. Idiot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
PoP did administer IQ tests for zones, theyre called flags... not every flag is an IQ test but a few of them are, if youre a smart player you get into a guild of other smart players and you kill mobs that let you into the non shithole zones</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lizarde</div><div class="date">01-29-2003, 08:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The n00bs have always been there, at least the ones you are describing.  If you want to see their alts, go to Paludal Caverns.  Corpses strewn all over, constant trains to the exit, where one or two groups are always camped.  Those groups will curse out the people training them, but they won't move an inch, even when they wipe repeatedly from those trains.  And a wipe is the worst, since by the time you get back to the spot 2 minutes later, two more groups have moved in.  Etc etc etc.<br />
<br />
Or go to LoIO or DL or Karnors, and you'll see a lot of the same.  Dead bodies all over, constant trains, KSing and fighting over spawns, /ooc and /tell being spammed to death, and so on.<br />
<br />
It just so happens that the 'leet exp spots' in PoP are the ones that the Gimp Express graduates have moved on to.  Let me guess, these zones now feature a pile of corpses at the GY, constant trains (including through the GY, of course), fighting over spawns, KSing, and an endless stream of utterly retarded /ooc and /shout spam.<br />
<br />
Boy, I'm glad I have friends who are willing to exp in out of the way zones. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Warmaster Xsavuung Llaahh</div><div class="date">01-29-2003, 09:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I saw a (seemingly) girl talking in the market channel about buying accounts. She's saying &quot;you can buy accounts. I've seen them on e-bay. Same a gear and money&quot;. Everyone was like 'ok, but that's not a legal purchase.' She said &quot;it's on E-bay, of course it is!&quot;. Most of us had to EXPLAIN why it was not legal. At first, I thought it was just someone being goofy, but then they were spamming the channel with &quot;I've get 50k, what's good for a bard?&quot; Sickens me to think that I've been playing for 3 years, and have only seen 45k one time, and that was to buy my Windblade. I've never had even close to that at one time in cash. And this person can just go out and buy it with 2grand or whatever and it's OK. But, here's what I think about PoP and anyone UNDER level 58...<br />
<br />
I think it's funny when people complain that PoP is too hard for us soloing types. IT'S DESIGNED FOR THE HIGHER END GAME! Yes, you only have to be 46 to get in, but that doesn't mean you should be able to take a level 46 group there! Jeez, I'm 60 and take a group with me. If I don;t have a group, I go find a spot somewhere else to solo. And there are PLENTY of them, fear kiting including. If you're 55 and complaining you can't get a group in PoP, try being 60 and shouting for an exp group there. The planes USED to be reserved for a raid force. So since the 60+ people can do it with a group, so should a 55 level group, right?? Yeah, ok...<br />
<br />
As far as places to solo, try dungeons. All you need is a snare and enough room to fear. I have found quite a few spots that allow you to fear in circles because of the pathing. You can do chardok in the entrance (or if you're good the exit), and Velks has spots where the mobs run in circles for EVER because of the labyrinthine pathing. All you have to do is find them. They are out there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They've been around for ever.  These are the folks who'se only concern is lvls and 'phat lewt'.  You can always find them in the same place - zones with good exp or loot.  You will almost never find these people in quiet zones, scouting around on their own, spending time helping folks (unless they think the occasion shout of 'lfg' counts has helping).  These are the same people that poison guilds and generally ruin the game.<br />
<br />
They are SUPER easy to avoid though - stay away from the 'exp for idiots' zones. Paludal, Karnors, and PoN seem to be the biggest ones these days.  They are marked, as posted before, by corpses littering the zone, WAY too many usless shouts, people spamming 'lfg', etc.<br />
<br />
I have NO sympathy for folks in these zones, be it the noob themselves or the folks who still choose to hunt there despite the noob.  Don't walk into a chainsaw then bitch you cut yourself.<br />
<br />
There are a million zones out there, all with their charms, be it exp, loot, or just fun.  I will ALWAYS question the 'noobness' of folks who post these types of rants for the simple reason YOU CAN LEAVE THAT ZONE.  Don't want to leave because the exp is good or the loot is extra phat? Then it sounds like you BELONG in a noob zone</div></div><hr />

PoP did administer IQ tests for zones, theyre called flags... not every flag is an IQ test but a few of them are, if youre a smart player you get into a guild of other smart players and you kill mobs that let you into the non shithole zones This is true, however, people still PL twink up and those twinks don't know crap about their class because they didn't have to earn their levels.  They tag their twinks into the guild and drag them along on raids so they can go up and hail an NPC at the end - &quot;WOOT!  Twink_86459456 can now enter HoH or CoD or wherever!&quot;<br />
<br />
Then comes eBay with not just a fully twinked toon like in the &quot;old days&quot;, but a fully twinked toon with flags!<br />
<br />
There should be several requirements to enter any combative PoP zone: (1) Level, (2) Days Played, (3) Flags aquired by raids/tests where requirements 1 and 2 are previously met.</div></div><hr />

Aaoogaa - Not once did anyone say &quot;train&quot;.  Matter of fact, I yelled train when I was trying to exit and a guy messages me saying &quot;Congrats, your the first person Ive ever seen announce a train in this zone&quot;.  <br />

<br />
It's not about playersauctions, or casual V. power gamer.  Its about respect.  <br />
<br />
/gets on soapbox<br />
<br />
There's a huge lack of respect in this game nowadays. Sure, there were always disrespectfull assholes, but it's getting worse. <br />
<br />
No one gives a thought to how their actions effect other people and how they spend their time.  They do what helps themselves only, fuck everyone else.<br />
<br />
For example a few weeks back I was in a group headed to mephits in PoN.  Another group followed us down while we killed everything from the slargs through the hobgoblins and eventually to mephits.  Then they rush up and start killing all the mephits.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mephits r camped ure KS'ing&quot; is what we see.<br />
<br />
They may be semi-correct in accordance to the EULA but thats fucking rude, inconsiderate, and disrespectful.  I wouldn't do that to someone else. I expect the same in return.<br />
<br />
I also had the captain KS'd from me on a BoB quest after I turned in the tools to spawn them.  Within 30 seconds after they've been spawned someone is running away with the giant.  <br />
<br />
I don't train anyone, If I overpull I get out of it of my own accord or I die. I don't run to the zone dumping 5 mobs on some unspuspecting person that is just zoning in or recovering from the last asshole's train.  <br />
But oh no people can't loose their precious KEI's and Virtue's they bought in the nexus so they can make L33T exp. So any zoneline is turned into the nearest amtrak station.<br />
<br />
And I've just barely scratched the surface. <br />
<br />
If you do any of that shit and are reading this. Show some fucking respect. You'd be amazed where it would get you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jupke</div><div class="date">02-04-2003, 10:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Amen  Moongarm.<br />
<br />
Reminds me of velks. <br />
A friend of mine was botting a level 62 cleric from another friend and we were just killing everything on our way up to find a nice spawn when they shout US open. Well off course i shout taking US. Some other group shouts taken US too, but i figured well i am halfway allready, they are at the zone in recovering from the last train they made (also landed on me). So i just continue working slowly up to US, killing everything when all of the sudden i see the other group charging past me, no invis, no nothing, running to US. <br />
So i think what a bunch of assholes and decide to just work my way to CC instead then. But that wasn't thinking of that group that charged past me, cause what would you expect, they charge past me running down now, unloading a train on me.<br />
There cleric died, and that is when i made a big mistake by rezzing it. Cause we were halfway to US again, everything respawned. They come charging past us again (this time with bard invis song) and offcourse they didn't make it and train me again.<br />
<br />
Makes you think to yourself how dumb people can get for a silly shot at a bit of loot, there were 3 groups in velks at that moment, so everything was up.<br />
<br />
So i just ended up that evening in a corner in the middle of velks killing spiders without trains while the training to zone for loot continued.</div></div><hr />

i dont think you understood what i was saying my comments werent about retarded assholes. There were, are, and always will be retarded assholes, my post had nothing to do with the number of them, my post was saying that making PoP zones 58+ OR have XX amount of days played will NOT help ANYTHING, if anything it may make things worse from SOE's point of view(i.e. lose players -&gt;lose money) so if you thought i was saying the number of retards on the loose is going down that is not what i meant at all</div></div><hr />

<br />
After reading your post I realized what I was realy pissed about....&quot;lack of respect from other players.&quot;<br />
<br />
That sums it up.  <br />
<br />
I dont train people and I expect the same from others, yet that is obvioulsy to much to ask.<br />
<br />
I agree that people now days dont give a shit about anyone else.<br />
<br />
The game has changed drasticly from when I first started 3 years ago.  Some for the better some for  the worse.<br />
<br />
I agree with you yet again, that as time progress's there seem to be more and more assholes that dont give a shit about anyone but themselves.<br />
<br />
I would have to say that I learned alot from playing on Rallos Zek before I joined my RL friends on Emarr.<br />
<br />
You do some thing stupid = you get PKed and lose a peice of armor.<br />
<br />
EX: You train the zone = Somone kills you before you zone, or after you zone over.  By by that nice BP you just got.<br />
<br />
- You talk smack OOC = every person in the zone wants to kill you now, and they CAN if they find you.<br />
<br />
I learned to die where no one will be effected by your mobs. (If you train the mobs on a person they will kill you when you come back for your corpse)<br />
<br />
I guess RZ is the school of hard knock's, but its a great leasson in what not to do, which applys to the blue servers also.<br />
<br />
So in the end, what im realy ranting about are the  people that a out for #1 and dont care about others in their EQ community.<br />

How hard is that? not so very hard now. Go to Velketor's Laberinth. Or even try soloing in there by fear kiting the entrance.<br />
<br />
Some times i agree trains suck, but they happen and should always expect them to happen its not like its some fucking kind of idiocy.  Some people do not like to make trains.  I believe u should just stay away from any place that u know they tend to train. like poj or in that damn place called Karnor's Castle. U can try soloing in velks like i said or SolB but dunno how good exp may be there.<br />
<br />
Sk's have FD also, i dont think an sk should ever die due to a train, if you run out of mana before the train hits you well ill tell you that u either try too hard to kill the mob, Don't use right spells, Not enough intel, or the mob may be too hard for your sk to take,  If you're ever going to solo as an sk, always have enough mana for FD. I wouldn't stress that enough for those who lvl their sk so fast and don't know anything about them.<br />

<br />
But, have you been LFG at 55th lvl lately?  <br />
<br />
Prolly not.  <br />
<br />
People dont want anyone under 58 for the planes groups.<br />
<br />
The &quot;solo&quot; spots are over run with campers and folks that train.<br />
<br />
Yeah FD works great....not.  Your 60 you have DP.  <br />
<br />
I still have the shitty old FD.  <br />
<br />
When people train, they dont rain becasue the mobs are easy.  Sorry, but I cant take a beating from (3+) 50+ level mobs that someone trained up from the pit of hell.  <br />
<br />
If Im lucky, my spell casting wont get interrupted and I will get my FD off.  Yet it seems I fail more than I succed when I have a mob pounding the shit out of me.  <br />
<br />
Then I may fail when I hit the ground and die anyway.<br />
<br />
Its never an issue of &quot;I dont have mana to cast FD&quot;, its that I cant get the fucken spell off when given NO notice that someone is pullen a train on my back.<br />
<br />
SO...I dont visit place's like PoJ, Velk's, karnor's.  <br />
<br />
Im not &quot;worthy&quot; of a Planes group, because there are always 10+ 60th+ lvl players looking for a group....ALWAYS.  <br />
<br />
I try to find a place to solo.  <br />
<br />
Lets see...ah first thing to do...check the suggestions here in the hunting grounds forum....<br />
<br />
Ah the Grey, sounds fun....Druids quad kiteing everything in the fucking zone...go back the next day....same fucken thing.<br />
<br />
Next..Katta..I leveled here from 45-49 good xp right.  I can now kill the high end guards near the bank and the graveyard...to many hp's for to little xp gained.  I have to fear each of them 3 times before they die, this is a HUGE mana drain.<br />
<br />
Go back the next day with a shaman, MoFo was there for 2 hours and got a blue and a half.  Yeah, that not gunna work.<br />
<br />
Go to ME, solo the goranga's...great, doin fine.  getting about 1/6th a blue a kill and loven it!  Total mana drain, but at least I can see my Blue bar move after I kill a mob!  Woot!  <br />
<br />
You know whats comen...yeah you guessed it.  Well, tryed it again a few times over the next week...same shit.<br />
<br />
Tryed to get a group in UP and ME so I could get away from the zone lines....not once did I get a group. Had LFG on everytime I went into those zone.  OOC'ed I was LFG...nothing.<br />
<br />
Went to OS, sat in ent. for 1/2 hour LFG, got a group!  Woot!  So happy!  We buff up go in, kill for another 1/2 hour...I get 1/4 a blue...train from no where...dead. <br />
<br />
Invited on a PoG raid for some nice loot and armor.  Cool...  Raid leader tells us to meet inside PoG.  Turns out to be 1 pick up group with no cleric.  Figures before we buff a named unicorn finds us and wipe's our little group...no cleric in group...no cleric in zone...lose 55.<br />
<br />
Went to PoT, LFG up..OOC'ed for 2 fucken hours.  Got a tell from someone's 2 box shaman saying that I will never find a group up here, and that I should go buy another comp and PL up a shaman so I can level.  He said thats what he had to do....<br />
<br />
WTF is up with this shit?<br />
<br />
Oh well, I guess the 55+ game is not for the person that can only dedicate 1/4 of everyday to the game.<br />
<br />
Looking back on the time spent...wow...all that to get to 55 and told that I will never find a group.<br />
<br />
Its not like I havent tryed, Ive been trying for the past month with almost no success.  Ive managed to get 4 blue so far, and in another 5 months I might get 56 at this rate!  Woo Hoo!  UBAH!<br />
<br />
So people tell me to solo while LFG. <br />
<br />
ok please let me in on these excellent solo spots that arent already permacamped/not to hard for the non-twink/that I might acctualy see any kind of yield from 4-6 hours of play.<br />
<br />
I have already exhausted the list in the hunting grounds section.<br />
<br />
Im in no way uber, I have slowly earned all that I have, and I work hard with the time I do have in game. <br />
<br />
Yet my DPS sucks ass, soo this limits the area's where I can effectivly &quot;solo&quot; for decient xp.<br />

Some groups just pick me over a level 60 cause they know me. Ok i will admit, if nobody is online when i am LFGing, it will take ages for me to get a group. <br />
And not much ppl that know me by now cause i have been soloing for ages, but it's getting better and better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I went to PoJ last night for the 6th time, the zone was dead!  Had a great time!  No one around to mess things up.<br />
<br />
Hope to do same tonight...wonder how long my luck will hold out.<br />
