<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>shortfoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Wondering if you can do fights out of order, can you kill one sk, do the end boss mob, come back and do wailing sister, get breeder, etc?  Or do you have do do them in order?  If you do have to do any in order, which?  Thanks :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zorndike</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well it is said in a few areas  i think and my own experiance you cant do any of the epic mobs out of order.  Starting with the Wailing Wraith and beyond the Mobs only activate if hailed by a &quot;Flaged SK&quot; for that event.<br />
<br />
Meaning if SK A, who has not done the sheath yet, trys hailing The Wailing Wraith.  the wraith does not respond and you cant kill.<br />
<br />
Senario B.  Flaged SK B for the WAiling wraith encounter activtes the wraith and the group kills it.  SK A, who isnt flaged for the encounter, cant loot the items because of coding Sony put in.<br />
<br />
Thus you HAVE to do it order.  Only notable exception is that you can Part 1 (if you dont have epic 1 yet) and Part 3 (gathering the stuff for the sheath) in any order and at any time.  BUT, you cant hand the Sheath in untill you have completed the first 2 Parts.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Baaguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">On the other hand, all sorts of little hidden flags have been fooked up lately and causing items to be unlootable =(</div></div><hr />

<br />
he isnt one of the mobs you have to hail to activate?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xtill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I killed him as one of my first mobs before doing any other parts of the epic. You do not have to hail him to activate him. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Moardok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Have killed Fragga he can be engaged by anyone any class..for those that are doing the side quest to get the 1.0 out the way. You do have to hail Ritald in Dulak an go through the text to be able to engage Captain, but up until the Wailling siter i do beleive the egg,hide,essence,drop from oldain,frogga, and the drop from PoG can be done at anytime. If anyone knows if the 4 Sk's can be engaged an lootable out of order Let me know ..Thanks</div></div><hr />
