<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am working on my faction for the Greenmist and have collected about 2000 bone chips.  I went to trooper Mozo, and started the turn in.  You can give him 4 stacks of 4 bone chips at a time, if I read the walk though correctly.  Three out of for of the messages I got after giving them to him said &quot;I do not see the 4 bone chips you gave me&quot; ...or some thing very similar.  Has anyone seen this before?<br />
<br />
-Thanks<br />

skip the bone chips do the explorer knives, went to kos with all but troopers to amible with everyone but the residents in a few hours<br />
<br />

<br />
btw had to do explorer knives again for the lord of pain's quest (still not done with that frelling quest) the turn in slave is on resident faction<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>mand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">No, this is my first quest...only every played to grind/level.  I must have misunderstood the walk though on it.  thanks for the info<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>HodorOgre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Actually I bought ~1800 bone chips in the bazaar last night and headed over to Trooper Mozo for some faction. I'd already read this thread and was aware of the explorer knives option, but I'd never tried that and figured I'd go down this road first. My thinking was that buying my way into Cabilis via the bazaar should be faster than farming explorer knives.<br />
<br />
Now that I've done a little of both, I'm not so sure. The explorer knives does seem to be the way to go, especially if the numbers posted elsewhere are correct.<br />
<br />
What I wanted to mention is that it appears you can no longer hand Mozo stacks of bone chips. I think that's what the original poster was trying to say. You used to be able to hand him 4 stacks of 4, but this is no longer the case. You only get one quest completion if you do this. I don't know when this changed, as it's been a long time since I did any quest like this, too.<br />
<br />
So I handed over ~1800 bone chips, 4 at a time, unstacked. It took me about an hour to do that (what with newbies occasionally bringing in mobs, standing in my way, etc), and now I have &quot;tradeskill elbow.&quot;  My faction with Crusader Bodil went from scowls to glares. <br />
<br />
I did want to mention that though I am KOS to the crusaders, I stood in the corner next to Mozo, as far back as I could get from the path of the crusaders, and they never once aggroed me.<br />
<br />
After that, I went to try out the explorer knives. This was far, far more enjoyable, so even if it takes me days to farm enough knives to get the lizards to love me, I think I prefer it to the drudgery of handing in 4 bone chips over and over, forever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kuvak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have never made a focused effort to raise Cabilis faction, and yet now I am not KOS to any faction there that I know of (guards are warmly and crusaders are dubious). Here's how I did it:<br />
<br />
Hunt in Veksar, collecting all the steel weapons you can find. When done collecting a few bags full of them, run back out of Veksar to LOIO and there's a guy along the western shore of the Lake that takes them in sets of four. Turn in to him for faction, coin and exp. I did that for about 3 levels (from 60 to 63) and am now non-KOS everywhere. I don't consider this out of my way at all, because I was hunting in Veksar for exp and fun not faction, and just discovered the faction quest later and it turns out the exp it gives you isn't that bad either (I think I average about 1% of exp for a full complement of weapons (ie. about 50 weapons). Granted you can only do this if you can hunt in Veksar, but I think it's a very reasonable quest. I hadn't really planned on doing my Greenmist (have epic already) but considering I have this easy way to get the faction, I am seriously considering the Greenmist someday when I get bored.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kuvak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">No, not regular Fine Steel. Only the ones that drop in Veksar. They are just called &quot;steel ????&quot;. No turn-ins I know of take FS weapons.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>only1erbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">ok thx :) seems i have a faction issue i am dubious to lord gikzic and he wont give me my bag ... Id kill him im so mad but i would loose so think ill just complain about it instead lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Valdarie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">the turn in slave is on resident faction<br />
<br />
Yet Illias says the enslaved iksar is on Scaled Mystics and Legion of Cabilis.<br />
<br />
Another interesting thing is that Illias says that Alchemist Granika is on Scaled Mystics and Legion of Cabilis and while he is only indifferent to me, the enslaved iksar is scowling..so perhaps he is on Residents as well.<br />
<br />
Can anyone confirm that he is on Resident faction?</div></div><hr />
