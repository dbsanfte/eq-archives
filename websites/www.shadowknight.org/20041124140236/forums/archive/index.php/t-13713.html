<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kilkalae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Think about it. Our FD takes 1 second to cast, has a chance to fizzle, get interrupted, or the most frustrating one of all, &quot;spell recovery time not met&quot;. If they would make it so that we had an instant recast time I think that would make up for this, and help us to be better pullers. What do you all think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ganaith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Start a monk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rhowne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Monks don't get insta-recast, though they do get rapid-feign.  Spells have a default 2.25 seconds (or around that amount) to reset regardless of the spell's refresh time.  An insta-recast FD would result in more &quot;Spell recovery time not met&quot; messages, not fewer.  A 4 second refresh for Death Peace is fine by me, we can usually take the punishment those 4 seconds require.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Drakonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Only problem I have with pulling right now is pathing warps... FD a mob too many times and it warps on your head... if this mob happens to be (in my case recently) say the Ragelord from Fennin event, you're kind of screwed...<br />
<br />
Only thing is I can't really think of much of a solution to it... can't really give us insta cast FD or insta refresh FD or anything like that... /boggle</div></div><hr />
