<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ogrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all,<br />
<br />
Just a question as to what skill I should be shooting for:<br />
<br />
Currently I have:<br />
RS3, Innate Regen 3, CF1, SCF1, ND1, CS1, CA1, FB1 and ToL1<br />
<br />
and 4 unspent aa's....<br />
<br />
What would be the best ability to go for now? was thinking SCF2 or waiting an aa for PE - any help appreciated. Thanks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Since you've gotten CA, CS, and ND I would go for PE.  It's a great upgrade when you have the other three and you are only one aa away from having it. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">After getting PE, you'd probably be best off choosing a focus route.  Like SCF+ToL+SA, or CA+CS+ND+PD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Apokx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Before getting anything,finish maxing CS,CA and ND..<br />
<br />
Putting one rank into everything isnt really helping.<br />
<br />
Then PE,Lightning Reflexes.Planar Durability...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Saveaux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">SCF3 &gt; All others</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Elysea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I don't think you can beat Theft of Life, for the price.  If you've got ToL1, you can max it out for 5 more AAs.  Just my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Get PE since you have 1 level of everything, then decide if you want to go offensive (SCF3, SA3, ToL3) or defensive (CA3, CS3, ND3).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nwaado</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">From where you're at I would get SCF3 and ND3 done next, in whichever order you prefer. I'd say those two are our most powerful archtypes.<br />
<br />
And to the above poster I wouldn't call SCF3, SA3 and ToL3 just offensive as there are very nice defensive gains here as well. I would get those before moving on with CA and CS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ogrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well, I ended up getting PE - and noticed a nice reduction in damage I was taking. AA's well spent... Now to decide between the tap line of aa's (SCF, SA and ToL) or go with more defensive aa's (ND, CS and CA)... Decisions, decisions... god I love AA's :)</div></div><hr />
