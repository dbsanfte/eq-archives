<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kritr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As I have been thinking in balance, after playing this toon for two years I still have to scratch my head and think what is this balance about. <br />
<br />
This comes to mind:<br />
<br />
Warriors = preferred tanks.<br />
<br />
Clearics = healers, rezzers / excellent.<br />
<br />
<br />
Chanters= Cc, makes us laugh with their illusions.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Rangers= Excellent dps, fine trackers, excellent pullers.<br />
<br />
<br />
Wizzards= ton of dps, TL in raids.<br />
<br />
<br />
Druids= Excellent for a taxi service, good dps, can spot heal and actually do a decent job when there are no clerics available.<br />
<br />
Mages= Excellent dps, feeds others with different toys for pets, etc. Awsome pet.<br />
<br />
<br />
Bards= mana battery, excellent  at pulling, can use melee,.<br />
<br />
<br />
Bst= good damage, nice cc-especially if not chanter, nice kick ass pets, heal if needed. <br />
<br />
Rogue= Unequal camouflage, great at pick lock, kick ass back stabs/ dps.<br />
<br />
Necros= excellent dps, mana feeders, not to mention their 93 % necro rez, summon corpses, bone chips, excellent pets, wake the dead.<br />
<br />
Can not comment on the new added class yet , the Bezerker.<br />
<br />
Will not mention pallys as we are similar ends of the spectrum.<br />
<br />
<br />
All these classes have a role, unique to them and really will benefit the group if present in their special ways.<br />
<br />
Now aside from being an &quot;Utility Tank&quot;, as some one in this board has called us, and having a bit of other classes what is is that makes us special or needed? <br />
Now consider the whole spectrum form level 0-65 and beyond. <br />
That is what I am talking about.<br />
<br />
There are some prima donnas that think balance is for &quot;high level SK&quot;, GOD- Elemental only  SKs.  I think as the word balance means to me this is for all not only a few at the top of the game.<br />
<br />
For me balance is just that balance. Both sides of the equation are equal. <br />
<br />
Now after playing this toon for this long what is it that I bring to the group, or raid that is special to an SK?<br />
<br />
Hmmm..... not sure. Need to think about this and really can not come with any real answer. Comes to mind my tanking abilities in groups with my aggro generation made me feel somewhat needed, different. Now the pure melees get their upgrades and now we as SK are left behind.<br />
<br />
 He he, I will have to keep thinking harder on what is is that makes me different from others that brings that special, you are good for your contribution to our group/ raid, and I am still thinking. <br />
<br />
Suggestions that I have mentioned and will repeat in a more serious tone here are: <br />
<br />
<br />
1. Make a disarm that works well for us.<br />
<br />
2. Improve hiding - invisibility so we can at least go places, be more efficient at CR and can help group. Makle the Shadow  part of the shadowknight mean something. The way it is when you use your hot key invisibility, you move and invisivility is gone. If there is a way to keep this on while on the move , I am not aware of it.<br />
<br />
3. Give us some type of lull/ pacify so we can be balanced with monks at pulling.<br />
<br />
4. Make the FD a hot key so we can save a spell slot.<br />
<br />
5. Need HT time refresher shorter.<br />
<br />
6. Be able to upgrade the lower end spells that at the higher end of the game really are not needed. In this regard the spells can be upgraded or make new spells for the higher level SK. <br />
<br />
7.  Improve our DD, certainly not as good as the pure casters but make it better than 600. This is okay for lower levels, but as progression in the game goes on this is just a drop in the buckett.<br />
<br />
<br />
8. Make more SK/ Pally drops only that will benefit this hybrids and not have to share them with pure melee. For example I really do not see the point in giving mana generating weap to warriors or monks.<br />
<br />
<br />
9. Improve the SCS to be activated.<br />
<br />
<br />
10. Improve/ ugrade the finishing blow type of AA to be able to use at higher levels of the game.<br />
<br />
<br />
11. Need some special use to the raid or group and this could be be a better warrior capable of being a tanking force on its own.<br />
This should be accomplish though a quest or AA, not just given.<br />
<br />
<br />
12. Make a special only SK ability like the Vampire kiss  where you can kill the mob in one shot, like when his Hp is 50 %. Sort of a disc that will be on a timer. Like every 30 min.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
13. Have better ways to upgrade gear that does not mean you have to go to 40 adventures to obtain one piece of gear.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
There is more but I am running short in time. Will continue with  my thoughts later.<br />
<br />
By the way there are some Prima Donna Sk that have their issues with GOD and think they know it all. Then those SK should refrain from saying anything as they are just to damn good for the lower tier guys like me. <br />
<br />
This thread is mainly for the SK that want a balance for the class as a whole<br />
from level  0 to as high as you can get. <br />
<br />
People that are extremely good, know all kinds of statistics, have uber gear and are elite, make your own threads.<br />

<br />
Why add balance at a point in the game where it's not needed and fairly close to balanced. <br />
Later <br />
Sith</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kritr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think that if the balance starts early in the earlier stages of the game the unbalance would not be so bad.<br />
<br />
I think SOE had no idea when the made the SK what was going to happen to this class.  At one point there were penalties imposed on us. That is gone. <br />
<br />
I just can not get the idea behind given away useless AA points, spells or weapons to SK or any class that can not be used at a later stage and has no way to improve.<br />
<br />
I am still trying to figure out why is it that Disarm is good for.<br />
I am perplex on a hot key for hide, that if I move it stops working.<br />
When the epic was desingned, I continue to wonder what was the purpose of spending this much time on it the end result is not good for a higher level knight, when he can get better weapons without that much hassle. I suppose that is a pride thing for the Sks that finish the quest and a fun quest. That is about all I can think for the time that was invested on it.<br />
<br />
At this point I have 614 AA and would be interesting when done with all the Gates AA if when I finally reach the elementals, missing RZ if it will make any difference. So far have weapon affinity, improved bashing and almost done with stun bash and would be intersting to know how will these AA will work once my gear is upgraded either with ldon or elemental gear. <br />
Lots of questions in this AA department. <br />
I have tried to talk to GM's in the past on matters of AA, gear and the answer was that they were not going to reveal their secrets. <br />
<br />
So once the gear starts rolling will have a different story to tell, probably a change of opinions.<br />
<br />
Then I will continue to debate and think what is that can make an Sk that special, besides a second fiddle tank and a no good caster. I do not have an answer for this. <br />
What I thought made us special at one time, was our aggro capabilities, especially in small groups. Now the warriors, pure melee got their wishes, they are better at it and we are...? Okay I am lost on where we are but certainly not balanced.<br />

Hit a mezzed mob with it prior to taunting, taunt will work more often if you're on the mobs hate list (doesn't always work on a success otherwise)<br />
<br />
I am perplex on a hot key for hide, that if I move it stops working.<br />
<br />
Afking, killing pets, hide questing (no longer in game)<br />

Was the best weapon aviable at the time by a large margin, same was true for other melees epics.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
<br />
Where I am at in the game(Ssra, just breaking into VT point), I have no problem out aggroing any warm in my guild or that I find myself in a pick up group with. Since you are bringing aggro as a balance issue at lower end point in the game, I gotta ask. Why can't you hold aggro? Because that gap sure as hell is there at this point in the game.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kritr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Brael that is my point. Things were done in the past that are obsolete, I can not use, unless I just want to mess around for fun.<br />
<br />
<br />
I do know the epic was good at one time.<br />
<br />
Need new ideas that can make the SK special. That is what I am trying to think, search, in a balanced way without stepping in others toes. I do not think the SK needs to be superior but equal in its own special way.<br />
<br />
As I said I do not have an answer. I am searching for it. Every night I play I think of a way, but that still eludes me. I think that maybe I am having just to much fun playing and my mind just stops being serious. <br />
<br />
 I will never be a game designer, hehe....''<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh and Sil I can hold aggro well. What I am saying is the warriors were not that good at it and now are better, close to us. So what is what I will get to balance what they got? That is the question. They got better aggro. What is my wish? What I would like SOE to do to balance this situation when they gave upgrades to the melees because what they got broke the unbalanced -balance even more.<br />

<br />
What they was a level of balance for problem tied to there class.  For the common exping, low end raiding SK/paladin there nothing we need for balance when it comes to tanking. Most exp group skill prefer us to wars because aggro is better (The difference is now a warrior aren't a cruch for the group).  We don't need anything to balance what war's got.<br />

Warriors are now all upset cuz some of us want to tank Raid mobs, they had no problem asking for our aggro. Balance is the issue, not what they got, or whether they deserved it. If they get better aggro then I get better tanking. By the way what you are saying if for groups. I am talking about raids. I yet to see an SK tanking any Raid mobs, by us, the so called low SK. <br />

First it's Sith not sil (where the hell do you get that from?)<br />
<br />
The melee balancing patch was based around fixing a problem in game balance. By default we got unhooked disciples due to working of the disc system. <br />
<br />
We didn't get anything because(i'll spell this out real slowly for you) W-E  D-I-D-N-O-T  N-E-E-D  A-N-Y-T-H-I-N-G!<br />
<br />
Sure there are improvements/upgrades we would like, but balance is of need not want. <br />
<br />
Are spellbook isn't that bad off. Also I tank on raid all the time, granted mostly add's, but every now and then I somehow manage to get a boss in.<br />
 <br />
The balance issue being discussed is  about high end balance issue that have turn up in in the new expansion.<br />

<br />
Seems to me that rudness is sort of the way to go here. <br />
<br />
Rudeness and name calling keeps following this game everywhere I go. But that is another subject.<br />
<br />
I am very thankful  for you correcting me.<br />
<br />
<br />
That is your opinion and I hope you are very happy with it.<br />
<br />
In my opinion I am going to spell it for you <br />
<br />
W-E A-R-E N-O-T B-A-L-A-N-C-E-D... HOPE YOU CAN READ THIS.<br />
<br />
<br />
You like our spell book. I think it sucks. I have aggro but I think should be better. I should have more damage with my spells. I should be, if I want to, be able to  make my toon better at tanking big-raid mobs. I am not going to take it like it is without saying my point of view just because you like it that way, or just because someone says I should be an utility tank.<br />
<br />
If we are balanced then:<br />
  <br />
#1. What is the logical mathematical method that this balance comes from?<br />
<br />
Is there a manuscript with rules  that explains balance?<br />
<br />
Where are the rules and I would like to see tables on this so called balance so I can get a visualization of this issue?<br />
I do not want to see just opinions.<br />
<br />
If there are rules they can be changed. <br />
<br />
#2. What makes it balanced when I play second fiddle tank and can not progress as a tank. Is that balance? Or is that just accepting the second fiddle &quot;utility tank&quot;?<br />
<br />
#3. You think that our spell book is just great. I know Sk's that do not agree on this. Read A Kz on for example Voice of Thule, Voice of Terris. How good is this spell and how much aggro it generates? Is there any difference among them? Is this difference adequate? As of my last browsing in AK there were some peeps that said they were not even going to buy or get Voice of Thule as it was a waste.  <br />
What this has to do with balance? If the problems that the warriors had with the aggro was addressed this issue with the Voice line of spells has to be addressed not ignored.<br />
<br />
Our cast disease, magic resistance, and line of terror spells, just about as useless as I can think of.<br />
<br />
Our undead line of spells, another joke. The Ldon undead version spell upgrade another waste of time and effort. Sorry this is not balance to me. Wow the cleric undead is better and they are healers!<br />
<br />
Mezz undead... Ha, maybe used at some point in the game, probably in the past.<br />
<br />
SCS,  there is another. This needs to be activated. The way it is if I buy this AA it makes me nerf myself.<br />
To fix a few of these problems makes balance. <br />
<br />
I am happy playing my Sk, actually I am pretty good at it. But I think several things need to be addressed if you want to implement fairness.<br />
<br />
My Banshee Aura spell getting erased by Shields from Druids and mages. Is that balance?<br />
<br />
Actually all of the shields/ mitigation  we have are totally useless at least where I am playing the most now that is SOl ro. Not sure about SSRA, as I have not been there too much. <br />
<br />
Using Peridots for Diamond skin is a  totally ludicrous way of thinking buy SOE. Diamond skin  spell I could use if I was in DL, maybe if I go back to Neriak forest, but certainly not sol ro where I am spending most of my time now.<br />
<br />
Monks can lull and have become better pullers. We are still using FD and nothing has been added to make me equally good. Is this balance?<br />
<br />
Boy if you call  the way things are balanced, then I need to go back to the dictionary and contemplate for several hours on what is balance.<br />
<br />
Balance, keeping equality means to me:<br />
                  ac=b<br />
                  c=b/a<br />
<br />
This is a balanced equation.<br />

To his warrior Roommate. <br />
<br />
Your answers basically show what you are, a warrior. You do not care or are ignorant  at all of the balancing issue. So your answers are a reflextion of your ignorance.<br />
<br />
<br />
Let me start by saying that this is about balance. I already said that a spell book that does not work is not balanced. How can it be possible that spells that I can not use at my level be helpful to me.? We need to upgrade what we have or have another set of spells that will work and make sense for our level. Certalinly for a warrior like you this does not make any sense, as you do not use any spells.<br />
<br />
All that I mentioned above are just thoughts on what would make an SK special. I am not going to repeat what I said on other classes, you can read that post. So yes disarm would be something that could make an SK different. It does  not matter if it makes sense to you. Like I am sure it was important improving your aggro, as your aggro before the upgrade was pretty pathetic.<br />
<br />
<br />
Improve hiding. Why not? Shadowknight... the knight that works in the shadows. That sounds cool. I did not said like a Rogue. That is what your one trak, narrow brain like your thinks. By the way we already hide, Gather Shadows and IVU. <br />
<br />
<br />
I would like some way to pacify the mobs that I pull and use this with my FD. Hey you are a warrior and of course you use a bow, doh. You do not FD. Warriors are shitty pullers to beging with unless the group does not mind you training the camp. But you are a warrior, what other comment can anyone expect?<br />
By the way I am not bitching, that is what your poor brain thinks. <br />
<br />
Let me repeat, I am just tossing ideas to make the SK different, unique,  as you warriors are so scared by SK thinking, not to say try to become as good as you in Raid -mob tanking. <br />
<br />
<br />
Why not have a hot key for FD? I use FD all the time during pulling.<br />
Again you seem to have a restricted mind. But again you are a warrior. So you are forgiven for your lack of knowledge.<br />
<br />
<br />
Need to HT time refreser that is shorter. Okay this is a good one. When you have a mob that has tons of HP, 9k one time hit is a drop in the buckett. Nothing. I hit my 7-8 k tonite doing MM and I did not see his HP go anywhere. But certainly again you can not make a comment here as you do not know how the HT does work. <br />
I keep reminding you I am talking on some sort of quality that will make the SK special. <br />
I do not think that making a HT timer lets say of 20 min is going to put the warrior out of commission.   <br />
 <br />
Your comments on me wanting more spells, continue to show your lack of knowledge of the SK. Look my spells do not work for my level, at the places I play. I am playing a lot in Sol RO. I have no idea where do you play as a warrior but I am yet to see any mob being feared and take off running anywhere in sol ro. That is just an example. The majority of the spells I already have are useless to me. Putting spells like Cloak of Akeva in an ornate armor makes no sense when I already have COL.<br />
<br />
Telling me to be play a caster or for me to become a warrior one more time shows your unidirectional mentality, you poor soul.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ah so you make comments of my magnificent DD spell that does a damage of 600. OMG, such a large damage! This only tickles the mobs in Sol ro. I am certain that,  for the GODs in the elementals, Time etc 600 damage is nothing, and by the way for such a minor damage it really sucks my mana. My level 65 cleric can damage for 1100 and 2200 and it barely touches his mana... I must mention that my cleric does not have the AA to improve his  numbers with spell casting fury, and he rocks.<br />
Oh, I aready have a robe, I have a cleric. <br />
He is level 65 and has 313 AA.<br />
So I still do not think giving me a DD of 1200-1500 is  stepping in anyones' toes as the mages, druids, wizzys do much more  damage than that. By the way our DD is resisted in higher level play. So not only is a low DD, it does not work some of the times.<br />
<br />
<br />
On making  warrior. Well I am going to confess. My son made a warrior. I am not in the mood to start another. <br />
<br />
I love my SK. I am talking here of improving my SK,  not changing my class.<br />
<br />
Improve / upgrade the finishing blow. You say only if warriors upgrade too...<br />
<br />
This is the most laughable of all your comments. Now warriors got an upgrade and  the  warrior's opinon is that that was okay. Forget that you as a warrior already stepped  on my aggro neck of the woods. Warriors thought the had a right in the name of &quot;Balance&quot; to get this. At no point I have heard anyone suggest lets give the SK something in return.<br />
<br />
Like for example:<br />
Why not change  the Voice  spell series a better aggro generator for SK and maybe the Voice of Terris 15 % and the Voice of Thule 25 %? Now that would have been some trade off. I would think about that. <br />
<br />
So if nothing was done when the warriors got into our territory, what makes you beleive that if we get  an upgrade on finishing blow you warriors should get it?<br />
<br />
Again I want to be sure you do not lose your train of thougth. All I am saying is let's do this change to make the SK special, unique, wanted. Something that no one  else has. So why would I like to share this? No way warriors would get the upgrade. You are already the only tanks in the big raids. You do not need any more.<br />
<br />
Vampire Kiss: just an idea to make SK special. Do not go any further. Who cares if my Vampire kiss takes 1000 Hp off the mob? Again that is nothing in higher level play.<br />
You warriors already are the big boys in the raids. Do you want more?<br />
<br />
Ldon 40 adventures for one piece. Maybe you are in an Uber guild with lots of Prima Donna friends that helped you get to where you are. Maybe you are in one of those conceded guilds types that think they are so special that they walk on water. <br />
Maybe you are e-bay. Maybe some one PL you.<br />
<br />
But let me say some people work for a living and I happen to be one of those. So It is a little exessive to me to have to do 40 adventures for one piece of equipment. I am assuming I win them all. Assuming that I am in a super good group let me see, finish the adventures in 30 min, now that is kicking ass groups, that means I would have to spend 20 hours to get the one piece. <br />
<br />
Now where does that leaves me when our guild raids every night?<br />
<br />
I guess I would then have to spend 20 hours Saturday- Sunday to be able to get that only one piece. So I would have to get up lets say at  8 am play till 6 pm, go raiding at 6 pm that is when my guild starts raids. Then I will raid all night. Wow I guess my wife will love this to death.! Probably I will end up in divorce court but damn, I can then say, I got that only one piece of equipment that you say I need to work hard for.<br />
<br />
You say working for something really sucks. I am not sure what do you mean and what kind of comment is this. <br />
But having played this toon for almost 2 years, no help, no uber guilds, no special friends and working my ass to get here is not what I would call a walk in the park. Tonite I Blinged  My AA 618 maxing  my  stunning bash AA. <br />
So bro do not make ignorant comments like this about someone you do not know. It just shows your prejudicial, ignorant type of mentality.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now your last comment on NO YOU CAN NOT BE GODLY!<br />
<br />
What is that? You think that my personal search for a special trait for SK will make me a GOD? Wow! You are a very confused  person.  I hope you are going to school and pay attention to your teachers. I think you need it.<br />
<br />
He he.. <br />
<br />
enuff of this ranting. <br />
<br />
Ah and Brael, What side are you on? Just curioius. Not that it really matters.<br />

Certalinly for a warrior like you this does not make any sense, as you do not use any spells. <br />
<br />
Ever think that I might play something other than a warrior? True, warrior is my main, but I also have a necro and, low and behold, an SK. Wow.  Your spells fit your class. You are not meant to be a chain caster. You are not meant to DoT like a necro, nuke like a wizzy, etc etc. You are meant to take hits, deal out melee dps, and throw the occasional DoT,debuff,nuke. Deal with it. You have Terror and Voice spells for aggro control. You think other classes want those? Hell ya. Your spells, minus a few stacking issues, are fine. <br />

Like I am sure it was important improving your aggro, as your aggro before the upgrade was pretty pathetic. <br />
<br />
 Ya know why disarm doesnt work well for you? Cause SKs have a skill cap at 70 for it. Warriors have 200. Maybe up the skill cap for SKs, sure, I can see that.   <br />

 You said you wanted to hide and still be able to move. Guess what, rogues have that and its called sneak. So yes, you are basicly asking for Sneak and Hide like a rogue has.<br />

By the way I am not bitching, that is what your poor brain thinks. <br />
<br />
Sks get pacify and monks and bards no longer are viewed as pullers. Guess which two classes start bitching? Besides, SKs , in my experience, are better pullers than monks or bards. One major reason for this, Higher HP/AC. Ive seen SKs pull shit that monks wont touch. You aren't asking to &quot;on par&quot; with monks/bards, you are asking to be superior.<br />

I am not scared of SKs or Pallys for that fact taking my role as tank. In single group encounters, Warrior/SK/Pally all should be able to tank well. Raid encounters on the otherhand, should be 60% Warrior tanks, 40% SK Pally (ie Time Cazic).<br />

Again you seem to have a restricted mind. But again you are a warrior. So you are forgiven for your lack of knowledge.  <br />
<br />
Haha, you're funny. Why not have an FD hotkey? Well for one SKs get FD mainly because necros have it. Monks have an FD hotkey because A. its a skill and B. they dont cast. If you want an FD hotkey, then it needs to be a skill that monks have a higher cap at. Its only fair.<br />

 I do know how HT works thank you very much. 9k unresistable one time hit drop in the bucket? Are you crazy? The best wizard nuke out there that I know of is Strike of Solusek. With Focus effects and the right AAs this can crit for 6k. It costs 640 mana, 8sec casting time, and can be resisted. You can do 9k, instant, no mana, unresistable dd and you want the timer shorter? Why? So the SK can be special? Tell me another class that gets HT. Guess what, only SKs get it. That makes them special. This is not about you wanting the SKs to be &quot;balanced&quot;. This about you wanting to reach out and touch every goddam MoB you fight. How can you be so stupid? O, and the disc required to make HT deal that much of damage are just over an hour refresh. You want that shortened too?<br />

I agree putting CoA on ornate armor was stupid. As to your comment on fear not working, well duh. DO you really think you can just go &quot;Booga Booga&quot; to a 55+ plus mob and see them run screaming in terror? Terror/Voice/Lifetap DoT/Spears/Lifetaps/Selfbuffs/Minor debuffs may not be the best spells out there, but they are hardly useless. <br />

Black Steel - 1400, Lv63<br />

The SK's are unique and special. They're just not the powerhouses you want them to be. And besides, giving SKs all the crap you've asked for messes up the balance of the tanks classes something fierce. So, in return, Warriors and Paladins would need massive upgrades too. Ever think about the effect these ideas would have to other classes or to the gameplay itself? No, I doubt it. <br />

 You're idea was for an out right kill blow when a mob was at 50% and you think that doesnt affect higher level play? Quarm at 50%, BAM, okay lets loot. Jesus Lap Dancing Christ are you really this big of a moron? Now you change it to take off 1000hp and, I assume, give it to you? Either way, HT DOES THAT AND DOES IT BETTER DUMBFUCK!<br />

I hate to tell you this, but HT can be resisted.  It's nothing more than a manaless nuke.  If not decreasing the reuse timer, then an AA that reduces the resistability of HT would make things a little more even on the damage output front.  <br />
<br />
Now, on the issue of taking hits.  With the extra mitigation that Warriors got as a result of the melee balancing, they've gotten a significant upgrade in the amount of punishment they can take.  I won't go into details on that, though.  The subject has been hashed and parsed ad nauseum.  The point is, as a knight, I have to say that I'm a tad worried that we're being frozen out of high end content, probably not by conscience intent, but by unintended consequences.<br />

I am just too tired now to respond to them are they are just your point of wiew but is okay, after all they are your thoughts.<br />
If you think that being inferior with inferior spells I can not use anywhere else but a lower levels, well I can not change your shitty ideas. Let's keep it that way, I guess you will always be a moron.<br />
<br />
I was doing Agnarr last night and we were just having a great time doing him. I used my HT on the second floor big boss.  When I hit him for4 8216, of course that was just nothing. One time shot, to be done again in one hour. <br />
<br />
Ha ha, we did so good that in about 25 min we were killing Agnarr, then killed his named after that. They were being Kitted by the Rangers. Okay I had no HT to use again. As I already used it. <br />
So do not tell me that such a long time is a big deal, or justified. It is balance and fairness and it is just too bad that you want to keep the SK at the botton, cuz it is all just fine and swell. NO IT IS NOT. I should have been able to HT Agnarr and I could not, you dim wit. <br />
<br />
Interesting enough a druid friend of mine told last nite that there are some new spells for SK to improve our aggro. They, supposedly were added as we are loosing in the field of aggro department. Told me to go to Fungus Grove to find them. I will do a search on this and two things will be evident here # 1. The druid is confused and did not tell me the truth, # 2 . The druid and others have noticed the we did lose in the aggro department to the warriors. So this is not in my imagination. Warriors getting an fix, and SK left behind IS NOT BALANCE.<br />
<br />
<br />
I am glad that you play an SK, but I think you are not to fond of him or you are certainly bad, ignorant on his role.<br />
<br />
I guess you are so ignorant, and one sided, pardon the repetition, that keep insisting in ignoring my statements. <br />
I said about Disarm, Hide, FD-hot key, and others are debatable, ideas on how to make us special. I did not made this thread to discuss on how to implement them so not to step on other's toes, Just tossed an idea on what could be fixed to give the SK an unique role as you warriors have a monopoly on taking the big mobs, and want no others to touch your possesion.<br />
<br />
I am going to repeat make us  something special. This means no one else has in this way. Then I would be able to have my own special contribution to a group or raid. It would have been nice if I could have hit Agnar again with my  one time HT, that by the way was nothing, considering his innate HP. That would have been my contribution to the raid. Not only one time at the second floor and wait for another 60 min to do again.<br />
In the fast paced minis in sol ro it would be nice to be able to use HT more often.<br />
<br />
You telling me that I should be contempt with my useless line of spells, for my level and areas that I am playing just shows your extremely narrow mind. I can not go there any more as you think you know it all. I am sure SOE, if they want to keep SK happy and up to par in the game will have to do something about this or I will be as usual the only SK in a raid of 72. So sad to see, one sk and 4 pally were in a raid of 72. Possibly this can be fixed or we as a class are going to be obsolete.<br />
<br />
Ah, Chain casting. I think this is an AA in Gates. You are wrong again dude. I guess SOE answered that one for ya.<br />
<br />
You are not scared of SK, well at least you want me to fill me up with mediocre spells and keep the me in second, maybe third place in the field.<br />
<br />
<br />
Monks and bards will no longer be seen as pullers, cuz I get a pacify that will allow me to single pull. Now that is one of the most stupid things you have said so far. The best puller I have seen is a bard, this just happened a few days ago in sol ro. He had a mob waiting for me after the one I was tanking was over. Kill one, next was right there. He can slow pacify, run fast, he is in my opinion the best puller in this game, followed by monks and rangers. I really do not see how it is possible for me an SK to pacify to bring one mob to camp is going to damage their already gained  abilites. Monks are great tanks. At times a monk was tanking one mob and I was tanking the other, we both did a great job. Should I be offended cuz the monk can be a tank like me when needed? No, I welcomed his tanking abilities, he saved my day and the exp went up faster as we both could tank. Let me tell you when I was doing the POJ trials a monk was the MT, yes a monk. Hey in that group I was so happy he was tanking. He kicked ass, one of the best monks I have ever seen. Was I jelous, not a bit. I was happy that he was doing such a great job.<br />
So if I am okay with monks being good tanks why should monks be upset for me to get a pacify, when there are already other classes that can do the same? I am sorry, I just do not follow, aggree with you trying to squezze me to the bottom of the game.<br />
<br />
There is no way I will damage a monk as I can pacify as he can. I mean when the monks were able to use their pacify, did the bards, clerics, rangers, got up in arms and told them that they could not do this as they were the sole owners of this particular trait? Maybe these other classes are not as possesive as you are and do not mind sharing their skills a bit.<br />
<br />
Although I can explain your thinking, you are the kind of person that thinks is okay for warrior to gain aggro in single groups, as this needed to be improved, but SK ... we need nothing. Your mind is sick man.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well let me see you are not that stupid after all you at least aggree that putting COA in ornate armor is not good and SCS needs to be activated. Okay that is good, so I give you a little star for tha one. HE HE....<br />
Oh, another little star, we need to improve or disarm cap of 70... HE HE HE HE... DOH... Now I am really laughing in RL, true.<br />
<br />
Some of the people I admire the most and are my friends are warriors. Yep, I have to confess this bit of a detail. <br />
<br />
I am tired, of this ranting will continue later....<br />
<br />
Ah, and if you think I am a fool, I guess you are just behind me...HE he he...<br />
<br />
Bye for now, I wanna go and play and check on this new aggro spells in Fungus Grove... can not wait any loger ... <br />

<br />
I think I was told not to post there as their concerns was high level Sk, elemental, Time and GOD mentality and concerns. As my ideas were irrelevant for them I was told to go and post elsewhere. Was told to start my own thread.<br />
<br />
So I started my own post for the not so good SK, and their concerns and tribulations.<br />
<br />
 So why don't you go back to the other thread and post your really good UBER  ideas. <br />
<br />
I think genius need to post among genius. Go back to your high cloud bro. <br />
<br />
Here is for lower level SK, as I am one of those low level shit, according to some.<br />
<br />
I have not seen any of your ideas  yet ;but it could be you have only one brain cell left, and I am just asking too much...<br />
<br />
He he...<br />
<br />
I am so excited to find that there are 4 spells added to our magnificent wonderful line of spells. So I guess SOE has noticed a bit of imbalance too and has done a bit of something to improve this.<br />
<br />
Looked about this Fugus Grove thing and it does not make any sense. Need to keep looking. <br />
<br />
Now, in the echocaverns in the way to Fungus Grove there is an SK area on the right once you go in to the echo caverns through the secret door. <br />
This area is  found once you open  the sliding rock. <br />
They sell spells there and maybe that is what the druid was referring. Maybe he was referring  to the echo cavern selling area on the way to Fungus Grove.<br />
<br />
I am there right now and checking have not seen any new spells yet but will continue my search. <br />
<br />
Will talk to the druid again as I was in a raid last nite and not much on detail was discussed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Found 4 new spells for level 65<br />
<br />
1. Mental Horror, 2. Black Shroud, 3. Miasmic spear... wow 660 DD, 4. and Anciet bite of chaos.<br />
<br />
This is how another sk feels about this. From Al K...<br />
<br />
 &quot;I'm damn happy they finally gave sks some good spells. This plus upgrade to Mental Corruption is nice. And a new nuke even. Too bad this is an ancient spell, so prolly gonna be hard as hell to get, especially guildless like most Sks are, me included. Guess I have to get the expansion now and just prey I can get it. &quot;     <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Seems there is some that think our spell line sucks.<br />
<br />
<br />
Will continue my spell search and check on aggro issues  and post more later on this.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Lejina Bloodbath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I was doing Agnarr last night and we were just having a great time doing him. I used my HT on the second floor big boss. When I hit him for4 8216, of course that was just nothing. One time shot, to be done again in one hour.<br />
<br />
Good thing you still can melee, lifetap, dot and cast spears between each HT, uh.<br />
<br />
Ha ha, we did so good that in about 25 min we were killing Agnarr, then killed his named after that. They were being Kitted by the Rangers. Okay I had no HT to use again. As I already used it.<br />
<br />
Of course, if you dont have enough self control to refrain from blowing your load whenever your HT is up, theres good odds it wont be up when you could use it when it matters.<br />
<br />
So do not tell me that such a long time is a big deal, or justified. It is balance and fairness and it is just too bad that you want to keep the SK at the botton, cuz it is all just fine and swell. NO IT IS NOT. I should have been able to HT Agnarr and I could not, you dim wit. <br />
<br />
HT is in no way your main source of damage. Its at most a little extra you can blast every now and then. If you want to HT more often, then feel free to train Touch of the Wicked.<br />
<br />
Interesting enough a druid friend of mine told last nite that there are some new spells for SK to improve our aggro.<br />
<br />
Your friend is roughly a year and half late in the news. Next summer he will probably tell you that the USA just started a war with Irak. Just nod to him and say &quot;ok&quot;.<br />
<br />
They, supposedly were added as we are loosing in the field of aggro department. Told me to go to Fungus Grove to find them.<br />
<br />
The spells are found in Echo Cavern. Close enough.<br />
<br />
I will do a search on this and two things will be evident here # 1. The druid is confused and did not tell me the truth, # 2 . The druid and others have noticed the we did lose in the aggro department to the warriors. So this is not in my imagination. Warriors getting an fix, and SK left behind IS NOT BALANCE.<br />
<br />
or #3 : complete and utter morons tend to have complete and utterly moronic friends.<br />
<br />
<br />
I am glad that you play an SK, but I think you are not to fond of him or you are certainly bad, ignorant on his role.<br />
<br />
By all mean, go ahead and enlighten us on the role of the Shadowknight class. <br />
<br />
Oh, there it is :<br />
<br />
I guess you are so ignorant, and one sided, pardon the repetition, that keep insisting in ignoring my statements. <br />
I said about Disarm, Hide, FD-hot key, and others are debatable, ideas on how to make us special. I did not made this thread to discuss on how to implement them so not to step on other's toes, Just tossed an idea on what could be fixed to give the SK an unique role as you warriors have a monopoly on taking the big mobs, and want no others to touch your possesion.<br />
<br />
Wow, Disarm and Hide, both really at the core of the importance of the SK class. Not.<br />
<br />
<br />
I am going to repeat make us something special. This means no one else has in this way. Then I would be able to have my own special contribution to a group or raid. It would have been nice if I could have hit Agnar again with my one time HT, that by the way was nothing, considering his innate HP. That would have been my contribution to the raid. Not only one time at the second floor and wait for another 60 min to do again.<br />
In the fast paced minis in sol ro it would be nice to be able to use HT more often.<br />
<br />
When used against an uber mob in an encounter that last 3-4min, HT improve your damage output by roughly 40dps. Given how shitty you are, this is easily an increase of your damage output by 50%. This is by no mean meaningless.<br />
<br />
Once again, train Touch of the Wicked and you will be free to HT every 36min, granted those wont be all 8khp HT, but this should satify your urge to blow your load as fast as you can.<br />
<br />
You telling me that I should be contempt with my useless line of spells, for my level and areas that I am playing just shows your extremely narrow mind. I can not go there any more as you think you know it all. I am sure SOE, if they want to keep SK happy and up to par in the game will have to do something about this or I will be as usual the only SK in a raid of 72. So sad to see, one sk and 4 pally were in a raid of 72. Possibly this can be fixed or we as a class are going to be obsolete.<br />
<br />
Theres what, 16 classes in EQ now?<br />
<br />
Tell me how you can have a specialised role for all of them.<br />
<br />
You cant.<br />
<br />
At best you can have a few specialists and a bunch of others who touch multiple specialisation fields. Guess what? The shadowknights are of the second set of classes.<br />
<br />
Shadowknights of your lvl of game tank alright against non uber mobs, they have decent sustained damage output, good burst damage and they pull fine.<br />
<br />
Ah, Chain casting. I think this is an AA in Gates. You are wrong again dude. I guess SOE answered that one for ya.<br />
<br />
What?<br />
<br />
You are not scared of SK, well at least you want me to fill me up with mediocre spells and keep the me in second, maybe third place in the field.<br />
<br />
Hah, the lvl of the game you play at is where the class has been at its best since the release of Kunark (on par with how we were the last few months pre-Kunark imho).<br />
<br />
If you are considered as a shitty raid members, its simply because you fucking suck at being a SK. Plain and simple.<br />
<br />
Matter of fact, spells are at their best in an environment where the players are poor or average gears. As the players gain power from new weapons, the spells gain very little boost and are eventually outshined by said weapons. You are at the stage of the game where you lifetaps, dots and nukes represent a good chunk of your overall damage output.<br />
<br />
This alone makes you a decent dps member.<br />
<br />
Add to this some serious agro generation overtime and the ability to pull whenever its needed, and its frankly silly to say SK arent valuable on a raid of this lvl.<br />
<br />
<br />
Monks and bards will no longer be seen as pullers, cuz I get a pacify that will allow me to single pull. Now that is one of the most stupid things you have said so far. The best puller I have seen is a bard, this just happened a few days ago in sol ro. He had a mob waiting for me after the one I was tanking was over. Kill one, next was right there. He can slow pacify, run fast, he is in my opinion the best puller in this game, followed by monks and rangers. I really do not see how it is possible for me an SK to pacify to bring one mob to camp is going to damage their already gained abilites.<br />
<br />
Hah, but to have the warriors gain better agro is actually damaging your abilities?<br />
<br />
Look dude, if someone else gain something and you dont, you now stand behind that other class comparatively speaking (this you understand already).<br />
<br />
This goes both way. If you gain something and the other class do not, this last class now is losing ground.<br />
<br />
 Monks are great tanks.<br />
<br />
Monks are ok tank at your lvl of play. They can take the hits decently if well geared but they have very shitty agro generation. They are hopeless as main tank in an environement where they are grouped with casters, they can however off tank in a pinch, once again : at your lvl of play. Its ok because at your lvl of play Shadowknights are a powerhouse when played correctly.<br />
<br />
 At times a monk was tanking one mob and I was tanking the other, we both did a great job. Should I be offended cuz the monk can be a tank like me when needed? No, I welcomed his tanking abilities, he saved my day and the exp went up faster as we both could tank. Let me tell you when I was doing the POJ trials a monk was the MT, yes a monk. Hey in that group I was so happy he was tanking. He kicked ass, one of the best monks I have ever seen. Was I jelous, not a bit. I was happy that he was doing such a great job.<br />
So if I am okay with monks being good tanks why should monks be upset for me to get a pacify, when there are already other classes that can do the same? I am sorry, I just do not follow, aggree with you trying to squezze me to the bottom of the game.<br />
<br />
You suck, face it.<br />
<br />
There is no way I will damage a monk as I can pacify as he can. I mean when the monks were able to use their pacify, did the bards, clerics, rangers, got up in arms and told them that they could not do this as they were the sole owners of this particular trait? Maybe these other classes are not as possesive as you are and do not mind sharing their skills a bit.<br />
<br />
Actually, at your lvl of play, your spells still represent a fair chunk of your damage output. With BoH, spears and your pet you can sustain the damage output of a monk with not too much problem, or at least be very close.<br />
<br />
Although I can explain your thinking, you are the kind of person that thinks is okay for warrior to gain aggro in single groups, as this needed to be improved, but SK ... we need nothing. Your mind is sick man.<br />
<br />
Warriors needed the extra agro generation very badly. What they did not need was the extra damage mitigation.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well let me see you are not that stupid after all you at least aggree that putting COA in ornate armor is not good and SCS needs to be activated. Okay that is good, so I give you a little star for tha one. HE HE....<br />
Oh, another little star, we need to improve or disarm cap of 70... HE HE HE HE... DOH... Now I am really laughing in RL, true.<br />
<br />
Ok fucking retard. Please, do tell us why do we need more than 70 to disarm?<br />
<br />
You are aware that disarming a mob does absolutely jack and shit, right?<br />
<br />
At best you will have that mob lose its fine steel weapon and you will be able to pick it up w/o killing the mob.<br />
<br />
If you are so hurting for fine steel weapons, then kill the damn thing. Its not like mobs dropping fine steel weapons take more than a few seconds to kill anyway.<br />
<br />
Some of the people I admire the most and are my friends are warriors. Yep, I have to confess this bit of a detail. <br />
<br />
Are they as stupid are your druid friend?<br />
<br />
I am tired, of this ranting will continue later....<br />

<br />
&quot;Stfu dude, im a teen and you are not, you dont know what you talk about&quot;.<br />
<br />
You gotta realise the uber peoples actually have been where you are in the past. You on the other hand have never been at the end game.<br />
<br />
This is why usually an uber can comment on the low-mid game and not sound like a complete tool but a low-mid gamer cant even grasp what the ubers are talkin about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>StruzorGnome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">For the record, I'm not very uber, I was on the forefront of the new expansion for awhile before I quit, but didn't get geared very well as I was doing VT and mid-teir PoP before I joined a top guild.

<br />
 Secondly I agree with the Author. Kritr ( I think, lol )<br />
 ANYWAY.<br />
<br />
 Yup we are losing our Edge...our fun. I am an SK in the Elementals soon to be in Time I hope. Broken into EMP and VT and YES.....I get bored on raids.<br />
 <br />
 Voice etc spells lines, no good. All the tanks basically in my guild have no real use for em. Most the MTs in guild have either the BoC or the other one ( cant recal its name..BoW ? ) <br />
 XP Groupwise I MIGHT use one in extreem cases if the Tank cant hold Agro too well other than that I Tank in xp groups and hold agro fine without them, as we should acouple of CCs and my Ornate Greatsword does a good job.<br />
<br />
 I have deleted almost all the spells from my spell book that are below the lvl 45. With exception to Agro, utility and the odd buff spell.<br />
<br />
 But basically I am getting bored. Playing the lesser tank on raids NOT even being including on corpse retrival ( Nec, Rogue, Monk do better jobs )<br />
LOOT Balance also Lacks towards the SK mainly, There are a good number of Paly only or Paly, clr, Dru only drops in the elementals especially. But for SKs we either have to share our loot with all the other plate classes OR other Palys. There is very limited SK only loot. Which is pretty sad.<br />
<br />
Overal though what can we do. There isnt enough SKs in the game as a whole to put up a complaint, unlike the DRUIDS who especially in the first few seasons of the game complained at everything and now they can basically DO everything !. <br />
SK numbers are short. and I forsee them getting shorter :(</div></div><hr />

Now aside from being an &quot;Utility Tank&quot;, as some one in this board has called us, and having a bit of other classes what is is that makes us special or needed? <br />
Now consider the whole spectrum form level 0-65 and beyond. <br />
That is what I am talking about.<br />
<br />
I agree with.<br />
<br />
<br />
1. Make a disarm that works well for us.<br />
<br />
Dont agree.<br />
<br />
2. Improve hiding - invisibility so we can at least go places, be more efficient at CR and can help group. Makle the Shadow  part of the shadowknight mean something. The way it is when you use your hot key invisibility, you move and invisivility is gone. If there is a way to keep this on while on the move , I am not aware of it.<br />
<br />
Dont Agree<br />
<br />
3. Give us some type of lull/ pacify so we can be balanced with monks at pulling.<br />
<br />
dont agree.<br />
<br />
4. Make the FD a hot key so we can save a spell slot. <br />
Dont Agree.<br />
<br />
5. Need HT time refresher shorter.<br />
<br />
 Agree but this can be done with AAs !<br />
<br />
6. Be able to upgrade the lower end spells that at the higher end of the game really are not needed. In this regard the spells can be upgraded or make new spells for the higher level SK. <br />
<br />
Agree.<br />
<br />
7.  Improve our DD, certainly not as good as the pure casters but make it better than 600. This is okay for lower levels, but as progression in the game goes on this is just a drop in the buckett.<br />
<br />
Dont Agree. our DDs are ok. for added DPS. we are weak Necros not wizards :)<br />
<br />
<br />
8. Make more SK/ Pally drops only that will benefit this hybrids and not have to share them with pure melee. For example I really do not see the point in giving mana generating weap to warriors or monks.<br />
<br />
Yup Agree<br />
<br />
<br />
9. Improve the SCS to be activated.<br />
<br />
no comment :)<br />
<br />
<br />
10. Improve/ ugrade the finishing blow type of AA to be able to use at higher levels of the game.<br />
<br />
yup, but this goes for all melee classes.<br />
<br />
<br />
11. Need some special use to the raid or group and this could be be a better warrior capable of being a tanking force on its own.<br />
This should be accomplish though a quest or AA, not just given. <br />
<br />
no comment<br />
<br />
<br />
12. Make a special only SK ability like the Vampire kiss  where you can kill the mob in one shot, like when his Hp is 50 %. Sort of a disc that will be on a timer. Like every 30 min.<br />
<br />
LOL no chance ! <br />

13. Have better ways to upgrade gear that does not mean you have to go to 40 adventures to obtain one piece of gear.<br />
<br />
no comment. Looks like the only way to upgrade if you cant raid the high end of the game.<br />

<br />
I am totally amazed at the judgmental ideas of people.<br />
<br />
They say I suck...HA HA HA HA..<br />
<br />
I came to this board to # 1. learn, # 2. to discuss my own perception of unfairness from the perspective of  the only SK in my guild that has now 622 AA. Now, I wonder how many AA some of you / flamming guys have? So maybe I know a bit more at my level with my gear than most of you. HE HE,, considering I am not elemental, yet.<br />
<br />
<br />
I get on line and I am innundated with tells from people asking  me to come and join me. So they really know me. I think they all think differently.<br />
<br />
On the Agnar Raid I was doing a named was running a bit late and the raid leader sends me a tell. Are you coming? I guess that is how much they think I suck, eh?<br />
<br />
<br />
We did the dragon in CT last night 12 peeps. The leader warrior sends me tell when I am sol ro and he says....Come bro we need ya.<br />
<br />
Ah, a warrior thinks I am good.<br />
<br />
<br />
Need to go and will respond as best as I can to all this moronic comments, but let me say, I play the best with what I have. I am am good.<br />
<br />
 PS.<br />
<br />
If anyone thinks I should  be happy with what I have, Suck it up. Some of us are not happy. I do not think I am alone. Only one SK in my guild, the others are mostly inactive and come once in a while,  and very few around. This  I mentioned before and this speaks for itself.  Listen up &quot;We are a dying class&quot;! <br />
<br />
Ah, this posts are so funny they make me laugh. <br />
<br />
Stru... you keep saying my ideas are stupid. But tell me any one of your ideas, I really do not see them. Actually do you have any ideas? All I hear you is complain but no constructive, or actually any ideas. So man STFO. <br />
<br />
Go back to the holier than though area in the clouds, for higher level SK, or go to the flame section man. When you have any constructive ideas you want to discuss and not insult, then maybe you can come back.<br />
<br />
Leji... oh well you have some serious adolecent issues. I really do not want to post here because this is not a psychiatric post on people asking for help. You need a lot of growing up dude.<br />

I think your main problem is you have yet to state how you think sk at your level of the game are &quot;un-balanced&quot; tell us why you think u are worse than other classes, and keep it short.  Just make a list of points or situations where sk is underpowered as you see it. <br />
<br />
From where i stand, SK at your lvl of the game look fine and dont need any upgrading.</div></div><hr />

In the face of such high demand, I'd like to ask you why you think you're out of balance, considering you can't seem to take 3 steps without people needing you.</div></div><hr />

Darko, I do not feel like repeating myself one more time. Just do not have the energy to do it. But to summ it up warriors got their aggro better, we need something in return ... just see what I proposed, &quot;not imposed&quot; this are points to toss around and talk.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, and yes, people like me. I am a likable guy, other than I am getting flammed here. So yes, I play my class well with what I have; and beyond all I help people any way I can. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">So in other words, what you're saying is that you had an unfair advantage over warriors throughout PoP and they got fixed, therefore you need something to gain that unfair advantage back?<br />
<br />
Isnt' that the same as the warriors on the other thread saying that if knight issues in GoD get fixed, that they need something &quot;in return&quot;?<br />
<br />
In other words, just because someone got fixed, doesn't mean you should be the benefactor should it?  <br />
<br />
Also, how do all of your insane ideas have anything to do with warrior aggro being fixed?    <br />
<br />
I suspect that you're looking for more power and not more &quot;balance&quot;, because most people tend to agree that in EQ, outside of GoD, the group tanking balance is better than it's EVER been in the history of Everquest.</div></div><hr />

ANYWAY.<br />
<br />
Nothing I typed says I suck at sex, where as everything you typed says you have absolutely no clue about SK's.<br />

Ive had that name since back before the great mama EQ nerfed us and before you was born mate. P.S Brael ?! Is that what you use to read ? because you aint good at it !!<br />
<br />
Nope, it's actually from the random name generator which means it's not supposed to be witty or cool or anything, its easy to type and is decent enough.<br />
<br />
?!?! Im sorry son, Do you feel a need for Voiceing on raids in your guild,groups then ? Maybe you and your guild are alittle lacking...Avatar of War drops a BoC you know ! Maybe you should equip one  Heheh if your lucky u may be the first BoC equiped SK &gt;<br />
<br />
Voice is useless in 99.99999% of all situations as I said, you're the one that talked about Voice spells, not me.  Btw, I do have a BoC it has a Ykesha aug in it as well, it generates far far far more aggro than my Cudgel of Venomous Hatred (which is rather sad).<br />
<br />
LOL Shut up you noob !! I'll repeat nothing like that ! LOL Everyspell in our spell book has a use&gt;!?....LOL in your face ! LOL<br />
Still using your lvl 9 Pet to charm the ladies hey...BUB. I suppose your also in the Raid CH chain with your Dark empathy<br />
<br />
Level 9 pet is quite useful for pulling stuff you can't get line of sight on outside of its aggro range, hell I use Dark Empathy on occasion as well since it's good for testing range.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yup you got me...my guild never wipes or has any loses in the Elementals..we are Uber....thanks  ?!?! lol we have no need for CRs in the Elementals ?! and u dont know why monks are better than SK to CR ?<br />
<br />
I know you can wipe in Elementals, although it really is quite hard if you're semi competent and have been there for any amount of time.  I'm trying to think of where you actually have to drag corpses when you wipe in eles and can't come up with a single spot where I can see you possibly wiping if you're there.<br />
<br />
dont have GoD...cant be asked with the continous streams of expansions with a hope that we wont bugger of to a better run MMRPG. Which we will.<br />
<br />
Guess your guild doesn't do weaker GoD raids then like ZMV or Weaponmaster?  It's too bad you'll never get to expierence LDoN raids, best designed raids in the game so far if you could add/remove people.<br />

HE HE, how if everything was so peachy king, and swell fixing had to be done for my level of play? Why did the warriors got their aggro fixed? Hmm, seems you are contradicting yourself.<br />
<br />
I said the warriors had a problem, agree there, and it got fixed.<br />
Why not fix  our problems? Now I already said balance is balance. Read in the dictionary what balance is, I already said it once to say it again is repetitious. <br />
<br />
I see SK have problems. I want a little consideration. I am voicing my grievances about it the same way warriors had grievances with their shitty aggro in groups, that by the way , according to you, not a good for them to say as you happen to beleive all was swell here at my level of play.<br />
<br />
They bitched and got it. Should I remain silent to make you happy?<br />
<br />
Brael. <br />
<br />
Why not brag. Crap in this game everyone brags, especially warriors, how much HP/ AC they have. Constant links from elemental gear for us poor guys here to salivate. <br />
Some people here think they know so much they are godly. <br />
<br />
So hell, my accomplishment so far AA and yes I will display them for whatever they mean. So maybe some of you do not know that I can possibly say a bit more than most of  you UBER guys. <br />
For me it would be very interesting to know how I will perform with my aquired AA and better gear, now that I am only one step from the elementals.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">You seem to misunderstand what balance is, balance isn't power upgrades when you don't need one, balance is each class being better at some things and worse than others but overall having equal desireability within that archtype.</div></div><hr />

I complain and say I do not have certain things, I already mentioned them. Why warriors can get their fix and SK not?<br />
Crap if your idea of balance is fair, then I guess then you believe: My way or the highway. That in my opinion is not balance. <br />
<br />
<br />
ps. and one more thing Brael. Exp is not easy to obtain. Sorry to have to say this but it has taken me one year to obtain all of these  AA at my level of play  pre elemental, pre time. I did it this way intentionally. Two reasons I want to better my toon with AA, then add gear and see how much better I get with it. <br />
So far at my level ; and I play every day, to the disgust of my wife, it has been one year to get 622 AA. This is not what I would call easy considering that there is nothing &quot;UBER&quot; about my guild. What I did: I  worked my ass to get. <br />
<br />
Woppeee I finally have 306 points for my BP in North Ro this week end... still working my ass there, but  some one said that  is the way is supposed to be. So I am not having it easy bro.<br />

Draco I already said My line of spells suck, my aggro is good but could be better, get me a disarm of more than cap of 70, improve the SCS, there are gear problems for SK.<br />
Some of my other ideas were just tossed around to make the SK special like the warriors the only ones that can do Raid type mobs.<br />
I never said impose this, I suggested them to start a debate on them and if they could or how to implement them would be a matter of discussion. Read my first post and it stated briefly what other classes do. <br />
I said I am still thinking what is that makes the SK special. After about two years, nothing comes to mind. The only thing that comes to my mind we are a punny warrior and no good casters.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>StruzorGnome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Ok fuckwhit, heres some ideas.<br />
<br />
How on earth, at your level of the game, are there gear problems for SK's where warriors or other classes have much better gear?<br />
<br />
Or how can you not hold aggro?  Go to BoT and cast fucking CD and fear, it's worked for me for more than a year, it can WORK FOR YOU TOO.<br />
<br />
What has changed in the past few months below Ikkinz save new discs and a extra mitigation boosts for warriors?  Nothing   Nothing changed for you, you can still tank 10-15% under a warrior, still hold aggro.. what's the problem?<br />
<br />
Your ideas suck, AND they aren't needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Your spell lines suck?  Which ones?  How?  Whats the problem with them?  Why don't higher levels have these spell line problems?</div></div><hr />

<br />
First of all its Darko, please bother to get it right.<br />
<br />
Second, you STILL havent said what the problem is, just saying your spells &quot;suck&quot; means nothing, you need to compare it to something for instance, Apples are better than Oranges cause Apples are red.  <br />
<br />
Same goes for agro etc, btw your agro may not be as good as you would like it but I cant think of any tank class that can out agro you at your stage of the game, unless you are doing something wrong.<br />
<br />
Quit thinking about SK only and look at the game as whole, cause thats the only way you can truely balance a game.  A game like EQ is a combination of many aspects, if you change on those aspects it changes the entire game, so when u ask for a change first think what the impact of that change might be on the entire game as a whole.  I mean sure give SK an insta kill ability, but think how much content that would gimp, and what would stop groups of just SK forming and farming every zone, hell why would anyone wana play another class if SK can just insta kill any mob?  EQ has had plenty &quot;ideas&quot; implemented that should have never left the drawing board, and we pay for them daily, why add to that list of problems?<br />
<br />
So start by stating exactly what the problem of the SK class is, as compared to other classes.</div></div><hr />

I never said I can not hold aggro. I said it should be better. <br />
Voice of Terris in my opinion should be better than 10  % aggro gain and Voice of Thule more than 12 %.<br />
<br />
<br />
Crap I can never get gear I think I should get a shot at it. Always necro, druid, warrior, ranger, monk or other gets as they need more. Read other posts on this. I am not going to repeat myself.<br />
Cuz we are a secondary class we do not get or receive. Oh the ranger got the Agnarr bow, I bid, he got, he is a ranger. Do  not tell me to leave my guild man. Not  more stupid posts please.<br />
Although you may think the Bow from the Agnar raid should be for a ranger. This story repeats itself over and over again. Ah , ya see that necro, bard, druid, needs more. See my MM thead. Do not want to bring that whole topic here. <br />
So stuff that should be for warriors that is the way should be and rangers for rangers. Do not make it for the one poor Sk had to work so hard to get, or actually not get it. <br />
<br />
<br />
Brael to answer your questions of how sucky our line of spells are I would have to break it down more than what I have time now but I have given multiple examples of the uselessness  of these spells. Actually I do not think I am the only one that has ever complained about this. <br />

So your in a DKP guild, after all why else would be bidding on an item. Which mean either saide ranger had more DKP or was willing to spend more DKP for the bow.

Level 9 pet is quite useful for pulling stuff you can't get line of sight on outside of its aggro range, hell I use Dark Empathy on occasion as well since it's good for testing range.<br />
<br />
It cant be usful on Raids though? Soloing I guess but then there are better spells to pull with. We will have to agree to disagree :) Dont Spear spells have the best range of all our spells? As I said I only pull when grouping and soloing and Spears work great for fast pull and tagging.<br />
<br />
I know you can wipe in Elementals, although it really is quite hard if you're semi competent and have been there for any amount of time. I'm trying to think of where you actually have to drag corpses when you wipe in eles and can't come up with a single spot where I can see you possibly wiping if you're there.  <br />
<br />
Ah you see, thats the factor. We havent been in the Elementals for a LONG time. Maybe only 3 months. Earth rings, when all goes tits up. Generally pull to ZI I believe. Not raided with guild religously for afew weeks as Ive been doing the Greenmist Quest.<br />
<br />
Guess your guild doesn't do weaker GoD raids then like ZMV or Weaponmaster? It's too bad you'll never get to expierence LDoN raids, best designed raids in the game so far if you could add/remove people.<br />

Thats the 2 sk only items dropping in the elemental planes that i can think of.<br />
<br />
Mind to list, the oh so much longer, list of paladin only and pal/cle/dru loot dropping in the elemental planes? (doubt you will, because paladins dont have access to any more weapons than we do in the elemental planes)<br />
<br />
Fact is, weapons drop everywhere on PoP. All of them make Greenmist loot like shit.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you would actually raid with your guild instead to mess around on useless quests, then maybe you would be :<br />
<br />
1) Higher on the loot list. Your guild is more than likely not interested to waste good equipment on someone who only show up to raids every once in a while.<br />
<br />
2) Actually have some clue of what is going on in raids and what you can do to contribute better.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It cant be usful on Raids though? Soloing I guess but then there are better spells to pull with. We will have to agree to disagree  Dont Spear spells have the best range of all our spells? As I said I only pull when grouping and soloing and Spears work great for fast pull and tagging.<br />
<br />
Read again what he said about pets. You can pull out of a straight line with them, this is not the case of spears. Think outside the box.</div></div><hr />

I never said I can not hold aggro. I said it should be better. <br />
Voice of Terris in my opinion should be better than 10  % aggro gain and Voice of Thule more than 12 %.<br />
<br />
Crap I can never get gear I think I should get a shot at it. Always necro, druid, warrior, ranger, monk or other gets as they need more. Read other posts on this. I am not going to repeat myself.<br />
Cuz we are a secondary class we do not get or receive. Oh the ranger got the Agnarr bow, I bid, he got, he is a ranger.<br />
 <br />
<br />
There are other methods for gaining aggro besides using the voice or terror spells..., look them up search is a beautiful thing.  You keep acting as if that is the ONLY thing you should be using and you don't want to try and use anything else.  As far as your gear gripe, you are in a DKP guild, GET OVER IT, you want the loot get the DKP or find other things to put into slots.<br />

You had it right in your other post, its called a BoW(Blade of War), and if you actually knew what you were talking about you would know that any class that can use a 2hs weapon can use it and not just warriors.  There is SK only loot in the EPs, and Vin had a nice little list just for you, I guess you missed it but just for you I will post a couple:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Kritr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">Wow so much flaming is just getting out of hand and is diluting the issues that SK are not balanced and we are a  dying class.<br />
<br />
<br />
Need to remember that there are some infantile minds here like Lejina, a teenager trying to become an adult. Will not go there any more. Will have to start another thread on that and it would have to do with psychological help and I do not think that is the purpose of this board and certainly not this thread. We are talking about balance.<br />
<br />
Some say balance is just totally great for where I am. <br />
Yet the developers/ SOE does  some balancing , like giving the warriors more aggro capabilities. <br />
Well I guess, maybe, the game was not that balanced after all.<br />
<br />
Now I am not going to speak here for other classes balance and problems but for the sk problems. What I perceive as a problem from a non uber Sk, in a middle of the road guild, no friends PL me and no special favors getting flags or gear. I did sweat blood to get here. Wiping in raids and long CR is my way of life.<br />
<br />
<br />
So my sucky spells. I am not the only that has complained about  this:<br />
<br />
<br />
1. Okay ..... someone said the Terror spells are 18 month old spells. Yes they are old and when I use them they are not that great. They work better when applied in lower lvl areas, but once you start going to sol ro, get in raids like MM, Bert, Agnarr they are not as effective. Have to use other spells to keep aggro on.<br />
I have been in situations when there is another warrior, after their newly acquired aggro, in which using this spell was just not as effective as it was.<br />
I have noticed like when there is a BST, necro or druid doing their damage, this line of spells really do not work that well. Not like they used to at lower level of play. I am not sure why this is. Maybe an upgrade for higher level SK needs to be done to make the Terror line more efficient.<br />
<br />
<br />
2.  Voice line of spells. <br />
Already said but will repeat.<br />
<br />
Voice of Terris: 10 % aggro gain or there about.<br />
<br />
Voice of Thule: 12 % aggro gain at best.<br />
<br />
Ha ha ha... now then, how good is this? <br />
Not sure but not much difference in one from the other. I have both and now in sol ro, actually in other tier 2 areas this is not really that great to &quot;makes us special&quot;. <br />
Maybe I am incorrect, but one of the things it used to make us special was our aggro capabilities. Same as warriors with their beloved monopoly of being the big daddies when tanking gods, and big time mobs. <br />
<br />
Now that is not so, I am not the only one with real good aggro, warriors becoming better at it and we have not improved on the defiency I have perceived as we go up in zones. So we lost our spot being the aggro kings. It would be like if Sk can tank Raid mobs, the warriors would lose their unique spot.<br />
<br />
2. Fear line of spells:<br />
Only time I can fear now is when I am going to an adventure and want to get rid of those little green pests that start hitting me. Is fun, I laugh when I do it and actually keeps me entertained as I wait for the ldon to get ready and organized.<br />
Ah, I can still fear the light blue little devil thingys in sol ro and light blue in BOT, but besides a fun thing to do, is not for any use other than for supposedly improving my aggro...he he...<br />
<br />
When I was in DL in my lvl 40's another Sk at the time told me, snare the giant, then fear him, then beat the hell out of him. Yes, it was a usable skill/ tactic at that time, especially if there were not may peeps around and your group was small. Those were the old days, can not do this anymore. It would be interesting if this type of technique could be used again by higher level SK.<br />
<br />
3. Shield spells:<br />
<br />
Diamond skin: tops like 350 or so shield. Only one hit, shield is gone. Have to cast a peridot every time I cast. Now this is one of the most useless of spells I can think of. Unless I stay playing forever in DL or DSP, no reason why to have this spell when one mob in sol ro hits me for 400 + one time. <br />
The other shield skins, diamond skin etc are equally laughable, buying agate gems for a one time hit shield. Is a totally inefficient line of spells for my level and stage in the game.<br />
<br />
Banshee Aura: well not sure how much protection it gives me, sort of obscure to me, it only lasts 9 minutes, but is overwritten by the high level Druid and mage DS spells on me. So if I am with a Druid or Mage and they are going to give me their DS I do not even bother loading this spell that has, to me, an obscure value.<br />
<br />
4. Pet spells another great line of useless spells unless you are planning to just fool around in lower level zones and send your pet to fight green mobs.<br />
My pet never survives any hit or attack. Granted have not used any AA gate to improve my pet, but will have to give it some thought as our pet line of spells is so laughable that is more an oddity and fun thing to do. Not sure if it makes any big difference at my level of play. <br />
<br />
5. Mezz  undead. Where can I use this  spell, in Neriak? Enuff said here.<br />
<br />
6. Find undead. Find undead? Ah, is this also a very old spell when the game came up? What is the use in Sol ro or where I am playing now? Need to do some thinking here .he he I can not figure this spell out yet.<br />
<br />
7. Breath spell. Useless you happen not to have a breathing gear that I think at my level most have some sort of another especially if you are going to hunt underwater or a place like SSRA where you may need to get there and not suffocate. Worse part you can not even give to others.<br />
<br />
8. Death Bond: this spell nullifies my Life drain from my blindfoe. If I cast Death bond my blindfoe proc is gone. So why to use this spell, that cost so much mana ,and can not use with my gear? Some may say: Get another weapon. <br />
Well at my level, that is what I am talking about, this is not an option. That is my best weapon! Sorry to say that.<br />
<br />
9. Ziev Bite: resisted a lot, only heals me and group for 400. Not bad, but should heal for more at a higher level of play. Actually one of my favorite spells if it could be improved a bit.<br />
<br />
10. Spears spells resisted a lot at my level of play, mana drain, and only hit for 600, spear of Decay. Oh I see we have Miasmic Spear it DD for 660, GREAT, for GOD. Sixty point increment. I am so happy SOE is so generous. <br />
<br />
<br />
11. Mental Spell spell line to get mana can not cast with Shroud of Chaos. Have to use one or the other. Why not combine it? Or make it so one can use both at the same time if needed.<br />
<br />
12. The skellies to get mana should be upgraded to have skellies that give more mana / tic. Not much difference from lvl 58 skellie illusion and the 60s version Pact of Hate.<br />
<br />
<br />
13. Already mentioned putting old spells in ornate gear. Why add COA to leggings when at this level it should have COL or better?<br />
<br />
14. Heart Flutter , and Asystole. I like the effects that come from them. That is how much I can say about them, unless again you think they help aggro a bit and Asystole helps debuff.  Again when I go to Neriak just for shits and kicks I cast these spells to see the mobs fall when I am just watching. To use this line of spells seriously at my level, not much use really. <br />
<br />
15. Magic resist, cancel magic, disease resist, cold resist, cast disease, totally useless at my level for what they were intended.<br />
 I guess I have used cast disease when I was pulling in inner for aggro gain, this was the last time I used it.<br />
<br />
16. Summon companion. What companion? My useless pet? He he good idea SOE.<br />
Shrink pet. He, he sure, surelets shrink my mate..ROL.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now I am tired and will continue later but this is just for beginners. Someone said the level I am is great when it comes to balance.  That is your opinion. I do not think so and that is why I think Peztilence got rid of his spells. They are mostly useless. <br />
<br />
Probably as I go to EP these line of spells would be even more pathetic, but again have  not been there to comment at this time.<br />
These spells had a use at one time. Now they do not. <br />

<br />
I'm having a really hard time believing that you wrote that.   Let me explain basic chronology.<br />
<br />
If at one time, things were out of balance, then those things are fixed.... Now balance exists.<br />
<br />
The game WASN'T that balanced before warriors were fixed, but now is different.   In the casual experience level of the game outside of GoD, tanking balance is as good as it's ever been in the history of EQ.   Just because it WAS out of balance, doesn't mean it is now.</div></div><hr />

Quit whining, listen to those who have a better rounded view on what the hell is going on , as I try to do, and play your ass off.<br />

<br />
Terrors don't scale properly, thats been addressed multiple times and isn't any real secret, the crossover point is around level 52 when darkness becomes a more effective spell for aggro/time, and is always more effective aggro/mana wise.<br />
<br />
<br />
2. Voice line of spells. <br />
Already said but will repeat.<br />
<br />
Voice of Terris: 10 % aggro gain or there about.<br />
<br />
Voice of Thule: 12 % aggro gain at best.<br />
<br />
Ha ha ha... now then, how good is this? <br />
Not sure but not much difference in one from the other. I have both and now in sol ro, actually in other tier 2 areas this is not really that great to &quot;makes us special&quot;. <br />
Maybe I am incorrect, but one of the things it used to make us special was our aggro capabilities. Same as warriors with their beloved monopoly of being the big daddies when tanking gods, and big time mobs. <br />

So we lost our spot being the aggro kings. It would be like if Sk can tank Raid mobs, the warriors would lose their unique spot.<br />
<br />
The area of the game you're at is where voice spells are at their best, Warrior aggro hasn't skyrocketed yet and its giving you probally 7-8% Warrior aggro, it's not great espically since SK's don't have the spell slots to spare, but it's not bad.<br />
<br />
2. Fear line of spells:<br />
Only time I can fear now is when I am going to an adventure and want to get rid of those little green pests that start hitting me. Is fun, I laugh when I do it and actually keeps me entertained as I wait for the ldon to get ready and organized.<br />
Ah, I can still fear the light blue little devil thingys in sol ro and light blue in BOT, but besides a fun thing to do, is not for any use other than for supposedly improving my aggro...he he...<br />

It would be interesting if this type of technique could be used again by higher level SK.<br />
<br />
Fear kiting was removed to attempt to make soloing less effective, that was on purpose, be glad Fear is a messed up spell and you can use it for some aggro.<br />
<br />
3. Shield spells:<br />
<br />
Diamond skin: tops like 350 or so shield. Only one hit, shield is gone. Have to cast a peridot every time I cast. Now this is one of the most useless of spells I can think of. Unless I stay playing forever in DL or DSP, no reason why to have this spell when one mob in sol ro hits me for 400 + one time. <br />

<br />
Banshee Aura: well not sure how much protection it gives me, sort of obscure to me, it only lasts 9 minutes, but is overwritten by the high level Druid and mage DS spells on me. So if I am with a Druid or Mage and they are going to give me their DS I do not even bother loading this spell that has, to me, an obscure value.<br />
<br />
Ever notice our rune line of spells stopped?  It's because they couldn't be effectively used any longer, at one point they were more effective than our lifetaps.  I remember chain casting Steelskin back in Kunark because it costed me less dps and &quot;healed&quot; me for more, more efficently.  It's a good thing we don't have to be using these anymore, with the dps of mobs today we would be needing 5k self runes to keep up and thats just well... bad.<br />
<br />
Banshee Aura is a pretty good spell, I like using it quite a bit.  Sure it doesn't stack but when you don't have those other classes with you its real nice to have in your lineup.<br />
<br />
4. Pet spells another great line of useless spells unless you are planning to just fool around in lower level zones and send your pet to fight green mobs.<br />
My pet never survives any hit or attack. Granted have not used any AA gate to improve my pet, but will have to give it some thought as our pet line of spells is so laughable that is more an oddity and fun thing to do. Not sure if it makes any big difference at my level of play. <br />
<br />
At your level of play your pet is a 50% dps increase or in some cases even more, learn how to use your pet right and you'll love it as you progress its value gets less compared to meleeing (same is true for all damage spells for all classes) but its always nice to have around, 31 more dps is 31 more dps.<br />
<br />
5. Mezz undead. Where can I use this spell, in Neriak? Enuff said here.<br />
<br />
We have no mez undead spells, do you mean lulls?  Never been useful, the very concept of SK's makes it impossible for them to be useful for us (same is true for all level capped spells)<br />
<br />
6. Find undead. Find undead? Ah, is this also a very old spell when the game came up? What is the use in Sol ro or where I am playing now? Need to do some thinking here .he he I can not figure this spell out yet.<br />
<br />
You've never had to hunt your own bone chips have you?<br />
<br />
7. Breath spell. Useless you happen not to have a breathing gear that I think at my level most have some sort of another especially if you are going to hunt underwater or a place like SSRA where you may need to get there and not suffocate. Worse part you can not even give to others.<br />
<br />
Since all those EB items have such great stats this must be a problem.  Apparently they're all soul bond too.<br />
<br />
8. Death Bond: this spell nullifies my Life drain from my blindfoe. If I cast Death bond my blindfoe proc is gone. So why to use this spell, that cost so much mana ,and can not use with my gear? Some may say: Get another weapon. <br />
Well at my level, that is what I am talking about, this is not an option. That is my best weapon! Sorry to say that.<br />
<br />
Get a new weapon.  Sorry even at your level of play theres alternatives to a Blindfoe, back when my guild first killed Arch Lich (original form with his 800/tick forever dot that was damn near unresistable at the time) we got a Blindfoe and guess what?  It rotted.  Thats how lame that sword was, even back then when NToV stuff is what we were using we let that sword rot.  You can easily get another one that doesnt have stacking issues.  But since you're complaining about that I guess you better start complaining about SEWS since Diamondskin won't stack with the proc!<br />
<br />
9. Ziev Bite: resisted a lot, only heals me and group for 400. Not bad, but should heal for more at a higher level of play. Actually one of my favorite spells if it could be improved a bit.<br />
<br />
It's low heal for a reason (btw its 200 non crits), it's one of our best spells.  It gives mana to your group, its better hp/mana regen than SD is which is pretty damn nice.  Infact at your level of play you don't even lose dps casting it because your melee damage is lower.  How can you not like this spell?<br />
<br />
10. Spears spells resisted a lot at my level of play, mana drain, and only hit for 600, spear of Decay. Oh I see we have Miasmic Spear it DD for 660, GREAT, for GOD. Sixty point increment. I am so happy SOE is so generous.<br />
<br />
Welcome to SK gripe-about-their-spellbooks #3, spears need a 10%-15% mana increase with a resist adjust on them. going from -5 at the lowest one gainign 5 each time leaving Miasmic spear at -25.  That would help alot for them.<br />
<br />
11. Mental Spell spell line to get mana can not cast with Shroud of Chaos. Have to use one or the other. Why not combine it? Or make it so one can use both at the same time if needed.<br />
<br />
Stacking code, it can't be combined without disabaling some of our AA's on it, which is kinda lame, plus I don't know about you but I like having choices.<br />
<br />
12. The skellies to get mana should be upgraded to have skellies that give more mana / tic. Not much difference from lvl 58 skellie illusion and the 60s version Pact of Hate.<br />
<br />
6 mana for 12 hp a tick isn't much of a difference from 15 mana for 32 hp a tick?<br />
<br />
<br />
13. Already mentioned putting old spells in ornate gear. Why add COA to leggings when at this level it should have COL or better?<br />
<br />
Poor itemization certainly (mental corruption and augmentation of death would have been much better clicks) but CoL shouldn't be on them, thats a rune spell.  Sorry.<br />
<br />
14. Heart Flutter , and Asystole. I like the effects that come from them. That is how much I can say about them, unless again you think they help aggro a bit and Asystole helps debuff. Again when I go to Neriak just for shits and kicks I cast these spells to see the mobs fall when I am just watching. To use this line of spells seriously at my level, not much use really.<br />
<br />
Debuffing mobs with a ton of extra aggro on them isn't good?<br />
<br />
15. Magic resist, cancel magic, disease resist, cold resist, cast disease, totally useless at my level for what they were intended.<br />
I guess I have used cast disease when I was pulling in inner for aggro gain, this was the last time I used it.<br />
<br />
We don't get magic resist, cancel magic is ok, endure disease is ok for those who don't have PoM flowers, cold resist again isn't bad at all, cure disease is useful actually I used that spell yesterday trioing Hoshkar with a friend and his druid bot.  You left Aura of Darkness off btw which is a really nice spell other than it taking a buff slot instead of a bard buff slot.<br />
<br />
16. Summon companion. What companion? My useless pet? He he good idea SOE.<br />
Shrink pet. He, he sure, surelets shrink my mate..ROL.<br />

Useful at times when theres bad pathing or you parked your pet across the zone, or in say PoJ trials to get your pet outside to you.</div></div><hr />

Brael I totally understand what is balance. The warriors had it shitty with their aggro. They complained. Result= change.<br />
 <br />
<br />
I don't agree that warriors whining lead to change.  SOE stated well before the warrior whine-fest slash sit-in that they were working on significant melee changes.  All the warrior whine did was make them implement it unfinished and in pieces, also to release information about the system which they later scuttled, like the openings system.<br />
<br />
There is a Latin phrase for fallacy of believing that just because one thing occurred before the other that the first thing caused the second thing... I wish I could remember it and hope someone posts it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>Darko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">Kritr that long post of yours about our spells demonstrated that you have a complete lack of knowelge of eq game mechanics.  This shows why you are getting the response u are getting, for instance you complaing about a spell like Zev Bite.  Zbite is with out a doubt one of the best if not THE best spell in our entire spell book, its not even an arguement, and btw zbite is practicly unresistable by any mob that is not immune to disease (-500 disease resist mod) so I dont see how you can possible make the claim that it gets resisted too much.<br />
<br />
Also once again, you have not stated how any of these abilities and spells are underpowered compared to the other classes.  Your brought up fear, well guess what all other classes who have fear spells (nec enc clr rng brd dru) can no longer use them on exp mobs at higher levels so its not like SK are being singled out there.  <br />
<br />
So far it seems your problem is not that sk are unbalanced but that you do not like the class.  However your distaste for the class has nothing to do with a lack of balance.</div></div><hr />

Nevertheless I do like this spell and I said is one of my favorites.<br />

1.  Terrors scaling improperly requiring all but the lowest 2 level ones needing revamped.<br />
<br />
2.  Spears being too highly resisted, their mana efficency is lower than the damage only portion of lifetaps.<br />
<br />
3.  Our self heals in GoD need a HUGE upgrade.  Not only did all healing spells fall behind the curve but ours didn't even get any upgrades like every other class who has heal spells, making them fall even further behind.</div></div><hr />

Just because people disagree with your points, and posts, doesn't mean that they are totally satisfied with what they have, it just means they don't agree with you.  <br />
<br />
See earlier post about the fallacy of thinking just that one thing came before another that the first thing caused the second thing.  <br />
<br />
Many other people have made good points as to what we would like to have as useful improvements, they just also happened to think, as do I, that most of the points you are making are flawed.  That does not mean that we are satisfied.   <br />
<br />
And Another Thing:   If this really is for the common SK, then there is no balancing issue.  Yes the agro gap has closed and the hp/mitigation gap has increased, but unless you are like Brael and really only have GoD for &quot;upgrades&quot; and progression, you shouldn't be having problems getting groups or progressing like all the post kunark SK's before you</div></div><hr />

Then I mentioned About Ziev spell as when I was reading and trying to present my point it has never occured to me to do an in depht anaylisis  to answer Drako's st. I know the spell is resisted in more than one place, but have not taken notes on all the places as I am not a game developer and when I am on line I am just having fun not taking surveys.<br />
<br />
The whole Ziev situation is ludicrous as I even said I like it, it just need to be improved and this happen to be the balance of the SK board.<br />
<br />
I never have problems getting groups. I am fine. I still do not see the balance you are talking about when there are still things need to be fixed.<br />

<br />
You have very strange ideas about the spells we get, for one.<br />
<br />
two things to illustrate this:  you can use fear (kiting) all the way to 65 for respectable XP.  This makes the spell extremely valuable and useful, not even touching on its use for agro purposes.<br />

Secondly:  you discount our pets, which alone makes me really wonder about you.  Its a huge boost to our marginal DPS, over time.  So he dies some *shrug*  its still 20ish DPS.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>Radahsam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">Well, being 1 kill from Time, my biggest gripe is obviously all the balancing issues associated with GoD, namely our tanking ability....or lack thereof.<br />
<br />
However, if you want to get into general gripes, I have relatively few.  Most have already been covered, but I'll reiterate just so it can be taken as agreement in case some dev is trolling and wonders who thinks what.<br />
<br />
1.  Same gripe about spears.  I desire the same result.  These things are resisted way too much.<br />
<br />
2.  Same gripe about item effects.  SKs are too often boxed in with other classes.  Sure, we need FT, vengeance, and all the other stuff too, but frankly, mana regen is just rarely an issue for me any more.  It'd be nice to have a useful clickable effect on some gear again.  I sometimes miss the g'ole days of Blood Ember gear.<br />
<br />
3.  I want an EE rez.  This is nothing more than an &quot;I want&quot;.  I am sick of wiping in exp groups or even raids because all the rez classes died and no necros decided to logon.  I can live without it, as I have lived without it for a long time.  This would be a &quot;bone&quot; they could throw me just to add some fun.<br />
<br />
4.  Give us an upgraded fear that works on mobs up to level 68.  That way, I can go fear kite at the tables in PoFire as a last act of lunacy and desperation since I can't tank worth a shit anymore.  (yes, I'm joking....kinda)<br />
<br />
5.  Upgraded heals.  Geebus, even doubling our lifetap for the same mana wouldn't be overpowering in GoD.<br />
<br />
That's about it.  I've never been one to worry too much about my SK until GoD.  I worried that we were gonna get nerfed with the big melee patch.  I posted lengthy bitches about the perceived nerf on HT.  None of it ended up being a nerf.  HT was better after the change.  Putting our disciplines on separate timers was a welcome change, even if we didn't get any new discs.  I am disappointed that we got ZERO new discs.  Would have been nice to have a bone.  Something, anything to acknowledge that hybrids are part melee.  But all in all, my role wasn't really threatened, and I continued to have just as much fun as before.<br />
<br />
With GoD, I am hardly having much fun at all except on raids.  I find myself wasting time doing old-world stuff.  I killed a few fabled mobs for a chanter friend.  Almost feinted to find out that King Tranix' fabled helm was actually an upgrade for him.  I wouldn've have put it on a TWINK, much less my SK main.  Fabled mobs are SOE's way of saying &quot;Suckers&quot;!  The people that can use them as upgrades are almost completely incapable of killing them, at least not without a major raid force.  The people capable of single-grouping them generally only do so for fun or twinkage.<br />
<br />
I'm contemplating doing the IA ring with a single group now.  What for?  Hell, I don't know.  The loot isn't an upgrade for me.  The exp will suck.  But it might be fun.  Did the spider ring event in the factory of PoI a while back with a single group.  I think this was originally a raid-level event.  HAH!  This stuff is kinda fun.<br />
<br />
Sitting and going LFG in GoD is NOT fun.  My only way to get a GoD group when my perma-group friends aren't online is to recruit people one by one.  Oh wait, I got my Tipt flag one night because a wizard had gone LD and they needed someone along that could summon her if she returned.  She didn't, and I profited from it.  Gotta love a mercy flag.  A ranger friend has both earrings from the Ikkinz trial.  Apparently, rangers have a good bit of value on the boss, what with TS and harmony and all.  Same ranger friend has closed the HP gap between him and myself by about 300-400 HP in the last two weeks thanks to GoD....all for ZERO DKP.  Meanwhile, I'm busy HT'ing old-world mobs for other friends who belong to &quot;unwanted classes&quot; and have started working on epics for more &quot;needed&quot; twinks.<br />

<br />
Thats what I was trying to make a point of at the Start Brael. Probably not a good point mind you :) but that was my point all the same.<br />
<br />
Fear kiting was removed to attempt to make soloing less effective, that was on purpose, be glad Fear is a messed up spell and you can use it for some aggro.<br />
<br />
Ive never found fear that effective to Agro. Maybe its just me, but I still prefer the old skool method of CC etc, once I finish the Greenmist I hear that has a Huge agro ( or used to ) I'll look forward to testing that with some shield Agro too.<br />
<br />
Ever notice our rune line of spells stopped? It's because they couldn't be effectively used any longer<br />
<br />
  Didnt a rune spell use to absorb a HT ?<br />
<br />
At your level of play your pet is a 50% dps increase or in some cases even more, learn how to use your pet right and you'll love it as you progress its value gets less compared to meleeing (same is true for all damage spells for all classes) but its always nice to have around, 31 more dps is 31 more dps.<br />
<br />
<br />
 Our Pet is fab. Quading for 50+ dmg, better dps than any of our dots at the cost of no mana. Plus handy for Faction Farming :) Ooopps hush ! I only wished the Aug lasted longer.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Z-Bite is a great spell. HP &amp; Mana Spammer. Ingroups I cast this whenever it pops. But on raids when we might have 2 or so SKs in a single group, both spamming with this - add Theft of Life and Cric spells ! and you get some nice little heals.<br />

The points you guys made are just minor issues with spells etc. but nothing really big.  Class balance, tank-wise, is quite good at the moment, imo. Sure, there are some minor things that we all would like to see fixed (effect on ornate legs/bp as an example, Terror line needs a revamp etc.), but thats only really minor points and they dont have to do anything with class balance.<br />
<br />
<br />
Wow so much flaming is just getting out of hand and is diluting the issues that SK are not balanced and we are a dying class.<br />

Dying class! Only one Sk in my guild, actively. Two others show up once a month, if any.  I guess there is so many of us! The number speak by itself. Interpret it any way you want.<br />
<br />
Maybe there is tons of Sk's in your server. At least not where I am, at my level, where I play.<br />
<br />
Maybe the reason why people do not want to play SK is because there are some nerfing, unbalanced issues that need to be addressed. <br />
<br />
<br />
This pet issue. Well true, is nice to add dps. I just wish the damn pet would last longer. I have been using the pet more often and test its use. So far he does not last long in Sol ro. Did a hard ldon adventure, I am getting hit for 998, 500, 300. Had the pet up. He is dead in first fight. Still debating this issue in my mind as there are pet -AA points in Gates and I am not sure if this is a good buy. Will keep testing this particular issue. Only when I convince myself is a good idea to have a pet at this level of play will I  buy this AA. I think will probably get Run 6 first.<br />
<br />
<br />
The point that Brael brings is that  there are issues that need to be fixed. This is the point I have been trying to make all along. If warriors get their aggro issue addressed. Why Sk do not get their issues addressed? <br />
I say  we have issues that need to be fixed.<br />
<br />
Some think  addressing these issues is not dealing with balance? <br />
<br />
I think some here are just getting lost in semantics. Called it whatever you please balance, fixing, improving, un-nerfing. These issues need to be address to be fair.<br />

What changed was the planes of power expansion when many started to feel the effects of the &quot;Grass is greener&quot; syndrome and a high agro tank became nessesary.<br />

We have problems surely, and warriors did not need the power increase they recently got. Which leads me too this gem which im surprized got left out of the flaming love.<br />

You have Terror and Voice spells for aggro control. You think other classes want those? Hell ya. Your spells, minus a few stacking issues, are fine.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u84"><b>Kritr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p84">Minor issues. What I have mentioned here are not minor issues. <br />
<br />
Spells I am not able to use effectively or lost their original intent. Is this minor? Aggro issues. Is this minor? Weapons I  think are outdated and hard to get. Also a minor issue? A pet that is hard to use, of questionable use, another minor issue? <br />
<br />
I think, actually I know,  is all a matter of perception. In my perception these are indeed balance issues. I do not think I am alone saying that the warriors/ other melee  got a good, not to say excellent upgrade. I am not saying they did not deserve it or trying to downplay their aquired abilities, but their gain affected my toon, and my play.<br />
<br />
I have the perception that all these issues that concern my SK are indeed, at this time, an excercise in balance. <br />
<br />
There have been some other nice posts here in this thread and on this board in which other Sk's  are talking about issues  affecting them. I would not call any of these issues minor.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
On the pet issue. I do know that trying to get the pet from behind would make more sense to keep him alive, but it is just a pain in the neck as I am too busy getting hit, trying to keep my aggro and using the spells I need for the fight. Also trying to be sure I know where is my next target as we usually have several mobs in camp during our chain pulling, or ldon. So to pay attention among all the pandemonium that is going on during fights to the position of the pet is one of the least of my problems when I am trying to be sure that if the cleric or chanter get any aggro I go and help them and take that aggro on me. <br />
Remember what I am talking about here is on the practicality of using this pet. <br />
<br />
<br />
Finally if we are not a dying class, then we are are underplayed class. I am not that sure that we are so hard to play, it is that maybe, or  possibly some people get tired of playing second fiddle.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u85"><b>Mdiyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p85">When you say outdated are your refering to our epic?  If so, then think of this, for the level of content in which our epic was placed, it was and still is a very decent weapon(kunark era).<br />
<br />
As expansions have come along, the weapons previously thought to be powerful get overshadowed by the new and improved ones.  In Kunark our epic was powerful, until Velious came out and we were introduced to the array of weapons there, one of the most coveted being the primals, then Luclin came out and the one weapon ever SK I can think of has and is wanting is an emp sword, now you have PoP.<br />
<br />
PoP has given SKs a vast array of weapons that are both class specific and we share with our knight counterparts.  As we go through expansions the weapons we gain become more powerful then the weapons we previously had.  And for a long time it was hoped that our epic would be upgraded, however as can be seen its not going to happen, but that isn't a problem due to the fact that there are many more weapons of better quality then Inny's curse.<br />
<br />
As far as the effectiviness of our pet, I have to ask, if you have ever considered spinning the mob so that its back is to the pet?  Knowing how/where to position a mob is as much apart of tanking as taking the damage and keeping aggro.<br />
<br />
Our spells are okay, even for the common SK, they are fine.  Other then the Voice and Terror line of spells, can your really think of anything that is totally a waste?  I mean yeah we finally got an upgrade to Mental Corruption, but SKs that either haven't ventured into the GoD expansion, or just haven't gotten the spell drop I'm sure use Mental Corruption especially when they have SA 3.  But as far as wanting a total overhaul of our spells done in the name of balance just because the pure melee got tweaked some, I really can't see justification for it</div></div><hr />

Sk since pop have a greater variety of weapons.<br />
<br />
Let me see<br />
<br />
  1. Greater Stormwatcher Horn, Sk only. I do not have.This is not a comon drop. I have been in this raid 4 times so far and the rogue weap drops. No GSH for me. Rats, and I have been the only Sk in  these  raids and did not get my drop!<br />
<br />
 Any others?  I could be missing something here.<br />
<br />
<br />
   2. Oh! ...Let's see Arch L... Blindfoe. This is my present weapon. It has been mentioned in this thread that Blindfoe is not a good weapon. A raiding guild left it to rot!. <br />
<br />
This happens to be my beloved weapon at this time he he... or Maybe I should not be so happy with my weapon? <br />
Maybe I am fooled?<br />
<br />
<br />
  3. Inn course. Belongs to the museum of history of EQ.<br />
<br />

Where  are all these weapons  I am missing here? <br />
I go regularly to Al Ka and I am missing them.<br />

<br />
The only problem, I am not sure why,my guild leaders are not interested in doing Emperor at this time, although I do have the Emp ring to go there. I have commented on this to my guild and just do not want to create to many waves. I did want, still want that weap, but so far can not solo the Emp, ha ha.<br />
Actually my guild is not going to SSRA that much lately. So XCT and others although I have done them not seen the SK weap drop.<br />
<br />
Seru. I do not have the key, neither I have bane weap to fight him. Seems only one  section of the guild trying to go there.<br />
<br />
Crap, was passed over  in Saryrn  for Greatstaff of Misery, just one week ago. A Pally got it.<br />
<br />
About Greatstaff of the Four Winds, he he , my wife, a pally  has it. I was passed over on it. <br />
<br />
Have done HP in SSRA several times. No Sk weap drop yet.<br />
<br />
<br />
So at this time I eat dirt. Will keep the blindfoe as my guild  is not concentrating in SSRA, not sure when we will go back to the emperor. Now my guild is trying to  break into EP and time. <br />

 Is Deadly Temptation supposed to depleat HP and how much mana exactly do Deathly and Pact give ?<br />

 I find Deathly does take away any health while Pact can take down a fair bit. I wondered if the ratio of mana to hp is worth it.<br />

<br />
In pop progression I'm behind kirtr and peztilance and I dont see anyproblems with sks or our spells.  On the higherend I can see why people would complain, but im a ssra/vt level sk thats 1 flag from solro and rz from the other 3 elementals.  Guess what I kick ass.  I tank, kite, dps (roughly what my guild monks do), stay alive when other drop like flies, tank mezz, pull and a bunch of other stuff I cant recall atm.  <br />
<br />
I really dont see what our problem is.  Our spells are actually pretty good once you consider most of the resists mods on them.  I tank very well, both in the ability to hold agro and mitigating damage.  We have outstanding pulling tools in fd, pet and snare.  We can kite decent too if a mob is unsnaible and we have our horse.  On raids I find myself pretty useful even in just a DPS roll.  I actually put out pretty good dps with melee (golden rod) and spell dps.  In groups I can tack on pet dps, although my spell dps takes a big hit.  Not to mention thing like zeefers, aura of hate or aura of pain =P<br />

<br />
I do not intend this to be an offense, but please forgive me if my wording sounds a little condescending, it's not my intention, but this seems to me to be a relatively ginger issue.<br />
<br />
Your issues seem to me to revolve around personal dissatisfaction, and not necessarily around game balance.   What I mean by this is that you seem to feel restrained by forces outside of your control, limited to some specific zones where you've been hunting, which have gotten relatively old and stale, where you don't see &quot;hunting&quot; based upgrades, and struggle a little bit because you feel like you've hit the proverbial brick wall.  It seems like you feel due for an upgrade simply because you've played at the same basic position of power for long enough that you feel like a hampster on a wheel, not actually &quot;going&quot; anywhere but doing the motions nonetheless.<br />
<br />
Based on most of the responses I've seen, most people don't share your pessimistic view of relative tanking balance, so I cannot say that it's a class based thing, but instead a personal progression based thing.   You went off on a small tangent about how you kind of feel a little &quot;cheated&quot; on certain weapons, which I think that if you got upgraded, would be at least a temporary fix in the feeling that you aren't &quot;moving forward&quot;.   <br />
<br />
I recommend for your guild that you keep at Auliffe Chaoswind, or you get a little risky and go after Zun Muram in Ferubi.   A guild at your level should be able to pull him off fairly handily, and he has some INSANE weapons for the difficulty.  It would represent a different venue for you, and I think you'd do well with his weapon.   <br />
<br />
I just think that unfortunately you're projecting your frustration at not being able to move forward because of not being able to get into Elementals yet, and not moving real hard on other targets, as well as the fact that you've pretty much gained the AA based power that you're going to be receiving on class balance, when it's not a class balance issue, but an issue of progression, and a lack of continual return on your time investment.<br />
<br />
Try some new stuff, do some LDoN, you'll slowly but surely gain some gear.  It sounds like you're on the right track going after a Tak BP, keep it going, you'll do fine, and will gain incremental gear upgrades, and keep chugging along for that weapon you so desperately need.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u99"><b>Kritr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p99">Hey thanks for your advice Fro. <br />
<br />
But let me say I am not frustrated, I am not dissatisfied either. I am having a blast really. I love my sk and do not plan to quit playing him or bored at all.<br />
<br />
So far do not see the boredom here. <br />
<br />
I am doing more Ldon and as I said one shot from RZ. Just wish could have done him a couple of days ago, but actually one of the best, if not the best guilds in our server took him as they are farming BOW. Go figure that one. I guess ...

The whole Ziev situation is ludicrous as I even said I like it, it just need to be improved and this happen to be the balance of the SK board.<br />
<br />
zevfeer's bite is about our best spell, and you want it improved?<br />
zevfeer's bite is basically unresistable to all mobs except mobs flagged DISEASE IMMUNE. <br />
<br />
no, you can't cast it on luclin undead, you can't cast it on BoT south wing, you can't cast it on crypt of decay, you can't cast it on any of the various other disease immune flagged mobs in the game. you also can't land spears, auras, or mental corruption/horror strikes on these. you can either deal with it or avoid these areas.<br />
<br />
<br />
perhaps you just don't understand what balance means. in the MMORPG world, balance generally means classes having equal desirability in groups based on their ability to do whatever job/jobs they do. shadow knights are a tank. currently the three tanking classes are pretty balanced.<br />
warriors tank the best but don't have the agro output of SKs/paladins (pre time)<br />
paladins can stun mobs to reduce damage intake, and can group heal/rez.<br />
shadow knights do more damage than the other tank classes, and can lifetap.<br />
 <br />
<br />
you are really just posting things that would make shadowknights more powerful, and not explaining how this would be balancing anything that is currently out of balance. you seem to just want an upgrade.<br />

A cleric says<br />
<br />
<br />
When bards pull a hard ldon, you almost always get singles. Monks are good for hard ldon as well, and chanter pulling can be dangerous, but can still work.<br />
<br />
......<br />
<br />
<br />
I have done  a few more ldon and as you are in a timer the good old FD, peel is not what I would call the fastest way to do it.  When I pull I bring 2 or 3 and actually with a good chanter, shammy or bard this is actually good as we need to go fast at this. I have been able to pull fast and more efficient with my cleric.<br />
<br />
So as it goes for ldon an SK single pulling FD is not the most time efficient way to do it. At least in my experience.<br />
<br />
This week end I upgraded my Blindfoe and I am very happy about this but at this time I am wandering what type of effect I should put in it. I would like to get an aggro aug, but not certain which one yet. The yeska effect from guk would be an idea, but have not done that camp much yet to see if this aug is a possibility for my new weap or if it would be a good idea. I understand this effect cost around 720 points.<br />
<br />
This week end my wife won that &quot;little square hammer only pally weap from VZ &quot;. It looks cool on her. There was another SK there. Yeah, for once I was not the only one there. He commented that we Sk do not get any nice looking weap and then someone also said that the weap were nerfed and SK as there are not enough of them, sort of written off. The other SK comments that yes, we SK get the short end of the stick.  Hmm, I said to myself and the memory of all the posts in this board came to my mind.<br />

<br />
While I don't agree with most of the suggestions he made, there's an important point he was getting at that most of you seem to be overlooking.  Before melee rebalancing, every class had a defined role and since that has taken place the Shadowknight has lost its role in the game of EQ.  That point I couldn't agree with more.<br />
<br />
Many of the melee improvements WERE necessary/good improvements, but giving Wars aggro abilities has limited our usefulness in grouping situations.  Wars now have disc aggro that can't be interrupted, anger augments to increase aggro, and tons of weapons available to them specifically for aggro purposes.  Before the rebalancing I was a staple in groups/raids for building aggro and passing it on to the Warrior (if I was with a War).  It was our ROLE to aquire, maintain, and distribute aggro.  Now any decent Warrior is completely adequate in a group/raid as a tank/offtank for holding aggro as long as the group isn't filled with morons.  So what if SKs can still pull aggro off of Warriors  by chain-casting useless spells (which lowers dps since we're not hitting when casting)?  It's not a freakin contest.  Why would anyone want to group/raid with an SK when they could have a Warrior with perfectly good aggro abilities, more hps, better AC, arguably better dps over time, and a damage mitigation disc for big mobs or in case things get rough?  They wouldn't.  This isn't just about GoD tanking, this is about SKs completely losing their role in the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i'm not high end (where the problem is) and guess what? i can easily outagro warriors, mobs can be slowed on incoming when i tank, i can sustain about 1.5X the DPS of an equivalent geared/AAed warrior, can make up for less HP by lifetapping, make up for less AC by using aura of pain.<br />
<br />
as far as i'm concerned things are much closer to balanced.<br />
<br />
i don't think warriors needed the mitigation boost they got.<br />
the spread between knights and warriors is a little bit too far now, and there should be further differentiation between knights and rangers. BUT this is no reason to ask for death touch, /defensive, SoS, HP boost, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u117"><b>Kritr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p117">Wow is very refreshing to see that there are some people that can disagree without resorting to insults.<br />
<br />
I guess what I have read and talk to the people that attended FF do not have a lot of good to say on changes to come for the SK. Sure Sk can still tank, pull, use spells, but all in all the gap is bigger since the new expansions. I can notice this even if some say is only a GOD problem. I was going to do a hard  ldon and have been doing some research with the people in my own level and they say the tank should be 8 k or more to be safe. Some say 9 k is better. The Hard ldon I have gone I have not been the MT but actually i was the SA and got the adds. The warrior that has been with me is at my own level. He did real well. I have not tried being the MT, and actually was suggested by the group to let the warrior tank. As I do not have that much experience with ldon it was okay with me. Most of the time I am the MT in groups and it was refreshing to let the warrior do his thing.<br />
<br />
So there are differences with the expansion. I suppose some may say this are little things and not important to be included in the balance. But again, the point is not what you call it, the point is that there is a differece now that was not before and at my level of play, where I play it is evident. I suppose it is not as drastic as it is in GOD, I can not comment on this, but the difference is there. <br />
<br />
I still would like to see some literature on how this balance issues are dealt with, sort of see what is the formula these SOE people apply to get their conclusions. <br />
<br />
I talked today to an Sk during another raid to Bert. He is trying to join our guild so he came as a guest. He comes to me and asks me if I am the senior Sk and I say yes, I am the only one and lonely one here. I told him that I hope he  can join us so  it would be two of us. That is the life of the Sk, few and  and far in between.<br />
<br />
I guess one of the reasons SOE has not pay attention to SK is that there are only  a few that play this class, and what the heck, they are not going to lose their sleep over some obscure class and probably they just do not care much.<br />
<br />
To be honest  one of my best teachers when it comes to tanking and chosing gear and dealing with Sk issues is a warrior friend of mine. I guess he understands the issues for players at our level better than many individuals in this board that are stuck in their higher level of play and have forgotten some still play in bot, pov, sol ro and are not yet elementally or time geared. I guess that I can consider myself lucky to have somewhat decent gear, not uber, but decent. Some other SK are really much worse.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u118"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p118">Many of the melee improvements WERE necessary/good improvements, but giving Wars aggro abilities has limited our usefulness in grouping situations. Wars now have disc aggro that can't be interrupted, anger augments to increase aggro, and tons of weapons available to them specifically for aggro purposes.<br />
<br />
This is a fascinating statement that I feel deserves to be analyzed from a warrior perspective.   <br />
<br />
In essence, warriors have 6 inherent means of aggro generation.   <br />
<br />
1. Taunt <br />
<br />
2. Incite<br />
<br />
3. AE Taunt<br />
<br />
4. Spirit of Rage Disc <br />
<br />
5. Melee<br />
<br />
6 Rampage<br />
<br />
Of those, only 2 were introduced with the melee rebalancing, and of THOSE... only one is actually worth anything.   The discipline of Spirit of Rage while nice sounding... isn't beneficial really at all, I've used it once in my EQ career, because while using it, you cannot use more important discs, and if your other discs have expired, then you have enough aggro that it's unnecessary.<br />
<br />
Incite (or Berate, or Bellow of Mastruq or Provoke) are all useful, but in reality, they serve the purpose they were designed for.  Incite alone can nowhere near put a warrior to SK level of aggro generation, since quantitatively, it's less hate than a fear, darkness, or stun, and it has a 30 second cast time refresh.   One cannot analyze fairly the instant cast nature of incite while ignoring the quantitative benefit, as well as the refresh.   What incite does is what warriors needed, which is to give an option to add a reasonable amount of self-generated hate.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, a lot of people have a difficult time differentiating what players discuss, for instance when Brael discusses warrior vs. knight aggro generation issues, and talks about how warriors at the high end exceed knight aggro, there are certain conditions which make this true.   This is assuming the existence of a Raex BP, a Symbol of the Planemasters, Darkblade of the Warlord, and Edge of Eternity, both augmented with Anger 3 augments and WA5.   The amount of hate generated with that setup is amazing even without incite, but the jump from prior to time to that setup is a huge gulf.   Prior to time, I used a Blade of War exclusively, and while it was acceptable aggro, with each addition to &quot;The Set&quot; my aggro generation increased dramatically.   Unfortunately sometimes the logical leap is made that says that because of that, that warrior aggro is equal to or greater than SK (or Pal) aggro, and yet this isn't really the case without those aids.<br />
<br />
Warriors pre-time are significantly weaker in the aggro generation dept than time-level warriors, and are far below SK/Pal levels.   The other thing is that SK's can control aggro in all circumstances both ways, both building and reducing.  Even top end warriors have in essence a 1-way aggro street.   While this is mostly beneficial, a lot of times it isn't.  Paladins, since most of the aggro that they generate is &quot;at will&quot; can choose to be high aggro or low aggro with little impact on their effectiveness, warriors really don't have that luxury without dramatically impacting their effectiveness.  So yes, SK's are still light years ahead of warriors in aggro manipulation, and yes, warriors have caught up in terms of aggro generation, but pre-time it's not powerful, just &quot;acceptable&quot; which is fine.<br />
<br />
 Before the rebalancing I was a staple in groups/raids for building aggro and passing it on to the Warrior (if I was with a War). It was our ROLE to aquire, maintain, and distribute aggro. Now any decent Warrior is completely adequate in a group/raid as a tank/offtank for holding aggro as long as the group isn't filled with morons. So what if SKs can still pull aggro off of Warriors by chain-casting useless spells (which lowers dps since we're not hitting when casting)? It's not a freakin contest. Why would anyone want to group/raid with an SK when they could have a Warrior with perfectly good aggro abilities, more hps, better AC, arguably better dps over time, and a damage mitigation disc for big mobs or in case things get rough? They wouldn't. This isn't just about GoD tanking, this is about SKs completely losing their role in the game.<br />
<br />
I can think of several reasons outside of GoD Kod Named + to use a SK instead of a warrior, not the least of which is that groups like having pullers, and although others can pull faster, none that I've seen can do it with the precision of a smart SK with Jaboner Jr, the level 9 pet and darkness.   A SK as puller AND tank allows one group position to be used for two roles, and if it's pre-time we're talking about, one can increase the efficiency of the group by replacing one of the positions with a DPS type, the SK has established aggro on the pull, and can tank easily.    There's a lot of reasons to use a SK in pre-GoD content, and not as many to use a warrior quite frankly.   It's not a crime against humanity for the difference between warrior and knight in terms of durability to exceed the difference between 2 warriors with different gear.    I think that's rather well thought out.   <br />
<br />
I have yet to see a situation pre-GoD that gives an unfair advantage to any of the 3 tank classes anywhere in a single group setting, and haven't seen balance like this ever before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u119"><b>Kritr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p119">Before the &quot;little fix&quot; for the warriors I used to get tells asking me to join groups. The Sk was considered the aggro master. I was proud of it. I was and am still good at it.<br />
<br />
New expasion comes. Warriors catch up, not bad, this is okay. My kingships is gone. Now I share.<br />
<br />
Monks get lull, can pull faster, more precise. I can still pull and I am good at it, but now the monks have an edge. Again I am not really that special any longer.<br />
<br />
To tank in a hard ldon, actually when anyone asks me what is my Hp, I am sort of embarrazed to say raid buff I am now 7618. A lvl 64 pally only 24 AA has 7300 hp, this was the pally that was with me last night  doing an adventure. OMG I have 632 AA. <br />
<br />
I will have to work my ass, I know, to be able to break the 8 k mark making me more attractive for gps in hard ldon and be sure I do not screw up the healers that will be trying to keep me alive.<br />
A warrior my at my own level of play, meaning pre -elemental, and pre Time has no problems with this. Most or our warriors are 8k plus in our guild, none are fully geared up yet. All of them are in high demand for hard ldon, I am still a paper tank and to be able to get close to the warriors will have to keep working my ass off. Certainly 632 AA have not done much for this, the ornate gear blows and my only alternative is to keep this adventures in ldon going to catch up with the warriors in the hp department. I suppose you can call this discrepancy, maybe let's call it gap fair.<br />
I am just sick and tired of working so hard to keep doing my job now that my previous abilities had been reduced, my slight advantage in some aspects of the game had been minimized. I am a second fiddle, paper utility tank, my aggro is not longer that important when compared to warriors  and any other puller can match or better my pulling capabilites, especially in the speed of the pulls. So there is a gap that some of us, pre elemental / time sk, have noticed.<br />
<br />
We should change the word balance to gap. That sounds a bit better. This will never be balanced. We are a minority and that is the way we are being treated.<br />

This is the litmus test of whether it's a balance issue or not.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did they not pick me because of my class or my gear?   If I had different gear would they pick me?  Is there better gear available to me that could change my position?&quot;<br />
<br />
Your issues are gear issues and not class issues.   SK's tank LDoN hard adventures all the time, people don't reject SK's because of class, they reject undergeared SK's because they're undergeared.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u121"><b>Kritr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p121">Fro I do understand they are gear issues. The point is the I have to work doubly hard to be equal to a warrior. In my opinion warriors were able to get aggro before the new upgrades and expansion. It just had to be done more intelligently like for example if the warrior was the MT in a gp I always allowed him to get the aggro by not attacking or casting any spells that would deter him from doing his job. I got attacked by the mob and I did quit attacking or FD so the mob would have to go back to him. It was team work but warriors could get aggro before the upgrade. Now with the new upgrades are you all know their aggro capabilites are improved.<br />
<br />
Yes, I have a gear issue that is as closely to as good it could get in pop, ldon not included here. I do not feel bad about my gear, but really will have, actually I am, working my ass to get that gear that will make me somewhat comparable to a warrior.  <br />
<br />
I do not want to trivialize the game, but look, I am as hard worker of an SK as it can be. Some people ask me how is it that I am where I am, and if I even sleep. Now I can imagine the Sk that has no time or interest in working as hard as I have done so far. Where would they be. Any pally, warrior would be really ahead of them unless they really get their motivation up to catch up. Maybe a lot of people do not want to work that hard and they just quit their SK.<br />
<br />
I have decided to press forward no matter what, but that is just me, I see how some other people can get easily discouraged playing a class that is at a disadvantage. I just like playing the underdog, not the hot dog, I enjoy my role. Just want to mention there is a gap indeed. I have no doubt I will break 8k. I have no doubt I will do fine being MT in ldon, just not now.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u122"><b>Radahsam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p122">Some things to consider, Kritr:<br />
<br />
I have been tanking LDoN hard encounters for about 6 months now.  The very first one I tanked, my gear was about on the same level as yours - mainly pre-elemental, and mostly Velious-era and extremely low-end Lucline at that.  I'd wager that I was around 5k unbuffed, maybe 5200 or thereabouts with 1300ish AC.<br />
<br />
It was rough, but I tanked it.  I required two healers.  A 2-pull was almost suicide for me and my friends, all in similar gear.  It was a hell of a challenge, but we could manage it if careful and patient.  Our success rate was about 50% on hards, with the losses coming mainly from loss of time due to deaths (mine usually).<br />
<br />
I can now tank LDoN hards almost as easily as I tanked normals back then.  I was in a pickup group last night, and we had several 3 and 4-pulls.  We did have a death once, but it was mainly due to a charmed pet break - pet was hasted and wielding weapons, so chanter took it on the chin, then all hell broke loose.<br />
<br />
My AC fully raid buffed is now about 1950.  Still not stellar, but a huge difference from when I raid buffed to about 1500 (with AoP).  LDoN hard mobs routinely hit me for 200-300, rather than mostly 900s.  I still take spike damage, and it can be nasty sometimes, but that is the nature of a non-defensive tank.  It's something I can live with.<br />
<br />
If you take a good look at my gear, I am about half elemental and half VT-quality, including several actual VT pieces.  I have zero Time gear.  The best elemental piece I have are Grimror's greaves.  I can now tank LDoN hard missions quite well, and with minimal danger to the group wearing non-end-game PoP gear.  When you consider that LDoN came out AFTER PoP, and that hard LDoN missions are targeted towards VT/elemental+ players, it is working AS INTENDED.  Your primary problem is gear (or lack thereof), and it is fairly easily fixed, even with LDoN gear if you don't have access to an elemental-flagged raiding guild.  I know several people that tank LDoN hard missions perfectly fine in LDoN purchased gear, in fact.  It just takes a bit longer.<br />
<br />
It is quite normal for a warrior to out-tank an equivalently geared knight on new expansion content.  Yes, warriors were &quot;tanking&quot; LDoN hards a little better than me a month or two before I was.  But the difference wasn't night and day, when you compared similar gear levels.  The difference BECAME night and day when you compared me to a full elemental-geared warrior.  But at any rate, I was able to grow into LDoN hard tanking by simply farming some of the better gear (not end-game, mind you) from the previous expansion.<br />
<br />
That simply is not the case with GoD.  Knights with some of the best Time gear, plus some GoD gear are having a hell of a time with even the &quot;easier&quot; trial bosses, as has been mentioned in the other thread.  For the first time in recent memory, &quot;gearing up&quot; isn't a valid method for fixing our tanking issues.  Defensive scales with the difficulty in mobs, so when the mobs become twice as difficult, defensive becomes, arguably, twice as valuable.  The measly HP/AC gain you get from end-game PoP gear (aka Time gear) doesn't put very much distance at all between you and knights geared in gear from previous content.   That is the nature of the problem.<br />
<br />
I fully remember my first tanking experience in most expansions.  I remember how hard Luclin mobs seemed compared to Velks spiders (what a joke).  I remember how hard PoV mobs seemed the first time I stepped foot in there.  I remember how hard PoFire and PoEarth mobs seemed when I first tried to tank there.  In each case, I was almost shell-shocked by the damage output I took.  But in all cases, the solution to my tanking problems was clear....just get the next level of gear.  And in every case prior to GoD, it fixed the problem.<br />
<br />
Well guess what?  Brael, Brik, and Darko all have the &quot;next level of gear&quot; from where I'm at.  And they are all saying basically the same thing I'm saying.....they get beaten like pansies way too often in GoD.  How does that make me feel?  I no longer can hold on to the hope that Time gear will solve my problem, because it won't the way GoD is currently designed.<br />
<br />
Balancing issues for the &quot;common SK&quot; should include things like fixes for the Terror line, fixes for AotC stacking, fixes for FD pulling viability....things like that.  Those are good arguing points for pre-Time knights.  I know, because I am a &quot;common SK&quot; in comparison to many.  And even after melee balancing, I do not feel threatened much at all in pre-GoD content.  I still off-tank on raids.  I still tank in exp groups.  It's only been since GoD that I feel totally inadequate with virtually no hope that it will change.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Rad, this is the best reply, advice I have seen in this board. Well done I could  not said it better. You know exactly how I feel as you had just about the same hp/ ac unbuffed as I have now when I am faced with hard ldon. Tanking a hard ldon for me would be painful, scary and if two mobs come possibly a wipe. Until I get to that magical number of 8-9k hp I will gladly allow the warriors to MT. I will just lay back and enjoy the fun. You have spoken beautifully of where I am standing right now. <br />
<br />
I totally aggre as you said that the problem to fix, if it ever happens, I am not holding my breath, has to start at earlier levels. Have to be changes that are implemented for the pre elemental / time SK.<br />
<br />
I am not the only that has complained that for us follow the tail of  the warriors  we have to get that higher expansion gear to be able to in any way to be of any use but seems to me from what I have read in this board, and what you said, that is not the case any longer. <br />
<br />
I am not a game developer, and so far seems lots of these ideas and decisions are also politically as well as economically motivated. <br />
<br />
 Some of the thoughts of this board are altruistic; I think SOE does not know the meaning of this word. SOE is not Mother Theresa, that conclusion, I think is the truth.<br />
<br />
Ps. Ah, one more thing: Maybe SOE just wants to do away with the Sk, class. Face us away so people will jump to EQ2 or other products?<br />

<br />
Still what I see here is the the usual way for me to pull up to this point was pull, FD, peel. That would be just too slow as this is a timed event. So I keep pullig 2 or 3 and let the slowers take care of it. The cleric can pacify if he is able to.  So far I ask rangers, at least the ones I meet, and they do not like to pull. This is even more evident in GUk. So I pull, but not very efficently, like I used to do it in the past. A monk can do a better job and I will allow a monk to pull any time.<br />
<br />
Is nice to have a cleric to pacify, that makes a lot of difference on my pulls. Would be able to have some sort of pacify, like lets say pacify the dead for a camp like guk. So far I see most people do not like this camp, I love it. So far 18 wins no loses. Would be great if I could pacify dead, like high level pacify dead, lvl 65. Then, he he, I think I would always be there.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u126"><b>Kritr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p126">True their harmony does not work well. So I guess, the only advantage of me pulling would be that I can get beat real well and do not die easily during the pull. Single FD would make it to slow to be able to make it on time. This is at least my experience so far. Now on one of the hard ldon I did the monk was FD, and the warrior peeled, I was SA and this worked well but eat almost all the time. I guess monk lull does not work well in hard ldon.<br />
I am not sure how their lull works.<br />
I am still learing but still not sure what is the best way to pull in ldon. <br />
A few days ago I was the SA in a hard ldon. To my horrible surprise the warrior LD and guess... I am the MT. Damn, I did it but it was a very scary ride, considering I did not have my pocket cleric, at that time. The warrior came back but kept the LD several more times. I made it, considering that now I am 7708 hp, raid buffed, it does feel a little better.<br />

<br />
<br />
Let me see. Improvements that have nothing to do with class?<br />
<br />
Okay so to go over 8 K / hp I have to work my butt off when warriors that are even lvl 64 are same or ahead in the HP department. Is this what I would call a class issue.? Certainly getting more adventures, etc will help me get there.<br />
<br />
 Sure having almost 650 by now and my present situation gives me an insight that probably a lot of the writers in this board do not have. Being at the higher level game, ep and Time gives some insight I do not have but having as many AA a I have tells me that even when an sk uses all of his abilities still does not match warriors.<br />
<br />
I can imagine that Sk that do  not have this many aa will have even more problems getting their hp etc unless you have connections or belong to an uber guild. Of the sk I know they are having similar problems. Actually I remember being freshly into the level 65, having all kinds of trouble when people were asking me about my hp and gear. At that time, this was over one year ago I had a hard time in this department. I am in better shape now but it has taken me one year of getting better gear and accumulating more aa.<br />
<br />
At this time I am concentrating on ldon, buying better gear with ldon adventures and getting my adventure's stone stats up.<br />
<br />
This is really a lot of work and is not coming easy. I consider myself a hard core Sk, I play every day.  Only thing I am not in a uber guild and actually do not want that. Uber guilds make me feel ill. To many conceaded, infantile minds for me to deal with in that environment.<br />
<br />
<br />
I really think I have a much better understanding than you of the Sk, at my level, at my situation and having almost 650 <br />
AA. Now tell me how many AA do you have and how did you get them?<br />
<br />
I worked my ass to get mine, no one helped me and I am not in the elemental planes to get quick leveling. Mine has been all work, sweat and tears.<br />
<br />
Now I do know of some SK and others  that got good connections, jumped to uber end game- guilds and now are Ep and Time. Hey I am not comparing myself with them. <br />
Neither I am comparing myself with Brael and the others. For them what I do is trivial. <br />
<br />
I enjoy where I am now and that is what I am talking about. <br />
<br />
PS. Just crossed my mind after I did my post. Although my gear at the present time is not elemental and time. I am not there yet. It is not too bad either and is as good or better than a lot of SK at my level. So I am not sure what is it you are saying that SK are 1 k above me raid unbuffed.  Are you talking elemental SK? Because at my level where I am, in my server I am one of the best, luckiest geared Sk around. Actually I am the highest, best geared  Sk in my guild. So when you are going to compare me with anyone, try to make it an even comparison. Do not compare me with elemental, Time sk.<br />

Oh, well this board is just plain full of idiots. Oh, you are one of them. Welcome to the list asshole.<br />
<br />
Ha ha ha.... you miserable sunk.  Some people play this game to have fun. I happen to be one. What I am doing now is just the way I like it and according to my means, and my time. I have that aug on my BP as I did buy it by mistake a long time ago and do not want to waste it. <br />
I got it when I started doing Ldon and had no idea what a type 2 aug was. So I have it and will use it, take it away when I am done buying other pieces I need. DO not see the point of throwing it away. Once I get a better one I will replace it. I guess you as others, just have some sort of mental impairment.<br />
<br />
 So in the meantime as I do more adventures I am using it. That is my business, you piece of slime. I play this game any way I want you shit head.<br />
<br />
By the way show me your AA. IF you are elemental and Time, do me a favor and eat your own shit.<br />
<br />
<br />
Have a very nasty day, you complete moron.<br />
<br />
Ps <br />
<br />
By the way you are an insensitive  bitch that has no idea what is Alzheimer disease , but only a complete retard like you can make this statement. <br />
<br />
I bet you are in a mutual masturbatory guy guild, just the kind I do not want to be. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u131"><b>Boodadar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p131">Kritir.... where do i begin? you sir are a fucktard. 0-65 balance? i'm a 51 sk that has never had ANY problems with balance. at my lvl i'm never passed over for a war nor am i told &quot;no we're going to have a ranger/monk/bard pull cause they do it better. FD??? i've rarely had to use it as cc and out right high dps usually takes care of adds. the ONLY time i ever FD in a an xp group (espically LDON) is either when a pull goes horribly bad and i get the entire room or if i'm below 20% making it a hotkey would be a waste as i have much more useful hotkeys up. you want something to make you special? here are some tips for you<br />
<br />
<br />
1 make frieds, friends=groups with people who know what they are doing<br />
<br />
2 MAKE YOURSELF SPECIAL, people i group with don't say &quot;hey theres that sk i think i'be grouped with, they say &quot;Hey there's Bood, i KNOW he's not a fuck up.<br />
<br />
3 learn how to use what you have, i have 2 or 3 different spell sets cause we are sooo damn virsitle that i can kick ass where ever i am<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
i'm done and i'm sorry that there are winy bitches like you giving ME a bad name</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u132"><b>Kritr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p132">Bood, welcome to the magnificent list of sick slime.<br />
<br />
You are level 51 and giving me advice, he he . Oh, well, seems this boards are just plain full of  sick folk. Lots need their medicine adjusted or are only 10 year olds with the intelligence of a 4 year old.<br />
<br />
I can not have a conversation without getting into childish flames. Nothing about balance can be discussed in a rational way cuz or they are dumb shit, like you,or too high above and lost touch with lower levels. <br />
<br />
No reason to discuss with you what I can discuss with my dog as my dog can give me better advice than you. <br />
<br />
So you  won chief of the fucktards award of the day, look at my profile then talk. Then you get to 652 AA, and reach level 65 then maybe, if there is some hope you will know something I already do not know.<br />
<br />
Well holy shit, only level 51 and your head is full of air. I can see that if you ever get to be a high level and if you reach ep and time you will be one of the officers or one of the leaders of an &quot;Uber guild&quot;. You pass with flying colors the idiot test. You have what it takes to be there bro, you have the age and the intelligence to lead. Keep the good job!<br />
<br />
<br />
By the way, I did not give you a bad name. You already have a bad name for being such a moron. Your advice shows your make.<br />
Next time post your magelo, so we can see your AA and acomplishments. Then tell me how many ldon you have won. I have 90 wins, 9 loses.  <br />

So I have been going to other boards to learn as usually lower intelligence individuals post here. Seems this is the board of the cynical.. Here are the people that say...Speak here and  do not disagree with me, and if you do, you will  get flamed. <br />
<br />
This is the most disfunctional place I have ever been in a long time. Maybe that is the reason why Sk are having a bad time. It has horrible players. <br />

You are 14 levels under me and you are calling me names and insulting me<br />
 That tells me you are a retard with emotional problems as you can not say anything that is comprehensible. <br />
I doubt you even have a job.<br />

Now consider the whole spectrum form level 0-65 and beyond. <br />
That is what I am talking about.<br />
<br />
There are some prima donnas that think balance is for &quot;high level SK&quot;, GOD- Elemental only  SKs.  I think as the word balance means to me this is for all not only a few at the top of the game.<br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
soooooo... you're talking about lvl 51 and lower right? yeah i'm sorry i guess i don't know any thing about those lvls huh? and as for me having a job RL has nothing to do with EQ and just for the record i work at circuit city selling morons like you computers to be able to suck at online games.<br />

Your sentences are very short, you don't use alot of extra descriptive words, or any extra words at all for that matter.  That fact that you type &quot;ha ha ha,&quot; is also ridiculously annoying, and just your vocabulary and the way you use it is poor imo.  Have fun, your still fucking stupid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u144"><b>Marruk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p144">To summarize what we've learned from Bitr:<br />
<br />
He thinks the SK class is unbalanced because<br />
     his gear needs an upgrade<br />
     he doesn't know how to use his spells<br />
     he can't remember if he plays a warrior or a knight<br />
     he can't HT EVERY mob for more than a wizard nukes<br />
     some mobs are disease immune, and therefore his<br />
               disease-based spells are &quot;broken&quot;<br />
<br />
It is too difficult for him to spell ANYONE's name right<br />
<br />
Anyone who does not have his exact problems with the SK class<br />
     is a moron who needs medication<br />
<br />
His post is called &quot;Balance for the common SK&quot; because it <br />
     supposedly addresses SK issues at all levels of play, however:<br />
<br />
If you are lower level than him, you cannot dispute his claims <br />
     because you haven't experienced the specific part of the game<br />
     he is complaining about<br />
If you have progressed beyond the content he is currently at, you <br />
     cannot dispute his claims because because he is a fucking<br />
     hippocrit<br />
<br />
He is extremely familiar with a variety of prescription <br />
     pharmeceuticals<br />

He talks to his dog (the poor dog is now dumber for having listened, unfortunately.  As are we all).</div></div><hr />

HALELUJA! finally a fucker that saw the light!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u148"><b>tyrrax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p148">Here are some ideas I've had.  Some good some maybe not.<br />
<br />
-A single target mez.  I know, were not chanters.  But make it with a high recycle time so the SK isn't mezzing trains and zero memblur so that the SK will have aggro when it expires.<br />
<br />
-Slow.  Yet again were not chanters or shaman.  A slow that is not as effective as shaman or chanter but make one that stacks with theirs.  Maybe make it a tap to let us add to our DPS like our AC/ATK/Sta taps<br />
<br />
-Drain HT.  An AA that on command will add half the HT's damage to your HP kinda like a heal.  <br />
<br />
-Fix spell aggro.  I know this sounds nuts but this would get a big warrior bitch off our backs.  However improve our terror line of spells so that we use that to get aggro. After all why were they put into the game in the first place?<br />
<br />
-Damage aura.  Instead of giving SK's defensive.  Give SK's an ability to reflect melee damage or a portion of it back to the attacker.  Sort of like an ultra high powered damage shield.  The SK would still take the damage and need healing but would be doing more damage to the mob.  This might be ideal in the case of SK ramp tanks taking over in case the MT falls, the extra damage would create the needed short term aggro to keep healers and high end DPS from getting summoned and eaten.<br />
<br />
-Animate shadow.  A triggered AA ability similar to the pet swarm AA's that are out there.  This would create a shadow duplicate of the SK that can fight for a brief period of time.  The emote would be &quot;Soandso's shadow comes to life&quot;.  It would have similar raw stats to the summoner.  If the SK has a pet already it is destroyed.  Duration would be 30secs to one minute tops.  Think of Grom Hellscream's power in Warcraft 3.<br />
<br />
I admit some if these ideas may not be the best but maybe something different is in order.  We're not getting defensive.  We're not going to get new spells until the next expansion (if there is one).  We do not have the numbers to even some close to causing the uproar that warriors did.  Hopefully warriors won't be fighting tooth an nail against us like they have been in getting these changes.</div></div><hr />
