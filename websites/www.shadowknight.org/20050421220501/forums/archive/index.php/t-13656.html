<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>muuru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok I have the coin and have the spot were tracker Azeal is at 7pm game time he runs off to the city and returns at 12am were is this second spawn at is it bugged? i have a tracker sit there for 5 hours and it happened like that all the time. <br />
Also can I start greenmist at 49. Have all its for the mirror hand do so can i do it now or do i have to wait&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jabbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yeah, you can start Greenmist at 49.  The only tricky parts really are the Mirror (You'll need a pretty damn good group, or 2 maybe if they're low 50's), the Greenish Metal Shard (same thing, might need a couple groups depending on level), and the Glowing Cliff Golem (one group will do it... might even only need a friend or 3 depending on level).  The rest you'll find you can likely solo or duo with a healer type.<br />
<br />
As to the tracker, if I'm remembering the right guy he pops in the city then runs out and over to a rock near the cliff.  He'll reach the rock and wait there for a bit.  Uninvis from a distance and Conn him.  If he's Indifferent (he'll be in the form of a wood elf as I remember) then he's the guy you want.  Then just take the quest from there.<br />
<br />
Look in Dirty Deeds for the quest on Khukri's, it's all listed in there along with map points and specific locs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>muuru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">here is what I did....as a non-Iksar<br />
1. WATCH out for those nasty goodess...<br />
2. go to the spawn point of the Tracker<br />
3. at 7pm he will run off to the city<br />
4. sit and wait until he returns around 9-11pm<br />
5. con him.. he should be dub.<br />
6. give him the coin <br />
7. say 'what about the tome' if i can remember just read what he says to you...!!! this is what starts the timer for him to take you there<br />
8. the spy spawn spot is north of were you are at!!!<br />
9. go there and wait until he come and the spy does <br />
10 do not hail him again!!!<br />
11. summon pet and attack the spy first<br />
12. let pet attack the hero<br />
13. loot...<br />
