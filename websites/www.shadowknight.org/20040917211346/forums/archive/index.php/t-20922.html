<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nysstyre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I completed the IC quest and Greenmist quest on my old SK before I quit EQ.  Now that I'm returning, I was wondering if I should try those quests again or just forget it since I put my time in on my old character?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Stugein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Really the only person who can answer that for you is you.  If you already did the quests previously then you know what is entailed.  Ask yourself if the effort is worth the items for you.  Do you really want the items that badly?  If the answer is &quot;Yes&quot;, do them.  If not, don't.<br />
<br />
Me personally, I'm still working on IC and I will finish it, but I wouldn't do it a second time over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>nimic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You've already acheived these accomplishments, and that should be enough.  These weapons are barely comparable to bazaar loot nowadays.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>quickling1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Greenmist is still good.  Go for that if you want a good 1hs untill  you get a good PoP 1hs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ziglug D</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">imho you should just fackin get a WMBS... and Greenmist sounds like it may be fun to you then do that also, but if you have done IC once, I wouldnt bother doing it again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Yaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I had to do the quest a second time on the same toon because I lost my first Corrupted Ghoulbane turn in to a bad MQ, yeah it sucked.  A few months later I sucked it up and started over collecting the blades, but I did it all myself this time instead of askin for MQ.  Got lucky with the Soul Leech drop too.  But that was just so I could gain epic status with my toon.  Had worked on it too much to give up too.</div></div><hr />
