<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dravok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just want to say hi first of all to all SKs both big and small who read this post or for that matter even exist in the world of Everquest.  I am just starting out myself as a lowly lvl 1 human SK who's heart is filled with the rage that only his diety Innoruuk can fill.  I know I am not like most of you who post hear who have reach the level of being a Grave Lord, have extremely nice armor with uber stats, or have such awesome weapons like Innoruuk's Curse or Blindfoe but I hope, with hard work and tireless effort, to achieve that goal one day in the hopefully near future.  All I wish is for some of you to give me a show of support and maybe even a hint or two or becoming the best human SK I can be and which zones to fight in to unleash this hatred in my heart and level as fast asa possible to achieve that grand name of Grave Lord.  Thank you all who read this and may Innoruuk's hate keep you warm inside.;)</div></div><hr />

Babies Cry and Eat and Sleep and would get owned by an Orc pawn with a twig.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>synnoira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Starting from Freeport you have lots of good levelling all around you, plus they've added in those sk armor quests. I've heard they're a pain but they might keep you occupied. I went to nek forest at level 6 and hunted there. It's been revamped since and looks quite fun. Orc and derv camps will keep you occupied in EC/WC/N Ro/Oasis plus there is Befallen for a dungeon. <br />
I suggest you work you're way through High pass and then go through the Karanas to the Luclin spire and do some xping on Luclin. Above all else don't rush it and try to go new places and try new things, especially dungeons whenever you can. Oh and start forming your own groups as much as possible, one advantage of being an sk is you can make an effective group with just about anybody.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Putrid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Do E. Commons or neriak till around 8.  Get in an orc group till 12.  Then I would suggest taking a trip to the Warrens.  Good beginning dungeon with good loot, easy to reach zone line, and close bind point.  That will get you up to 18 or so.  There have also been some threads on Paludal caverns being a great place at these early levels also. I have not hunted there but you may want to do a search on this forum for it to get the details.<br />
