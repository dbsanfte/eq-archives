<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So I know this is a &quot;table spawn&quot; in the box room at location 12 on eqatlas map of KC, but it seems to me that I vaguely remember someone talking about figuring out a way to get into the room without having to clear all the way back to it.  I can't find the post now, though, and am thinking it must have been archived or removed.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know any tricks to getting into the box room and getting the blade solo?  I can run back and just FD off anything I come across, but room 10 (right next door to the box room, and directly on the path to it) particularly worries me, as it houses the construct of sathir, who was nice enough to summon me one time when I was in KC helping a shammy with his Canni II quest and give me a sound beating.<br />
<br />
I can make Thurg gate potions, so getting out shouldn't be a problem, but getting in worries me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dracul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I just followed a group in there and let them kill the mobs on the way. Got it in like 5-7 mins. <br />
<br />

Dracul</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>yuggoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">ITU and FD are your friend... I had no problem, even at 49.  Helps to go in at a time the zone is kinda busy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jabbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">ITU, FD, Circlet of Shadows.  I hardly know the zone at all and followed the lame map I printed out.  Had it in no time, then just made my way out.<br />
<br />
Simple. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jackkal Darknite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I just invised and ran there and back<br />
Zero problems.<br />
<br />
Then again, there was a group taking the entrance mobs and another group at the bottom of the stairs. All I had to worry about was the mobs on top but they wasnt no biggie.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Woot, got it tonight, like everyone said, no real problems.  I did just about piss myself when I took a wrong turn and almost ended up in the Construct's lap, but FD and IVU did the trick.<br />
<br />
I also picked up the hammer of 1406 tonight (took about 5 minutes; a huge thank you to whom ever suggested just fearing him all the way out of the fort and fighting him outside), and I have a mirror MQ lined up.  Things are progressing very nicely.<br />
