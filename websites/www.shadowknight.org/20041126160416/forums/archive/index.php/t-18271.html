We cleared all of Vex Thal last week.  This week we cleared all of Vex Thal only to find that AHR wasn't up when we got to the end.  Anyone have a good idea of Aten Ha Ra's spawn time?  It makes a difference in if I'll go to sleep now or stay up and wait for the spawn.<br />

Kinda odd that you clear all of VT and she wasn't up though.  VT isn't exactly a zone you can &quot; pick &quot; what mobs you want to kill.  You need to kill one mini boss to de spawn the Warders so you can progress to the next.<br />
<br />
If you know for sure you where the last guild to clear Aten, then she should be up soon for you guys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Souldee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My guild has been doing VT for the past few months and from observation AHR usually spawns between 5.5 and 6 days after she was killed.  Occassionally she is a few hours late, but not much and not often.  From my experience her spawn time is 5.5 days +1 to +16 hours.  But whether her spawn time is what I said earlier, or 6 days +/- 8 hours, it is definately not a 7 day timer.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Krassus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">6 days + or - 8 hours and most usually right at 6 days, all of VT except TVX's on same timer</div></div><hr />
