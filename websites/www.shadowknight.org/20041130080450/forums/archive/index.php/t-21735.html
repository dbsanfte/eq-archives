<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Synapticus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Healing classes get improved healing, why did we not get improve lifetap AA?<br />
Healing classes get AA's that increase the HP's healed by their spells, and they get spells to crit them.<br />
SK's should get AAs that increase Lifetap power by up to 30-40%, kind of like an innate ID focus for lifetaps only.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>nnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Theft of Life gives us a chance to Critical heal ourselves with a tap, but thats about it. I would like to see an improved heal type AA, or maybe throw some Improved Healing IV (or whatever the focus is called) onto some SK items. <br />
<br />
The only arguement I can see against this is that Paladins are the real healers, whereas SKs are generally supposed to be more about hurting others. So giving us improved healing may step on Paladin's toes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Our healing is self-only, theirs isn't - they'd get over it.  Pallys are currently a notably better class than SK's, bringing us closer to them would be beneficial; problem is healing isn't the way to go about handling our tanking woes, it doesn't scale and healing != mitigation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tramlok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i would like to see aa to further theft of life, along with fury of magic, that should help us a ton and bring us up to where we should already be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Synapticus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I meant an increase in damage and healed, but they other things work well too.</div></div><hr />
