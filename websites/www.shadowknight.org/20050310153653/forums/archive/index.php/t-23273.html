<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cryptia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Finally got my Epic 1.5 finished on Vazaelle this past sunday the 17th, around 2pm est. Thank god that's over! :D<br />

Along the way I found myself running into all kinds of small details that were worth noting, etc. I'll list them here, in case anyone is wondering the same things I did before doing a paticular step.<br />
<br />
-Misstress of Malvolence can be solo'd right on her own steps on the 2nd floor. Just snare/fd split the two mobs in her room and go at it. No need to go all the way out of the house, thus aggro'ing the mob downstairs.<br />
<br />
-When I fought the Breeder, the adds seemed to spawn on a timer from when it was first aggro'd. Every 15 seconds or so, another spawn seemed to pop out. We set up camp in the hallway just past it's room. Cleared the adds and wanderers first, then I aggro'd the breeder and pulled it through the opposite hallway, through the other round room and out onto the bridge and then I fd'd there. In that time I was able to get 3 spawns to pop, thus making the mezz job alot easier for my chanty friend. When I fd'd, the Breeder popped back to it's spawn location, the warrior pulled it single easily, and my group had it mostly dead before my 2 minute mem wipe occured so I could join in the fight. Had 8 people for that fight. Me, warrior, chanty, cleric, rogue, paladin, bard and another cleric jumped in to help. I should probably note, that we cleared the camp 4 times before it spawned.<br />
<br />
-Combined the sheath at 108 tailoring skill without a problem. Used crystalline silk, etc. to get my skill up.<br />
<br />
-Fraga was alot easier than I thought he would be. I walked in the tent, got target, walked back outside and stood south of the tent and was still able to pull him through the wall. He was single for about a minute then 3 friends added from the tents for some reason. By that time I just blew my HT and killed him off, looted and just zoned the adds. Had a druid healing, rogue, warrior, shaman and myself. The single target rampage was very weak.<br />
<br />
-The wailing sister really is cake. Beat her with myself, ranger and cleric.<br />
<br />
-The gnome SK in Iceclad is indeed soloable via aggro kite. Then I got some help and we took out the SK in Timorous Deep with myself, a druid and chanty. Next we killed the Ocean of Tears SK with the same group but added a rogue, which was good because he hit a tad harder and frequent than the other two so the extra DPS was nice. Then finally we took out the Swamp of No Hope SK with the same group. Note, that the 1500 lifetap hardly ever fires off, I was hit only twice with it.<br />
<br />
-With the 6 paladins in Kithicor, I was not able to pet pull for some reason. Maybe it was due to it being 5am and I was too damn tired to get the timing down. I just snare split the two frogs first since they weren't immune. After that I aggro'd the remaining 4, ran around like a fool and waited for them to split. Since they're pallies, they'll cast a spell once in awhile and that's when an easy split would occur for us. Had the chanty I was with pull a single, slow it and then tank it. They are that gimp. Had a cleric, monk, chanty, druid, rogue and myself. Was kinda overkill, but was nice having extra in case a pull got hairy.<br />
<br />
-Falmont was just like the guides said he was. Weak melee, the AEs were right on, the 2 second stun to the tank every 30 seconds, etc. etc. I brought 20 people and it was easy. Rampage isn't very frequent. Only thing that happened that I didn't expect was a named dragon aggro'd the raid, named Von. Wasn't a big deal at all.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that we were all Time geared with a little bit of Qvic thrown in. I used the guides provided on here and everything worked out great. Thanks to those that put the guides together and provided all the detailed information in various threads. :)</div></div><hr />
