<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Waydol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm interested in trying to solo some in HHK, but I'm not exactly sure which NPCs I'm looking for to kill.  Someone mentioned nobles.  Last time I was there was about a year and a half ago, so I don't remember too much about HHK, other than I do remember some NPCs upstairs were hostile to me even though I had good faction with the guards.  If I kill the nobles will I be KOS to the guards?  And will I be able to handle the nobles solo at 52?  My equipment is somewhat mediocre, other than the fact that I have a Windblade.  Thanks for the help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>AinilyeEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Go up to the stairs, theres a room on your right with Isabella Calus(sp) and 2 bards, on the left theres another room with 2 nobles. Isabella wanders between both rooms. Kill them all hundreds of times :D.<br />
<br />
You will be KoS to the guards and pretty much every1 else in HHK. Some faction hits to Queynos and Freeport too (who cares).<br />
Kill all the guards u see when u not killing nobles, they drop 2-6 pps and sword sells for 5pps. Theres a Erudite NPC (spell vendor) on the main floor on a diferent faction. Sell swords/gems to him.<br />
<br />
Easy fear kite spot, 1% xp per kill and good plat farming spot on the same camp. What more can u ask.<br />
<br />
Maybe thats why its allways camped ;) <br />
<br />
Started there at 52 if i remember correctly, so u should be ok. All u need is Fear and Dooming Darkness really. KEI helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nambkab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I made this camp an art form on Nameless, so here goes:<br />
<br />
What Ainilye said about the location is right.  Basically kill the guards at the top of the stairs, kill the wandering guard (Xantos I believe) and the guard in the bard room (named Bach, he will add as you kite).  Then go to the noble room and stand in front of the door that looks straight in on the nobles.  Tag one with Darkness and it should single pull at 52 with no difficulties.  Fear as soon as it pops up then beat it as it walks away from you.  It will path down the stairs, and normally I would refear when it got to the bottom if it wasn't dead yet.<br />
<br />
Now, if it doesn't come single you have a couple of options.  Personally, I never had luck with FD splitting, no matter how many times I let one return to spawn point, it would always re-aggro.  You can try to split this way regardless, but the best way I found was to dark one, target the non-snared one as it runs at you, then fear it.  As it runs helter-skelter through the zone (strangely won't aggro anything else when it returns) fear the snared one and beat it down.  Fear snared one again at bottom of stairs, then wait for the other to come running back (fear should be gone on runner at this point).  When it rounds the corner for you, re-fear, then finish off the snared one.  go sit at stairs where you can see corner of hallway and wait for fear to break again.  When he comes back this time, snare then fear and kill away.<br />
<br />
Good luck to ya!  It is a monotonous camp to be sure, but it is great xp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Waydol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ok, thanks for your help...I'm much less confused now. :)  Two things though, do I kill the aforementioned bards as well as the nobles?  And I am not KOS in HHK right now as far as I know (thanks to killing goblins as I lvled through the teens), but I gather that I will be as I kill nobles?  Thanks again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Salaam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You will go KoS very quickly to the guards by killing the nobles; the bards are on different faction (iirc). If the path takes them down the stairs then there are several guards who could add (2 at top of stairs, another a short distance from the bottom of stairs plus a wandering guard or 2). <br />
<br />
Kill the guards for the FS sword they carry, as they sell for 4-5 pp each and its easy/quick pp. <br />
<br />
You might also want to try Capt. Boshinko who is in the turret on the right side as you enter. Quick spawn time and nothing nearby except more of the greenie guards  and a low lvl bard nearby.(clear those out before you start your fear kite to simplify things). Bosh drops a sword (not worth much 1pp or so) and rarely a gem worth around 80pp or so You won't regret it, great exp and cash</div></div><hr />
