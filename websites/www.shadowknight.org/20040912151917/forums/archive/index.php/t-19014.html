<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Duke Xerro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Although we did not get any new discs..... I have noticed that the damage to my Harm Touches has greatly increased. With my improved damage 2 before the patch, I had done 7848 max (without any bard songs, etc)<br />
<br />
Now, with the same improved damage 2 item, and no other effects, I harm touched for 9113. I don't know if this is supposed to happen, or maybe a bug? <br />
<br />
Has anybody experienced increased damage in harm touches besides me?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gadaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have also, i dont have any enhancing aa but before patch it did around 1756 with UA and now does any where for 2200 to 2700 with UA</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Duke Xerro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I wonder if it was planned to act this way after the new patch, maybe to compensate for our lack of new skills? Or is it just a good dream that will probably end tomorrow in a new patch? :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>AngurProne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">HT'd for 2153 at lvl 59 with unholy disc  :)   experienced different figures each time i HT'd rest of the evening(low 1k, high 1700)..(2153 was very first use).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sivass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">yes , i saw a nice increase in my HT. I hope it was intentional and doesnt go away in the future.  Also I am very happy that Unholy aura and Leechcurse are on different timers. Leechcurse is a underused disc that has saved me from a late heal, bad pull or LD healer many times. Glad now that i dont have to choose one over the other.  On my cntl s window i have all 4 discs in there, but they are on timer 1 , timer 2 and timer 4 .  I would assume we are getting new discs in the future?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Duke Xerro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">We will most likely get new discs when the new expansion is released.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sivass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">There appears to be some focus effect in the unholy aura disc.  I will usually switch out my rings and use War Crested Ring to increase my HT , but since the patch my HT have been LESS with the ring than without it.  Has anyone has same issues or is it just a coincidence with me?</div></div><hr />
