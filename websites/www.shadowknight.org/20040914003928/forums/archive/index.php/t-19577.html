<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Skoggel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Certainly for hybrids, and I suppose an argument could be made to extend it out to casters as well.. I think a great AA would be an all around fizzle reducer. I'm sorta surprised it isn't already an AA... there are fizzle removing AAs for spells under level X, so it would almost be a logical next step to have one that reduces fizzles on spells above those levels.<br />
<br />
As painful as it would be for someone without 200+ AA, it'd make sense to have Spell Casting Expertise (and perhaps getting the upgrade to that with GoD?) as a prereq. Just having it as something like a 2-4-6 AA with a progression of 10, 15, 25% or so chance to not fizzle a spell doomed to fizzledom. The exact cost and whatnot aren't important as this is only a wishlist type thing, and I put roughly 10 seconds of thought into them, so all flames towards this will be ignored. :p<br />
<br />
I just hate fizzling so much. :| Especially painful while aggro kiting, but that's probably just cause I notice it more.<br />
<br />
Thoughts?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Squigle D'Muerte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I would be happy if they would decide if we are full casters or not.  If we aren't full casters then we shouldn't pay the same price for the same caster AA skills.  If we are full casters then we should get access to the better skills and equipment available to only caster classes.<br />
<br />
We pay just as much for SCF as a wizard but the wizard gets a &quot;tiny&quot; bit more benefit out of it don't ya think?<br />
<br />
Same for pet skills spending AA on pets doesn't help us as much as any other pet class (except silly Druids) but costs the same.<br />
<br />
We need a discount or class specific skills that even this out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Awaon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I want to see an AA that gives me an extra buff slot per level of skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>aress</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">fizzles are annoying, but only a FD fizzle is crucial.<br />
<br />
One can work around it and make the following hot key:<br />
<br />
/attack off<br />
/cast FD<br />
/cast FD<br />
<br />
if the first FD fizzles, the second always kicks in.</div></div><hr />
