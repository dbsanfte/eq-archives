<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>tanadil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK,<br />
<br />
After almost a year of playing EQ with this character on and off I have finally dinged 60. Cant believe it! thought i would never get there.<br />
<br />
I have 3 questions that I was hoping some of the members of this forum could shed some advise on based on their experrience.<br />
<br />
1: Where to hunt now?<br />
 - obvioulsy POV etc... is an option but I am not that keen. I will quickly explain why. I duo mostly with a 60 Cleric and we play on the server that appears to have the worst rep for twinks with no clue and grouping difficulty issues. (VS). As such although we always LFG we probably only get a full grp going 30% of the time. Bizarre but true:P<br />
<br />
2: I have stopped now at 60 to do the basic 6 aa's. ( i am focussing on ldon's to achieve this) The reason why is sheer boredom at the lvl grind and peer preasure I guess as again most everyone seems to now be 65 with a shed load of aa's:( <br />
I know conventional thinking is to grind to 65 then do aa's but will it really hurt me to stick around at 60 and do these 6 aa's?<br />
<br />
3: I have a limited budget, but I belive i have spent what I had well. Obviously palnes will open up some more gear options, but are there any glaring phook ups in my magelo? Please bare in mind this is my first and only character.<br />
<br />
I have done Veksar, POI,POD,PON to death and my guild whilst desperatley trying to get everyone access to BOT etc... is in a state of severe upheaval so for now its me and my cleric friend.  I play whatever role is needed, but mainly MT and/or pulling.<br />
<br />
I know its another limp wristed help me please post but seriously now I appear to be at the higher end game I am a tad lost as to where to go from here.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1)  PoV mostly... and LDoN.<br />
2)  Get at very least run3 asap... you should have gotten that already.<br />
3)  Some gear ideas... cloak of greater pernicity or hierophants cloak, get your PoP charm, some gauntlets with hp on 'em instead of crystal chitin, solstice earring unless you've absolutely positively got to have the see invis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kazral Shadowthirst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">SKs already get an ultravision and see invis spell if you need it, it lasts 30 mins so basically one cast of it while you travel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you can get a group with a Druid or wizard to get out, I'd suggest Droga.  King camp is a blast and you can get yerself a copper hammer of strinking.  Not sure about exp there at 60 though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Assazzin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Looks good to me, but i would think about upgrading an ear slot to Earring of the Solstice   <br />

This item is the result of a quest.<br />
<br />
Protection of the Cabbage (Earring)<br />
<br />

Found in:<br />
Fungus Grove<br />
<br />
 and maybe try for a bejeweled chestplate from LDoN ive seen them go for 10k or maybe get lucky in a ldon group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ramgar SK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My last 4 levels have been all over.  I'm currently 64.<br />
<br />
At 60 LDoN seemed to drop off and lose popularity.  It was still fun, but got old.  I have done many things, mostly 2boxing, to get me from 60 to 64.<br />
<br />
Torgiran Mines and Nadox are still great exp for me and would be good at 60.  Set up near a zone, make a pet, and pull what you can handle.<br />
<br />
PoV is really good exp if your group has cheal and slow.  I've still died several times, even with a good group.  There is little room for error there.  The golumns just hit too hard to allow for mistakes of any kind.<br />
<br />
Velketor's Lab. is still great exp for you.  Get the named camp and pull like crazy.  They die fast, don't hit hard, and there are lots to pull.  Might even make some cash.<br />
<br />
Veksar entrance would also work well for you.  Plenty of goblins to keep you busy, and a couple named can spawn there.<br />
<br />
PoP exp can't be beat though.  A good planes group will set your exp rolling.<br />
<br />
Don't sit LFG.  Make the trips, talk to groups in person (not shout to zone).  I've found this to be the best way to get a good group.</div></div><hr />

Whichever website this came from should update it to say common as dirt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Vaeluur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">while having not been to the new howling stones yet i would say that my time in the revamped zones of cazic and greig's end has been great...not quite pov level of xp, but damn close for the fact that it is easier.  did one chardokb group at 59 and that was pretty good too--would guess sol c is on the same lines.  you should easliy be able to tank and pull those places.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Squigle D'Muerte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It is possible to fear kite in PoD by the courtyard.  Pull feeble rats, wandering biles and goos back but be VERY careful and patient doing so.  They have added a butt load of higher level wandering mobs now so if you get a spider DONT go back to Cleric LOL.  I hate those spiders.<br />
<br />
Nice thing about duoing with a cleric is that you can tank a bit but if you keep mob snared Cleric can fear it for you so no interrupts.  Mobs hit very hard here though so don't think &quot;It's just a rat.  I can tank a rat.&quot;  Everything there packs a punch.<br />
<br />
Also Nadox is very good at 60.  I camped there till like 62/63.  Get the camp by the zone to Torigan and you can also get some occasional nice drops to sell in bazaar.  Very safe here, zone to your back and easy single pull static mobs.  Most people don't like Yek zones because they are such a long run from PoK but that is what is nice about them - seldom crowded.</div></div><hr />
