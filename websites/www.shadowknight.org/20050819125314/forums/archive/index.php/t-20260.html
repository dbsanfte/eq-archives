Reason being for shits and giggles.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Saruton</div><div class="date">02-26-2004, 02:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do it solo. Take a gate potion along flop yourself to the north spot and start to kill. At 59 probably best would be to carefully fearkite at north ss. I had no problem at all at 65 to clear the plane, its just boring and tedious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bloodmere</div><div class="date">02-26-2004, 08:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">SoE has implemented a new mob in Fear called the Ireblind imp, this mob is thought to pop when an ordinary imp is killed, and reports say that he is a pain to take down even with a raidforce. 20 secs Mezz  chaincasted with about 6 secs between, 3 waves of mobs at different hp %. So IF you go in there, stay away from the imps. The mob is for the Berserker epic btw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Groff Gorespiller</div><div class="date">02-26-2004, 09:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Indeed.<br />
<br />
Someone on our server board posted a small rant about this mob, detailing a 6 hour corpse recovery involving at least two different guilds, both of which had moved well beyond the old world plane level of play already.<br />
<br />
Be warned, this shit looks nasty now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TaurusL</div><div class="date">03-04-2004, 10:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Was in there Tuesday night with guild trying to do a Warrior epic piece off the golems.<br />
<br />
This mob does not stun/mezz unless it is engaged.  It pretty well kept to itself and if you quit engaging it would not chase you.<br />
<br />
Beware his AE has a huge range.  And could actually get you at the zone in point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nikumu</div><div class="date">03-04-2004, 03:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That stupid mob got me killed recently.   <br />
<br />
I had decided to go into PoFear and solo for some shits and grins, but another guild was clearing the plane.  So I went to a far corner of the plane, FD, and went AFK for about an hour.<br />
<br />
The AE on that imp is huge and WILL drop you out of FD.  Needless to say the guild engaged the imp and I got dropped out of FD.  Checking my combat log i kept getting shadowstepped all over the zone.  Took the mobs quite a bit of time to finish me off.<br />
<br />
Frustrating when you die and your body isn't where it should be :D</div></div><hr />
