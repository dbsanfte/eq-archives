<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Laronx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Listen up warriors, it is no secret that your class has problems right now, it sucks to be a wrrior, especially if you aren't the main tank in a raiding guild. We agree with you. We agree that you need a better role in xp groups, however, you do not need *our* role. There is no denying that most groups will turn away multiple warriors while waiting for a knight, and this is wrong. Honestly though, it has nothing to do with our tanking abilities, and is all about aggro. That's it, aggro, 100%. Warriors are still the kings of hp, ac, and mana efficiency for the healers, but only if aggro is maintained. Therin lies the rub, as knights are pretty close to you in your specialty, but you are nowhere close to us in ours. But is that really all there is to it?<br />
<br />
I don't think so, but let me start off by saying this: We agree that groups holding out for knights to tank is wrong. On the flip side we believe it would be wrong if they held out for warriors as well. Ideally if a group is looking for a tank, the first one they come across should be fine, be it sk, warrior, or paladin. That being said, how many of you realize that a lot of groups hold out much more than that? I have seen xp groups take beastlords, rangers, and shaman over warriors without even blinking. It is really that bad. I also play a cleric with a group of freinds that gets together and just grinds xp and shoots the shit, none of which is a warrior or a knight, and it's almost a foregone conclusion that between the beastlord and the shammy, we don't really need a &quot;tank&quot; of any kind. Added to the fact that no matter what, once you have one of either (knight, war), adding a second of either is almost unheard of, yet how many times have you xp'd with more than one wizzie? more than one druid? a ranger and a druid? You get the point.<br />
<br />
This points to the fact that even lock tight snap aggro probably won't change a thing. You need much more than that. I've said it before, and I'll say it a gain, it would be a disservice to you as a class to accept simply either copying one of our abilities, or nerfing us as a &quot;fix&quot; for your class. Changes are needed on a much grander scale for you, because believe it or not, knights are pretty balanced to every other class in the game. As a matter of fact, with the exception of warriors (and maybe that hit monks just a little *too* hard with the nerf bat..hehe nah!) the classes are all fairly balanced against each other. Also, we are balnced in relation to the monsters in the game, that means that we lose effectiveness across the board, even if we're soloing, even if we're in a group that has a freakin warrior MT and we arent taking shit from anyone, what it means is that group will kill slower, and thus be at a greater risk of dieing, and everyone loses in the end. They aren't going to screw all that up just for one class, and they fucking know it, which is why exactly jack shit has improved for you in 3+ expansions.<br />
<br />
You need to fight for fundamental changes to the game, and stop singling out our class. I firmly believe that warriors can become a viable class, somehow, without infringing on knights at all.<br />
<br />
I will give you a few examples of changes, these are fundamental changes to the game though and may seem kind of extreme, but that's what you need.<br />
<br />
First, everyone agrees that the idea of knights being true hybrids was thrown out the window long ago. However, at a basic programming level, we still have a lot more in common with our warrior side. This shouldn't be, we don't share any kinds of ac/attk/etc. tables with casters, why should we share any with warriors. Warriors should get their own, their ac should be calculated differently, their ac should be calculated differently, as differently as an sk's is from a necros. This would stop any further benefit for knights when they are just trying to tweak melee. Not only that, but you should have a completely set of tables than other pure melee. Monks already have some seperate tables, so in effect it would seperate rouges, monks and warriors totally.<br />
<br />
Necros do far more damage than sk's if each only use spells, and if the sk casts and melee's the necro still outperforms him in sustained dps, which is the advantage of being a &quot;pure&quot; class, and theoretically losing some utility. The same should be true for warriors, you should definately outdamage us if we are both only straight meleeing, which with the difference in skill caps, is basically the way it is. However, you should in all honesty do more *sustained* dps than us even when we use spells, as should be a benefit of you also being a &quot;pure&quot; class, it's that way in relation to the other pure melee, rouges and monks definately do more sustained dps, but they can't tank. That's not really that important though, and I'll explain why in a second.<br />
<br />
I have lightly touched on two things I'd like to address at this point, the first, tanking doesn't stack. This is a problem, like I mentioned before, there is exactly no reason to have an extra warrior or knight if they aren't tanking. Yeah they can add a little dps, but you could pick 5 classes that you would put before us in that regard. Maybe offtank, but unless you're absolutely sure there will be many adds, a second shammy or bl could  could tank infrequently enough, and they would be much more beneficial when they weren't by dotting, back up healing, slowing, etc. So theres another fundamental flaw, tanking needs to stack, and it doesn't, fixing this benefits any tank class, warrior paladin, or sk.<br />
<br />
The second thing, I think in comparisons to what warriors can and can't do, I have mentioned every class in the game. There is a reason for that. Every class in the game has abilities that make them unique, and in certain circumstances the best there is at a certain thing. Yes, I know, warriors have defensive. I'll say this right now, it's a turd, I will do us all a favor and act like it doesn't exist, using it to argue as a favorable ability for warriors is wrong. Think of it this way, if disc makes you take half damage, than in theory you just cut the number of warriors you need in half as well. I'll get back to that point later. The point about abilities that I am trying to make is that even the other so called &quot;pure melee&quot; have abilities that make them more usefull than warriors. Monks have fd, mend, rouges have backstab, sneak, etc. And almost everyone does more damage than warriors. In every way warriors are inferior to someone, I don't even really know why anyone would roll one up at this point.<br />
<br />
This discrepancy is all about utility. There are many different facets of utility, I will break them down here into the major categories.<br />
<br />
1) The &quot;save my ass&quot; utility. This gives certain classes the ability to save them and only them in case of emergency. Some classes get a form of harmshield, that at least helps them get to the zone to save their own ass. Some classes get a self only gate to bind, if you're going to your bind anyway this is always the better option. Some classes get fd, others can at least root or snare a mob, some others can at least invis. The point is, that even though none of these are guaranteed life savers, every single other class has at least one form of it, at least you have a chance. What do warriors get? If you're lucky some jboots and an OT hammer...<br />
<br />
2) The second is the &quot;Shit hit the fan&quot; utility. Not every class gets this one, but many do. Wether it's evac, group heal, LoH, or even the occaisonal AE blind or stun, almost every class has at least one ability that could be used in a pinch to make sure that even if your group can't kill it, it won't kill you. What can a warrior do? Die first most likely.<br />
<br />
3) The next is the &quot;OMG I PWNed that mob&quot; utility. This is the burst dps utility. Manaburn, Harmtouch, Backstab, Dragon Kicks, AM3, even spell crits. These are the eye candy that makes killing stuff fun, and the majority of classes have some form or another of this ability, and the ability to have it reset fairly quickly. What do warriors have? That crappy disc that makes you hit a whole bunch of times for like 12-17 damage? I have never seen a warrior use that disc without it being followed by someone in the group typing LOL.<br />
<br />
4) The next is situational utility. This is the ability for almost any class to join a group that already has someone filling the main role they are intended for and still reasonably contribute to the group. This includes changes in tactics that are available inherently from having a spell book. Any casting class has many more spells than they can mem, so if someone is already doing their main job, it is much easier for them to adjust their spell line up, and still bring sometyhing to the table that benefits the group. I will include the ability to cast pets in this category, but only for the classes that aren't inherently dfined by pets, necro, beastlord, mage, etc. For other classes that have low damage, in effect &quot;extended dots&quot; for pets, cleric hammer, shammy pet, sk pet, etc. This is situational, a lot of times these classes, if they have the ability to use their pets in group, they are most likely not performing their primary function, i.e., an sk might not have his pet up if he's pulling, cleric might not cast hammer if he is the main healer. What else can a warrior do if he's not the MT, umm exactly the same thing he would be doing anyway?<br />
<br />
<br />
5) Next is general buffs. Finally, something warriors benefit from. Hp, Ac, haste, regen, Ch, this is the stuff that defines warriors. Unfortunately, even though warriors recieve none of the other benefits that I listed above, the one that they recieve the best boost to their best usefullness, *everyone in the game gets exactly the same benefit* This is why you see shammys tanking, they have decent ac, enough hp's that they can usually live at least long enough for the cleric to get a ch off, and they recieve every single one of the benefits I listed above.<br />
<br />
So, even if you gave warriors the one unique ability of snap aggro, you would still be lacking in all around utility enough to still be getting passed over to tank. Then what? You have snap aggro, and the most hp/ac, but the LFG pally has enough hp/ac to tank, still can hold aggro well enough, and can heal buff, hmm, I see the pally still getting lots of groups. Or that LFG sk, he can tank well enough too, and we need a puller, or he can feed us mana, you still lose that group to the sk as well. Add to that, the sk and pally may well end up in the same group, but two warriors in the same group would still be useless. The sk and the pally can group because they have more utility, even if the pally is holding aggro, and being mt, the sk still has adds more to the group than a warrior would.<br />
<br />
One simple &quot;aggro lock fix&quot; simply will not do it. You need much more than that, and it may very well be that whatever you gain would infringe on many other classes, I don't really see how it couldn't. I think all the other classes should be ready to accept this. I don't however feel you should &quot;steal&quot; a role from some other class, just so you can have a role. <br />
<br />
I say you guys need a fairly substantial dps gain. Every class that can deal dps, with the exception of priests, has the ability in the right circumstance to be the one at the time doing the most damage. Why can't a warrior have a manaburn-harmtouchish ability? Maybe it could burn their hp bar like it does for wizzie mana. It could take 12 secs to do it, just to keep the cleric on his toes. Why can't a warrior have some form of pet? Almost every class has one in some form or another, why can't they have a war dog or something, that is only good for situationasl use. My idea would be to have the warrior pet basically do a &quot;shield&quot; type thing automatically when the warrior is attacked, so that it takes all the damage first and dies quick with a long reuser time, so if the warrior is MT it wouldnt be that useful, but in a secondary role, it would give them utility, which is how it works for any non pet defined class in a secondary role. Why can't a warrior have some kind of &quot;save my ass&quot; ability? Why can't they have a big badass attack, like backstab and monk kicks? Why does everyone get the same benefit from buffs? Why can't warriors get a skill that scales upwards as they level that makes them get an inherent bonus from certain types of spells? Maybe it should just cost healers flat out more mana to heal anyone but a warrior.<br />
<br />
Should they get all of these abilities? Hell no. The fact is though that every has class has at least one of the main abilities I laid out above, and a lot have 2 and 3. As it stands right now, not only is there no reason to have a wariior in your xp group over a knight, there's really no reason to have a warrior in your xp group at all. It is time that warriors got to at least share in some of the basic utility. No other class should cry foul if they give warriors a few new abilities that happen to come from our bag of tricks. Keeping in mind they shouldn't gain so much of any one that it overshadows them, but a few from each to make a unique whole. Every class out there shares some of it's utility roles with another class, and it hasn't killed them, so let's not bitch when warriors get a few toys too. Yes, some of it may be eye candy, but I think one of the things that sucks about being a warrior is that no matter what, for the entire life of your character and your career as a warrior, you will push maybe 4 or 5 buttons. Let's face it, even some of the meaningless toys at least let you have a little fun, and that is after all why we play this game. I do think that a few fundamental changes will really benefit you though.<br />
<br />
All in all these are the things I think will be most important to you becoming a viable class:<br />
<br />
1) Make tanking stack. Do this by giving warriors at least enough utility to fill in some secondary roles if they are not MT. Also, they may want to make stamina actually mean something, maybe after a certain amount of time, your stamina is depleted and you have to rest. Either the group can do nothing, or the secondary tank can take a few. This would be equivelent to the cleric having to med and the druid taking over heals.<br />
<br />
2) Make warriors the best tank again. On paper they are, in terms of the highest ac, and most hp's, but having the &quot;most&quot; really doesn't mean anything more than the 5 or 6 other classes that have &quot;enough to do the job&quot;. Make the difference inthe way warriors take damage over anyone else totally different, make it matter. Make a warrior be so much more mana efficient to heal that it really matters.<br />
<br />
3) Run screaming from defensive disc and never look back. At the very least it will increase the need for warriors on raids, and that will filter down to the rest of the game.<br />
<br />
4) Give warriors a few toys and maybe a little survivability. This by no means should be the only or even a real important thing, but more stuff to do just makes the game more fun.<br />
<br />
5) Make /shield better. This is one thing you have thats actually a decent idea, especially for xp groups, make it more worth using, maybe even more of a direct exchange of hitpoints between you and the person you are shielding. And here's a crazy idea- add some decent aggro to it. This could be a much more defining ability or warriors. You would have the ability to save a caster and grab aggro back. This could be your &quot;shit hit the fan&quot; utility, it should have a decently long refresh time, so that like most other classes &quot;shit hit the fan&quot; ability, and you can't really plan your group strategy around it.<br />
<br />
5) Don't steal anyones role. Snap aggro is ours, it always should be. Perhaps there should be a way for knights to dish aggro more effectively. On a personal note, his is the one defining ability for knights IMO. It is the favorite thing about my class that as a shadow knight, I can do something so evil and vile to a monster that they just can't ignore it. Likewise for a paladin to call down a can of holy whupass that they just can't ignore. You shouldn't be trying to take our role anymore than you should be trying to become the main healer. Knights technically arent the best tanks, that should be your role and we don't want it. Unfortunately, we are the best tanks that can do a bunch of other stuff, and thats the problem. Above all they need to make being the biggest, toughest, meanest piece of meat on the block mean something.<br />
<br />
I know this has been a long post, thanks if you suffered through it, it's nothing more than my opinions, if I really knew how to fix balance issues in video games I would be getting paid to do it. The main thing I hope you take from this post is that we support you wanting fixed, but in all fairness you signed up to be a warrior, and that means nthing but being the one able to take the most punishment out of all the classes, you should stop at nothing short of having that actually mean something again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Drynnious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Very well written. I can see you thought of both sides of the arguement, instead of trying to play up sk's. I think you have a lot of good points in there, and a lot of good idea's.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Silence</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">it is well written and offers good points, <br />
<br />
an idea hit me when i was thinking about  how they could possibly give them skills for utility  without making it some kind of spell or using the stamina bar or some other weird thing... <br />
<br />
what if they gave warriors a Warcry skill  give it a bard song cast time (i know they have that AA but it works from a RP perspective and gives em cool names) <br />
<br />
make one like Burnout for warriors... give it say a 72 minute reuse time  make it like their disc that makes em hit for 4x the dmg of their weapon for oh 15-20 seconds and give it an enrage quality or just an extended chance at flurry / double / triple / riposte    this would be a good burst dps type thing, name it Warlord's Bellow<br />
<br />
make one work so it hardens the warriors skin to diamond making him invulnerable for 18 seconds  save yer ass  name it Cry of Pain ( give it a 10-15 minute reuse time)<br />
<br />
make one group useful, say a  haste (30-40%) that stacks with ench / sham and lasts a minute  and adds 150 atk for the group and for the warrior only  make it 150 atk 100 ac  maybe an extra 10-15 % haste for them only...  (reuse time like 10-15 minutes)<br />
Bulstering Cry<br />
<br />
its a set of skills gives them utility kinda... couple that with  increased DPS  like you said  and the increased mitigation or avoidance  that may just work</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sadyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I like the suggestion of improving /shield it would do alot for warriors.  Here's another, warriors get more and better crits than any other melee class, I realize this isn't a big thing but improve on it and it could be.  Also, when low on hp's warriors go berzerk, they get more/higher crits and crippling blows, why not make this a use ability that drains Stamina (that little yellow bar) when used and can only be activated every xx min and lasts until the stamina bar runs out.  Additionally, you could throw in some of the DnD barbarians rage into it with a boost to str and sta that can exceed any and all caps, and lowering of their ac.  They hit harder, faster, do more damage, gain a boost in hp's and get hit a little more often.  I realize alot of these are there to a degree in their disciplines, but only useable one at a time and for very brief periods.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grimmlokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">warriors get more and better crits than any other melee class<br />
<br />
 Well, we might get slightly more, but certainly not better than other melee classes. It's the same multiplier for everyone. And rangers and rogues get the most benefit from it by far. Also, pretty sure the gain for a warrior from max crit AA's is a lot less than another class, relatively speaking.<br />
<br />
 Anyhoo, good post. But I didn't read the whole thing. All stuff that's been hashed over a hundred times on war boards sadly=/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>derakolwtf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">yeh that sounds good.... even though i didnt read it. someone summarize this, need information in short spurts like tv commercials.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Xanathol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think its a nice post, and hits most of the points on the head. My opinion may vary with some of the suggestions, but the basic ideas are there, and that's cool. One point I had a slight issue with in the post was:<br />
<br />
However, you should in all honesty do more *sustained* dps than us even when we use spells, as should be a benefit of you also being a &quot;pure&quot; class <br />
<br />
Umm, no, have to disagree there. Amoung the tanks, and the tanks alone, the SKs are considered the 'most offensive' based tank. Our melee is lower, and it should be, but with spells, we should surpass the warrior, whether its burst DPS or substained. That is our true specialty, and gives reason behind our aggro, even though our aggro generating spells do little or no damage, it just gives 'reason'. Other than this, the post looks cool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ziglug D</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">And I havent seen anyone post this yet, But we have a EXP penalty for our spells, we picked a SK they picked war...and if they were gonna complain about us having spells like Furor did, and he expects our spells to just have the aggro stolen away from them, he is wrong...<br />
<br />
<br />
But anyways, I wouldnt mind a snap aggro thing that warriors can use on every mob, like only once on each mob, But make it so its like snap-400 aggro...then the rest of fight they will need to rely on procs...But SOE DID MAKE the warrior the &quot;pure&quot; tank, and Shadowknights and paladins are definitely better tanks, So maybe if they made the snap aggro thing, We would be equal and the only thing to worry about when a group chooses MT is, DPS and maybe HP/AC...But I dont think its necessary to make their DPS higher, Just so they can keep up with our spells, thats ridiculous...<br />
<br />
EDIT: I R TEH GUD SPELLUR!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>RuzukFV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The EXP penalty was removed from hybrids a long time ago Ziglug. Only penalties that remain are race based EXP penalties.</div></div><hr />

These are both very situational and wouldn't help warriors get groups at all.<br />

Sounds like a nerf to me.  A lot of people made pure melees because they didn't want to sit around meditating.  Otherwise though, nice post.  I would definitely prefer to be better at what warriors have always been good at, than to have some kind of auto-aggro button.  But a lot of my fellow warriors wouldn't agree with me.</div></div><hr />

It's my opinion that snap-aggro should NOT exist. Every class should have to work for aggro. Shadowknights probably should work less hard than others due to your hate line of spells. But this, by NO means should be snap-aggro.<br />

It dumbs the game down, and allows for lazy players to get to the high end.</div></div><hr />

5) Make /shield better. This is one thing you have thats actually a decent idea, especially for xp groups, make it more worth using, maybe even more of a direct exchange of hitpoints between you and the person you are shielding. And here's a crazy idea- add some decent aggro to it. This could be a much more defining ability or warriors. You would have the ability to save a caster and grab aggro back. This could be your &quot;shit hit the fan&quot; utility, it should have a decently long refresh time, so that like most other classes &quot;shit hit the fan&quot; ability, and you can't really plan your group strategy around it.<br />
 <br />
<br />
I think this would be a great skill for warriors not in the MT role.  In other MUDS that I used to play, a skill along this line was called RESCUE.<br />
<br />
Perhaps it could be a skill with a reset timer and requires the use of a shield.  If successful it would allow the warrior to Rescue the attacked member of the party and &quot;sheild&quot; said member from all/most blows for X seconds.  During that time, the warrior would be able to use taunt to try and gain aggro.  It would also reduce the warriors DPS several percent since he is concentrating on deflecting the blows directed at said member.<br />
<br />
I also agree that the warrior should be able to take advantage of the fact that if he is not MT, he should be able to either add shielding to the main tank (fighting side by side with him) or if he is not tanking at all - he should be able to concentrate his combat prowess to damage the mob (fighting it from behind).  Much of the warrior's main added DPS comes from Riposting.  Since in a Damage dealing role, he is not getting benefit from this skill, perhaps he could have a Skill that increases his base damage rate when attacking from side or behind. I am not suggesting a BS role, but perhaps increase damage possible by Y percent.<br />
<br />
You all might recall one of the earliest upgrades for warriors was Crippling Blow.  This was added within the first year of EQ.  It was supposed to be the original &quot;shit hit the fan&quot; skill for warriors.  If all went bad, the warrior got added DPS in the last ditch effort to save his party.  This has not lived up to what it was originally intended to do.  It was designed to the original world of Norrath.  It was not designed for the high DPS mobs and High HP mobs of Kunark and beyond.  (thought came that perhaps Crippling blows could be applied to warrior damage when not attacking mob from the front).<br />

Neat post. I agree for the most part. However, I disgree with this idea:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It's my opinion that snap-aggro should NOT exist. Every class should have to work for aggro. Shadowknights probably should work less hard than others due to your hate line of spells. But this, by NO means should be snap-aggro.<br />
<br />
It dumbs the game down, and allows for lazy players to get to the high end.  <br />
<br />
Snap aggro is *exactly* what makes knights desirable. Saying it should not have existed in the first place is saying that CH should not have existed in the first place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>synnoira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Well it's entirely arguable that CH shouldn't have existed in the first place, or Defensive, or snap aggro. Unfortunately they're all embedded in the game design now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lol CH shouldn't have existed in the first place. SOE realized this and that is a why they set a limit on how much it heals, so technically it is not a &quot;complete&quot; heal, but only for a miniscule amount, if any at all. I can't remember what they put the cap at.</div></div><hr />

Snap aggro is *exactly* what makes knights desirable.I know it's been said a million fucking gimes already, but here we go:<br />
<br />
Knights bring much more to the group than aggro abilities.<br />
<br />
Personally, I LOVE having a paladin in the group for fast heals, Brells, and rez shoulds we wipe and we have no cleric (which is getting to be more and more common).<br />
<br />
And I love having a SK in the group for ATk buffs, hate bufs, pulling, DPS, snare, etc.<br />
<br />
There we go: #1,000,001.<br />
<br />
In my opinion, I'd like to see the aggro situation be:<br />
<br />
Sk----&gt;War--------&gt;Pal.<br />
<br />
As opposed to:<br />
<br />
SK---&gt;Pal-------------&gt;War.<br />
<br />
....like it is now.<br />
<br />
SK holding a slight advantage due to direct hate spells and the voice line of spells.<br />
<br />
Warriors holding their own thanks to a properly working taunt button.<br />
<br />
Paladin having a slightly lesser taunt button, thus having a lesser aggro generation.<br />
<br />
Snap aggro can be worked around without redesigning the 30% of the content in EQ (which is where 90% of the population plays).<br />
<br />
Complete heal is next to impossible to work around, unless you redesign that same 30% to accomodate.<br />
<br />
Defensive is in the same boat.<br />
<br />
EDIT: and CH is at 7500 (without a crit).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Mactac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I was in a PoS Frogs group just last night with my Shaman when the second Warrior left to open a spot. A lvl 64 SK was in the zone ready to join when the remaining Warrior said &quot; Don't take the SK their DPS sucks.&quot; The other group members aggreed so this eqauled one LFG SK. This tells me we never did lose that old Kunark perception of being low DPS wimps. Probably because it is true.<br />
<br />
Keep on saying SK's are ok and don't need anything if you like LFG. What we need is offensive skill and weapon skills raised to at least 240 so we are  are not considered just &quot;gimp warriors&quot;. SK's  need to have better DPS to offer a group when SoE gives Warriors abilities that make them the only Tank groups want again.</div></div><hr />

You do have better DPS, just not in pure weapons. Your added DPS comes in your spells and such.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Morganti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">The warrior didnt want the sk in group to make him look like a slouch for not maintaining aggro.<br />
<br />
The group agreed because PoV is filled with fuktards who dont know any better these days.<br />
<br />
I really wish the trial requirement for PoV and such was not lifted, the place has become Karnors Castle with mobs that hit for 800.</div></div><hr />

Ganaith, CH shouldn't have existed in the first place  <br />
<br />
Lol, that i know brael. That is exactly my point, it *should* not exist, but it does. in fact, content is build around it. Changing it would change a whole big deal of EQ. Changing the hate generation of our spells would mean that they have to change it for each and every caster that uses our spell line *darkness for instance* which would mean that some casters can actuallu pump out even MORE damage without getting much aggro.<br />
<br />
Basically, a problem which is very, very deeply rooted into the game. Hard to get out. That was my point. It should not have existed, but it does. Nerfing that in any form isnt right.<br />
<br />
Finding something that makes snap aggro work without bouncing on the warriors that cannot do it is the solution.<br />
<br />
How? I aint no developer. We have done tons of good suggestions though, and i hope somewhere the devs will pick it up and be put to good use.<br />
<br />
Times of nerfing are hopefully over. We have been through that way, way too many times.<br />
<br />
We all just dont want to go back to kunark.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's right, an exp penalty.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Frankly, I think any improvement to warriors has got to involve equipment.  Once again, a poster completely ignores the utility warriors ALREADY HAVE UNLIMITED ACCESS TO strictly through equipment.<br />
<br />
Self invis, shrink, ammo production, bandage production, levitate, sow....<br />
<br />
I'm a firm believer in thematic improvement.  Giving warriors an HT or manaburn?  no.<br />
<br />
Improve /sheild?  Damn strait.  How about /grapple, which forces the first 15/30/50% of the damage of a mob to go to him, no matter who it's aggro on, for the next x minutes... /manhandle for the next 15 seconds, the mob stays in front of the warrior (can you say mob positioning?)  /headbutt : higher spell interupt percentage than bash, works on more mobs, does less damage.  /forceproc increases the chance that the primary weapon will proc by 50/75/100 percent, refresh of 2/1.5/1 minute.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>GranochTonka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">The /grapple and /forceproc ideas are awesome...but what about giving warriors a type of SCF, that increases the chance their primary weapon has to proc by say 10/20/35% ?? costing 3/6/9 AA respectively, i do understand this still limits warriors to aggro weapons, but hell its better than nerfing us. We've been nerfed and renerfed, and now that we a re back to almost where we belong, warriors are bitching.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Utility through clickies. Pfft.<br />
<br />
They all cost either plat per dose, or an outlay initially, OR significant outlays in man hours through camps or raids. All for spells that just about any level 20 class can trump in power... and not only that, but you can bet if a warrior can use them, ANYONE can use them, including SK's.<br />
<br />
Not only that, these are 95% of the time, only buffs that can be casted on a warrior himself to benefit him only, and very rarely his friends or enemies. Meanwhile, any caster or even a hybrid can offer spells that directly benefit his group/raid remembers, and/or mess up his enemies.<br />
<br />
That &quot;utility&quot; you speak of, is a complete red herring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Xanathol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Not so...I cannot click the cobalt bracers for a shrink. Better yet, the ONLY slow proccing weapon I know of that an SK can use is a wavecrasher..a 20% slow for 1 minute. Trucheon of Doom for warriors I do believe, sits at 50%? Hell, with that weapon, I could two box a lot more mobs with my cleric and a warrior than I could my SK, simply bc slow &gt;&gt;&gt; all. I don't feel a need to list more...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I think that utility through click items is indeed something that should be considered, even though that utility may be limited to an extent.  I do ask that you don't even bring up the cost, either in plat or in time spent camping something, to get these, though.  I don't recall getting my spells for free when I levelled, I had to go get them just like any other caster.  I still don't have all of them, either, nor do I have enough money to get them at this time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Laronx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Every &quot;utility&quot; a warrior can get through clickies is available to every one else in the game, so no, that's not even close to a decent answer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, you are incorrect on wavecrasher being the best slowing item for SK's. a Willsapper is SK usable, and slows by 35%.<br />
<br />
While I agree that a ToD is usable by warriors, again, I restate that there is a huge cost involved... in this case it's losing significant DPS, so that you can HOPE to get a proc off... of which the level 29 slow spell for shamans does just as good. ANMY slower class can outdo the ToS slow at 65, so it's never used.... and that's about the only level where you'll expect any significant amount of warriors to have one anyway. and that's about the MOST useful proc or clickie, as well as the most common, that any warrior would have... and it's almost entirely useless.<br />
<br />
Nope. Red herring.</div></div><hr />

All of these points are the exact same for an sk switching to a willsapper or wavecrasher.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Morgrist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Forget the mana bar. Use the stamina bar instead- warriors aren't magicians,they're meleers. Tweaking zings and such is trivial.<br />
 <br />
But giving warriors bar-based abilities I think is a critical need for the class. We are not &quot;hybrids of warriors&quot;. We, paladins and warriors are all plate melee classes. <br />
 <br />
SK = Necro/Warrior died in Kunark. The game view needs to evolve. <br />
 <br />
Give them slower, critical attack techniques with twohanders. PBAoE &quot;whirlwind&quot; strikes that use two weapons.  A /shieldlike technique that lends the ability to parry/ripsote attacks at another with the use of *gasp* a shield! Take advantage of the item focus and make the new abilities based on weapons skills. Limit these abilities with a bar. Stamina is the obvious choice.<br />
<br />
More of the same old same old is not the solution. The solution is killing the dinosaur concept of warriors as the &quot;nothing but swords and /defensive&quot; class.</div></div><hr />
