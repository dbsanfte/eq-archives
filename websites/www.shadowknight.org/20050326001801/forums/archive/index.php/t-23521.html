<br />
Thereby unlocking those zones?<br />
<br />
I am not elemental flagged but have been pushed through all raids in most zones, would benefit lots from this if it does.</div></div><hr />

Halo2, Half-Life2, EQ2 and WoW all coming before xmas.  Guilds may see a decline in 50% of their raid force.  One day 60 on - Next day 30.  What do you do?  Recruit!  Unfortunately if you are a guild that is that far in, backflagging somebody is a pain in the butt.  So, this gives a way of more easily doing so.  Is it going to crowd the EPs?  Yes.  Will it create new Time Guilds?  I don't think so.<br />
<br />
I thought they were backflagging KT as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">KT doesn't require raid flaggage and is more single group friendly at this point then ever.<br />
<br />
I would say it could be done in 2 nights (3 trials per night).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Naubi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">They are adding backflags for GoD content too.<br />
<br />
For Qvic for sure and probably for Txevu. However these will require a quest to become flagged in additition to picking up the flag item while raided in under 15/85.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kahntun Derstand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">this would flood EPs and Time with newbs.<br />
<br />
Newb is a relative term.  For example, Siilvir would likely consider me a newb because I wasn't in the first guild flagged for Elementals (what, 18 months ago?)  I was the in third.  Should I consider you a newb, or were you in the second?<br />
<br />
That content is so old, it's really beyond calling someone a newb if they just got access.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Covi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I been playing since release..I am no noob.<br />

school,work, kids, GF cuts into a big portion of my raid time these days..<br />

I am unable to be committed to a guild...I was in a guild but the sk class leader booted me cause I didn't play enough.<br />
<br />
Some guilds on my server don't back flag people unless they are in a guild that has already experienced the content..What the fuck is that about... I.E..I asked guild_0034 if I could loot a spare rift in SSRA to complete my VT key...got a big &quot;NO cause you aren't in a guild that has kilt Emp yet.&quot; My personal favorite is, I need Rathe to complete my Time flag..Asked guild_0234 that was doing Rathe and got basically the same response even though I explained Rathe was the last kill I needed.</div></div><hr />

It makes perfect sense.<br />
<br />
A &quot;back flag&quot; means you missed an event. Like you are in a Time guild but are missing Coirnav because you couldn't play that day. So you are missing a flag to be with your guildmates, that your guild has already completed. Hence the &quot;back&quot; in &quot;back flag&quot;.<br />
<br />
Most guilds won't give out free flags to random individuals, the same way they won't send out random tells if raid loot is rotting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Arikash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I think the issue isn't newbs, but dumbasses that think they are the shit when they really aren't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kilkulan Darkwarrior</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Just because your in some Uber guild doesnt mean you have skills.. sorry but there is more e-bayed people now then there ever has been</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>bastardlunatic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I know its old content, but for some of us its current content.<br />
at least they didnt defile VT with that crap</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kelv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">After over 20 raids in VT, I would rather pull my teeth out with a dull spoon than ever going back to that place.<br />
<br />
But after who knows how many raids in the e-planes, I still enjoyed raiding them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>bastardlunatic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">VT is mind numbing, but damn isnt it a good feeling when u click up to the mini ahr?<br />
<br />
for a guild at the level of progression that mine is at u just cant beat the amount of loot from 4 hours of clearing in VT</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Arikash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">VT key = the lose<br />
<br />
<br />
I know, but if they pretty much &quot;open&quot; them up, then the amount of dumbasses will increase exponentially prolly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Airemus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The EP's are already pretty flooded on most servers anyway. But i don't see this as a bad thing because you still require a raid force that can access the particular content. And i don't think open raids on the gods will be a common thing, seeing as you would most likely get people who aren't flagged for the zone anyway. This basically gives guilds an additional way of backflagging new recruits/old members who come back and arent flagged.<br />
<br />
It's a move im not surprised to see, with all the new games coming out, they have to keep people interested somehow. This isn't the first time they have made things easier either, they have been doing it almost every expansion.<br />
(pok anyone?)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Vnayr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">This isnt about saving any high end guilds from backflagging.<br />
This is about giving people access to content they would otherwise never see in an attempt to stop the bleeding of eq players to other games.<br />
<br />
Just like in OOW, with zones like MPG, being unkeyed, better exp than KT, better loot than KT, with easier mobs.<br />
<br />
These decisions are about keeping the casuel / unskilled happy, not about helping out the 2% of the playerbase that is hardcore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">VT isn't bad as long as you do it with only one group of people, mostly boxed, so that you don't have to share the loot with more than one or two other people.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Avengent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Interesting Bolas ~<br />
<br />
Sounds rather whorish</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kyfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">How long does it take to one group that place? Seems like it would take an eternity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Amphitryon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Oh please, this will NOT fill Plane of Time w/ newbs.<br />
<br />
Unless there is some non-guild orientated zerg coaliltion (like Barbraid on Prexus), you will still neede to join an Element level guild and join them on their raids, and they dont typically take every whanker who wants a flag along for the ride.<br />
<br />
This is all about a guild being able to take on new members w/o having to do every stupid thing over again. Think about it, your guild loses a few members, and then you cant raid at all because a) not enough people &amp; b) none of the new people have flags, so you have to redo your entire progression, possibly many times?<br />
<br />
However, I would have added the extra stipulation that people flagged in this manner only retain the flag as long as they remain in their guild (yea unguilded ebayers would be out of luck, so sad). I think that would address the problem with raid leeches and having packs of the 'unworthy' from running amok in the Planes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">So would recruits for guilds... the system looks pretty good to me, once you're flagged for a zone and capable of killing stuff inside it you can flag a couple people whenever needed basically.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Kaalm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">How do you define newb? Is it someone new to a zone? Of course someone new to a zone is going to be a newb -- just like every single other person was when they first entered the zone. Just like you were and I was (and still am in some zones). <br />
<br />
Like those who went before them, they'll learn the zone as they raid/exp in it. Just because someone does something second doesn't mean they suck. In my experience the people who call others newb (or any other name) are the people who you really need to watch out for. They are the ones that train the zone in even if a group is exping there becuase, what the hell... that group is just a bunch of newbs anyway right?. How about offering advice insead of denegrating?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Varrius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">This isnt about saving any high end guilds from backflagging.<br />

That is exactly what it is about actually.  <br />
<br />
This is about giving people access to content they would otherwise never see in an attempt to stop the bleeding of eq players to other games.<br />
<br />
How many casual friends do you have that are elemental flagged (need at least 36 to % you in) and will go kill the 4 God's for you (need more than 36 to do this, most likely), just so you can zone into elementals and act like a newb and train the exp groups there?</div></div><hr />
