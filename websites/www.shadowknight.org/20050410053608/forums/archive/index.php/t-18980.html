<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>petras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey, im a friend of mine has a 54 and he lost to a 56 beastlord today, I tried to help him yet kinda helpless in the battle.  The beast had 20aa's, he had 1 ha.  Other than that.  I forget what pot's add magic resist, and which dispell.  Kinda a low level duel, yet I thought he did alright but he said blind was fucking him over.  I dueled the beasty and it was rather easy, yet my friend lost yuck.  So if anyone knows the names of those potions, that'd be great.  Also, where should he duel him? I beat him in everfrost, and my friend wanted to do it in qeynos.  Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Stugein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Potions that boost magic resist:<br />
<br />
Elixir Of Divine Endurance - +10 to all resists<br />
Greater Null Potion - +25 DEX and MR<br />
Potion Of Shumar's Breath - +20 MR<br />
<br />
All are player made.  Talk to your friendly neighborhood shaman.<br />
<br />
As for where he should duel him...it shouldn't matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>petras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">K thanks, do all these pot's stack? and how long will they last.  I never dueled with potions, and my friend has no clue.  I'd ask the shammy, yet better to ask the friendly sk's here :P ha.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Stugein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Durations:<br />
<br />
Elixir Of Divine Endurance - 20 minutes<br />
Potion Of Shumar's Breath - 27 minutes<br />
Greater Null Potion - I don't know<br />
<br />
Not sure how they stack amongst themselves or with other stuff.  You may want to consult a shaman or someone who has used these potion extensively.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The general rule I've noticed with potions is that if 2 potions affect the same stat then they do not stack.  If this is universal then your &quot;friend&quot; will only be able to use one of the potions mentioned.  <br />
<br />
Also I remember seeing a dispell potion somethwere, might be old alchemy (not all those recipes work anymore).  Any self - respecting Shaman selling potions though will have a quick chart IRL to look at so just ask whomeve you wind up buying the Greater null potion from...<br />
<br />
Here's hoping your &quot;friend&quot; doesn't embarass himself again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>petras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">lending him some gear, so he better win, with the gear I lent him he had about 160 mr so lol</div></div><hr />
