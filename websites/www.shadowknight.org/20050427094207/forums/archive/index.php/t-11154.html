Gotta love the dark elf cuz he reminds me of Magus from Chrono Trigger :)  Any old school rpg fan knows wut i'm talkin bout</div></div><hr />

Problem is, this is my first time playin EQ, i'm a total newbie, and i'm gonna be startin from the bottom with so many high level people out there.  Are there any friendly peeps that help newbie's out there? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Magus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I just so happen to have a DE Shadow Knight<br />
<br />
I think it's a good combo. Better thank human/erudite/gnome anyway.<br />
The good starting city/ ultravision/ high INT/ Hide etc etc are all a bonus for the DE. While STR and STA suffer at first, you will soon find magic junk to boost these stats.<br />
<br />
If you play a DE SK it WILL be hard, and you WILL need patience, but in the end, no matter what race you are, it's equal. <br />
<br />
If you want an easier (but still hard) path try a troll, ogre, or iksar.<br />
<br />
And yes Chrono Trigger is a great game.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>nnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">how are any SK races easier or harder than the other?<br />
<br />
the SK class as a whole is a hard class to play, regardless of race. sure, some races might have an exp penalty or a skill that other races don't. But when you reach &quot;end game&quot; your role will be the same no matter what race you play. <br />
<br />
besides, I am not sure how trolls, ogres and iksar are &quot;easier.&quot; please explain.</div></div><hr />

Where not the biggest, we dont have the most mana, we dont have the most stamina..<br />
<br />
But we can be evil as we want to be and SK is a evil class, *we can see our own hand in front of our face in the middle of the night unlike some races, We can go through a dungoen with out shrink potions, we can fear kite just as good as any other sk, we can come from behind and knock the tar out of them then walk away with them wonder what the hell just hit me...<br />

So dont get mad if you only good racial ablity is only good for 22 lvls. Do SK's below 22 exist anymore? and if they do is it for more then 1 day? The Only thing Darkelves have done worth note is take in the weak Trolls after they lost their village to a bunch of frogs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jinsei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yeah, we get Deadeye at lvl 22, not 20. But it gives infravision, not ultra which DE's got.

<br />
I can see where Troll would have a big advantage over other races as a newbie/lowbie. The racial regen makes a world of difference then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>shadowblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">High level female Darkelf shadowknights are the sexiest baddest bitches in the whole game. (and rare, at least on my server)<br />

And thats all that needs to be said.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Magus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I said &quot;for an easier path (but still hard) path try an Ogre, Troll, or Iksar.&quot;<br />
<br />
Notice the &quot;but still hard,&quot; that is to say it is still diffucult, but not as hard as a DE.<br />
<br />
Trolls: regen, slam, high STR and STA. Newibe/Lowibe untwinked troll could kick the crap out of a moderatly twinked DE newibe/lowibe. <br />
<br />
Ogre: HIGH str and sta, unstunable from the front, and slam.<br />
<br />
Iksar: higher than DE str and sta, natural AC bonus, regen.<br />
<br />
Those aspects make the road to the level 65 SK not quite as hard (BUT STILL HARD) in compairison to the DE Shadow Knight.<br />
<br />
I rest my case.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Rezzbagg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Yeah but that 20% extra xp you get doesn't help at all?</div></div><hr />

<br />
OH yeah, how could i forgot, that 1 or 2 HP regen a tick REALLY makes us overpowered. I forgot how uber trolls are. <br />
<br />
How about our LOW int....midlevel soloing = FEARKITING, that stamina is really usefull then. People should start getting there heads out of there asses. <br />
All SK's are simular hard, one got mana problems, the other got hp problems. Only thing that sucks is the 20% XP penalty for something that only starts to get good at level 50+ and still useless is at those level. Not like that the 16hp regen sitting will save me when a mob is pounding on me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Magus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Yes, the DE's do not suffer the 20% XP peanilty, and that does help. So does the high starting INT.<br />
<br />
Now, I NEVER said in ANY of my posts that trolls are overpowered. Don't put words in my mouth. We all have our up's and down's, but when it comes to raw melee the higher STR and STA will help. DE's do have much higher mana, but SK's are more of a tank class.<br />
<br />
Listen, I'm not supporting or comdemning any race here. I'm just pointing out facts. Trolls DO have higher STR and STA, regen, and slam that can make a difference. <br />
That's not to say that it's all golden and easy in trollsville, in fact trolls (as with any race) have their disadvantages.<br />
If your a troll the horrible experience loss can and will bite you in the ass, and so will the low mana.<br />
<br />
There, I explained AGAIN that all races have pro's and con's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Malucchi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Str &lt; Shit</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Sadicious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I chose a de sk because i liked the way they looked the higher int is a bonus for mana. When i made him i put all the points into stamina. <br />
<br />
I dont see how trolls regen is really any good post lvl 10. They shouldn't have an exp penalty. <br />
<br />
Iksars have ac bonus and regen. When u are 50+ i dont think that bonus 25ac (guesstimate) isnt going to help u when u are getting quad hit for 500+.<br />
<br />
Ogres imo i think they are the best SK tanks they cant get stunned from the front thats friggin hot. U still have a chance to channel a FD off if u have 5 mobs beating on u and not worry about getting stunned.<br />
<br />
When u get to 60+ all of them are basically the same the only really only advantage a race gets is the Ogre.<br />
<br />
Play what u want, i picked the DE even though every time i loot more then 3 things im encumbered. I dont want to have to shrink and i like not looking like an ogre :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Darain Thex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I chose a Teir`Dal Shadow Knight for roleplay when I started playing.  My cousin started a Half-Elf Ranger, so I decided to be evil to combat him.  In the newbie levels, I didn't see that big of a difference in being a tank, I took damage and I dealt it out, so no biggie.  One thing I did find I liked was that when we first got out spells, I was able to use all of them, as opposed to an ogre or troll friend that neglected INT and had to try to raise his before he could make a pet.<br />
<br />
In my opinion, Teir`Dal SKs are the sexiest bad asses you will see.  Our cultural rocks for us, and we have a wide variety of cultural to choose from, from the Adamantite to the Regent.  Pump the starting points into Str and Sta then suppliment with items to raise them.  I don't mind being stunned, because if I die it is just part of the game and I'll just go back out to hunt some more.  As for the Regen and AC, get Shammy buffs :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Zeralenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I am one of those rare female DE shadowknights -- just dinged 54, yay for me (and before you ask, I am female RL).<br />
<br />
This was my first character when I started playing in June 2002. I made her a DE strictly for style points. Knowing what I know now, if I was making a shadowknight, I might very well make an ogre for the natural strength, stamina, and lack of ability to stun from the front. Then again, I might not. There is something very interesting about playing a female DE shadowknight.  (Except that the plate helm toons for female DEs look like a bucktoothed monkey skull, which is why I never wear a helm that &quot;shows&quot;).<br />
<br />
I think in my early 20s I was killing the Millers in Qeynos Hills. By the mid to late 20s I was killing the dorfs on Sister Island in OOT. Neither are terribly exciting.<br />
<br />
High level shadowknights seem relatively rare. I think a lot of people start SKs and don't continue on with them. 20-30 is a particularly telling period; it seems if you can get over that hurdle you'll keep with it. 20-30 is probably the worst awkward period in the young SK's life. Your spells really, really, really suck instead of just sort of sucking.<br />
<br />
I finally got my STR raised to 170 and my STA to 156 (INT is 232) so I'm starting to feel like I can get some damage going. I concentrate primarily on my taunting skills and being a def tank rather than being a hardcore damage doer. My job is to keep the mobs off my necro friend who is doing the REAL damage.<br />

For soloing or duelling, imo, DE SK's rock!!  Sure we can be stunned, which sucks big, bu they, we all have a downfall.  The high Int definitely allows you to take on the fatties with more Str/AC/HP both up close and at a distance.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Maallycious Quintessence</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I am an old school RPG'er, from the days of D&amp;D in a box. From the get go I have had a love for the dark ones, Drow by TSR standards. <br />
<br />
I am a female in RL. And I run, for my Main Avatar, a 48 DE Innoruukian Female SK. You can generally find me solo and occasionally grouped up with another SK, male, who is level 52. Now we tend to compare ourselves alot lol. We are both DE, SK's. He is of a higher level and &quot;better gear&quot; then I am but guess who gets the most aggro? <br />
<br />
You Gotta love the fact the we not only have a great INT to start, but we look good in everything we wear, and can out aggro any class in the game if run correctly, including the quezenarts (ie... rogues and rangers).<br />
<br />
If you're curious why, go look at my magelo profile in my sig. I may only be level 48, but I am &quot;uber skilled&quot; for a 48.  I never accept rezzes unless on a raid, which for me and my playing times are few and far between, and I never run from a fight. I'd rather stand and die, then run like a fool. So needless to say I should be of a higher level then I am.<br />
<br />
<br />
For my alts and a bit of &quot;flavor&quot; I run a DE necro, a DE rogue, and a DE magi, but none shall EVER take the place of my SK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Kensha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">My first SK was a dark elf. I never had any regrets about her. I played her to 49.  There were some times when I felt a little weak, but I know now that equipment and level would have changed that for me, as it did with my second SK.<br />
<br />
I changed servers and played a gnome to 61. She's been fun, but she is not nearly as groovy. She certainly doesn't get hit on as much, which makes me a little sad. I rather liked the &quot;pretty poison&quot; role.<br />
<br />
From a RP point of view, I really relate better to the dark elves and Innoruuk than to gnomes and Bertoxxulous. Hate is an emotion full of power. Decay isn't really evil, IMO. It's necessary and inevitable, but not evil.<br />
<br />
There's really no reason NOT to be a dark elf if you like the race and the class. It all works out in the end.<br />

When i made my Ogre sk i put all my points in to Sta, because i was still uncertian of how to properly make a character...so now...at 57 with almost a full suit of Moktar armour (yeah its crap i am working on getting ToV armour) i have 3.5k hp and roughly 1k AC with no buffs.. I am MTing in plane raids and Plane of storms against the giants....now i am not trying to blow my own horn or anything...just listing a few things that ogre SK's can do when they get there act togeather. I have a 147 int so my mana pool is pretty good and i can hold a taunt from a 64 warrior when i want to..(and she is decked out) <br />

But getting to a close here, I still prefer the DE look to the Ogre..though when ogre's hold weapons...they look huge..which is cool. but yeah....On Ec'i there are actually alot of DE SK's..most of the SK's i know are DE...and there are lots of mid level trolls and Iksar because of regen but not to many high.....but sadly i am one of the few high level Ogre SK's (not sure how many there are.:(  ) Also about the comment of how all the stats will be the same...thats not really true..because i can get the same gear you can...and the same AA points and what not..and still have a higher Sta/Str then you(a DE i mean) while you will most likely have a higher int/dex/agi/cha then me (i am butt ugly with like a 40 something cha..lol) so unless you are getting buffs..it is unlikely that our stats will ever be the same.

<br />
I dunno on your server, but on my server, ogres and trolls run rampent.  DE SKs are a rare breed on the Rathe.  And a 55+ DE SK is even rarer.<br />
<br />
I, myself, chose the Dark Elf SK for a couple reasons... one was the looks.  Face it, DEs are the embodiment of great fashion :D   And for the role-play factor.  Dark Elves are the epitomy of Evil, they ARE hate.  The Shadow Knight is a class that is anti-life, anti-good, anti-everything that isn`t death, destruction, hate, mayhem, and whatnot.  Dark Elf Shadow Knights ARE all those, and then some.  Which do you picture riding in to battle on a midnight black steed, clad in ornate, crimson plate, wielding Innoruuk`s Curse at their side, thirsting for the flow of the blood of their victims... and not having the mental capacity of a 3 year old?  Certainly not Ogres or Trolls, that`s for sure :p.  Iksars are another story... but anyway, I`m off track =X<br />
<br />
DEs are the sexiest of the sexy, but they`re also the embodiment of evil, which, in my very own and very humble opinion, is why I chose to be a Dark Elf Shadow Knight.<br />
<br />
**Contradiction notion coming up, wait for it... wait for it... go!**<br />
<br />
But choose whatever race you feel comfortable with.<br />

**End contradicting notion...**</div></div><hr />

I think with gear and buffs in the end game we all come out about the same. I choose DE for vanity reasons. My first Sk was an iksar, then the new models came out and iksar chics just look dumb. So she was deleted and out came the DE. I have a lot of fun with her and I must admit she does look badass. So play what you want, for whatever your reasons. It is a game and is meant for fun.;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Strega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">I'm a RL female too, and I picked dark elf for SK because they are the sexiest bad asses in the game, LOL.  The drooling on the part of male characters, their bad attempts at pick up lines and such is a lot of fun.  Even my boyfriend has fun with it, though in game his DE necro spends a lot of time snarling at those schmucks, LOL.  (For that matter, as we tend to run characters that can partner well together, his Barb warrior growls while people come on to my high elf cleric, his wood elf druid growls when they come on to my wood elf warrior, etc, but it's all in fun)<br />
<br />
Fashion is everything in this game, the only one of my characters who wears anything on her head with a visible graphic is my druid who had a hard time turning down the Elysian crown as it completed her outfit.<br />
<br />
Have fun with it folks, those that take the game so seriously they are going to argue about imaginary stats in an imaginary world probably don't have much going for them in Real Life.  Ok, maybe EQ is the best part of your life - it works that way for some of my guild mates - but it is just supposed to be harmless (and relatively cheap) entertainment.</div></div><hr />

Dark Elf and Shadowknight combo makes for KOS everywhere, only combo more hated is Iksar Shadowknight...now them, i truly pity. But as the saying goes, 'That which does not kill you, makes you stronger' and in Neriak its survival of the fittest and I'm fit.  <br />
<br />
Do not pity the Iksar. Being an Iksar makes Kunark travel all the easier. Plus, all this KOS stuff builds character.... and stuff. yeah. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Dark Elf...true...the female dark elves are kinda sexy...much better then those Ogre babes (ugh!).<br />
<br />
I made a Ogre, and would do it again in a heartbeat. I love being in the middle of the fight, having more xp than many warriors, and cant get stunned from melee! <br />
<br />
And as SK's, we can out-taunt those warriors. Plus, with some spears, out damage 'em! :D <br />
<br />
The one thing I do wish is that I had more base int, but a nice KEI buff helps that out. And with UV, plus my shammy making me some shrink potions, I am gtg.<br />
<br />
Of course the xp penalty sucks, but hey, thats the price of greatness. <br />
<br />
Just remember that we follow the way of hatred, but that doesnt mean we have no honor. Stand with your SK brothers, and we are a devastating fighting force!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Rugs Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">DE's are awesome if your not worried about regenning hps or gettin stunned.<br />
<br />
That never happens though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Magus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Here's the deal:<br />
When you are level 65, it doesn't make a freaking difference what race you are. All of you stats will be maxed out. You will get the coolest gear avalible to SK's. <br />
Remember Furor (the most powerful EQ player) is a human warrior. <br />
Now if Furor were on these boards and asked what race to pick, everyone would say &quot;Pick Ogres&quot; or &quot;Pick trolls&quot; because they have better starting stats. Or they would say &quot;pick a dark elf&quot; because they look cool. <br />
<br />
So here is the answer: it's all a matter of preference, NOT stats. If you think looks/small-medium armor use/ultravision are important, then pick a DE. If you think that scary looks, slam, and regen are important, then pick a troll. If you think fat oafs who can't be stunned from the front are great, then go with an ogre. Do you like eating bugs and shedding your skin? If so, then the Iksar is your choice.<br />
Gnomes are off limits, unless your a thundering idiot that is.</div></div><hr />
