<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>BrikBludgaard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">***WARNING LONG!***<br />
 <br />
<br />
Much ado has been made by both knights and warriors about balance.<br />
<br />
The biggest problem is that our roles seem to not be defined.<br />
Warriors, Shadowknights, Paladins, and now perhaps even Berserkers seem to share the same overall team roles.<br />
<br />
This is attempt to form a plan.<br />
<br />
This is what SHOULD be different, not what is currently so.<br />
<br />
WARRIORS<br />
<br />
Positives:<br />
-Offensive AND Defensive melee skills maxed.<br />
-Most HP<br />
-Innate Mitigation<br />
-Damage entirely through melee (both advantage and a disadvantage)<br />
-Should have some nice melee abilities which show skill above and beyond that of the other classes.<br />
-The ability to use all fighting styles (1H/Shield, Dual wield, and 2H) with skill and thus be able to handle different melee situations the best.<br />
-Master of reliability and consistent melee damage and melee mitigation.<br />
<br />
Negatives:<br />
-Shortest RANGE on aggro (this is to say they SHOULD be able to aggro in melee range quite well)<br />
-Small Utility/Flexability (specialist)<br />
<br />
<br />
PALADINS<br />
<br />
Positives:<br />
-Defensive melee skills, Defensive Spells<br />
-(should be) best combat healer (speed) second only to Clerics<br />
-most flexible defensive tank (roots, stuns, Heals)<br />
-Highest melee damage to undead (should be overall best tank vs undead due to the positive power coursing through them.)<br />
-(should be) Second best ranged aggro in the game<br />
-Master of defensive shining moments (Paladins should be able to defend their groups/raids for a short time when no one else can...)<br />
<br />
Negatives:<br />
-Lowest overall damage output in the game for a damage dealer (except undead, where warriors should be the lowest)<br />
<br />
<br />
SHADOWKNIGHTS<br />
<br />
Positives:<br />
-Defensive melee skills, Offensive Spells<br />
-(should be) best burst damage dealer second only to mage/druid/wizard. (note this is BURST damage due to spells and abilties... not sustained damage like rogues/monks/wizards/mage)<br />
-Most flexible offensive tank (feign, nukes, lifetaps, drains, debuffs, damage shields, LIFETAP DAMAGE SHIELDS)<br />
-(should be) the tank that hurts the mob the MOST to hit<br />
-(should be) Overall best at causing hate in the game period.<br />
-Master of Offensive tanking shining moments.  (beating on a shadowknight should cost the mob dearly for a time)<br />
<br />
Negatives:<br />
-little to no friendly buffs or group/raid affecting things without combat.<br />
-The most dealy of Shadowknight abilities shoudl have costs above and beyond the mana cost (or exceptional mana cost)... but should be proportionately powerful for their cost. (right now they aren't)<br />
<br />
<br />
BERSERKERS<br />
<br />
Positives:<br />
-Offensive melee, Moderate defensive skills<br />
-Best burst melee damage dealer in the game bar none<br />
-Decent sustained melee damage slightly below ranger melee output.<br />
-Master of the endurance bar (for short bursts of melee offensive and defensive feats)<br />
-Most overall endurance and endurance regeneration.<br />
-Some decent utility due to melee feats.<br />
<br />
Negatives:<br />
-Lesser tank than knights or warriors.. better than rangers<br />
-When Endurance is gone, is &quot;winded&quot; and thus mediocre in everything.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thats the plan.  Now how do we get to it?<br />
<br />
For the warriors and paladins, I will leave most of their needs to experts who play those characters.  This is what I suggest for this expansion for shadowknights.<br />
<br />
-Spear of Murram - should be more than 660 thank you...  even if it has a life cost on top of it. We are getting this spell from a cursed continent and we are cursed characters...  Leave the mana cost and add an equal amount of life to the cost.  Raise the damage to 1000 and bring the resist mod to -200 disease.  Can we nuke around as well or slightly better than a SHAMAN please? (given the life cost as well...)<br />
<br />
-Black Shroud - Should be a combo lifetap/manatap for 100 (100 lifetap with a 100 mana recourse)  This would be a 300 lifetap 100 mana with SA3.  Rangers self-imbue proc for 150 with a -150 adjust with ZERO AA spent on it.  Since we got an AA for this, you think maybe we can get proportionately powerful for the expense please and not be balanced assuming we have 15more AAs than everyone else?<br />
<br />
-Mental Horror - Dump it in favor of making Black shroud a combo buff.  As it is, we get an extra 10 mana...  What an upgrade for a level 55 spell that gives 100 mana at level 60...  Since Mental Clarity procs about 2/minute, we can count on an extra 20 mana per minute if we are in combat constantly.  This is horribly underpowered for a level 65 spell.<br />
<br />
Instead of mental Horror I would like to see an upgrade to harmshield specifically tuned for Shadowknights:<br />
<br />
Shield of the Void<br />
<br />
Slot Description <br />
1: All mob hits reduced to 1<br />
2: Damage shield by 10<br />
3: Silence (no spellcasting)<br />
<br />
<br />
Mana: 200 Skill: Abjuration <br />
Casting Time: 1 Recast Time: 600 <br />
Fizzle Time: 2.5 Range: 0 <br />
Location: Any Time of Day: Any <br />
Fizzle Adj 25 Deletable: No<br />
Interruptable: Yes Short Buff Box: Yes<br />
Target Type: Self Spell Type: Beneficial <br />
<br />
Classes: SHD/65<br />
<br />
Why is this an upgrade?<br />
Because you can still melee... because you can still hold aggro.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
AA's<br />
Shadowknights are getting horribly left behind on AA's that seem to focus on our PET, and horrible copy/pastes from other classes' PoP AA lists.  Where is our tanking AA's??  If mobs are going to hit for 5k, can we at least scale with the other tanks please?<br />
<br />
AA's like the Dot-crit one are actually nice...  and maybe adding Fury of Magic.. yank the pet AA's please or perhaps simply add a swarm AA of HT'ing pets...  never mind adding piles of AA's to our little pets as we will see very little actual improvement.<br />
<br />
<br />
here are so ideas for Shadowknight-Only AA's<br />
<br />
-If we must have a Damage shield AA...  then let it be this one:<br />
<br />
Let me suggest a substitute for the SK-only AA Intense Hatred (the one that makes DS on us do more damage.)<br />
<br />
Vampire's Spite<br />
3 ranks<br />
Cost 3 6 9<br />
Requires Soul Abrasion 3<br />
<br />
When activated, VS creates a lifetap damage shield, mitigating part of the damage done by converting it to life. This is cast much like Harmtouch in that you cannot use it while stunned or silenced, but that it &quot;casts&quot; instantly.<br />
<br />
Level 1 20pts lasts 30 seconds (5 ticks, recast 60 minutes)<br />
Level 2 40pts lasts 60 seconds (10 ticks, recast 50 minutes)<br />
Level 3 60pts lasts 90 seconds (15 ticks, recast 40 minutes)<br />
<br />
Too weak? mob hits you for 600, you take 60 life from him and only take 540 damage effective. Thats a 10% mitigation. If the mob hits harder its less, if the mob hits softer, you get a larger percentage.<br />
<br />
Too powerful? Warriors mitigate 5% innately... this doesn't count defensive... which both lasts longer than VS, and mititgates more damage. All of this doesn't count the new HP increases warriors are getting and we aren't. Considering it will cost an very large amount of AA to get, it SHOULD be powerful and useful. Its also in OUR theme of doing things... the way of draining our enemies dry... while dealing damage. For fast hitting mobs that hit lighter, we would be quite useful... for mobs like Vallon in Time, (3K hits) we would not.<br />
<br />
Stacking will be important... it should stack with all other DS, but NOT lifetap from them. (hehe bards would make this a bit too powerful -- 150pt lifetap DS might be just plain wrong.)<br />
<br />
<br />
This is just one way....  Any way we could have a vampiric damage shield seems the way to go to me...  it improves our tanking and offense all in one shot...  and would be unique through ALL the classes.  Make it an AA, or a spell, or a combination of the two that stack...<br />
<br />
<br />
Also...<br />
<br />
If you are going to give us the THIRD upgrade for an ability nearly no one buys before their 200th AA point, could it actually DO something now?  After spending 20+ points on it, it does a grand total of 1500 lifetap, and does NOT stack with normal HT.  Have it auto crit heal or something?  Can it PLEASE be given a separate timer after 30 AAXP into it??<br />
Can we just have it stack with our big HT and the levels in Soul consumption be the amount of HP you DRAIN from it?<br />
1900lifetap is simply not worth the AAXP you have to put into it... especially when you give up the 7k+ nuke.<br />
<br />
<br />
I am looking for logical discussion and other suggestions to amend or to improve the plan or the solutions.<br />
<br />
Brik</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Blackeagle Dwimmerlaik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">good stuff, doubt they'll listen to any of it though.  they seem to ignore us because they don't know if they should make us more offensive or more defensive, and simply leave us as extremely weak in both.<br />
<br />
I'm still just hoping and praying they'll take away death's fury.  for a necro or mage it may be mildly useful.  maybe.  after 45 AAs spent on it.  heh.  for us it's trash blocking us from getting something that someone with fewer than 700 AAs will ever even consider buying.<br />
<br />
and as for improved consumtion of the soul... I bought leech touch around AA 380 a few months ago, and have yet to use it.  if you want me to even think about using leech touch, much less dumping AAs into it to make it marginally better, it's going to have to be on a seperate timer than improved HT.  That or make them stack somehow.<br />
<br />
what bothers me most about this expansion is the further seperation of warriors from the other 2 tanks.  Sony seems to forget that SKs and paladins ARE tanks and ARE meant to take hits from the mobs.  Warriors already take about 14% less damage over time than we do, and will now enjoy a comfy 1200-1500 HP advantage in all situations as well.  More at the lower levels of progression, at which point knights will be flat out broken as tanks as far as I can tell.<br />
<br />
The fact of the matter is that the difference between ranger and SK tanking is about the same as the difference between SK and warrior tanking.  The vaunted 'aggro advantage' of knights is virtually non existant at the time level, and SKs don't even outdamage warriors over time for all of the defensive advantage we've given up.  Especially when tanking, where warriors crush our DPS due to interupts and the amount of time we have to spend casting (virtually non-stop) to match the aggro warriors generate just by hitting auto-attack<br />
<br />
anyhow, to stay on topic, I really like the spell ideas.  one thing to point out though is that we need some offensive spells with more potency/mana cost, for the simple reason that at the higher end we have to resort to chain casting lifetaps to use our mana in most raid situations (not exp groups, in exp groups we can use our mana fairly effectively as is)<br />
<br />
this expansion hasn't even been released yet and already it's my least favorite expansion ever.  If it weren't for the facts that time is extremely buggy and not fully instanced, ldon raids simply aren't an option for guilds with 50-60 people online wanting to raid, and there are already 9 guilds in the elemental planes on my server and rising, so we NEED more places to raid, i wouldn't even buy this expansion.  If I were a more casual player, I'd save my money.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Darko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You got the right idea, but the sk changes are all horrible.<br />
<br />
The new spells are fine, as far as mana cost, we already have extremly ineffcent spells making them any more so would completely screw us in the magic department.  If anything we need another tap maybe something between tov and toi.<br />
<br />
The new DA type spell u are sujjesting is gona be pretty useless too imo, if you want stonestance play a monk :D, we gota at least leave them that, let them be superior pullers, only a couple ppl on a raid pull but many do damage.<br />
<br />
You mention our new aa suck, and thats true but the ones u are proposing i wouldnt even bother training... Mitigating 60 damage per hit for 90 seconds is a joke at my level of play, unless this ability some how scales its useless, and if it does scale warriors WILL bitch like there is no tomorrow.  Not to mention its not even true mitigation, sicne u still take the full hit and then get healed back for 90.  <br />
<br />
It seems SoE wants to keep SK on the damage side of the tank spectrum, i am quite happy with that and imo we should take advantage of this  by asking fr more damage.  Warriors are now once again &quot;The Tank&quot; so id rather have damage to fall back on then stand in line behind warriors.  <br />
<br />
One of the only tanking type changes id like to see made to SK is a AE taunt like skill which grabs agro instantly.  IMO intense hatred should have been that skill, it should either automaticly place the SK on top of the agro list, or generate an INSANE ammount of agro on demand, a 5 min or so reuse time would be apporipriate to make the skill balanced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Blackeagle Dwimmerlaik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">darko- I had the same thought as you when I saw intense hatred in our new AA lineup.  i was extremely disappointed to see what it actually turned out to be :/<br />
<br />
also, i wasn't suggesting that our spells simply cost more mana, I was saying that they should do more damage too</div></div><hr />

<br />
Spear that does 1000damage for 264mana and 264 health is inefficent how?  We would be regenerating it by our procs, the added damage is paid for by adding our own health to the spear.<br />

<br />
Um,you would pull with Shield of the Void?  why bother??  <br />
just use HS...  The new spell is for damage-spike removal...For instance, the first few seconds of when a Time god manages to kil one of our warriors.<br />
SK-Taunt him and live for 9 seconds while holding aggro.<br />
(hey look! we can USE our taunt ability in raids! woot!<br />

<br />
Yup, but since it IS always the same, it would do 60 damage and heal 60 every time you are hit while active...  even for when you are hit for its lowest... it also helps normalize the high hits, even if its for just 1%.  The big hitters will still be the realm of the warrior with Shadowknights able to patch-tank with Shield of the Void.  The light-but-fast hitters means we might be a very competitive choice.  Note, this stacks with every other damage shield... with a bard, you could be reflecting 150damage every time the mob hits you...  now combine Shield of the Void and 60pt lifetap damage shields... for a few ticks you take 1 damage heal 60 and do 150 damage per hit... I am willing to listen to arguements the lifetap shield should be more robust, or that its lifetapping should stack with other damage shields (150pt lifetap damage shield with a bard?<br />
<br />
Warriors complain that knights can tank?  Let em go right ahead.  (and since you are a shadowknight(??) why do you care when the warriors whine about excessively stupid things?  They have no justification for being the ONLY class that can tank to any degree, and they would remain the BEST at damage mitigation due to the very fact that it isn't real mitigation (its healing after the fact).<br />
<br />

If we never tank, then we are low damage monks...  and we will never touch the damage dealers for damage output.  We already have single-target aggro skill....  its called Dark and Fear. (and terror, if they didn't suck so bad)  I would be interested in spells that grab aggro in a wide area. (like AoE Taunt, but a SPELL)<br />
<br />
<br />
Just FYI... &quot;at Darko's level of the game&quot; is likely the same as mine... we are farming time as well, and have been for months...<br />
<br />
<br />
Lets hear some more POSITIVE ideas and good feedback on the current ones.<br />
<br />
<br />
Brik</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">So far of the 6 class boards I have visited about GoD AA's none of them have been happy about what they are getting.<br />
<br />
Sounds like we are all going to get screwed together. :0</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Darko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Dont get me wrong brick, i am not trying to flame you but last i checked this is discusssion forum, if you post your idea u should expect critisim, but no hard feelings :D<br />
<br />
The spear idea is good, just i doubt we will get it, it will be too powerful in many situations imo.<br />
<br />
The thing with SA is a moot point, we got f00ked on SA and we will continue getting f00ked on it.  Its easy to say that dev's shouldnt balance our spells around SA but the problem is to balance the class they have to take into consideration that most sk do have SA, for me personally i wouldnt wana suffer in other areas just cause i can self buff myself with a 450 tap proc.<br />
<br />
Shield of the void, when i am grabing agro i am gona be chain casting, especially on a raid, so if shield of the void makes you unabale to cast it kinda defeats the point.. not to mention ur healers should know who is up next to tank, and the switch should be smooth with out it.  Also the cast time should be reduced imo since thats the type of spell u cant afford to not channel through. Not to mention just like HS i just dont have the spell slot to keep a spell like this memed, maybe if it was an aa that didnt take a spell slot.<br />
<br />
Btw i do use taunt on raids, but with the recent changes, weither u like em or not, sk are just not the ideal tank in most situations.. we have to realize that and move on, imo its clear SoE will not let 3 tank classes be equalt tanks, warriors will always be better, and pallies seem to be bumped up into that direction too.  I really think asking for more tanking tools will hurt the class as a whole in the long run.  We will remain great oftanks, and exp tanks but tanking big stuff may not be our role for much longer, with the exeption of the elite loot hoarders, but then again anything is possible for those :D  <br />
<br />
As far as the concerns of warriors, yeah they are whiny bitches, but we have to look at the game as a whole when we ask for something for the sk class, i want to play a game thats as close to balanced as possible.  SoE is a tough cookie to take head on, if they get stuborn on warriors tanking it may be wise to take our losses and expand into other areas.  The thing i love about my class is my flexibility, this is not to say we should give up on tanking entirely.<br />
<br />
Life tap DS is a good idea imo quite orginal, i just think the way you present it wont be effective in most situations.  Just of the top of my head here is a couple ideas.  Keep it at 90 sec duriation lower reuse time to 30 and have it either: a) add a 20/40/60 ds and turn all ds damage to taps, ie when mob hits you it takes a combined 95 damage from ds all the ds currently active, so you also get a 95 point heals or b) make it sorta like evasive, ie every time a mob hits the sk has a chance to tap back a large portion of the hit just recived, the number can be tweaked to make it balanced but usefull.<br />
<br />
As far as dark and fear, sure they are great for agro but i am talking something mor eliek ae taunt, a spell or skill that will generate enuf agro to turn a mob to the sk when shit hits the fan in a raid situation and with out delay.<br />
<br />
But again i dont think tanking is what we should be concentrating on at this point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The life tap DS idea is a good one. It is what Intense Hatred needs to be. <br />
<br />
Each level of the AA should increase the % of our current DS that works as a tap.<br />
<br />
level 1 10% of the DS<br />
<br />
level 2 20% of the DS<br />
<br />
level 3 35% of the DS</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>BrikBludgaard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Darko,<br />
<br />
I was expecting criticism...  but the method was what I was asking to change... and you did so quite admirably.  Thank you.<br />
<br />
I would argue that allowing us to focus our life into damage spells (then leeching it from enemies) is what our class should be about.  Given the sacrifice for the spell, I'd say 1000 damage isn't too much to ask.  Again, the spell can be scaled to be fair, but the idea of enhanced damage for life spent on the spell seems worthwhile to me... and it would be something no other class could do.<br />
<br />
We got boned (pun not intended) on 2H weapons as well and they fixed that...  Self-imbued procs seems to be something the devs want us good at...  much like Slay undead makes the Paladins good at damage for undead.  I think its fair to ask that they rectify this proc thing...  its like a whole 225damage/minute we are talking about...  I swing 2-3 times per 1.4 seconds for up to 395...  why is this an issue?  I am asking to be noticably  good at something we spent 18AAs on...  I don't think I am out in left field here.<br />
<br />
I would accept Shield of the Void as an AA...  I chose spell as a few of the warriors (even the most vehemently against Shadoknights tanking anything) suggested that an upgrade to harmshield that allowed us to keep aggro for that short period wouldn't be a bad idea.  Since its a spell, and an upgrade to a existing line, the non-uber-whiners probably wouldn't have an issue with it.  (its for a few ticks... thus for transition tanking.)<br />
<br />
The recent changes are the biggest reasons for my &quot;we need a tanking solution&quot; changes.  We need a niche, and I think lifetap damage shields would be the niche that we should look for.  It allows some damage spike prevention, allows us to be the most costly tank to hit, and makes us quite competitive for certain types of mobs, while leaving warriors the obvious choice for the hardest hitters.  Everyone wins.<br />
<br />
Like I said, if we aren't tanking... we are just low-damage monks.  We should be tuned to USE our defensive skillcaps, and our offensive spells to good use.  Using our taunt skills to cause damage by making the mob hit us while draining it dry sounds very SK-ish to me...<br />
<br />
Lets say we made the damage shield permanent with a /on /off and tuned down the self DS...  say to 5 15 30.  Then made ALL damage shields cast on the shadowknight drain.  For raids, we could be buffed up to very nice DS, and for solo/small groups damage shields would be much more reasonable.  The ability also becomes more valuable because its an innate.  Note, this ability would NEED an off switch.  There are times when DS are a curse and not a blessing.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sil, a 35% lifetap from a raid-buffed 90pt ds is 31-32pts...  its a little underwhelming...  is this what you mean, or did I misunderstand you?<br />
<br />
keep em coming guys...  even if no one important is reading, its still nice to gather some interesting ideas.<br />
<br />
Brik</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Blackeagle Dwimmerlaik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">lifetap DS would be a fun little toy, but wouldn't really help us much except for when we're trying to solo stuff to see if we can<br />
<br />
allowing us to put our HPs into offensive spells is an interesting idea I kinda like<br />
<br />
I still wish they would make aura of hate what it should be: a flat out upgrade to torrent of hate.  I still mem and use torrent of hate in most situations as it is, and while I know a lot of SKs use aura instead, I stand by my preference for ToH.<br />
<br />
bottom line is I want things that increase either our defense or our offense.  dancing around the issue and giving us worthless junk like this is getting old</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Brik yeah, that's what I meant. Would it be underwhealming? Might be. But it would be an improvement over what Intense Hatred seems to be at the moment, and asking for a small improvement is sometimes best.<br />

It would help us to tank better, however slight that improvement might be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>BrikBludgaard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">With Bard song and raid buffs plus the damage from the shield thats a 120pt+ done and healed per hit...  this is not counting stackable rclick toys.<br />
<br />
if the mob hits for 2500 and you heal 125 every hit then you have a 5% mitigation.<br />
<br />
if the mob hits you for a lower hit (say 1000ish from a 2500 hit) then you just mitigated 12.5%<br />
<br />
Remember, its 125 from EVERY hit... even the ones you mitigate down to 1 with Shield of the Void.<br />
<br />
With enough AC, and facing mobs with low max hits, Shadowknights would become competitive with warriors...  pehaps superior vs specific mobs. (light but fast hitters??)<br />
<br />
note, the ability can be scaled to fit...  add damage to the innate DS part, or change it to have a duration and be more potent.<br />
<br />
Toy?  Not when used with strategy and by combining other classes' abilities together.<br />
<br />
Now add in a warrior shielding the Shadowknight...<br />
<br />
<br />
Note, heavy-hitters would remain the realm of Warriors, and be in the realm of &quot;stop the uber from eating clerics for 18 seconds&quot; for the shadowknight. (using Shield of the Void)<br />
<br />
<br />
Why ISN'T raiding about using various classes' abilities??<br />
(right now its about three classes.. clerics, warriors, and damage.)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Karnij</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I agree with number 2 or 3 who said <br />
<br />
sony has re enstated warriors as &quot;the tank&quot; so they should boost our DPS up our dmg tables on 1hadners and 2handers <br />
<br />
they are the tank class to tank not take dmg better and do more dmg than us.   <br />
<br />
<br />
WHAT EVER YOU DO SONY VI PLZ DO IT MAKE US ScALE UP AS TANKS OR AS DMGDEALERS but FOR GOD SAKES don't focus on HT and pets to &quot;class balance&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Haven't read the entire thread, but we need a new tap this would be nice:<br />
<br />
Touch of Brael<br />
1974 tap<br />
1353 mana<br />
1.0 cast time<br />
50 sec recast<br />
4.5 sec recovery time<br />
magic -500 resist check</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>BrikBludgaard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Good plan Brael.<br />
<br />
We will put that one right next to Warrior insta-complete heal.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Seriously now...<br />
<br />
We are never going to even approach the damage dealers...<br />
Except perhaps if we are getting beat on.<br />
<br />
<br />
Why not use our HP and defensive melee skills in combination with our spells to form our main mode of operation?? yes even in raids...<br />

His penis legnth. :o <br />
<br />
If they gave us a DS of 100 or more, like intense hatred giving us 20 DS per rank while we have a DS buff on, then we might be put back in the DPS tank department. It works only when we're tanking though, which doesn't solve anything for our raiding situation.</div></div><hr />
