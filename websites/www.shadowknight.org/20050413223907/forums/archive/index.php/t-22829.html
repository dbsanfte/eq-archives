<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Astarin ShadowPrince</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Maybe I missed it... but I looked for it...<br />
<br />
I think I have been on 6 Manaetic behemoth raids now... all wiped...<br />
<br />
Anyone have a good strategy they could point me to?<br />
<br />
 I have been looking around and just can't find one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1st:<br />
get a good tank (time equipped war)<br />
get 4 - 6 good encs<br />
set up groups on one side of door and buff then. clerics/druids should not use MGB for the buffing, they need to save it.<br />
split up half the people, one half on each side of doors, have encs at corners.<br />
<br />
2nd part: when you're all set up<br />
encs sit and look pretty, the two seperate sides kill all spiders until MB is targettable<br />
<br />
3rd part:<br />
enchanters at corners start mezzing all spiders. they can start with bliss and switch to AE mez<br />
group with MA/SA/TA/bard go in first and engage MB<br />
everyone but clerics and druids follow in 10 seconds or so.<br />
clerics and druids use quick heals to heal MA, as long as the MA is near the middle of the room both sides can land quick heals on him without going in room and getting hit by AE.<br />
have an MGB HoT/SotW order set up, and when its their turn the clerics/druids should run into center of room and cast the MGB heals, then go back outside and heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Onoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You dont need a time equiped warrior to do MB.  You dont even need an elemental geared warrior to do MB.  Its the first or very near the first raid target in PoP.  I mean why suggest that you get a warrior with gear beyond the event to do the event itself?   :rolleyes: <br />
  Its pretty simple.  Get two teams of CC.  Use the CC to keep the spiders from entering the room and triggering the AE.  While the CC is keeping the spiders out of the room, corner the MB and have the raid attack him.  Its that simple.  The specifics like his AE and what resists your raid needs and range of the AE and similar stuff, you can find on allakhazam.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">you don't need it, but it makes it a hell of a lot easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Arikash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">A time geared warrior makes every big raid a lot easier, last time we did behe, he had his knockback AE that scared the shit out of me when it happened the first time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Astarin ShadowPrince</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">One of the problems I have is being on The Rathe, with the RTA rules... We have several good tanks... although none of them Time equipped, and had him to 40 pct last attempt... and having to maintain this within our guild... we did well... VERY well in fact... I think we just let the spiders stack up too long during the last minute instructions... Hopefully attempting again tomorrow night... Everyone pray to Bertoxxulous and Innoruuk for us!<br />
<br />
we are using 4 chanters in the corners... and fighting spiders in the corners as well... I am going to attempt to get this adjusted tomorrow... I hope it works out a little better... sounds like the recommended strategy is what we are using... was just wondering if there might have been any better ideas, Thanks much... as for the MGB part... good thought we hadn't done that yet...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gentian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The only thing that I can add to this is that you can have good success when everyone is going &quot;balls to the wall&quot; against him.  Just go nuts with the damage, he drops in seconds that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Scabben</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">In a nutshell:<br />
<br />
Kill spiders for 5-10 minutes... do this however you want.<br />
<br />
At the end of those minutes, blur any spiders and let them pass.<br />
<br />
Prep your raid force for the fight:<br />
<br />
Everyone at east door.<br />
Healers are to the left as you face the door.  They are to hide around the little jutted thing there.  They need to pin themselves in that jut as close as possible to the door.<br />
<br />
Take your enchanters and spread them back out to CC spiders.<br />
<br />
MT Group:<br />
<br />
Tank 1, 2, 3, bard, healer healer (should be suffice np)<br />
<br />
Healer group:<br />
<br />
Healerx5, bard (a bst for paragon if you have one lacking MGB works in here also)<br />
<br />
Add a healer to all other groups if available.. use pallies, etc for group type heals.<br />
<br />
MT goes in (or weaponshield ranger works, along w/ a pally w/ pacification -- don't use DA).  MT pulls to inside left corner (from east door), generates his agro (use an SK to build if you're worried).  Raid force follows him in after like... 6 seconds or so, burns down Mr MB -- fire off ANY AE heals ... if 2 can go at once, make sure your raid party knows to have like 3-4 buff slots open for heals/mb ae dot effects.<br />
<br />
Did I mention burn?  Yes.. you wanna be full dps on him... which means tank needs damn good agro because if MB turns.. you're only hurting your efforts.<br />
<br />
Once he is dead, clear out the room.  Find a monk to pull Giwin to raid.  As long as you keep Giwin agro'd.. he'll last as long as 30 minutes for you (which allows for things Sony wouldn't like).  Enchanters blur and let their spiders go back into room.  Once the dust settles and everyone is rezzed, get a link on loots, assign them, and keep an eye on spiders, and let people in to loot.<br />
<br />
Not really all that hard.. just pay attention -- doable w/ 24 no problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>cames</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">As an alternate strategy,<br />
<br />
- Set kill spider teams at each of the 4 corners leading to the MB room.  These will consist of Knights, Beasts, Shamans, Monks, Rogues + a few others (chanters included) who can neither heal effectively nor range attack effectively.<br />
<br />
- Set a MT and a ST (just in case) with a bard.<br />
<br />
- Create healing groups.<br />
<br />
- Create Ranged DPS groups.<br />
<br />
1 - Kill Spiders and keep killing them through entire fight.<br />
<br />
2 - When MB pops, MT engages and healing begins.  ST with some healing engages to build aggro.<br />
<br />
3 - Range DPS engages, burns down MB<br />
<br />
4 - 1 corner at a time (or more if you have enough chanters) get the spiders cleared (so there is 0 aggro) or spiders memblurred (so there is 0 aggro)<br />
<br />
5 - Hail and loot<br />
<br />
This fight strategy has some advantages and disadvantages against the burn it down fast strategy.  It takes longer and requires a bit more control (something that will be useful later).  It simplifies the healing job in some ways, and if you have an alt clicky cleric (like I do) one can recover from a wipe of the DPS/Healers pretty easily.  If you don't have lots of chanters, and have good DPS (particularly Ranged DPS) this strategy can be effective.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I bet an EP equiped Knight could tank him, I tanked him about a month ago or so for a pickup raid, he was laughable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>tanadil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">100% dont need a warrior/ tank beyond the events designed lvl.<br />
In fact if you are in aprogressive guild that are raiding and progressing together then it would be outrageous to ask your normal tanks to step down in favour of a higher end equiped fella imho.<br />
<br />
MB is easy when you get the tactics right. However Imho it does require some good preraid planning and everyone to remain very disciplined, coz as you have found it can get nasty really quick otherwise.<br />
<br />
Lots of ways to do it, most of which are covered above.<br />
<br />
When we do him then we set 4 groups onto the spiders, mezzer in each group. The rest of the raid onto the MB himself but a ranged fight. Healers/ casters stay round the corner out the way of any nasty AOE. Once MT has aggro then burn him to the ground. Then keep killing the spiders till all are rezzed, loot sorted, hails done etc.. etc...<br />
<br />
Oh and I would strongly endorse the idea above  on MGB HOT.<br />
As a guild that never went thru VT our resists overall are failry light in comparison to a guild gone through SSRA/VT. So we always, always have Beastlords use The spell Paragon of Spirit combined with their MGB during fights wehere AOE can cause all manner of aggro issues.<br />
POS is a fast mana/ HP regen and on fights like the MB but even more so on Aerin Darr etc... its damm usefull to have Bsts chucking this on the raid every so often.<br />
<br />
One last point, you mentioned spiders stacking up during last min instructions. Maybe I am reading this wrong, but you dont need to touch or kill, mezz anything till the raid is set. Just keep everyone out of the MB room, spiders wont aoe on anyone outside the room.  When all are in place and ready, then get your spider groups to start clearing/ mezzing. 5 mins later MB pops, get your MA in the MB room and any other brave mele. Everyone else stay outside.:)<br />
<br />
Good luck with it anyways.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Neithan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">One other thing to consider if enchanters are a problem is kiters. Enchanters start by mezzing and then kiters snare mezzed mobs to take them off the enchanter.<br />
<br />
This is what one of our druids ended up with (http://www.povartarewalliance.org/album/Brindlefoot/0)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Scabben</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">LOL @ that pic<br />
<br />
My strat above simply mentions a way to do with 2 enchanters and some nice dps in a low number raid format.  Like I said.. the more the merrier for MB (the spiders don't have to die tho.. just keep them controlled)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Croix VorAbaddon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Here's the strat used by my Alliance:<br />
<br />
This strat needs 4 decent tanks for corners, MT and ST/RT, 4 chanters AT LEAST, the more the better, and 4 druids, again, the more the better. Also, as many TS rangers as you can snag. 10 or so will be perfect.<br />
<br />
Create four mez groups. These should container a chanter, perhaps a second if available, and a druid snarer. Rangers will NOT suffice, you'll see why in a minute. Also in this group should be a tank, and a healer. The rest are DPS gravy. Assigned these groups to corners by direction: NW, NE, SE, SW. Use the map to get it right.<br />
<br />
Once those groups are in their corners, the rest of the DPS/Tanks head to a corner that seems to need people and waits.<br />
<br />
At this time, the MT, RT, and ST stand by a door to MB and ready themselves. Clerics stand at the wall looking at the door.<br />
<br />
At this time, the Raid Leader calls for spider kills to begin. At this point, everyone grabs a spider and the slaughter begins. After a few minutes, the MT should be able to target MB. At this point, the RL calls to finish the current spider, and mez the rest. Once this is call, tanks and dps OTHER THAN rangers finish the mobs. Rangers report to the MB door. Either one will work, since this won't last long.<br />
<br />
HoT the MT and RT, and they charge. Soon as the MT is ready, he'll call something like &quot;RANGED ATTACKERS! ASSIST ME NOW!&quot; at which point, the ranger move into bow range, preferably IN the room so as not to draw MB out if they somehow get aggro, and begin plinking away. Soon after this, the MT calls Trueshot. All rangers Trueshot at once. MB should be mowed down before he knows what hit him.<br />
<br />
If things begin to go to hell, or the TS barrage doesn't kill him, the MT calls for an all-melee assist. All melee's rush in, and go all out, full offensive discs.<br />
<br />
As long as aggro is managed well, he's toast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Astarin ShadowPrince</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Everyone thanks for the input, a plan compiled of all of this goes live in about an hour... I'll post the exact strat that we use, and the success rate of it, including detailed listing of classes etc in the next couple days... for now basic plan is...<br />
<br />
1. Kill spiders...<br />
2. set 2 clerics up at one door, myself at the other...<br />
3. Harmshield my way in...<br />
4. clerics DA in behind MB...<br />
5. engage is called... everyone runs from spider rooms... they have 10 seconds to be in... at 4 seconds I click HS, and clerics click DA... I get solid agro, clerics spam small heals...6 seconds to do this...<br />
6. everyone engages max damage output and we all fry his circuits... we'll see.<br />
6. Enchanters and other CCers stay in spider rooms to keep thier buddies busy for 30 seconds.<br />
Again thanks all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kilkulan Darkwarrior</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">ummm basic everything... no one steps in MBS room but Main tank... have everyone range from door.. easyest MB  raid you will ever do</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Astarin ShadowPrince</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">we got him to 24... had a bit of a problem with healing... other then that it went great... next time going for the pure ranged other then MT...

<br />
same basic plan...without the cleric going in with me... subtract the raid rush... add alot of arrows and some SERIOUS nuke power... I think we got one &quot;dead&quot; mech! oh yes and... pop leechcurse the second I drop harmshield. instead of miskeying and hitting HT... like I told the raid... my bad.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i don't care if a knight can tank it, even if you can its dumb.<br />
you should have a warrior go in with a bard playing psalm of veeshan following along with your SA/TA. warrior pops furious when MB starts beating on him, switches to defensive... he's taking a lot less damage which lets healers only use quick heals on him from outside of the room (quick heals have 200 range, ch only has 100 range).<br />
<br />
also, any competent enchanter can keep all the spiders AE mezzed for what should be the duration of your fight, so just let them do their job. if you're really worried, also assign a snarer to back up each enc. everyone else should do DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>nezzka is sexy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">ok window, how about this,<br />
<br />
get a time geared raid force, then get time geared war to tank, while chanters mezz and others attack/heal!</div></div><hr />

 ? So would having a full raid group of Time equiped peeps ? But then thier wouldnt be a point to it if they were timed equiped. :confused:</div></div><hr />

What happens if you don't have 4 chanters online?<br />

Suppose no warrior logs in that night?<br />
<br />
That is the point of some these other strats.  There are alternate ways of doing the mobs without certain classes.  It may not be the most efficient or &quot;the best&quot; way of doing things, but it allows the guild to continue without core class attendance.<br />
<br />
For some encounters there are no good alternatives (Rathe Council without mezzing, might be an example).  For many encounters, there are lots of ways to complete them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i'd recruit from outside the guild in those cases.<br />
if your guild doesn't have 1 warrior online, its doubtful you have the force necessary to kill MB anyway.<br />
and why designate 24 people to do what 4 enchanters can? if you choose to have groups kill the spiders, you need about 1000 DPS that could be on MB to keep the spiders dying.<br />
<br />
there are alternate ways to do encounters sure... but this guy keeps failing, so why not try a smart way?</div></div><hr />

Tell me... although I'm kinda new to hanging out here... is this window someone we can't simply look through?<br />

The whole point of this is that there are alternate strategies to ANY encounter that can make the encounter a win.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Astarin ShadowPrince</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Very basically the reason I am tanking is because I am one of the few 8-8.5k tanks we have, we are very short on warriors... even if I would prefer having a warrior tank it would require one of our 2 to sign on, I personally don't plan on waiting for them, if we got him to 24 with myself tanking a good portion of it and a pally going from there, I am sure we can do it... if one of our warriors was on, we would have won.<br />
<br />
It may be dumb for you to have a knight tank him, but ya know, sometimes the key classes aren't present... so you make do with what you have. If the knight wins, then you are that much further. If the knight loses... oh well, at least he tried.<br />
