<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Might be worth it if your able to get one at a low enough level to get some use out of it, but for the most part not worth the trouble.<br />
<br />
If you love doing quests or feel incomplete as an SK without and epic then by all means go for it.<br />
<br />
If your in any kind of raiding guild lots of better weapons are out there and some bazaar weapons are decent too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's a trophy.  Do it because you like questing.  Do it because you want possibly the coolest looking weapon in the game.  Do it simply because you want to be able to say you did.<br />
<br />
Don't do it because you want a weapon upgrade.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You question has been asked a dozen times.  If you want to just buy something, just buy something.  If your guild is moving through content as designed and you're farming the planes, do the epic.  If your guild is past the planes, loot something better.  There doesnt need to be this big internal conflict and despair about how 4 your old weapons are obsolete.  Clear?</div></div><hr />
