<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Izus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just curious if these are useful and if they are actually working unlike most of GoD stuff so far.  Using my uber powers of search I saw only one comment from Brael stating they were useless. <br />
<br />
Anyway, I dinged my first point last night and it said 1 of 8 (group). Not really sure what the 8 signifies (is there a cap?).  Any input would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Leadership points are capped based on level.  So you can't have more than 8 saved up, basically.<br />
<br />
Raid leader points seem to be broken at the moment -- I never managed to even make the bar move despite being raid leader for an entire vex thal clearing.<br />
<br />
If you DON'T WANT group leader exp (which reduces your normal exp by 20%) then turn it off.<br />
<br />
-Bolas</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I haven't seen that much discussion either regarding leadership skills.  Although some look ho-hum, others look fairly interesting.<br />
<br />
At first glance, Mark NPC looks interesting but would be impractical for a SK (IMO, first reaction) especially if they are MA/MT -- since we wouldn't have time to be marking NPC's while tanking.  Seems more like a good chanter leadership skill.<br />
<br />
That said, what WOULD be a good first skill to get?  I know that the general concensus on leadership skills is that they aren't worth it, but I do have most of the non-GoD AA's where I want them and although I could focus on some new GoD AA's, I don't think I'd miss 20% funnelled off (not that I get much more than 1 - 2 AA's per day at best).<br />
<br />
I'm leaning towards Delegate Main Assist.  If I understand correctly, I should be able to target myself and designate myself MA and then the mobs that I have targetted will be marked somehow.  IMO, this should aid cc'ers and offtankers to know which mob I have on a multi-pull so that they can take care of the add(s).  Do I have that right?<br />
<br />
Also, making some assumptions that perhaps some beta testers or peeps with some of these skills already can confirm or deny:<br />
<br />
- to use a group leadership skill, do I have to be group leader at the time?<br />
<br />
- if so to the above, can I then make someone else leader and have the skill I activated previously still be active?<br />
<br />
- can several different skills be active by several different group members (by cycling leadership and using their skill) at any given time?<br />
<br />
- do these skills (such as Delegate Main Assist) persist through zoning?<br />
<br />
- is there any reuse time on these?  Such as the group hp or mana enhancing skills?<br />
<br />
- someone mentioned somewhere (don't remember where) that some of these skills use the song window (I assume the hp / mana ones but maybe applies to all skills?), is this true?<br />
<br />
That's about all the questions I have regarding this.  I only have 2 group leadership points, so it'd be a while before I get to spend it on anything, but would like to at least make a good first choice (taking into consideration that the main group enchanter will be getting Mark NPC as his first skill).<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Here's my initial thoughts on it.   I'm going to be working on group leadership because it looks kind of fun.  Here's what I'm looking at doing, and as I get skills I'll post how they are.<br />
<br />
First I'm going to be doing Mark Path to PC.  I am in too many groups, LDoN and others, where someone gets seperated from the group or wanders off and gets killed or something.  This skill should let a lost person get a find path that works similar to the merchant finder in bazaar.<br />
<br />
The Delegate MA will be my next one.  that one should be especially useful to chanters.  If they can instantly see which mob you have targetted, they can target the other one and mez it.  This seems very useful.  I probably would do it first if it wasn't for the fact that my GF has problems getting lost and I'm grouping with her all the time.<br />
<br />
Next will probably be the leadership skill that increases partys max HP.  I'm not sure how much it adds, but it would be kinda nice to be able to give everyone in the party a HP boost.<br />
<br />
There used to be a mana regen one, but it was removed.  the HP regen one would only be slightly useful.<br />
<br />
Most of them seem kinda useful.  Not sure if it's enough to make it worth them in all cases, but I'll post more as I get skills.  Almost have two points right now. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Vex Thall raid exp is absolute ass anyways.  It MIGHT cover from the losses of a death or 2 if you have real exp going the whole time.  Might be why you didn't notice much for raid leader exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kormus the Dark Angel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Nope Joshad what he was probably referring to was the wrong display of leader experience - I got a feeling that the xp bar only shows 60% of RL xp instead of 100% - when doing 20% every half hour on raids it stopped at 99% and would not move a bit after that. Till you suddenly ding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">In other words, yet another piece of GoD is broken?  Beautiful....</div></div><hr />

I should have my find pc group leadership skill by this weekend at the latest.  Have 3 points now.  Will post when I get it and let you know what i think.  Soon some of the women that I group with regularly will stop getting themselves lost when we adventure. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Lynxal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The first level of the ATK leadership ability for 4 points adds 10ATK.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Thack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I got the Find Path to PC AA.  It works pretty good overall.  Does exactly what is expected.  Select a group PC, click the hotkey (or use /findpc command) and it does a path to the person like the bazaar feature.  Does it to current location of PC though, so if they move then the get to see where the person was, rather than where they are.<br />
<br />
Seems to be problems in some LDoN if people are in certains spots where it won't work, but it works most places.<br />
<br />
I know it's not the first one that some people would go for, but it's one of the more useful ones for some of my friends I group with. :D<br />
<br />
Think I'm going to work on Delegate MA next, followed by the HP ones.  If someone wants to beat me to the HP ones, I'd appreciate it.  Dunno if it gives enough HP to matter a lot or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I got Delegate MA last week, it's pretty neat IMO.  Any mob that is targetted by the MA will be seen by group members (who I hear must have the GoD expansion to see it) to have a pulsating targetting ring.  Hard to describe but let's say the default ring for a blue con looks like a smokey blue ring.  Well with the new ring, you can see the blue still but it's overlaid by a concentric ring thing that goes in and out from the outside of the ring to the inside of the ring.  Kinda um... disco-like, heh.  Also, above the player's head there are brackets to distinguish them from other mobs, e.g. &gt;&gt; an orc pawn &lt;&lt;.  Must be 3 people in group before you can activate it.<br />
<br />
I got Health Enhancement 1 this weekend.  Every group member gets 30 hp as long as the person with the skill is group leader.  Minimum 2 members in group.  If you pass leadership onto someone else, the hp disappears instantly.  I have just over 4 more points now, so I should have Health Enhancement 2 in a day or two.  I heard it gives 60 points *on top of* the 30 you got for level 1, won't be able to confirm first hand until I get it and try.  So it'd be either 60 (30+30) or 90 (30+60)... if the latter, lvl 3 will be maybe 180 hp (?).  I do plan to take this one all the way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Update: got Health Enhancement 2 last night, only got 30 more hp with it, over and above the initial 30 hp.  So, level 3 (for 8 points) will most likely be 30 points too, meaning 90 pts fully maxed for a total of 18 points.  ND/PE/PD, etc. have no effect on it, just hp tacked on top of whatever hp you currently have.<br />
<br />
I still think it's worthwhile, definitely not a must-have.<br />
<br />
Could be fun killing low-hp groupmembers by transferring group leadership at a really bad time... :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Thack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">That kinda sucks.  That's a lot of work for just 90 HP.  I think that after I get delegate MA in two points I may give another skill a try instead.  Get more info on the boads as to the different skills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Perhaps true, 90 hp doesn't seem all that much for 18 points; but it sounded more beneficial than the other skills (to me).  I'm still going to finish the line out but not sure what to go for after that.<br />
<br />
Maybe the atk one.  I heard it's only 10 atk per lvl, which would mean 30 atk at lvl 3 for 18 points -- and that doesn't sound like a whole lot either... but since I'm lacking in Veng/AoB/Aoc items anyways, it sounds like a plan.  I haven't gone out of my way to earn leadership points (i.e. grinding) but 14 points in just over 2 weeks doesn't seem that slow... maybe I could have had one or two more aa in that time.</div></div><hr />

30hp may not seem much but if you could upgrade 1 piece of armor that much you would apply that item more than likely.</div></div><hr />

<br />
thats 540 hps for 18 aa.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Thack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Well, here is my thoughts on the group leadership now that it's been around for a while.<br />
<br />
First of all, if you are going to do it, I would strongly suggest going with the HP add, Delgate MA, or maybe the atk one (though less emphasis there) and then working on the others.  It's not so much that these are so awesome as it is that if you have skills that the entire group wants, it's going to be easier to get leadership and gain more skill.  I chose to do Find Path to PC because of a couple friends I group with that are always getting lost.  Although for me this was a very logical move based on the people I group with, there are at least 2-3 groups I've been with that someone else was working on leadership, but didn't have any skills.  They weren't willing to turn leadership over for Find Path to PC, but if I had a more useful skill, they most likely would have.  Basically you chose the skills that will make people hand you leadership for so you can gain more leadership in the end.<br />
<br />
Second, you need to go all or nothing in leadership.  I feel that a month or two down the road, leadership is going to be based on who has the most/best skills to offer a group.  If you are just slightly working on leadership, then you aren't going to be leader much and you aren't going to get skills.  If you want leadership skills, you have to work hard at them so that you will always be chosen if there is a conflict.  Currently I have about 7 leadership points, and it's more than anyone else I've grouped with so far.  If my prediction is right, then I will continue to get group leadership and there won't ever be any conflicts with other people wanting to be leader.  If you have half a dozen useful group skills, and the current leader just has one, then the entire group is going to want group leader to turn it over and he won't have as much choice.<br />
<br />
Third, leadership is only minimally helpful.  90 HP for 18 points is a lot of points to spend, and 90 HP isn't that many.  Heck, you can get almost 250 HP from tribute (or 150 if you have capped stamina).  Most of our AAs that give HP give more HP per level than this skill.  30 atk isn't a huge deal either.  Aura of Hate, which you have to parse over a period of time to see any difference is over 100 atk.  It takes almost 200 atk to have a difference that you can notice without having to parse.  Yes, all of these can add up and it can help when you stack lots of little things, but just keep in mind that all of these skills are only of minimal use, so you need to decide for yourself if it's worth it.  For every group leadership point you lose about one AA.  For my 7 group points I could have 7 AAs.  It's very debatable in my mind whether it's really worth it in the end or not.  Personally I'm going to still keep going with it because for me I enjoy the group skills, and as many who notice my posts, I always tell people to do what is fun for you rather than what is going to be the most uber.<br />
<br />
Fourth, Leadership seems to be based on the level of mobs that are being killed or number (not sure exactly on level, just a guess), but you gain leadership at the same rate at any level.  You play a 15th level guy in groups and you will get leadership at the same rate as higher levels.  To me, this says that leadership at pre-50 levels is more worth it than later levels in some ways.  Anyways, it also means that if you are in a raid, you definately want group leadership.  If you are group leader in a raid, you can get some awesome leadership points, even though exp is horrible.  Last night my guild tried RZ a couple times and failed both times.  Despite that, I earned two yellow bubbles of leadership exp, and not enough AA exp to really notice.  You *DO* always want group leadership in raids.  This is the one time that I can say that it is definately worth it 100% of the time.  The gains outweigh the losses without a doubt (since there is practically no loss since you aren't really getting noticable xp anyways)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Thack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">btw, it appears that the amount of leadership exp that you gain has been increased.  I noticed that in a typical LDoN adv I can get about half a group point now, and it used to be about half of that.  Kinda nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Thack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Oh, and just for kicks I got the skill for showing NPC HP.  Maybe it changes when you have other skills as well (like mark NPC), but it's not even worth two points from what I've seen.  You have to have the mob targetted, and then it adds a health percentage to it's name (like A_Lame_Mob_76%).  Since it has to be targetted, it's useless because you can see the same info on your target bard.  Will post if it changes with mark NPC or others, but I'd say that unless it does change, skip this one for sure.  Definately NOT worth 2 points.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This was the first (and only so far) leadership AA I've gotten and was initially excited becaues it would help the healers see how far down a mob was without having to target it... looks like I was wrong, as Thack points out above... Hoping that changes as I accumulate AA's but as it is now - I have to agree - worthless skill indeed....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Thack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I should know soon if the health one works with the mark NPC skills or others.  Have 2 points now, and should have 3-4 by tomorrow.  Not sure if I want to go for the Delegate MA or Mark NPC first.  Guess you'll know in a couple days. :)<br />
<br />
Anyways, now that they have bumped the exp up, it's much more worth doing than it used to be.<br />
<br />
Also, it turns out that so far I have been right about the idea that the more points you have the more likely you are to get leadership.  I now have 12 points, and most groups let me have leadership even if the current leader is working on group leadership.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, I agree.  I used to hate being leader with a passion (always have to invite LD group members that came back while tanking, having to request adventures instead of getting afk breaks, etc. hehe).  On the first day of GoD release, we had a board discussion within guild (very small guild, mind you) before any of us got any leadership abilities, and it was decided that our enchanter should get Mark NPC.  After he got his 4 points for that, he found that he rarely had time to be marking npc's, let alone be able to spare the hotbutton slots.  So it was decided that most times, I'd be leader since it was determined that I could better 'afford' a 20% penalty.<br />
<br />
Now with Health 3, Delegate MA, Target's Target, Spell Awareness, it's generally accepted that it'd be unwise for someone else to be leader (sort of a vicious circle now).<br />
<br />
BTW OT: Thack, do you play on Prexus?  Saw a 65 SK with that name the other day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>cauchy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Mark NPC has its uses for pullers.  My regular exp group has Delegate MA, Mark NPC and Delegate Mark NPC 1.  I usually use mark on roamers to wait for when I'm splitting, or to tell the group which target to attack first on a multiple pull.  While the mark does take a hotkey slot, I think that the ease of communication it gives is worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Thack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Good idea there cauchy.  I hadn't thought of that use for it.<br />
<br />
I have however figured that mark NPC and delegate mark NPC would be nice for chanters to let them mark when mob to attack next when mezzing lots of mobs.<br />
<br />
If anyone else has useful ways for using mark npc, please post.  I'd like to get as much use out of them as possible.<br />
<br />
<br />
I did find out that the mark health one *does* work with mark npc.  If you have a target marked, you will see the health, even if you have someone else targetted.  I'm guessing that means that if you have 3 levels of it, you'd see health on all three marked targets.  Makes it a fair bit more useful.<br />
<br />
I think that I'm going to go for Delegate MA next, followed by health of targets health (Klotar's comments on it today chatting convinced me to do that), and then the three HP ones.  Should keep me busy for a bit.  :)</div></div><hr />

Group leadership I doubt the usefulness, would rather go for hp and atk instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Thack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Kormus, it depends on how you play.  If you group a lot, group leadership is very useful.  If you mostly just raid, then it's not quite as useful.  Very situational.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Thack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I still disagree.  My GF plays a cleric, and she often likes to know what the mobs health is.  She is always targetting me though, so she has to turn and look at my computer.  She's been actively encouraging me to get this skill because she wants it. Clerics would appreciate this the most.<br />
<br />
Also, group skills work when you are in raids, so if you have the group version, and the raid leader doesn't have it, then it will at least help for your group.  I still think it's worth getting personally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Reyortsed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Thack, I was commenting about HoTT as a group leadership skill - I consider it quite useless there.<br />
<br />
I would definately disagree w/ that.  This skill is useful in just about any group/raid situation.  When regular trash npc's start hitting for over 1200+,  its very nice to know the instant someone besides the tank has aggro.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Kormus the Dark Angel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Seriously - when you need to get a new target window to see who the mob is agro on you should get a new group or stop playing in a raid on another server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Thack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Well, you may not think it's worth it Kormus, but some of us apparently do.  It's really not a big deal.  I think a lot of things are like that.  7 points is a fair bit, but it does have it's uses, even if they are trivial.  For my GF, the main use is just convenience of knowing how hurt the mob is without having to go out of your way to change targets.  Once I have that skill, it will be easier for her to time her heals so that I am healed at the end of a fight rather than mob dying when I'm at 40% and then having to wait 10 seconds for CH before I can go pull again.<br />
<br />
No, it's not a heck of a big deal, but it is a convenience.  You may never agree and you may not want the skill, but some of us will enjoy it.  To be honest, most of the skills you can get are only slightly useful and not very many will make a huge difference, but they are fun to play with.<br />

On the bright side, now that they increased group exp, it's now 5 group points you gain per AA lost (depending on where you adv).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Thack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Just realized that I forgot to post some extra info I learned about group exp.<br />
<br />
Group exp is based (from what I can tell) entirely off of the number of mobs killed that you get exp for.  It is not based off of any percentage of exp like normal AA/exp.  If you fight in LDoN, you kill more mobs that are worth less exp than BoT for example.  You don't get as much AA as you would in BoT, but you will get more group exp because you are killing more mobs.<br />
<br />
In addition, group exp seems to go up at the same rate no matter what level mobs you are killing.  If you are 20th level and put exp to group, you'll gain it just as fast as if you are 65th level and put exp to group.<br />
<br />
I have found that on LDoN adventures that I typically gain half a group point and a bit less than half an aa.  This means that when I do two adventures I'll usually have about 1 group point and a bubble or so short of an AA.  That means that over 10 adventures, I'll have about 5 group points and 4 AAs.  Had I not had group exp going, I would have had about 5 AAs, so as I posted earlier, for each AA you lose in exp, you earn about 5 group points.  That's really not too bad of a deal.<br />
<br />
That means that the health ones that add 30 HP end up costing about 1 AA worth of exp.  I don't think there is anyone here that would say that 30 HP isn't worth 1 AA.  heck, you end up spending about 3 AAs for the same HP when you get planar durability.<br />
<br />
Also, if you are raiding, especially raids like VT or such where there are lots of mobs killed, make sure you get group leadership.  You get group points at the same rate for each mob killed in a raid as you would if you were in a group and killed those same mobs.  I always try to get leadership in a raid that will be killing lots of mobs for that very reason.  Few times i've earned a couple bubbles of group exp from a PoP raid.</div></div><hr />

Path to PC is good in LDoN, and for long trips to camp, but otherwise isn't all that great.<br />
<br />
Spell awareness. $$$. So nice to see which mobs are hasting each other and which have what to dispell before inc. CH is nice to see too.<br />
<br />
Main assist is pretty much bread and butter of leadership aa. HP and ATK are solid spends as well.<br />
<br />
The rest are kinda like Path to PC...useful in niche situations, but overall kinda bleh.</div></div><hr />

As group leader, you can assign MA to yourself, or anyone else in group.<br />

It used to be early on that you could get leadership xp with 2 peeps, get the hp benefit of Health Enhancement and other passive skills with 2 peeps, etc., although the other activated skills like Delegate MA required 3 peeps or more to activate.<br />
<br />
Now you need 3 peeps for even the passive skills to work and the of course the activated ones too.  And I am fairly certain that now you require 3 in a group to earn Leadership xp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>SweetMeef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Ok thanks.<br />
I sometimes box a shammy on one comp, but I may get a war or monk or rog to box on a second comp for the leadership AA. And yes, you do Not get it w/ just 2 people.<br />
Maybe I can find a 3rd..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Bumluk Rayrspaun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">You're right, it takes 3.  I could have sworn I used to get it with 2, but it didn't work yesterday with 2.</div></div><hr />

Mark NPC gives same effect as Delegate MA (fixed target ring on Mob) BUT, you can target around and taunt as you wish, and the Mark doesnt change.<br />
Downside is that you are the only person who can do this, and you need to hit a macro to put on Mark.<br />
<br />
My &quot;Mark 1&quot; button:<br />
/gmarknpc 1<br />
/g Engage mob Marked [ 1 - %t ] Keep DPS on that !<br />
<br />
<br />
NPC Health can be used as a cheap Health of Target's Target. The mob that you target, your group can see the % health over its head, even if they dont have it as target.<br />
Its not the same, but close :)<br />

raid XP I don't know yet. was RL yesterday but got no movement on bar. I was groupleader as well so this could have bugged it, although i got the You earned raidleadership exp messages.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Svartrot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">HoTT is extremely good on raids.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>SweetMeef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">Got HoTT, Delegate MA, and Health Enhance1 so far.<br />
Should I finish out Health Enhancement or get something else (for cheaper) like mana/offense?<br />
<br />
Points to ponder:<br />
As a tank I'd want Health, but you get to be leader more, the more Green you have (green letters means you've bought it). So I thought about getting a bunch of different ones since groupies can't see how many levels of one ability i have, but can see how many diff ones i have.<br />
<br />
Thoughts? opinions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Zakko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">I have Hp3, ATK5, Mana2, %health, Mark1, Delegate MA, HoTT. <br />
I was going for Mana3 then work Regen, but i was missinformed about how Spell Awareness works, or i think i was.<br />
<br />
So far i have just seen what it is mobs and pets are casting. The pets are anoying, but to see when mobs cast CH or Gate, that rocks (or dispell).<br />
<br />
Could someone please clarify just how spell awareness works ? If i take off NPC casting, will i not see the spell casting text?<br />

<br />
First off, NPC casting should always be on (and really should be notably colored), you're a bash-class, it's your job to help interrupt NPCs from gating/CHing/etc<br />
<br />
Spell Awareness messages look like:<br />
<br />
Thainden begins to cast a spell. (Touch of Innoruuk)<br />
Quarm begins to cast a spell. (Plagued Earth)<br />
<br />
So if NPC casting is off, you obviously won't see the message.</div></div><hr />
