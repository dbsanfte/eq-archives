<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Matador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Any info were the a wailing syster spawns in Pon? If it's not correct on the map provided. Also does anyone know the respawn time on her? Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thaln V'Orro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">She wanders that whole field, but she does normally path over to spiders regularly.  Set up at the dock and pull to there after you clear out some trash.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ilvai Oloth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">When I did her, we positioned ourselves in the cubby before the ZO.  She roams right next to the hill area where Vhakiz is.  She seems to roam there once every 5 minutes and stops for about 10 seconds.  That area's nice and clear of adds, also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ezele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">very ezy but at start sorta caught us off guard cuz we got a few adds and her aoe is aoe silence.  Only had like 4 people tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Halfwarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i tried to solo her =(  but seems you need to be flaged to that point to even get her to attack you.... so the sk has to do the pulling so it seems</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>kharan_zechts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">When I did it we set up at the hedge maze. She pathed over near the Vhaksiz hill and was an easy single.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>frotty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">1 hour respawn</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>The Zenogias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">And the actual battle was.....?? How many people, what did she do, what did you do?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>frotty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">She does a silence.<br />
Uhh... 1 group. <br />
<br />
Bring melee dps. Preferably a bard to slow as bard doesn't get silenced. Nothing remarkable past that, hits like a vxed trash mob... 700s rarely, usually 200-400s.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ahlana DaFosse</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">How long does her Silence last for? Is it resistable? Is it cureable?<br />
<br />
Thank you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Uvaavu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Her DPS is so pityful when slowed just SR from out of the AE range with a cleric.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Chania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I did it with a druid and a ranger. The silence doesn't last long, and she barely casts it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Carasak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">did her for a guildie with chanter, boxed beastlord, sk, sk, boxed cleric. tanking her with about 10khp y 2k ac. never went below 70% hp. didnt see single silence on me...others said it doesnt last long. max hit was arround 1.1k. was slowed easy and fight took about 2 minutes. <br />
all chars with time+ equippement apart from boxed ones.<br />
<br />
just wait for her to path to mujaki platform. SK who gets drop tags her and bring to group. we set up between hedge and platform.<br />
<br />
not really a mob to worry about</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Deathfighter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Killed her with the help of a 70 ranger and a 67 cleric. She hit for 1120 once and mostly 500ish the rest of the time. Cleric kept getting silenced and died 3/4 way into the fight. With the help of chaining lifetaps and IHT we killed her leaving me with 5% health and 20mana. AE was sticking about 25% of the time with 300 prismatic resists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Averse</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Her DPS is so pityful when slowed just SR from out of the AE range with a cleric.<br />
<br />
<br />
I show her AE to be 100' longer than SR is...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Uvaavu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Yep, guess my clerics resists held out :) I wasnt actually watching that screen so I probably missed the resist messages.<br />
<br />
Still a valid point is that SR alone was enough to keep the tank healed.</div></div><hr />
