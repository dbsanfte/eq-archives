<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zlandacar</div><div class="date">03-31-2002, 03:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought of a double weapon with two blade's that would do two attacks per round, but should be sort of 2H weapons only for a further upgrade to gimpy 2H weapons, but if we miss on the first attack we should miss the second hit indefinatly, but if all hits land we would quad hit, it would increase are damage, probably a stupid idea that only i would want but let me know what you guy's think.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't see how it could work, seems like it would be a really clumsy weapon, and hard to use...<br />
unless it was like a spear with 2 pointed ends.. or like that crappy kunark weapon thats a 2hb with spikes on each part...</div></div><hr />

<br />
2 flail heads if first hits, 2nd dose. If first misses 2nd gets a roll to see if it would to.<br />
<br />
Net idea.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krazix</div><div class="date">03-31-2002, 08:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The one i remember is like 6 / 30 2hb <br />
<br />
However it is likely that there is one I don't know about, as I hate kunark, and never go there.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dedbrain</div><div class="date">04-01-2002, 12:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Soulbinder is actually pretty decent, 24/36 2hb, procs about a 100pt dot lifetap or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khoth</div><div class="date">04-01-2002, 01:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Stat's are right but the proc on Soul Binder is a 75 pnts DoT lifetap that starts at 5 and increases in increments of 5 after that until 25 when the full 75 dam is done. The proc used to be 125 or 150 I hear but sadly was nerfed soon after Kunark came out. It is basically a better looking zealots incarnadine sword with a slightly worse ratio.<br />

the one im thinking of is called ketchaka coro mist or something like that I think,<br />
<br />
and it does suck if I remember correctly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Syfon</div><div class="date">06-13-2003, 01:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry for the old thread, it came up using the search feature.<br />
<br />
I recently got a Zeolot's Incarnadine Sword and It finally started going off at level 50. With the new messages that tell you exactly what your DoT damage is the damage is 4, 9, 14, 19, 24, and 29 when the effect runs all the way through. Thats 99 damage over 6 ticks total. <br />
<br />
BUT here is the important part. I was NOT being healed instead I was TAKING the same damage as the mob. The DoT effect was identical on me as on the mob. <br />
<br />
What I am wanting to know is if anyone actually looked at the effect on them and if they can confirm that this is what this effect now does. This really lowers the value of this weapon for obvious reasons esp if its the end of a close fight and you are low on health and it procs right before the mob dies, I still take the damage from the DoT.<br />
<br />
If anyone still has one of the weapons that has the effect Soul Bond I would appreciate it if they would experiment and see if this is what it does to them as well.<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance<br />

The negative proc is being discussed here (http://forums.shadowknight.org/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=14531) so may be better served in that link.<br />
I hope no one dies from the effect.  Leave it to SOE to reverse a beneficial proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vilesoul</div><div class="date">06-13-2003, 03:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Kechata Koro Mis is not the best weapon in the game, but I feel it was made for those who ignored their melee skills since it does seem to have the lowest delay of any droppable 2hb I've yet seen.<br />
<br />
Some weapons just aren't meant to be uber, like those broken bottles you find in LoY, now I almost want to put a stein in one of my SK's hands and that bottle in the other sometime, even if it's just for screwing around.  That and I wnat to get peircing up.<br />
<br />
<br />
Really I think staves should have 2 attacks per round anyways.  at least if it's used like a Bo staff and not like a thin club like it seems to be used as.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Forget the old days at Sarnak fort eh? It drops off of Sarnak Gem Oracles in the Fort at Lake of Ill Omen, During Kunark/Velious era that was a hot spot, course you knew that.....<br />
<br />
Random Note = Other Junk drops there like the Sarnak emblazed tabard, Sarnak sacraficial Dagger , and that no drop 2ac 3str earring every melee wanted back in the day lol.</div></div><hr />
