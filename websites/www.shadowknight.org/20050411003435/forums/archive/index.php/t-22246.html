<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ashrai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone know what exactly this IS?<br />
<br />
Zerker boards had some discussion on it, and opinions range from AE flurry to just AE melee.<br />
<br />
Have had people say they've gotten the Infuriate while being out of melee range. Have had times when I've been in melee range, had attack on, and Infuriate never hit me (and owned a bunch of wizzies)<br />
<br />
Does anyone know what exactly the definition is, and what determines who gets Infuriated?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">In mob terms it is kind of like an aoe rampage that hits everyone within a certain range of the mob.<br />
<br />
Its used in some of the ikkiniz trials on some of the bosses.  Basically the mobs seem to infuriate at around 50% health and will kill anyone within melee range.  So we just back up when the mob gets close to this level.  They seem to do it again around 10 percent health the ones I have seen anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ashrai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well that 'kinda' answers my question...<br />
<br />
As I mentioned above, I've been in melee range of the mobs when they infuriate, never had a chance to turn attack off, and never gotten the Infuriate.  <br />
<br />
Yea the ones we've done in Ikky seem to do it at 50% and 10%. But we've had people who were well out of melee range get it and others be untouched. <br />
<br />
The reason I ask is that I hear theories on everything from a set hate list to simple AE, so was wondering if anyone's ever figured it out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Temporary AE ramp.<br />
<br />
You'll only get hit if you're in range and the mob procs a ramp while infuriated.  Im amused at the mobs that infuriate but cant ramp.  Im even more amused when one quick furiate/ramp takes out all our guild applicants.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Saruton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Or the mob just happens to run straight to your clerics while infuriated ... thats fun to watch.</div></div><hr />
