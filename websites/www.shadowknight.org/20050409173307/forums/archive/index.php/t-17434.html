It's all about rep,grats to a good start.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Winkles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Many a poor hill giant died to buy my WMBS.  I went through the progression of 2hs weapons till I got.  Nathsar, Light velium claidmore, Greatsword of discipline, tae-ew 2hs, Reaver and then WMBS.  It is so nice for holding aggro.  Of course I have to sometimes use FD to get rid of aggro when not MT but who cares.   The only time I don't use it is when going against casters and I need to interupt the mob.  Then I pull out the cheap ole Shield of Rainbow Hues that gives +20 to all resists and a Sceptre of Lightning.  Congrats on buying such a fine weapon at such a good price.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Your level in relation to the warrior is why you were getting aggro so easily, the mob saw you were a weaker target so went for you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">yep, level aggro is significant.<br />
<br />
Bet the cleric wasn't real happy to have to heal the lower level tank all the time.</div></div><hr />
