<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Meriboh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Sounds like the accidental code that made Plane of Knowledge PvP enabled, is set to go live on all PvP servers next month.<br />
From what I’ve heard (listening to the chat in the Bazaar), looks like the Nexus will also be PvP enabled.<br />
Looks like some of us will have to rely on the old-world way of traveling..boats, running, ports etc.<br />
There will be mad rush for all those bound in PoK to be rebound in their home cities or Bazaar. This may be difficult for some, as not everyone can bind or their home city may be predominantly from the other team(s).<br />
<br />
I think this is one of the most ridiculous ideas to come to pass, as of recent, to PvP servers.<br />
<br />
For those who play on the Zeks, what are your thoughts on this?<br />
<br />
It sounds like PoK will have to be renamed PoC (Plane of Chaos)<br />

that no one else has very good faction with. It is not a starting city, and is somewhat out of the way. We have all started wizzies and druids on our second accounts for ports.<br />
We will work out of there, instead of PoK.</div></div><hr />

Kael isn't all that out of the way considering that you can port in and out of WL, and faction is much easier to gain here than killing stupid amounts of gobbies for salts and skins like Chardok.  <br />
<br />
I suppose it's the safest of any all things considered simply due to the timesink involved with faction there.<br />

Makes me glad I'm a bluebie  :D <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Meriboh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">For those who ruined their faction with their home cities, binding in another non-starting city is a good idea. As long as you have the best faction possible, I guess.<br />
Ruining my faction in Neriak was too easy, unfortunately. Neutral Dark Elves are a pain…<br />
Anyhow, I think I better take the time left and do the wine quest for an entire day.<br />
I think I’ll bind myself right on top of my Guild Master.<br />
<br />
The thing that concerns me the most about this change, is the deadly corpse runs that will surely plague you after a death in some far off, god forsaken zone…. God, I don’t miss those days.<br />

As far as Chardok, can you bind there?<br />

RZ though, i mean, we ahve halfers, high elves, dark elves, gnomes, trolls, etc. Can't exactly all bind in one of our starting cities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Atrocity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I don't think it will be all that different on the teams servers.  Tallon is very much a cross teaming server now, can't speak for Vallon or Sullon.  My main objection to PvP enabling PoK and PoT is that there is only one way into PoT. <br />
<br />
I'm tired of arguments along the lines of <br />
1) You don't remembe what it was like in the early days at the nek/ec zone line!<br />
2) It's a PvP server, get over it or move!<br />
<br />
The nek/ec were fun yes, but it wasn't like either one of those zones was the gateway to all of the key zones at the time.  Also, back then almost anyone who as in range to you didn't really have that large of an advantage.  Put a level 57 with no aas up against a level 65 with 400+ aas and what do you think will happen?  This isn't even sport...<br />
<br />
PoP zones are vital to almost all players over level 50.  Yes it is a PvP server, but PoK and PoT were deployed to the server as PvP disabled it seems a bit late in the game to make this kind of change.  If 90% of the players were completely through Time I guess it wouldn't matter so much but that's not the case.<br />
<br />
Oh well, SoE is going to do whatver the fuck they feel like just like always.  I wish they would consider either making all books also port in to PoT so that there are multiple ways in and out of the zone, or making the zone to PoT place you in a random location in the zone.  I think trade skill folks will get by fine one way or the other, they could always ad merchants to the bazar or something.  Creating the biggest choke point in the game is just a bad idea though.<br />

I'm thinking POT issue will need to be adressed.<br />
Perhaps PoT stones in various cities, like the PoK stones, only for PoT....</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Howlitoezis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I've adpated to PvP on RZ for 4 years.<br />
I've always managed to have fun.<br />
I'm a bit of a loner, and have managed to make the best of bad situations.<br />
I'm looking forward to more restricted movement, just like in the old days.<br />
I do agree that the PoT issue needs to be taken care of though.<br />
Those pesky rangers will no longer be able to zone into safe zones from me anymore though :)<br />
That makes me happy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Meriboh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I too, have played PvP for a long time; 3 years if I recall.<br />
The restricted travel may be a good idea, just like it was in the “old days”.<br />
This will put a damper on griefers camping greens.<br />
But, if (on team PvP) one team controls PoK, this will severely affect those of the other teams to a point where many will quit in utter despair. I don’t think this change is the best interest of the PvP community as a whole. Too many key zones are only accessible via PoK.<br />
<br />
But as always, SoE does not give a shit about the PvP community.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">My choice for a bindable zone that is out of the way would be Highhold Keep.  Easy faction for everybody, even Iksar.  But you probably have an even better place picked out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Flanders</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I bet its Kelethin/gfay or Kaladim nobody goes there</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Atrocity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I'm sure a lot of the old world citys that are now completely deserted will see some increased use.  I think this is one of the positive aspects to PvP enabling PoK.  When I run around Neriak now and it's completely empty I do miss the days of old when it was a busting happening city.  I've gotten so used to everyone being in PoK I completely forgot to consider the faction issues of multi race guilds.<br />
<br />
As for those pesky rangers, I think life is going to be pretty good for them.  Their damage increases by 20% and they won't get the &quot;you are too far above/below your target&quot;  Watch out for arrows raining down from the heavens....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Flanders</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">heh I wasnt serious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">The more thought I put into it, the more places I think of that could be used.  The arena by Lake Rathe would be nearly ideal, no faction involved at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Not to mention the fact that they have snare/root which will land after pvp resist changes go through. snare/root/plink/plink/dead sk.<br />
<br />
Anyways IM STRONGLY against PoK/PoT/Nexus being pvp enabled. People whine about zone dancing and how they cant kill someone who's running for a pok book in OT or whatever stupid zone your in. This is just gonna bring more griefing and blatant violation of server rules. Anyways this is my new sig for EQlive boards.<br />

The Neutral team is pretty strong and always seem to work well when Pking.<br />
The good team has had some big improvements, since when I was on it.<br />
The evil team may be strong, but it wont always be that way.<br />
It’s not necessary to split them up, in my opinion.<br />

<br />
Im honestly gonna give up on PvP servers if they decide to go ahead with the no safe zones. It encourages portal camping just like SZ rules encouraged training and look what you have on SZ? Mass trainage. So after this change what will you have on all PvP servers? Mass portal camping...<br />
<br />
Anyways though my Cleric bot and my Bst bot dont want to live on server were we cant get a c3 in the *bazaar/pok and head to an exp spot.<br />
<br />
*100% sure bazaar/nexus zoneline will be camped 24/7 making getting a c3 in bazaar and heading to planeof001 impossible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Silvershadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">From the hints, it sounds like Katta (most likely) or Seru to me. Close to port and easy to get the necessary faction.<br />

That said, if I were on a PvP server I'd cry havoc over such a change, PoK should obviously be a pvp-free zone.</div></div><hr />
