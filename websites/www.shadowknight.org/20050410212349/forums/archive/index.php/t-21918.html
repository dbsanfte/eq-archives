<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Asegai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a 21 Bard, 19 BSL, and 11 Shadowknight.  I absolutely love the spells of the SK and casting and fighting but I am torn between which to make my main.  My questions:<br />
<br />
How hard is it for SKs to get groups?  I am on Stromm btw.<br />
<br />
Does tanking get boring after 30 lvls?  I have never been a tank before.  I love soloing with my SK but I don't know what grouping will be like.  My first group was a bad experience.  I was lvl 10 and the others were 11-14.  The Shaman wouldn't heal, the bstl wouldn't fight, the warrior had less hp than me with temp and the mage kept drawing aggro.  I spammed taunt and my spells and held aggro better than I thought until the monk showed up.  The group was disorganized and pulling fiends individually without calling them.  I died and did corpse run past the bandits no help and barely any acknowledgement that I died because the shaman didn't heal.  <br />
<br />
What is our role at higher lvls?  Do we mostly serve as main tank or secondary tank(which I prefer)<br />
<br />
Btw, I am roleplaying an Erudite and have leveled him up fairly quickly thanks to kind players and my new guild.<br />
<br />
Moslty concerned about grouping because I know I can get groups with my Bard(don't like twisting but love versatility) and BSTL(Love utility but wish I could do a bit more dmg like my pet)<br />
<br />
Asegai</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>UGLA</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Dont' think its hard at all for sk's to get groups.  <br />
<br />
Tankin hasn't gotten boring to me in 65 lvl's and over 700aa's.<br />
<br />
You will always have your crappy groups if you just do pickup groups, but you'll also make some new friends that way. <br />
<br />
<br />
And your role at higher levels just depends on your situation, if your just exping, then you could always be the main tank..or if your bored you could pull..or play 2ndary tank i guess just dependin on the group you're in.<br />
<br />
Sk's are pretty versitale characters.  Some people will differ but I'm happy with my sk, it's all i've really played.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>StPatrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm also on Stromm, Asegai. At my current level 63 I never faced a problem of finding a group, if there are any group forming, people tend to prefer SKs over Warriors and Pallies. Happend to me several times when a pickup group took me instead of pally or warrior - kinda all-in-one class.. Well, not ALL, but very good combination - can single pull, can keep aggro and can tank. High level group buffs that people just love (specially resists buff, was asked many times to cast it when we face casting MObs)<br />
<br />
As for boring... uhmmm.. NO and once again NO  :p The higher you get, the more challanging tanking will be, thus making it more fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kenshi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i've never had a problem grouping when i want to. either i make the group up (about 99% of the time) or i get the random tell when i log on asking to group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Axxon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You will find stupid people at every level.  I was recently asked (mid-50's) if I could hold aggro as well as a warrior.  Idiot.  I have never had a problem getting a group.<br />

<br />
Yup.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aoninie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">SK or bard, that will all depend on you. I have always played an SK and have never had problems getting a group. Bards never have problems getting a group either and are very versitile. Play them both until you find what YOU like better. The more you like your class the better you will be at playing it. Have fun, it get's better with levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Big beef getting groups as an SK: Most people have no idea what an sk can do.  Had a group that insisted Rangers were better pullers than SK's.  They wiped.  I fd'ed after cleric went down...fear kited a couple mobs around the dungeon (not the brightest idea I ever had BTW) until they got back, pulled after that and we won.  They kept wondering where my body was.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Most people have no idea what an sk can do.<br />
<br />
unfortunately that also includes a lot of SKs. really, player skill is a big factor... a lot of classes can do amazing stuff (SK especially) but knowledge and player skill changes how they do... like the clerics who ALWAYS cast a CH when you hit 50%, regardless of how many mobs are beating on you, how much HP you have, whether the mobs are slowed or not, how hard they hit, etc.<br />
<br />
this game isn't hard, but a lot of people manage to fuck up simple things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">unfortunately that also includes a lot of SKs. really, player skill is a big factor... a lot of classes can do amazing stuff (SK especially) but knowledge and player skill changes how they do... <br />
<br />
Too true.  I actually started Keevel because on my shaman I could never seem to keep the guild SK around my level, alive when we duoed.  I wanted to understand the class better and see what I was doing wrong.  After reading these boards for a couple months, I made Keevel and once he got to around 35 or so I just realized that the SK I hunted with was a moron.  Unfortunatley I also found I prefer duoing Keevel with a chanter than a shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Asegai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thanks for the responses.  I REALLY want to role play an erudite and have enjoyed my SK so far.  I just have to bank everything because I am so weak.  Should I go to Kurn's tower to lvl at 11?  What good Str items are there?<br />
<br />
I cast a lot during fights now.  Will that continue as I lvl?  I am assuming I will use my mana pool to keep aggro as well as harm the mobs since I am not as strong. I have some basic armor (Shadow/phantom armor I think) but I need a better weapon.  I'm thinking I need to stay with 1 handers until I get better armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The biggest problem I have getting groups is in GoD groups where the only time I get one is if I can start it myself or no warriors are online or they are not avaiable.<br />
<br />
Soon as a warrior logs on they get grabbed up in seconds in my guild and I get tired of begging for groups so what I do is look for a cleric and chanter and build my own with the other classes that get left out.<br />
<br />
I cant even beg anyone to try Ikkinz with me though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>BullMarkOne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I never seem to have problems getting pickup LDoN groups with my SK.. 'course he's only lvl 30.. and I'm still learning the ins and outs of the class.. and lets face it I'm a loser, so unless you suck even more than me (not likely since I'm nearly a total vacuum) you shouldn't have any problems getting groups as an sk...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Oagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Play the toon you enjoy the most, and learn the class.  That said, plan on some frustration, because as stated, people don't know what we can do, and the warrior upgrade really helped their viability as exp group tanks, where we used to shine.<br />
<br />
Once a cleric, chanter, shaman has learned what a good sk can do for them, they will often pick you.  However, it only takes a bad sk to sour it as well.  A lot of it comes down to skill.<br />
<br />
You're young enough with all your characters to try them all out without a lot of penalty.  You can re-roll, and be where you're at in a couple of days.<br />
<br />
A bard with a good rep will always find groups at the later levels.  They are also better solo'ers than us.<br />
<br />
I did a LDoN hard with my shaman last night, and we had a warrior tanking.  While he was okay, it's obvious they still don't have the snap aggro capabilities that SK's do.  I was getting hit on the slow, which never happens when my SK tanks.  I just didn't feel like two-boxin last night.<br />
<br />
If you're looking for a class that will nearly always be able to find a group, cleric, chanter, or bard would be the way to go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Asegai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Had a fun night last night. I got two groups and did ok.  I was lvl 10.5(not 11 yet) with a plate helm ac 10, ring mail sleeves, a cloth shirt, ring mail wrists, no leg armor, and sandals.  I have a 4/24 slasher and 3/23 piercer, and cracked staff.<br />
<br />
<br />
Group 1 - I got picked up when the group saw me soloing with temp.  I held my own even though I was lowest lvl in group ranging from 10-14 with paladin, necro, bl, and cleric.  I assisted the cleric or paladin who were both tankiing and pulling.  I noticed that near the end of fights after casting my dot the mobs would turn to me.  THe group wiped on a bad pull because we got overconfident and pulled 6 blue-to red to me.  I assisted the paladin trying to help him kill the first and cast dot on another to get them on me.  THe paladin then ran and I followed him trying to get the mobs attention to no avail.  He zoned and mobs turned and killed the necro.  I probably should have cast dot on all the mobs to get their aggro and then assist the paladin.<br />
<br />
The group dwindled to the BL and me without temp now.  I was surprised at how well I held up with crap for armor against yellows as the tank. (THe higher lvl BL was tanking, but he was getting beat up so I pulled and tanked yellows and whites) We did fine until he had to go. I had almost made it to 11.<br />
<br />
Group 2 - Duo with a lvl 9 Warrior in the Warrens.  Went there to farm plat and get some teeth.  I was puller in group but this guy kept taking aggro from me.  I had to cast like crazy to keep them on me.  He had full newbie armor and a steel alloy longsword.  Is that good?  He was hitting for 20 a pop!<br />
I died when I pulled a blue and a white and then got aggro from wandering kobolds.  We killed four in a row but I was so low on hp that everything aggroed me before I could run out.  Lesson: GET BETTER GEAR!!!!<br />
<br />
I'm not uber but last night was very fun and I really enjoyed playing this guy.<br />
<br />
Questions: I am planning to go back and farm the Warrens for plat and teeth or go to Blackburrow for exp and gold.  I want to get money for better weapons and armor.  I don't plan to do the newbie quest becuase in 11 lvls I have found only 1 calcified bone.  I have almost all the pelts and ore but not the other.  Is this stategy ok or a mistake?  I also think its better to lvl instead of running around killing stuff that is green in hopes of getting a drop.<br />
<br />
My lack of Str is annoying!  Even with my miserable armor setup, I am encumbered.  What Str items should I be onl the lookout for?  I need one with +5 Str or several cheap ones with +1 or +2.  I need at least 10 more str just to wear armor and carry loot without penalty.<br />
<br />
What is the next quest I should do?  Should I do the unholy steed quest in Befallen?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>BullMarkOne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I gather from the comment about bone chips that you're a Dork Elf. Not getting newbie armor might be a mistake in the short run, but our newbie armor can be a royal pain. I only had about 3 pieces before I'd bought better off of bazaar for the rest of my slots. Only spots to get the calcified parts, se corner of zone has a small skellie camp, and west side of zone south of zone-in for lavastorm has quite a few more of the skellies ya want, but alot of higherish lvl wanderers too.. [EDIT] oh yeah, IIRC I was still getting some xp from the right type of skels at lvl 10, don't quote me on that tho.<br />
<br />
For pretty good plat farming and maybe a very little xp, head to butcherblock mountains via plane of knowledge.. farm the green goblins for heads and blood, they sell for 4pp each, and you ought to have no prob soloing them at lvl 11ish all ought to be green or lb unless wiz or shaman.. great $$ for a casual player<br />
<br />
if you need an in game map of BBM (or anywhere else for that matter)head over to www.mapfiend.net (http://www.mapfiend.net) and grab it, or better yet get the whole collection. quality varies though so dont expect much out of some of them<br />
<br />
Hey... I posted something usefull!!! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Asegai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">No, I'm an Erudite ShadowKnight, the bestest looking in plate:)  However, I will look at those spots for the calcified bones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>kassdax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Here's a couple of suggestions for plat farming.<br />
<br />
1. Kurns Tower - kill the stuff and collect bone chips. On Saryrn, bone chips sell for 20pp a stack if you sell them in bulk (get 4+ stacks before putting them up in the bazaar). Stay here until level 20 or so.<br />
<br />
2. Level 20-25 - head to East Karana and kill spiders. These things drop silk, lots and lots of silk. Mainly go after the red and black spiders, they drop the most silk. On Saryrn server, the silk sells for 200pp a stack. Once you get several stacks, head to the bazaar and put them on your trader overnight.<br />
<br />
These two things outfitted me very well for my level. Prices on your sever will probably vary but one thing in common with pretty much all servers is people want trade skill stuff.<br />
<br />
G' luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Ghismonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Soon as a warrior logs on they get grabbed up in seconds in my guild and I get tired of begging for groups so what I do is look for a cleric and chanter and build my own with the other classes that get left out.<br />
<br />
I have my own cleric for this very reason.  I grab any slower and take anyone that is lfg.  The xp is so good in Kod Taz you really don't need an &quot;ideal group&quot; to keep everyone's xp bars healthy and happy.  One of my best groups had two clerics and two shaman in it.  Whenever a spot opens, I *always* offer it to the knights in my guild before I offer it to the guild at large.<br />
<br />
On a bit of a derailing rant, there was once an SK spamming &quot;forming GOD group&quot; in Knowledge and Tranquility for several minutes.  I often times leverage having a well-geared cleric on my second account into getting a spot for my shadowknight as well.  I sent a tell to this shadowknight asking who he had in the group already, fishing for whether he had a cleric and whether he had room for two.  He responded, out of the box with something very rude like, &quot;GOD has made shadowknights sucks so badly, there's no way I would group with two.&quot;  I mean damn.  I've never been denied a group based on being an SK (yeah, people don't normally look for an SK when they want DPS and always ask the warrior to tank first) and here someone who you would think would UNDERSTAND how hard it can be to get a group is denying me based on my class when I hadn't even informed him that I have a cleric too?<br />
<br />
I found a little bit of pleasure in the fact that hours later he was still in Plane of Knowledge and I had grabbed an enchanter and formed my own group, which included TWO PALADINS AND A SHADOWKNIGHT and ended up getting 12 AA that day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Vixeena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Only way i've ever gotten an EP group or a God group is to make them myself, or if its at non peak times and the group is just dying for a 6th member or they cant find a war.   Somtimes then, the random group that some  friend of mine might happen to be making, and they invite me basicly becasue they like talking to me and/or just want a friendly face in the group.<br />
<br />
Sks generally are only are asked to pull when no competent ranger or monk is around (rare occurance) and would pretty much never be invited specificlly for this reason.   Only asked to tank when no war is avail, and , one almost always seems to be (durring peak times)   On stormhammer the server population is so low that at non peak times, groups will take what they can get, even if that means, god forbid... an SK.<br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe at some time in the past SK agro was something that was sought after, but wars seem to be able to keep agro just fine nowadays.  So kiss that &quot;role&quot; goodbye as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">How the might SK's aggro has fallen, we're the lowest aggro of the 3 tanks, granted this problem is amplified by subtlety but with a 1h weapon I can't keep aggro off our better rogues and keeping aggro high enough for the mob to not go charge my healer is a very serious threat...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>shadowfox98</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">A fellow Eruidite SK...we are few and far between, don't worry much about STR it will come to you.  I hope you asked someone before you made your erudite sk.  At lvl 65 I have all my stats except STA maxed if I had put my starting points into sta instead of Str and Int I would be much happier.  I am not even close to EPs yet.  Str is such an easy stat to raise, probably second only to Int.<br />
<br />
So don't despair, the going is tough but you will enjoy it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Asegai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">No, I put my stats in Sta and dex I think.  made lvl 12 last night and bought some chest armor, 17 ac :) Now I just need some good legs and foot gear.  My next project is to get a better weapon.  My weapon now is slash 4/24 and pierce 3/23.  Has anyone doen the mount quest in Befallen?  I want to do that if I can and save for a good weapon.  Right now I will hail a mage when I log in to get some summoned weapons and pet gear.  I plan to lvl in Kurns or Befallen because the loot is so bad in Paludal.  Any suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>BullMarkOne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">For my 2 cp I'd suggest you head for Kurns, no silly keys to mess around with. Also imho safer to solo in since 2 exits means yer only 50% likely to get mowed down by a train. 'Course on Nameless server Befallen is so desolate that the possibility of a train there is pretty laughable. Still its worth the occasional trip to Befallen for the free horse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Aoninie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">If I recall that horse only lasts until you log out. Befallen can be a fun place but you'll have to bring your own group. It can be pretty dangerous. Very easy to get adds there. And if you get stuck behind a locked door and are fumbling for the key you are screwed. Also if you bring one of the big races with you make sure they have a way to shrink or you'll get stuck behind them in a tight hall. Befallen was the first place my wife and I went into together and cleared by ourselves. I think we were lvl 30 (she's a Mage) and bored and just had a blast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Bloodbrood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Can't say I have any trouble finding groups (since I'm in a huge guild) but whenver finding a group is going slow I just create my own group.<br />
<br />
btw I just had to comment on something about bad groups:<br />
<br />
A couple of days ago in PoJ I was grouped with the absolute worst pally.  We had a group of a ranger (puller) me, pally, necro and druid.  The pally was the MT since he was a couple levels higher than me (he was 53 I was 50 at the time plus he had more ac/hp) and whenever the ranger would go pull the pally would come along and pull his own mob too.  I'm like wtf are you doing?  He did this a couple more times and the entire group almost got wiped out.  Everyone was asking why he was pulling his own mob.  He claimed that he couldn't hold aggro unless he was puller.  From that point I knew he must of bought his account off ebay or something because a 53 pally should know how to keep aggro.  I didn't even cast a dot or taunt at all and I still took aggro from him even though I had buffed him with Voice of Shadows.  I had to explain to him to use the Taunt button and use stuns to get aggro.  Needless to say that group didn't last long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Asegai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Level 18 now but getting frustrated with Paludal and pick up groups there.  I left Kurns at lvl 16 to try Paludal and get some better drops and pp.  My first group, I was the lowest lvl tank and I got killed because the group had no crowd control and pulled 4 bandits.  Everyone died.  Next 2 times on with SK I could not get a group in Paludal.  I log on yesterday and get a group.  I was the lowest lvl again at 17 now.  Bard, who is red to me, pulls 3 without lull and the ranger is afk.  Bard calls for help. I was waiting to see which ones he would mezz, but I jump in against a red and I cast Dot on the yellow.  I get the aggro from two and die.  (HT was not up) Bard runs to zone and has the nerve to ask if I made it after telling me he had a temp buff!<br />
<br />
I told him if I knew he had temp I would have feared mobs.  He apologizes and ranger apologizes as well.  Back in and add a couple more members.  The bard Never lull pulls.  He Never mezzes adds and Never plays any song besides health and Dot.  No haste.  No mana.  Two people leave the group(They were the smart ones)  I am almost to 18 so I stay.  Bard pulls 4 and we get an add.  I wait to see who he will mezz.  3 are beating on him and 2 on the monk.  I'm going to die again I think.  So I fear one, Dot and assist the monk.  HT the next mob we face.  It goes down fast.   We assist the bard and kill 4 when the feared one comes back.  I am at about 30 health but we take him down.  I felt very proud!  I dinged 18 then left.<br />
<br />
I hope this is not what the rest of grouping is like as a SK.  If so I might stick to my bard.  Every time I have died it has been because of lack of crowd control.  I really miss that in my SK.  However, I did not have these problems in Kurn's tower.  Not just because it was a different place but the groups seemed to be better.  <br />
<br />
I am gonna try again but not in Paludal.  I'm gonna go back to Kurn's or somewhere else to level where people are smarter or leave groups sooner.  Btw.  I did a Ldon with my 24 Bard last night and the SK was tank with another bard lulling.  It was a breeze.  Two bards who knew how to mezz and lull playing haste, ddd, mana, resists, and heal and a SK holding aggro and pulling when safe.   Sk looked great in his role and inspired me to keep the faith in my SK.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Gordrach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Congratulations on the levels you've been gaining.  I think the general concensus is that when it comes to random groups, you're going to get good ones and you're going to get bad ones.  You mentioned your dislike for dying due to a lack of crowd-control, and I'd like to tell you fear not.  At level 30 Shadow Knights get a handy little spell called Feign Death.  Since I tend to have to go with random groups quite a bit, I always have FD loaded.  It is not uncommon for me to be the last one standing in an LDoN group after bad pulls.  Typically the cleric is dead with the others also dead and/or running for the zone.  Once the situation has come to this point, I pull off a Feign Death and start sending tells to the group to start the corpse recovery process.  8 out of 10 brutally bad pulls have seen my Troll's butt saved by FD.  There is hope. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Tornicade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I suggest you keep playing the bard and the sk  its  really helping your understanding of the importance of crowd control. Which usually makes or breaks a group</div></div><hr />
