With my current gear it's sitting around 165 unbuffed and I'm wonder if it's worth it to consider gear in the future with Int in mind at all?  I suppose it's possible to get it up over 200 eventually, but it there a point of diminishing returns?<br />
<br />
And if someone's bored and wants to have a peek at my magelo for suggestions, by all means, have at it.<br />
<br />
Purist on a PvP Teams server, so I am rather limited in to less than current high-end gear.<br />

But the best thing to shoot for is mana regen rather than simply more Int. An Earring of Solstice would be a good start.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Concentrate on HP and STA, as DE usually lack there.<br />
(most +HP also have +MANA on them, so its win-win)<br />
<br />
-Not having the mana when you need it sucks.<br />
-Not having HP and a bar full of mana also sucks.<br />
<br />
SK need BOTH to be truly effective.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jice Virago</div><div class="date">12-04-2002, 05:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I play more of a spell oriented style as an SK.  There is clearly a drop off at 200, but its not as severe as it once was.  Target mana pool, IMO, should be 3k mana.  Thats good for most fights where you are chaining spells to last you an entire fight.  With KEI I can go over an hour in an XP group using most of my arsenal before I run my mana down enough to warrent a med break.  Soloing, I can do 4 to 5 mobs on a full bar of mana when fear kiting, 2 toe to toeing it.  I have 197ish unbuffed with 600ish in +mana gear.  That is not too difficult to hit as a Dark Elf SK these days, especially with cultural armors out there (the bracers and pauldrons in particular are excellent buys) and the Kael plate cycle.  <br />
<br />
A large mana pool is basically good for two things:  Boss mob fights where you want to maximize damage/lifetaps and having a reserve for when the shit hits the fan.  With plentiful mana, you can offtank a slowed add with little to no healing assistance, which is really helpful in certain situations (and takes pressure of the healers).  Being at 3k mana seems to be that comfortable level, imo.  Enough to do a nice long sustained chain tapping, but not so much that you will never call on that mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Okami</div><div class="date">12-04-2002, 05:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">when they removed the int/wis/mana cap for casters, didn't that effect us too?<br />
The way I understood it, they saw a set increase in mana up to 200 int, then anything above that gave much less per int. Then they changed it so anything above 200 int scaled the same way.<br />
I would have figured we were caught in that too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bunk</div><div class="date">12-04-2002, 06:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Regardless on  how you play, there will be a point at which mana regen means way more  than your total mana pool.  I am at the point at which in my favorite solo spot I can kill a blue con mob using 10% mana.  The issue here is mana regen, I can pull nonstop until the mobs run out if I have c2 or better.  With out c2 I have to stop and med.  At some point you will  hit the &quot;corner&quot; at which having flowing thought items, mana regen AA or clarity to replace mana burn is more important than the total mana pool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mordeth</div><div class="date">12-04-2002, 08:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">At level 60 every point of int below 200 gets you 12 mana.<br />
<br />
ever point of int above 200 gets you 6 mana.<br />
<br />
It used to be that every point above 200 would get you 1 mana...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mystina</div><div class="date">12-04-2002, 09:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I burn alot of mana on bosses and when soloing, 3600 mana pool listed on magelo and often find it too low.<br />
Yesterday i died from AE DoT while fighting Aerin, If I had 1k more mana to tap I would have lived till the end and dealt more damage.<br />
<br />
So imo for a lvl 65 ideal mana pool should be around 4500 mana.<br />
About int, well i dont know exact numbers but I would not try to have more than 255 buffed, best way to raise mana = items with 100hp/100mana or more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xilr</div><div class="date">12-04-2002, 09:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Every point over 200 is 6 mana?  That would be pretty cool, but how about points over 255?  Hopefully its still 6 mana per, I wonder if anyone can confirm that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kainzzothewindmaker</div><div class="date">12-04-2002, 10:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A large mana pool is also nice for DOT/pet kiting which is about the only way you can solo past lvl 61 :p <br />
<br />
Soloed a lvl 63 Razorfiend in POV when I was 63 without much problem. Just need KEI  and alot of time!! !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaotix</div><div class="date">12-04-2002, 10:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">At lvl 60 I have like 87 int and according to magelo around 1200 mana :/<br />
<br />
But like someone else pointed out - mana regen &gt; mana pool.<br />
I'm a crack addict and always have c3 for soloing in PoJ and PoD or where ever.  I rarely have down time for medding; usually only if some idiot has trained me.<br />
<br />
It looks like its a different story for soloing past 60, so maybe some int gear is in my future.  But for now Im farming aa points and getting by just fine with low int and mana pool. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PredatorySZ</div><div class="date">12-04-2002, 12:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">After 255 int, you get about 3 mana per int.<br />
<br />
Definately not worth it to raise above that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nocifer Deathblade</div><div class="date">12-04-2002, 01:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye, only good use for beyond 255 int is to switch to INT gear for trade skill as skill up. Not worth it for combat. Basically, target is 230 int then you are good to go cuz you would get KEI almost full time that hits 255 int. <br />
<br />
Yeah, mana regeneration &gt;&gt;&gt; mana pool. That's why Flowing Thought/Mental Clarity is very sought for. <br />
<br />
Mana pool still is very useful in certain situations such as POJ trials, etc that you need FULL time bursts of DD/tap sustained blasts without stop.</div></div><hr />
