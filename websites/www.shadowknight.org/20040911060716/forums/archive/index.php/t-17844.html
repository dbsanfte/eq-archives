<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>fudisbus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Thinking of camping on 1st island in plane of sky and keep killing A Thunder Spirit Princess until it drops.  Just camp off on the island and try for a week or two.<br />
<br />
Any guess if a even gear lvl 55 SK, epic and good gear lvl 55 Shaman, and a lvl 50 druid could do this with no problems? or if not enough dsp, add a near lvl 60 rog with that?<br />
<br />
Only info I could gather was was mob is lvl 53, hits for mid 200s.  Unlikely to land any spells on mob if under 55.  Also knowing spawn time would be nice.  Heard 12 hours but also 4.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Auronan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">One team is best for this, and you'll want either 1 cleric or two non-cleric healers for when you take on the Princess. With the personnel you mentioned, you will have no trouble clearing the Thunder Spirits. Just remember to do a few things:<br />
<br />
1) Clear the Thunder Spirits first. If you attack the Princess with the Spirits still up, all of them will come over to assist.<br />
<br />
2) No AoE type spells. The Djinn that live on the lower level of the 1st isle will agro if you use AoE spells and when they all come out together, its gonna be lights out for you and your team.<br />
<br />
3) Snare the Thunder Spirits and Princess as you battle them since they are all runners and the last thing you want to do is have them run over to anything else and get adds. Let the SK do that since the mobs disease resistances are fairly low.<br />
<br />
4) Do not attack the Dwarf Merchant there as you engage the Princess as he is bad news. And likewise do not attack or even speak with Sirran the Lunatic once he spawns upon the Princess' demise.<br />
<br />
5) Your best bet is to go to each Thunder Spirit and fight them where they float as to avoid the chance they run and bring adds if you pull them to a different location.<br />
<br />
The Thunder Princess will have the Blade of Abrogation visible in her hand if she has it. So you will know going in if you are going to be SoL or not. And last time I was there, the spawn time for the Princess and her underlings was 8 hours.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kowl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My guild raided the POS last night and the first thing I noticed was that the Princess was not holding a sword. :( <br />
<br />
We got to the fourth island and all camped, we are going to continue on tonight. The purpose of the raid is to get the piece for the Ranger epic from the Essence Tamer.  From what I read there is a chance the Blade of Abrogatoin can drop off him to. I am hoping that I will get lucky tonight and get it while we are there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Auronan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Any boss mob on any of the islands can potentially drop the Blade of Abrogation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kowl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well I got it. The sword dropped off about the 4th or 5th Essence Tamer we killed. Also got a Belt of Iniquity but my Silvery Belt of Contention is better so it will probably just sit in my bank.<br />
<br />
I need the Decrepit hide, the Soul-Leech, the Drake spine and to kill Gholnor and Lhranc and there will be one more SK epic out there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>halcyonforever</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I just got my blade late last night.  I had established a routine of visiting Sky everytime the server reset or 8 hours after she took a dirt nap.  Well within 6 cloudy stones of Veeshan I had it.  Just to let you know when we took it on we had a 65 wizard (main tank - no joke she wanted to solo it) a 52 cleric botted incase someone died, 53 SK, 65 mage, 65 shaman, and 65 necro.  Just some of the late night members of my guild who thought this would be fun.  The wizard seriously solo'd the princess without ever dropping below 80% health (only had to heal her 2x and even then wasn't really necessary) the other spirits never joined in.  <br />
<br />
Great things can be accomplished with a will and a bored wizard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Saruton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The fairies on the first island all do not run.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zurdaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I dont know if this has to do with your level, but a group of 65's went up there not to long ago with me, and we just tore the princess's wings off where she floats, nothing came to add, she did not have the blade, unfortunately, but the fact remains NOT ONE fairy added on.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps someone~<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>waspz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Just so you know..the Blade has a chance to drop off anything.That means from isle one to isle 8..Ive personally have had them drop off every isle..Sunday 1 dropped from a drake on 7th isle..it was funny seeing the sword stick out of his head lol..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Barzec</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have a guildy that has this in the bank.  I have not seen any place that has said yes or no to the BoA being MQable.<br />
<br />
Can anyone let me know.  I'd think that it could be since it is a turn-in...<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Drakang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Have only seen it drop from the princess and the horses.  The horses dropped 3 the first time I went and 2 the second time.  I am sure it can drop other places but they seem to have the highest probability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ainya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">the blade is MQ'able ... do a search</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jinsei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Got mine off the Princess</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Vigormortis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">we went to sky last night just for kicks, plus a couple rangers needed the SSoC. tore through to the 7th island before people got tired and raid started falling apart. But holy shit. not 1, not 2, but 5 Blades of abrogation dropped. lol. I passed on the first one even though its the last piece I need for the Corrupted Ghoulbane. I just have no interest in completing my epic.  But ended up looting one just for the hell of it. I'm one of 2 sk's in my guild so we destroyed the other 3. I've been to sky tons of times and never seen one. But 5 to drop... I tell ya I could have shat a golden brick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Mordraeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I killed her with myself at 59, level 60 cleric, and level 65 wizard. We didn't have any mana regen, so were OOM by the end of it. Take it as you will.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Yrgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Killed her with just me and 65 Wizzy... Ported up... self buffed and smacked her down... nothing on the island added.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ravenar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Duoed her with 62 Cleric and 61 Knight in the center w/o killing other faeries.  Easy battle but slightly long.  Even with all HT AA the 6000 crit Ht barely dented.  Luckily I had every major Dot loaded so she fell quickly.</div></div><hr />
