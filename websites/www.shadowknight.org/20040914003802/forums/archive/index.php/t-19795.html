<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>BlackDrake</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just a quick point and one that I am sure has been mentioned before but in terms of trade skills which stat do we need to raise. Casters need INT/WIS and melee need STR.  As WE are classed as hybrids, do we need all three??<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you are asking what stats are most important in general. <br />
I say STA &gt; INT &gt; STR &gt; DEX &gt; AGI<br />
<br />
STA = Hit points<br />
INT = Mana<br />
STR = Attack Rating (How much you hit for)<br />
DEX = Increase weapon proc<br />
AGI = minor increase in AC (Armor Class)<br />
<br />
STA returns less HP after reaching 255, you start out with a decent amount being a Troll.<br />
INT will need to be raised because you are a Troll.<br />
STR you are probably ok with being a Troll.<br />
DEX raising it is nice, but not a &quot;need&quot;<br />
AGI just make sure it's over 75, like DEX it's nice to raise, but not a &quot;need&quot;<br />
<br />
Raising trade skills faster you will probably want to get INT items. This being trade skills as in &quot;making items&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Tradeskill stats are as follows:<br />
<br />
Baking, Brewing, Tailoring, Jewelcrafting, Alchemy, Fishing, Pottery, Tinkering, Poison Making, Fletching  ---  Use higher of either Intelligence or Wisdom for skillups.<br />
<br />
Blacksmithing -- Uses higher of either Intelligence, Wisdom or Strength for skillups.<br />
<br />
For Weapons Skills, Swimming, other combat or &quot;general physical&quot; oriented skills, Dex determines the number of skillups.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Actually that's not entirely accurate.<br />
<br />
Tradeskills use the higher of Int or Wis.<br />
<br />
For Blacksmithing, there is an additional bonus for high str.<br />
<br />
For Tailoring, there is an additional bonus for high dex.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I agree with Bolas that all trade skills use the higher of int/wis.<br />
<br />
I always seem to get more sucesses (not skill ups) if all my physical stats (str, sta, agi,dex) were buffed.  My friends also have said the same thing, but I've never seen proof that this is true.  Still, I'm superstitious enough to get buffed by a pal each time.<br />
<br />
Brewing is cheaper and has less recipies you really need to do (see the trade skill thread in the archives for a good skull ale recipe), but I've noticed that has as slow skill ups as my 158 tailoring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Oagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My wizard has his 8th prayer shawl.  Other than smithing, the higher of INT or WIS.  Since SK's are INT-based, we will generally have higher INT.  Not to say that SK's can't be tradeskillers, but trolls/ogres tend to have much lower INT, so skill-ups are going to go slower.  You're probably going to want to have some +INT gear to use while you're tradeskilling.  There is a lot of player made jewelry pieces that can increase INT.<br />
<br />
Dex does seem to help.  Geerloks are also a good idea, and can be purchased rather cheaply.  I believe it was shown that dex helps successses in Fletching, and can see why it would also possibly impact tailoring.  <br />
<br />
If you're not doing the prayer shawl or the PoP earring, I'd say it may be better to make a tradeskilling caster (erudite=highest INT) to master the tradeskills.  If you're doing pottery, it will also help to have an enchanter, since they are able to enchant clay at a reasonably low level.<br />
<br />
Don't kid yourself, however.  GM tradeskilling in any skill is a time-consuming/expensive proposition.  Brewing and Baking are probably the cheapest to GM.  You can only have one skill past 200, until you use the PoP aa's, or are a Gnome and Tinker.  A forager is also helpful in Baking.<br />
<br />
At your level, Black Drake, Brilliance is the spell that will raise your INT.  KEI/VoQ is the one to use 45/46+.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ravenar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Looking for tradeskilling int?<br />
<br />
Here are a few items that are easy to get that I have found max out some int:<br />
<br />
<br />
Will of Innoruuk (BP from our epic quest)<br />
Head of the Valiant (earring from our epic)<br />
Stein of Mogguk<br />
Mace of Shadowed Soul<br />
Noct sword<br />
Beginner's planar manual (for range if your bow range has low int)<br />
GEBs borrowed off one of your alts (because no one plays an SK as anything but a main right?) could help also.  <br />
<br />
Being a Teir'Dal I have more options to DEF only smithed items, so my int is 265 when I decide to skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rhumba_Kween</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Regarding skillups from Int vs Str.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ah, that would explain why Smithing went up really quick, but my brewing (which is supposed to be easier) is going up slowly.<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually, you also have to factor in that some tradeskills are set to go up slower. Brewing being one of them. In other words, you could have INT as your main stat for both Brewing and Smithing, but Brewing simply takes more attempts, given all other factors being equal, to get skill ups.<br />
<br />
Of course,  brewing is super cheap to raise, so this is part of the reason for this. Cheap to raise, but takes a few more clicks (actually lots more).</div></div><hr />
