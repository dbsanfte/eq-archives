<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zadien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello, I've been searching everywhere to see if this is true or not. I was told that if any of your starting stats are NOT at least 75, then you take a penalty in that stat. I made an ERU SK and dumped all my points into STA. My base DEX/AGI is only 70. I notice at lvl 50, I miss a TON. Has anyone else heard of this, or is it just a myth, or something they have fixed? If it is true, will putting AA points into base DEX/AGI fix the penalty?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I know its true for agility u take a ac penalty if your under 75.  I don't know about Dex though but low dex means you proc less and also learn weapon skills slower so I think I would get those up</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thakalas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It doesn't matter what your base stats are really, since any buffs/gear that brings it up behaves identically to having the base be that.  The that's easiest to see is the penalty to AC for having under 75 agility.  Assuming your gear brings agility up above 75, it's all good.<br />
<br />
Dex and agility have nothing to do with hit/miss.  Depending on what you're attacking (ie red con/blue con/green con) you'll miss about half the time.</div></div><hr />
