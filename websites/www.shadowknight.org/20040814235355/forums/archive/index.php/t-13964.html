<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dkhar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm a dirty piece of shit for not reading every quest post sorry. Question. I want to start my Greenmist quest. It says I need some newbie thingy to give to some guy to start it. I don't have any newbie khukri. I don't know what guildmaster to talk to to start the khukri quests. Is the Khukri quest really neccassary to start the greenmist quest at all ? Can I just kill in Old Sebelis and get faction that way ? Then do some knife turn ins and bone chips ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Saruton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Greenmist-Forum (http://forums.shadowknight.org/forumdisplay.php?s=&amp;forumid=17), a whole forum just dedicated to the lenghty quest called Greenmist. Just look there first and come back if you still have a question that isnt covered there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dkhar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just wanted to know if this khukri had anything to do with greenmist really. It's not really covered weather or not it's best to do this quest or go and do faction work for Cabalis instead. Or even if a human can start it without the newbie khukri.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Saruton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Its called Greenmist, the unholy khukri or rile, thats what you can read when you open up just the first sticky post in that section. Should give you a hint allready. Then, if you open up that post and read the walkthrough for this quest you will eventually find the following paragraph:<br />
<br />
Go to the Dalnir Forge and combine:<br />
<br />
Lord of Pain Khukri<br />
Greenist Metal Shard<br />
Greesmist Khukri Blade<br />
Librarian Zimor's Tome<br />
Hammer of 1406<br />
<br />
You receive Greenmist, Unholy Khukri of Rile<br />
<br />
<br />
See, you need the Lord of Pain Khukri. Now you use http://forums.shadowknight.org/images/top_search.gif and search for &quot;Lord of pain khukri&quot; and right on the first page you will find Krushum's Guide (http://forums.shadowknight.org/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=5541&amp;highlight=lord+of+pain+khukri) for the complete Khukri Walktrough.<br />
<br />
Which proves your statement, wether this topic is covered there or not, as wrong.</div></div><hr />

But damn, this is gonna be a loooong quest. I'm not even sure if I want to do it now since I got a new weapon.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jabbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you're going to do this, do it FAST FAST FAST.  The Droga aspect of the Khukri quest is going to change BIG TIME with the revamp of the zone.<br />
<br />
Since I don't have (and haven't bothered looking it up) what the specific changes are going to be level wise, I can't tell you exactly.  However, if the zone as a rule is going up to a CT-esque revamp, that Key camp to finish that part of the Khukri quest is going to be next to impossible without a group with a shitload of time to kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Duecey Dooce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm sure with the Droga revamp they will place all the quest item holding mobs outside of Droga as they did when they redid CT.  With SoE who knows though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jabbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">We can hope, but are they going to put the entire cell outside, along with the pottery wheel lookin' thing?  Or change the whole encounter?<br />
<br />
If it was something as straight forward as getting a drop and turning it in elsewhere, I'd agree they'd move the mob.  With something like this which is a bit more involved, I personally think they're just going to 'break' the quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Pheargore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">ROFL. Nice update to your Sig, Duece.<br />
<br />
