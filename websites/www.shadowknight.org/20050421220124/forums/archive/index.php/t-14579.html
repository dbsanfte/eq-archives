Well, Lucy claims the effect itself hasn't been changed since last year.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Karrotine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ok 3 months ago when I finally got my Greenmist it after weeks of dedicated work to claim it, Greenmist was Lifetapping now the Greenmist effect is draining my Hitpoints instead of doing Lifetap I also found out that Soulbond effect also is dealing damage instead of lifetapping this is really fraustrating since I dont have any other weapon to replace these two I use I have to Siphon health alot more which means more medding I hope its just broken and everything would go back to normal soon.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>joofntool</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">YES ITS BUGGED</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wyrdlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Definitely bugged.  Works fine during the fight, but after death it takes HP.  First tip off is  that you can't click it off, unlike positive effects.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jabbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Also confirming, it's a lifetap dot against you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah it is. What a bitch,  /bug if you havent already.  there is a patch coming soon so hopefully this is fixed then.  Greenmist isnt as bad but our fuckin Epics are bugged to and that worries me.  Just sit and wait and do all you can to report it cause it is a major pain in the ass.  Especially if it is all you have to use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dharkenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">since last patch my GM is working just fine</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Meulard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well mine is still DOTting me after the fight. Are others working correctly?</div></div><hr />

<br />
GM is not only tapping you after the fight is over, but during ht efight as well.... go beat up greens for a while, you'll notice that even when they aren't hitting you, your HP are going down by about 15 hp a tick.... granted the mob's HP is going down by 30 a tick...and the other effects seem to work just fine, but it definitely seems to be tapping both the mob and myself.... since IC is apparently doing this as well, has anyone played with the SK lifetap DOT's at all to see if they are suffering from the same problem?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sepcieulus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Got my Greenmist last night. WOOT!!!<br />
<br />
They haven't fixed the proc yet.<br />
<br />
I went out and whacked on some mobs just to check the proc (lol was much to excited to do anything serious last night)<br />
<br />
With no regen Items or spells on ... after the mob was dead and effect was still on ... I watched my life head south. :(<br />
<br />
So ... not fixed yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Crazycajun Crawfishin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">got a new twist for ya... Greenmist was suppose to be fix after this last patch... <br />
<br />
No good.. now it wont give the AC/Str buff anymore.. but the tap looks to be workin... though i doubt that to since i  dont see a icon up for it....<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sepcieulus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Well after patch ... <br />
<br />
It dots mob for 30 per tick.<br />
<br />
It no longer dots me (which I consider a plus)<br />
<br />
No str/ac boost (it may debuff the mob ... no way to tell really).<br />
<br />
No noticeable regen/lifetap at all(as soon as Greenmist would proc ... I'd back out of combat with mob rooted and just watch my HP).<br />
<br />
also no Icon (which dosen't bother me ... rather have no Icon)<br />
<br />
Buff's I had at the time (just incase it might matter):<br />
<br />
Bobbing corpse<br />
Storm Str<br />

Anyone else notice anything similar?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">If thats all its gonna do now it fuckin sucks, just do what i did and bank it and buy a tae ew two hand sword.  im done waiting for this peice of shit to start working.  they arent going to fix either IC or GM so it is now simply a pride quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ophidius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">mine works as originally intended now! i get healed, mob gets fucked. its a sweet deal. i picked a good day to ding 45 and start proccing it</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>GeeViouS</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Since the latest patch... I noticed the Spell gem has changed... along with it saying &quot;You Spell did not take hold.&quot; when it procs and no other DoT lifetap based buff on me or the mob. It's been doing this for a while now. Reported the bug but nothing seems to be done. I'm thinking they nerfed it again.... if thats the case im gonna destroy my greenmist sadly. Just my opinion on it and stating i am also having problems. hope it's just me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Meulard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">It looks to me like it's fixed now.</div></div><hr />
