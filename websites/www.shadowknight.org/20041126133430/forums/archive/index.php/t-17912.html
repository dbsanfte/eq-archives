<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Covi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Last item I need is decrepit hide...killed about 100 ashen bone drakes...great exp and armor trade-in loot....but no hide.<br />
<br />
Anyone know about how many drakes have to die before a hide drops?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Messer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Pushing 300 drakes killed now, 0 hide drops.<br />
<br />
Stuff like this makes the game lame, but I still like to kill shit.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dachande</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, really, all it takes is one drake to get your hide.  You just have to be lucky.  When I played I saw 2 or 3 drop, and completed the epic 3 times...Always keep your options open and you might find someone with one to MQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nycathis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">270 here no drop<br />
<br />
<br />
What I would like to see is the approximate number of Drakes to hides if people can remember. <br />
<br />
It IS a pain that this is a crap shoot - some get a hide the second time others get a hide after hundreds.<br />
<br />
One thing that I have been able to research though from the 10 or so Epiced SHD on Brell I asked is that the wandering Drakes dont drop it  only the ones set up as static spawns .....<br />
<br />
But is this TRUE? Would YOU take the risk?:p <br />
<br />
Anyone remeber if their hide dropped from a wanderer or a static?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Saruton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">A friend got it from a drake who popped on the staircase just at the zone in. He got it for his alt :(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aelali</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah... this part of the epic royaly sucks... <br />
<br />
Something that might help though, the spot where the ashenbone broodmother spawn is near Maestro's house, the neat thing about the mini's in Hate now is that they have Place holders, though the really neat thing is that the PHs are always the same mob as the mini.<br />
<br />
Thus, the place where the Broodmother spawns will *always* have a drake standing there. <br />
<br />
<br />
At least this way you can for sure kill one every spawn cycle at the least.</div></div><hr />

Prior to VFF, I had a theory; if your fear drop was looted fast and easy, your Hate drop would take forever... and verse a vise, if your Hate drop was looted fast and easy, your Fear drop would take forever...  we started a thread (http://forums.shadowknight.org/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=11864)  to start counting, but it didn't live very long.<br />

My Hate drop came on my first raid to hate (as a guest with another guild) on the second drake, drake was pulled to the maestros room (have no idea if it was static or pat spawn).  This also predates the revamp of Hate.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Ganodoar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">I am currently up to 144 drakes, 0 hides in 7 trips to hate. I have been camping the broodmaster spot since the ph is always a drake. So far we have seen only 2 earth staves drop and heard in ooc of 2 essences of a vampire rotting. The hide can drive people insane. Luckily, something unbeleiveable happened. On trip 7 the shaman I invited loved hate so much that he decided to stay with his bot. He plans to live in hate for a long period. He even said he'd mq the hide for free.<br />
<br />
The best part about this is not only does the chances of a hide double, but since his main is a shaman and he is still doing the shaman epic, he has sufficient faction to do the MQ. No need to sneak or anything. Sometimes hate can do funny things to people. If it wasn't for the xp and the marsinger quest gems that some people go after, this would be the worst camp in EQ history.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Tescin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Make no mistake.  This IS the worst camp in EQ history.  10 Trips to Hate.  Lost count of all the drakes we've killed.  But I would rather camp for months than hand some greedy mage 200k for an MQ.  (No joke, I had a mage /auction that while I was there.)<br />
<br />
Most of all, I hate having to drag people up there.  I'm even considering leveling my shaman to 58 just to be able to 2box there for the hide.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Ganodoar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">I still say Stormfeather is the worst camp Tescin. Having to drag people is no problem to me because they like hate for the xp and of course the 2 rangers still need the SEOC so that is enough to convince them. Luckily my guildies are finished flagging for Plane of Tactics so I figure more hate grinds now. As for that mage, I hope you told him to shove it. <br />
<br />
Another good thing about hate Tescin is you could make lots of cash selling other epic MQs, assuming you don't got a friend(s) or guildie(s) that need it. I have seen mages wanting to buy the earth staff MQ for 20k. One chanter in hate was oocing a lot that she was willing to pay 50k just for loot rights to the essence of a vampire. Some grind group I saw told me they got a SEOC and managed to sell the mq for 50k. You could actually get rich lvling your shaman or a good group up there if you are lucky. <br />
<br />
Now why I think Stormfeather is actually worser than the hide (Hide being the 2nd worst camp in my mind). First, you don't even get xp really by the time you can effectively solo Stormfeather without a Kser being able to KS you. Secondly, for the most part, you just sit on your butt waiting and thus not getting xp or even loot like you would in hate. Thirdly and lastly, you don't get to help other friends or guildies get epic pieces in hate or maybe even the pieces to MQ for good cash.<br />
<br />
Hopefully you can get the hide. I know what you mean though. To me it almost feels like the worst EQ camp. It is the worst epic camp in EQ though. That I will agree too but just not the worst overall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Tescin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">Ahhhh  I forgot about Stormfeather.  I talked to a friend once about his experience with that camp.   He sat there for 12 hours strait at least, and a wizzy showed up and sat near spawn point.  As soon as Stormfeather popped, my friend engaged.  The wizzy proceeded to burn Stormy down...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, I know. I can dream though can't I?<br />
<br />
Camped Stormfeather for a week during which time i was KS'd twice (finally got him on the 3rd pop), but I'd gladly do that again than camp Hate for months. Dunno whats it like on your server  Ganodoar, but I can't PAY people to go there with me. Or Sky, or Fear for that matter. After months of pestering my guild, looking for pickups, posting on general server based forums and even talking to rival guilds I only have 1 Sky and 1 Hate trip to my name, and I've never set foot in Fear.<br />
<br />
It's really fcuking me off and I'm on the verge of jacking the whole thing in. <br />
<br />
Sorry for the rant.<br />
WTB group going to Hate, Fear and Sky, on Venril Sathir :-(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Noguut</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">202 Drakes so far. <br />
<br />
Luckily it seems I am the only SK on The Nameless working on it tho.  I've been the only SK in Hate almost every night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Covi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">wow! I am surprised this post is still going.<br />
<br />
Post on your servers message boards for the hide MQ. Usually some class that has no use for the hide almost always has one. Sony gets a kick out of giving shit to the wrong classes. <br />
<br />
Best wishes all.</div></div><hr />

buckle down and shut up...keep killin :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Celebribar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">Took a group to hate last night, first drake we killed dropped my hide. I've listened to the numerous horror stories of this drop and have been dreading it ever since I started the quest.  I have only been to hate 3-5 times, guess this was my lucky night.  Only need BoA and on to City of mist :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Splatterpunk6</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">102drakes:1 hide, I guess I was lucky.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Ganodoar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">Went to hate today (trip 9) and of course went to the drake house. Brought the kill count to 165 when all of a sudden a troll shaman in the zone said he had been here since thursday trying to get a SEOC for his ranger alt. Turns out he got a decrepit hide and said he'd mq it for free. The only catch is I have to help him with the child's tear, high scale kirn, neh ashirr and lord rak for the epic. <br />
<br />
Granted it doesn't give an sk the same feeling as personally looting one but IMO the decrepit hide is just an insane camp and insane camps can do funny things to people. Hell if you killed 100+ Drakes I'd say you earned the hide. Not your fault the drop rate is stupid. I can see why some sks break down and offer to buy the MQ too. Sadly there is no way they will up the drop rate cause after all they don't want to gimp the sk epic like the rogue epic was gimped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Laymon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">What was gimped with the rogue epic?<br />
<br />
Anyway if they dont want to up the drop rate they could at least make the stats a little better. a beter dam/delay ratio or a HT proc or something. <br />
<br />
Actually there's an idea for a thread. &quot;What stats would make the SK Epic worth getting?&quot;<br />
<br />
think I'll do that now</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Ganodoar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">http://matt.waggoner.com/ragebringer.html<br />
<br />
Scroll down to the very bottom and it explains why the rogue epic is gimped now. Kinda funny having a rogue who wrote that guide talking about it being gimped. I really wish though that they required the 4 daggers, the 4 swords, and that the kedge robe only dropped off of Phin and the Ishva robe only off of the Ishva Mal.<br />
<br />
Then maybe we wouldn't say the rogue epic is so short. I recall hearing, Laymon, a rogue who started the epic and finished it all in one day. The epic is that short and well if it wasn't gimped then at least it would take longer. I have nothing against rogues but SOE's epic balance blows. <br />
<br />
Ah well just Mummy of Glohnor and Lhranc are the last 2 fights. Still have to wait for the troll shaman to come down to mq the hide and wait for the next patch to fix the quest containers to get the heart of the innocent but once you get the hide laymon, the worst is over. Well maybe not anymore cause I hear breaking fear is a bitch now with the Ireblind Imp (berserker epic mob) who is located conviently at the west wall camp.</div></div><hr />
