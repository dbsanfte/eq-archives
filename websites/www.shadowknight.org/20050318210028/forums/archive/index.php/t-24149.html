Our 1.0 is also non pvp. In fact, any spell effect with a recourse wont work in PVP so kiss the Lifetap Dots goodbye, the Mental Corrup/Horror, and Zev's aswell for PVP, not like i'd use the mental or Zev's anyway but the lifetap dots would have been handy. Anyway you can still cast it on another NPC and then use it on your PVP friend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kilkulan Darkwarrior</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">ahh thx, I Was told it was PVP.. then I clicked it today and was like hmmm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">That's messed up.  Should be pvp useable.  I think they botched something in the code.<br />
<br />
If I'm fighting someone, I should be able to cast Bond of Death on them or click my epic.  /bug.<br />
<br />
I've had problems lately with casting Bond of Death on Eye of Zomm causing the game to crash to the server select screen.  Anyone else had this problem?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>BludrainHalovex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">We got the obvious bitchslap when it comes to pvp.  Recourse spells I can *maybe* understand.  But when we get hit with the mana tap priest hammer while our mana tap procs &quot;dont effect target PC&quot;, I'd say SOE needs a course in subtlety.  Dont get me wrong I dont think we should be playing in god mode in pvp, but I dont think other classes should be allowed to either.<br />
<br />
As for the bond spells on eye of zomm, did this for a quick boost during a raid a few days ago while in window mode.  Only thing it did to me was lock my mouse up when I right clicked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mordosskul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah, I can't loot my eyes after Z-biting it or bonding it or it'll kick me right to the server select. A couple necros in my guild have the same issue.</div></div><hr />
