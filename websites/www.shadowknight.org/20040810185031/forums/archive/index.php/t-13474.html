Just wondering as I'm going to give them a go tonight. But in the right up in allakhazam it states that you need things like &quot;clockwork rat back plate&quot;, &quot;clockwork rat belly plate&quot; and &quot;clockwork rat leg section&quot;.<br />
<br />
Whereabouts can I find the clockwork rats which drop these items, I cant spot them??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vuloshek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The clockwork rats you need are called &quot;a rogue cleaner&quot;, and you'll find them in the northwest near the faydark zoneline (can't remember, is it the lesser or greater faydark?), basically just past that gap in the mountains behind the Grikbar camps.  They're hard to spot, but easy to kill.  What makes them hard to spot, aside from their dull color and small size, is that there are large plague rats roaming in the same area who look nearly identical from afar, and there' a small hill in their general spawn spot that's a real blinder for a short gnome.<br />
<br />
I'll add in this part just in case you didn't know (you didn't ask).  The clockwork spider pieces you need come from the large &quot;a rogue clockwork&quot; spiders that roam near the minotaur cave in the northeast.  Not hard to kill, but if any giant yellow recluse spiders see you killing them, they'll add on, and their poison is pretty potent - 12 hp per tick or so.  Also, if you get any humanoid &quot;rebel clockworks&quot; adding on, their motors are worth a plat or so when they drop, they're not worthless quest items (I think there's more than 1 type of motor that drops, only 1 is worth money).<br />

You're going to hate the helmet when you get it... gnome helmets are goofy.</div></div><hr />
