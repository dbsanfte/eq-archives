<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ShadowForged</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I decided to start on the Eyepatch of Plunder, and so went to talk to the Lost Pirate. He responded to my Hail and &quot;Ami wants Chapter P&quot; but nothing else. I've tried a lot of different things and I get nothing. He wouldn't give me  the box.:confused:<br />
<br />
After trying for a while, and getting annyoed, I went to GD to kill Tizmak so I could get their meat. I got four after a while then went to Bloodmaw to hand them in. I invised first and moved close enough to hand the meat into him. Once the trade window went up I hit hide, to be indifferent. Pushed the give button and Bloodmaw says &quot;I have no need for this item Ragol, you can have it back&quot; 4 times.:confused:<br />
<br />
Anyone know what is wrong?<br />
<br />
I'm also confused about the Dire Wolf Stalker. Is the shadow temple ToFS? If so, I just go kill every regular dire wolf around ToFS and he will spawn eventually?<br />
Thanks for the help in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kyrkii Sa'Kyttn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">On the Dire Wolf Stalker...Quest writeup on Alla's is wrong, it's on the island with port ring.<br />
<br />
I decided it would take forever to do it with just the sk, so I pulled out my 63 druid, went to around n2000,p6000 in Iceclad, near a dragon skull stone, and would ensnare every wolf I could find.  Would gather up between 15 and 30 wolves, circle em together like a quad, and PBAoE them with Catastrophe.  Doing this continuously for over 6 hours, killing hundreds of wolves, eventually spawned a dire wolf stalker.  Tracked him, dragged him to where sk was parked, murder, log and loot.<br />
<br />
You definetely need a tracker for this.  Get some friends and just hang out at that loc killing wolves and eventually you'll get him.<br />
<br />
Don't know why Bloodmaw did that...What I did was to go up behind him, fd since I'd get aggro.  Put meat on cursor, hover it over Bloodmaw, and quickly hit 1(stand up), click meat on Bloodmaw, 2(hide).  Took a few tries since hide didn't always work and I'd have to fd again, but eventually I hid and was able to get him to poof.<br />
<br />
I remember Lost Pirate not responding either.  Tried lots of things and unfortunately didn't log what worked.  Keep trying stuff in the dialog he gives you, something with pieces/parts/finding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Carshail Shel'rac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">&quot;I will find the parts of the map&quot; will trigger the shinhumper to hand you the book binder.<br />

Just get a druid to charm Bloodmaw ;) had the same problem a few weeks ago (did the quest out of boredom and to get a new clicky) and just asked a druid friend to charm him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ShadowForged</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for the help. I got the 3rd map piece from the gnome captive this morning. I used Kyrkii's method since I didn't have any druid friends on at the time. It worked perfectly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My turnin with bloodmaw, I just did at max range I could trade from.  Tried handing meat over and over, slowly moving closer.  Finally got just close enough to hand in, and worked fine.  Move much closer, aggros, and smacks on ya.<br />
<br />
I just ran around the island with the port ring, killing anything in sight, took about 20 minutes to get wolfie to spawn I needed.<br />
<br />
Cant remember phrase that was needed for lost pirate.  I saved it for last, and if I remember right, the guide on alla was wrong, but someones submitted message under it had the correct thing to say.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Oombak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">another thing that works is harmony/pacify type spell, worked for a friend of mine. i was able to creep up on the guy and turn in without a problem</div></div><hr />
