<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Arangar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What's the general opinion on this? Will they loose to many members to keep going?<br />
<br />
Also, will SOE release more content for EQ1, seeing as EQ2 isn't nearly as hard-core player oriented?<br />
<br />
Any exsiting rumours and thoughts appreciated :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ghismonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I predict highish-end guild mergers.  Not the highest of high-end, but the guilds that are still not in Tacvi will be merging with other guilds on their server to keep alive.<br />
<br />
Progression through POP, where you still need a grillion cleric CH rot to kill Cornerstone mobs, is gonna take a serious hit.  I suspect guild collaboration.<br />
<br />
I predict that in about 3 months, we'll begin seeing EQ servers condense, opposite of splits.  Congratulations Morden Rasp, you're being movelogged to Maelin Starpyre!<br />
<br />
Content that will be released will include ways to beat POP (for the first time) with a 54 person force, and more content similar to the MPG single group trials.  Ways for the newly &quot;casual&quot; people to still see upgrades even after their highish-end guilds fall apart.  After all, a casual player pays the same amount per month as a hardcore one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Askeer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Novae is gone already.<br />
And don't forget WoW, it's gonna impact guilds too, more so than eq2 I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ghismonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah, I guess the title said EQ2 but I expect WOW will have a bigger impact than EQ2 will.  Same outcome I predict, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">EQ2 wont affect anything, in fact, I guarantee give it 2 days after it releases till u see people who left EQ for EQ2 coming back to original eq. WoW however will take some significant numbers I think, but not enough to cripple the game by any means. I like many others am going to play both original EQ and WoW</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Naubi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">WoW looks like a good game... but the setting just doesn't inspire me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>kharan_zechts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Many guilds are having serious membership issues atm and more coming with eq2/wow. A lot of guilds are going to dissolve or merge because of losing members to these new games and losing members to other high end guilds which will be agressively recruiting to fill their lost spots.<br />
Tough times are ahead  :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I see mergers and the end</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>cames</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I agree.  I would expect EQ to be 50% or less of current active accounts in 6 months.  On my server, I expect to lose 2 - 3 Time+ guilds and folks merge into the remaining ones.  I don't expect EQ to die, but compared end zones of PoP and GoD people are in Anguish pretty quickly.  Seems like a way of holding people and expecting them to jump in some quantity.  People seem to be growing tired of EQ1 and are looking for something new.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kahntun Derstand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If my guild falls apart, I will finally be able to walk away from this type of game for the last time.<br />
<br />
It is somewhat sad, though.  If you have a core guild of 54-70 people that are willing to keep playing, this could be a very exciting time for you.  More raid targets = more raids = more dkp = more loot = faster progression.  A guild that sticks together through all of that could have a really fun time for the next few months / year.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I see mergers and the end<br />
Guild or sever mergers?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Lunaci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">just in the last couple months due to lack of leadership/interest.  A lot of consolidation occurring.  I don't think we're to the point where servers will get combined but I see a lot of guild combines going up as the top gamers get bored and move over to WoW and EQ2.  <br />
<br />
Coming back to EQ only really has an appeal if you haven't already won.  And a heck of a lot of people are now at the point where they feel like they pretty much have won...or don't have the numbers to consistently keep winning.<br />
<br />
Casual players still have a year left in EQ though.  I'll stick around for a while yet as I haven't seen time.  But on Karana at least, the jarring death of our open raids with the release of OOW and the WOW betas really impacted the server.  Once people couldn't see Planar progression happening anymore, a lot started to lose interest.  OOW is ok but the insta twink factor from all the uber loot there even starts to wear thin when you realize that everyone else has the same new toys you do. *shrug*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Oagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I agree Kahntun, and I think I'm in one of them.  We're about mid-way VT (yeah, I know, obsolete content) I'd say.  However, having chosen to take the normal progression has kept us fairly tight and focused.  We're actually closing recruiting for the most part, because we have what we believe we need for continued progression.  I'm fairly confident we'll see Time.  Beyond that, it's a toss-up.  Not beating the game, per se, but it will be a lot farther than I expected to get in this game, not belonging to an EST raiding guild.<br />
<br />
I am surprised tha Novae folded.  Too bad.  I believe ED will continue to function as long as SoE adds some content for them.  They'll replace those that leave with others that want the tag.  But, Brael could best comment on that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Lejina Bloodbath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I see EQ related suicides skyrocket.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no, not enough of the gang is online to kill the dragon&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If you think the recruitment rate was bad with PoP or GoD, you're in for some rough times. Mass exodus of players to EQ2/WoW, new recruits get in, old members getting tired to flag the new recruits and quit, more new recruits, the not so old recruits getting tired to flag the same stuff again and again, etc. Load of fun!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I see the end of a lot raiding guilds.<br />
<br />
Maybe the real hardcore eq players left, will do server transfers to all be together on a few servers. That's the only way I see decent recruiting with out having to back flag or redo content, which will just probably make more people quit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Vaalkryst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">At worst we are looking at the downfall of some of the games high end guilds.  I've recently come back to the game starting fresh, and let me tell you, there is a large base of dedicated mid level players still active.  I forsee more of a temporary decline in the high end raid scene until this generation comes to fill in the gaps (flags are really going to be the problem here, though I've heard things like new quests to get into higher end PoP, and items that will auto-backflag you when you loot as a 15% in a raid.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Daeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Back-Flagging quests are coming in for a reason you know i'm pretty sure they have already thought of the plan to keep people in eq1</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kyfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I think the guilds that are smart and bulk(ed) up a bit starting a little while ago will do ok.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Skoggel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I think that if it was EQ2 or WoW, there wouldn't be a big deal. Remembering back to when DAoC came out, a good deal of people left EQ for it, and a good deal of those were back within a few months. It was no apocalypse for EQ by any means, but its release was felt temporarily.<br />
<br />
WoW or EQ2 will be about the same I think, maybe a bit more of an impact but certainly neither are EQ killers...<br />
<br />
...WoW and EQ2 released so close together? Well, not an EQ killer, but it will double the impact. More than double, really, as people who don't want to struggle through such times may not stick around anymore either.<br />
<br />
Still, I don't think we'll see anything like server mergers anytime soon. Things won't be too too bad, particularly if this new backflagging thing works well. In my guild's case, we just beefed up our numbers about a month ago to really wade into Time, and while it will still be a bad thing to lose people to two games more or less at the same time, I doubt it will be crippling considering 1) Guild average level gets closer to 70 every day, and by no means do you need a ton of level 70s to clear time and 2) Aside from Time, we're doing by and large 54 man content, which we're currently already usually filling up.<br />
<br />
I have a feeling many guilds roughly around that progression will be in similar circumstances as guilds had to have numbers based on level 65 not that long ago.<br />
<br />
One or two guild mergers for the upper end guilds on a server will probably be expected, and in particular a bleak month or two ahead. There are still gonna be enough people playing EQ that there won't be huge differences in the way things are now to the way they'll soon be though. If two of the top five guilds on a server end up merging and across the other three there's a hefty wave of apps, it's hardly a doomsday scenario.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>mulletess</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I think the causal population will take a much bigger hit then the raid population.  Already if you do a who all 62 65 on my server you rarely ever get more then 8 to 10.  If the casuals start having troubles find groups they will leave.  If there money leaves it will hurt the game.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Eggborn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">It's strange where I see it.  It seems to be all over, but it basically due to who has the systems to handle it vs who doesn't.<br />
<br />
The people who have the systems that can use it, have been trying it. I am not sure how many like it, but a good many do.  Some don't.<br />
<br />
My old guild broke up over some other issues (we had just started raiding the Elementals), and most members merged with another guild who was just finishing the Elementals.  Most chose to stay in EQ1 and start to raid Time, while a few causals retired, and others moved to EQ2.  I think we may lose a few, but since the guild just got into time.. probably many will stay to see that through.  It's gonna depend on whether or not they like GoD and epics more than EQ2 for us I bet.  Still, there's a boatload of people who just don't have the systems to handle the new games.</div></div><hr />

At times I still play EQ1 on a P2 400. WoW won't even load on that machine. :) And we are pretty much exclusively doing things in Oow. So I would strongly disagree with you on this statement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Perhaps modify that statement to include the use of new models in OoW requiring a better computer than WoW, and I could agree with that.

Your friends are wrong, I've tested 3 raids personally in a short time in the EQ2 beta - as well as Tarwhatever in the EQ2 section here stating that she's tested MULTIPLE RAIDS, and Requiem on the FoH boards.<br />
<br />
Try spewing that bullshit someplace else, no one is gonna buy it here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Culdahl1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I love to see how everyone bashes sequals no matter what, yet they all end up playing them eventually.....there was actually a good article in CGW about this in relation to Doom 3.<br />
<br />
 WoW does not seem to have the same functionality as EQ and appears to be geared towards a younger crowd.  I'm not saying it won't succeed but I heard the same shit about camelot and other RPG's that, for lack of a better word, suck balls.<br />
<br />
  As for raid content in EQ2 - there is plenty and I know several people have done the lower level raids (don't think anyone has done the endgameish stuff yet or come close that I know of).  Essentially, EQ2 has the same content as EQ1 before all the expansions but has much better graphics and gameplay (Vox and naggy are still the big raid targets that they were upon EQ1's release).  If EQ2 catches on early you will see a gradual decline in EQ1....IMO, i kinda hope it doesn't catch on all that fast 'cause I want to be able to take my time exploring rather then racing to end game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Killail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Hello,<br />
  Its my believe, that mid- level to causal gamer will take the hit harder then High-end players. Yes there is Raid targets in Eq2 but its different. Eq2 is just different, along with wow. I believe again that players will leave and after the &quot; Newness&quot; or the &quot;cool&quot; effect comes off, people will come back.Eq1 is still the main driving force in the MMOG market. <br />
  I want to say this from my brother's point of view. He states, that is not content or the targets, its that he wants a more of a life beyond the game. His old guild had very high attendence demands on him,so he left about a 10 months ago, to finish college. He got into both WoW, and Eq2. He states again that is just different form eq1. This game to him, will always be a life changing event to him. My brother, in the last few weeks has come back to Everquest1 not to raid, nor to be an high-end raider and a hardcore gamer. He just wants to play this game, for fun and to play with his friends that sitll play the game. His goals now for the game is not to be an high-end raider or let it take over away from is another comments.<br />
  I am blessed to play this game with him on the same sever, before I was thinking of moving on from this game and from this part of my life. Gaming with my brother is fun, I enjoy my time with him when he does play with me. In the end people will leave and then come back. Its just the nature of the world. ITs my believ that Wow/Eq2 are different games, People will try them out, and come back if what want too. That is what l think soe needs to Try and sell. Its bring back people to the game. I say, that look at your life, before you come back. This is just my rant for the month sorry... <br />
<br />
 have fun and be safe<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>mulletess</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Maybe English is not his first language.  I am sick and tired of people who jump on people just because they make a mistake in grammar or spelling.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Warrl Kyrie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I don't think as many people will leave EQ for EQ2 for one reason. The All-Access pass. This was an extremely smart move by SOE. <br />
<br />
I know it doesn't list EQ2 on the all-access pass right now, but the devs have stated that's more for legal purposes pre-launch than SOE not including it. If they list EQ2 on the All-Access pass pre-launch that implies that people currently with the All-Access Pass are entitled to play the game.<br />
<br />
Many people will keep both accounts active with the All-Access Pass, which will keep SOE from merging servers. While this will have a rather large impact on raiding guilds to start, mainly for as long as the new car smell sticks to EQ2, I believe that most people will find a balance between EQ and EQ2 in the end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I actually got a pop-up while logging in that wanted me to buy the all-access pass, and that it would include EQ2 once EQ2 launches.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Zobb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I suspect we will lose more people to WoW than to EQ2. I also suspect a lot of those people to come back in 3-5 months.</div></div><hr />

Simpler solution would be to get the All Access Pass after using the free month and not have to worry about it, no?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Played EQ2, although it's fun, EQ1 is much more fun.<br />
<br />
Cannot comment on WoW yet, but a lot of people like it initially, and a lot those that have played for a while say it starts to lose it's apeal.<br />
<br />
I have to agree with Zobb, every other mmo game that has been released seems to have bolstered EQ1's ranks. We may see a short term out flow of players, but most will be back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Iohotep-CT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">I suspect more will leave and actually stay in WoW then EQ 2. I suspect many who play EQ 2 will come back to EQ 1 after a few months because they will miss the raid aspect. I also suspect that some will play EQ 2 casually while still raiding in EQ 1.  <br />
<br />
As for higher end guilds surviving, thats easy. They will siphon off players from lower guilds or guilds of close-to or equal in raiding capabilities. The quest to get time flagged will benefit guilds in getting lesser geared apps the gear they need to do larger raids in GoD and OoW. Think of Time as a shopping mall. I think guilds that are not prepared to lose about 40% of their members will hurt but will eventually recover....<br />
<br />
All in all for many guilds the next month isn't going to be all that great. However they will eventually recover, and continue as usual.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Kahntun Derstand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">I'll believe that WoW will last more than 3 months after it has lasted more than 3 months.  Now, don't get me wrong.  I'm sure a ton of people will play the game.  However, a ton of people played every other game that came out before WoW.<br />
<br />
All of my RL EQ friends have quit.  None of them has lasted longer than 2 months in any game that they have tried.  And, the sad thing is, they have tried them all.  That's a lot of $50 + subscription bs.  Meanwhile, I'm just sitting here playing the one game I know can hold my interest.</div></div><hr />
