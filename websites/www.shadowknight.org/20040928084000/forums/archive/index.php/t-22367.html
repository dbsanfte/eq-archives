All New PVP System for PVP Servers * <br />
_____________________ <br />
<br />
The Watch List: <br />
- Safe Zones: We’’re still looking into a better solution for the problem of safe zones. Expect some kind of change in the future. <br />
- Point System: There are still concerns of potential exploits with the point system at this time. Therefore the selection of PvP items available on the merchants will be limited to consumable items for now. We’ll monitor the accumulation of points after this update. If all goes well, we will add a selection of equipment to the merchants in the near future. <br />
- Sullon Tokens: As a secondary concern with the point system, we are delaying the addition of the turn-in quest for Sullon Zek tokens. If there’s a potential problem with the point system that eventually requires us to make adjustments to the way points are awarded, we don’t want players to end up with less than full credit for these tokens. Once the point system has had any potential issues ironed out we will add a quest to turn in your tokens for PvP points. <br />
<br />
PvP Combat Changes <br />
<br />
- Melee attacks have a 50% increased range. This does not affect thrown weapons or archery. <br />
- The maximum damage any one spell can do is now capped at 40% of the target’s total hit points, down from 75%. <br />
- Archery damage has been increased to 80% of its base damage in PvP, up from 66%. <br />
- Being stunned while on a horse will now cause the horse to disappear. This only applies to stuns caused by other players. <br />
- Lowered player melee mitigation, effectively lowering Armor Class by 20%. This will increase the damage potential of melee weapons in PvP. Originally the targets full armor class was considered. <br />
- Player spells now have a separate duration field for PvP. Individual spells will continue to be tuned during beta. <br />
- Player spells now have a PvP specific resist mod. Spell lines with resist mods differing from their normal adjusts initially include: <br />
Movement Rate <br />
Root <br />
Enthrall <br />
Mana Drain <br />
Stuns <br />
Direct Damage <br />
Damage over Time <br />
Pet procs/innates <br />
- Added higher level snare spells for rangers/druids with increased resists mods. This should allow them to land snare spells with similar frequency to other snare spells. These spells are available on the PvP merchants for 1 point each. <br />
- Necro and Mage pets have had their PvP resists increased to closer match the existing Beastlord pet resists. <br />
- Lowered the duration of most snare, Enthrall, and Root spells and abilities. <br />
- Berserker snare is no longer unresistable. <br />
- Added a set of pumice stones to the PvP merchants that will cast various forms of dispel magic with a 1.5 second cast, 12 second cast time. <br />
- Arena deaths will now place you at your bind point, and not in shadowrest. <br />
- PvP Resurrection effects now last 5 minutes + 1 minute/negative vitality point. The Max duration is now 15 minutes instead of 25. <br />
- Made further changes to prevent hill ghosting. Please test this and give feedback. <br />
- Ranged weapons are no longer restricted by the Z axis, allowing greater freedom of use on varied terrain. <br />
- Snare will now properly slow mounts. The mount will still be faster then normal running while snared, but will considerably decrease their movement rate. <br />
- Spells now have a minimum chance of landing of 5%, up from 2%. <br />
- Water will no longer cause you to be immune to people outside of water and vice versa. <br />
- Zoning with low health will no longer set your hit points equal to the amount of +HP gear you are wearing. <br />
- Players killed in PvP combat will now spawn in Shadowrest with full equipment. A naked corpse will remain in the location they died for 3 hours. Note that this effectively removes item loot from Rallos Zek. With the addition of no drop augments it became rather trivial to effectively remove item loot from the server anyway, and we felt the benefits of the new death system outweigh the benefits of an item loot system. <br />
- Players who are killed in PvP combat will respawn with special resurrection effects on them. The duration of these effects is variable dependant on how frequently they die. <br />
- Summon Corpse Potions are now usable by any class/race. <br />
- A system to score PvP kills has been implemented. For more information see below. <br />
<br />
Scoring System <br />
<br />
- The new scoring system will award points to any player who kills another player. If the player is grouped the points will be split between the players in the group. The points awarded will be based on three things: <br />
<br />
1. Level of the killer <br />
<br />
2. Scoring Modifier <br />
<br />
a. Level Difference (Each kill has a base point cost determined by the level of the killer. All subsequent modifiers apply to this base number.)For each level the killer is above or below the victim, the scoring modifier increase by one point. If you kill some one who is higher level than you, you’ll gain more points than you will for a lower level character. You will also subtract points from your modifier for killing a player lower level then you. <br />
<br />
b. Infamy Difference - Each time you kill another player, points are added to your infamy pool. At certain thresholds a player will gain an infamy level. When a player is killed, the infamy levels are compared and the killer gains a scoring modifier point for each infamy level his victim is above him. He can also lose scoring modifier points for killing someone who is of lower infamy. Infamy will gradually deteriorate while the player is online. <br />
<br />
c. Vitality score - When a player is killed their vitality is set to –10. For each 5 minutes they are alive, they will gain back two points of vitality. This vitality total is added directly to the scoring <br />
<br />
d. Group bonus - Groups of 4 or more will receive a bonus % of points for each kill. 4/10%, 5/15%, 6/20%. <br />
<br />
3. Time since the victim was last killed by the same player. Players that repeatedly kill the same player will see a steep decrease in the amount of points a player is worth. They will gain half the points for the kill they normally would for each time they kill that player in a 24 hour period. After the score has dropped below 1 point, they will begin to lose points for killing the same player. <br />
<br />
Example: Frizznik kills Rytan. Frizznik is level 60, while Rytan is level 62 for a level difference of 2. Frizznik has an infamy level of 5, while Rytan has an infamy level of 2, which results in infamy difference of –3. Rytan has not recently been killed, so his vitality is 0. Level Difference + Infamy Difference + Vitality = Scoring Point Modifier or 2 + (-3) + 0. <br />
<br />
- Each scoring modifier point adds or subtracts 5% to the base score. Normally Frizznik would gain 100 points for killing Rytan, but because of the scoring point modifier he will gain 95 points instead. <br />
<br />
<br />
Leader Board <br />
<br />
- The leader board tracks the players with the most total PvP. A number of other useful statistics will be available in the leader board. <br />
Point Rewards <br />
- A player’s point total is capped based on their level. They cannot gain more points once they hit that cap, although they can gain more infamy. There will be a number of consumable PvP items that will be focused on PvP combat, and will only function against other players. <br />
<br />
Windowed Mode * <br />
_____________________ <br />
The EverQuest process is now more friendly. Alt+tab'ing to other windows should be much more responsive.You can also choose to adjust your maximum Frames Per Second(FPS) in the Options Window under display settings. The valid range for the slider is 10 to 100. The default is 100 which means EverQuest will not throttle your FPS. Lowering your setting will cap your FPS at that value and free up the CPU for other tasks. <br />
<br />
<br />
Hot Zones have changed! * <br />
_____________________ <br />
<br />
Hunt for greater XP rewards in the new Hot Spots. Make your way to the following zones. <br />
<br />
60-65 Plane of Torment <br />
55-60 Chardok <br />
50-55 Grieg's End <br />
45-50 Nurga <br />
40-45 City of Mist <br />
35-40 Kaesora <br />
30-35 Dalnir <br />
25-30 Hollowshade Moor <br />
20-25 Runnyeye <br />
<br />
Kill a few goblins for me. Oh, and that Grieg guy. <br />
<br />
AA Changes <br />
_____________________ <br />
- The cleric AA Touch of the Divine has had its healing power increased. The original ability has been refunded, so players who wish to retain the ability will need to purchase it again. The portion of the AA that will remove detrimental effects, when it goes off, will not be going in with this update. <br />
- The necromancer AA Swarm of Decay has been refunded. <br />
- The shaman AA Call of the Ancients has had its description changed to reflect the fact that the summoned ward casts healing spells, not endurance regen spells. The ability has been refunded because of this confusion. <br />
- The rogue ability Seized Opportunity has had its chance to work significantly increased. <br />
- The druid ability Viscid Roots was increasing the chance for roots to break, not decreasing it. This has been corrected. <br />
- The paladin ability Hastened Piety now affects the reuse time for both Hand of Piety and its upgrade, Pious Supplication. Previously, it wasn’t affecting Pious Supplication. <br />
- When an AA is an upgrade of another AA and both are triggered abilities, players can make a hotkey and use either one, but will only get the upgraded effect if they use the hotkey for the upgraded ability. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Tacvi Changes <br />
_____________________ <br />
- Tacvi will no longer give lockout timers. Instead, when you beat an encounter there, you will gain a timer for that specific event. Then, when you come back to the zone, if that timer hasn’t expired yet that particular event won’t be up, but other events in the zone will be if it has been long enough since the last time they were defeated. <br />
- Loot in Tacvi has been given a thorough audit. Many changes were made including changes to the statistics of the items, changing item names, changing where the items drop, and over a dozen new items were added to the zone. <br />
- The Tacvi zone timer was increased from 6 hours to 12 hours. <br />
<br />
Misc. <br />
_____________________ <br />
- Diamond Dust will now drop more frequently in permafrost and can now also be found in SolusekB * <br />
<br />
- Names will now scale with character they’re associated with. So a giant will have a much larger name than a Halfling will while retaining its much smaller brain. <br />
- Names for larger characters will be visible from a greater distance than the names for smaller characters are. They will also scale up slightly as you increase your distance from a character, making them more readable from a greater distance. <br />
- Tinting should now work properly again on Robes, let the Fluorescent Pink tinting begin! <br />
- We have added Tooltips for your status bars.* <br />
- We have made some changes to the fonts EQ uses so that they are more clear and visible. <br />

<br />
For every 100 patches they do, one is specifically for PvP.<br />
It's nice to get some attention for a change.<br />
<br />
HT was gimped? Well, I think it was modified so it’s not an insta kill. We have to be more cautious and guileful when using it.<br />

Hehe, ROK is where SK was badly broken in terms of tanking power, xp penalty, too long cast time spells, gimped HT, low defense skills, low hp, dumb-ass, useless pet, low mana pool, etc etc. I can't imagine how bad it was compared to now!

Under PvP, but I hope it effects blubies too<br />
- Ranged weapons are no longer restricted by the Z axis, allowing greater freedom of use on varied terrain.  <br />
Might have pulling uses<br />
<br />

At least until they kept the server up for another 30 minutes to call an emergency patch...<br />
Prestige for the fast is good, isn't it? :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Space</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">The assmunches called a server down for patch in 10mins about 30mins after server up but... they only bought down Tacvii for about an hour or so before they finally took down the servers completely.  We were about to go kill cyno when they called the server down yet we could of stayed online killed him in the time it took the servers to actually come down. All they did was cutoff the login server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Askeer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">so I tried and dueled during the short time the servers were up.<br />
my super improved HT that I paid millions of AAs for did an incredible 3400 dmg !!!111~~(using unholy aura of course)<br />
And touch of innoruuk landed for 360 max, and healed for 180.<br />
I still managed to win, but it sucked bad.<br />
And of course bards are still overpowered, and I still couldnt land a single snare on anybody.<br />
Gogo PvP changes !!  :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Scarus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Another undoccumented feature of the patch is that they seem to have fucked up far clip pane.  Mine is set to maximum but in game is only drawing around half to two thirds distance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Meriboh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Another part of the original patch message that was missing:<br />
“All safe zones have been removed save Shadowrest and the Bazaar”<br />
<br />
PoT, Nexus and PoK were all still “safe” zones when I logged in…<br />
<br />
Sorry for the missing bits of info on my cut and paste. I must have dl the pre-patch message for the pre-patch message for the pre- patch… never mind.<br />

<br />
Mindlessly killing lots of annoying mobs to now be left with a BP that cannot be sold back...if you call that luck..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Manslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Except that it was a superior equipment when you could use it.  Don't think most of the people in that position really are going to be hurting not having an extra 1k LDoN points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Space</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">They turned CBQ into a bastard again, reflects about 80% + of spells again, its back to being all about the melee.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">CBQ was also banishing our raid members by handfulls.  Out into the middle of the ocean, near the south zone wall.  Snare + ported halfway across the zone = loooooong run.  Shes still easy, but definitely got buffed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Askeer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">I confirm that SA crits are working again on live servers btw.<br />
Got a lot of 540dmg crits from mental horror yesterday.</div></div><hr />
