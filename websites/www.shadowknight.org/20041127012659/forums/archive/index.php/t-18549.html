<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>newtank</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">hybrids are suppost to be 75% war...where are our 75% of their openings?  even if we 50/50 we should get 50%.  Guess being a whiner pays off.  <br />
<br />
If balance is off in Jan I think there gonna be some sk accounts cancelled.  So lets start this thread, what is a good replacement hobby to replace eq with?  I have been fading out of eq via the gym and dating etc but I need something more solid like golf or something...</div></div><hr />

If you don't like your SK, make a warrior after the changes come out ..<br />
<br />
I like playing my SK as it is now, maybe a couple things could be changed, but over all, I enjoy it ... If I had wanted mega DPS, I would have made a Wizard or Rogue, if I wanted to tank every high end MOB in the game, I would have made a warrior ...<br />
<br />
The game is what you make of it, your class is also, Warriors do have a legit gripe about taunt/aggro ability, the rest of their whinning is just stupid, if they wanted a high DPS character, they should have made something else, but they made a tank and tanks need to be able to hold and keep aggro ...<br />
<br />
The changes they are making to the combat system and giving to pure melee effect me very little, if they aren't nerfing SK to make these changes happen, who gives a shit, if I wanted to have to do a bunch of silly ass combo moves, I would be playing Mortal Combat 30 (or whatever they are upto now) ...<br />
<br />
Until they nerf SK from what we are now, I say more power to the warriors, let them have some fun ...</div></div><hr />

But I'm not gonna whine about new warrior abilities as long as every expansion gives me new spells.  They only are getting &quot;conbat skills&quot; now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sure I will be happy with that too.<br />
<br />
As long as every expansion gives us new spells that increase our overall power proportionally with casters.  The hybrids are part melee thing doesn't hold true if we don't have access to &quot;melee spells&quot;.  Therefore our spells have to be way more powerful to compensate.<br />
<br />
So lets say there is a new expansion.<br />
<br />
Wiz gets new spell 10% better mana-&gt;dps ratio or more mana<br />
War gets new openings/weapons 10% better dps from melee<br />
<br />
SK gets function from 2 sources<br />
<br />
Necro/Wiz part and War part<br />
<br />
Both of these parts need to increase 10% to keep up.<br />
That or one part needs to increase more than 10% (but then either caster gonna cry nerf like necro did on lich line spell in pop or the warriors will like they just did).  <br />
<br />
I see a strong temptation to have the SK's spells increase 8-9% and the sk's melee side increase 8-9% cause SOE listens to the loudest class.  Short term this isn't a problem cause we not really at the bottom but you can see where this is going.<br />
<br />
I see the total lack of &quot;melee skills&quot; for SK/ranger/Pally/BST etc as a fundemental return to the concepts that were in effect when I started playing eq when hybrids couldn't get a group (velious).  Rangers are gonna feel this first but we will feel it eventually too.</div></div><hr />

BTW all thanks oh so much for all the love.<br />
<br />
If you don't get a commitment from SOE that hybrids are gonna get some version of &quot;melee spells&quot; before they go live then we probably never gonna get them.  IE if they say there are no current plans to have hybrids get openings but in future expansions they will get a weaker version etc. we will be ok.</div></div><hr />

<br />
SoE make a commitment to something?  heheheh ...<br />
<br />
We are ok now though (like I said before, maybe a couple little things could be changed, but nothing drastic is needed, well maybe except for changing the GD graphic on GBoC ....)...<br />
<br />
Personally, I don't even see why you would be comparing us to wizards, we aren't even in the same ballpark when it comes to our spells/abilities compared to theirs ...<br />
<br />
The love is easy to come by, SK is a good class, it has taken a long time for us to get to the position we are in now, there might be a little drop in the amount of groups we get once these new changes come in, solely because of the novelty of them and people wanting to see them in action but, overall, I doubt it will have a serious impact on us ...  <br />
<br />
Those new abilities sound great on paper, but they are being given to a class that is used to doing nothing but hitting auto attack and pressing taunt (maybe kick, bash and/or slam also) which means right off the bat you will have a slew of warriors that A) won't use them very often cause they require you to pay attention (something a majority of them are not used to ..) or B) Won't be using all of them because they are just not worth the effort to bother with (I have some unknown large number of spells in my book and I pretty much use the same ones all the time, which maybe amounts to 20% of the total I have, I can see the same happening here ... ) ...<br />
<br />
Also, we don't even know yet what they will be giving us, what spells, AA, abilities, etc ... Till we see, talking about SK deleting/canceling accounts is kinda silly, not to mention, it ranks right up there (to me anyway) of the kinda panicky, propaganda whinning that the Warriors are notorious for, i.e. 'OMG, SK got a new lifetap, I don't know what they will be giving Warriors but I'll bet it is gonna suck !!!' and other crap like that ...<br />
<br />
Right now they have said they are not nerfing SK, this makes me all warm and fuzzy inside since I still have nightmares about Verant's (and now Sony's) idea of class balancing when it was to nerf the other classes rather than try and fix the problems with the classes in questions ...<br />
<br />
My suggestion would be to wait it out, see what changes get made, see what we get, etc .. then, if it as bad as you seem to think, delete/cancel your account, honestly, I'll probably still be playing my SK regardless, since I don't play my character to compete against Warriors, I play it because I like being an SK and as long as I can pop off an 8K+ HT and see those around me say something like 'GD balriz !' or FD right as a wipe happens so I can lay there and poke fun at those not lucky enough to have the FD skill, then all is well in my universe  =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Faminbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Heck yes I want them to fix warrior taunt..I am tired of taking the damage for them so they look good :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>mysko1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I dont know about but dosent matter how much they gonna change wars, you still be picked before them as a tank.<br />
Sk aint supose to all mele or all necro classes they r a bit of everything, thats what it makes them so cool to play, make a war and you got a BRICK WALL. You cant solo anything, you cant duel against all classes.</div></div><hr />

Its a melee upgrade. We have this this cool thing that they just put it! It's called spells! I think someone told me that they were for utility or something, I don't care though, I just mash taunt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sabrosia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">All I can say is this guy must suck as a Shadow Knight...  SK's are one of the best classes in the game right now...  <br />
<br />
If we need fixing anywhere, it's in the fact that we also have one of the hardest epics and one of the suckiest...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Deadalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Why bother with epic, just spend 5k in the bazaar for a WMBS ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Atlis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">We got a new lifetap?!  Oh great...clerics are gonna whine now.<br />
<br />
Even if warriors outgroup us in standard exp groups after patch.....we can outdo them in other areas.  Get 3 or 4 reject SK's (there will be plenty of them since we are out of jobs) and head to tactics, HoH, PoV, and start kiting.  When kiter #1 gets lom, go to kiter #2.  By the time kiters 3-4 are oom, kiter 1 is fm.<br />
Heck, I may do that anyway....I work better with SK's than with BL's and shamen who try to chain pull while I'm tanking, and the druids and clerics who fall asleep while I'm tanking 700 hitters at 6% health for 45 seconds.  I'll be glad to let the warriors deal with that stuff!</div></div><hr />
