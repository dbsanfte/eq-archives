<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lorimar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I messed around today and on accident found that you can train the rogue epic  1.0 DE's into the Pally camp and FD..Those DE's beat the SHIT outta the Pallies. <br />
<br />
When they are done wiping thier asses with the pallies, the DE's path back to thier house, and you do all the looting. <br />
<br />
I repeated this process 3 times and it worked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Arangar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i thought mob killing mob meant no corpse to loot</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Croix VorAbaddon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Normally it does... and regardless... all you have to do is pet pull them. Is that REALLY so difficult?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have to admit I had a tough time pet pulling to split the pallies.  The pet kept getting stunned and couldn't make it 3 steps before turning into bone dust.  I didn't have the benefit of cleric/shammy buffs or bda etc. this time around so it was humbling to have to bring up a half dozen pets.  Then on the pulls that the pet did make it somewhat back, I forgot to FD first and ended up getting the entire camp (oh, and this is a good test of FD before pet pull vs. not FD'ing before pet pull; using Cackling Bones* at lvl 70.  FD = single, not FD = entire camp, using the same pet).  I managed to kill one pally before they despawned and I had to wait until the skelly respawned.  While I was waiting for that, some guildies got on and it was easier after that since the pet could get buffed up decently.<br />
<br />
If the above tip works, could save a few bone chips and time.<br />
<br />
*Edit: said I used Invoke Death but was actually Cackling Bones (I moved Invoke Death to back of spellbook, I only use Son of Decay [reg] and Cackling Bones [pet pulls].</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lyquid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My group kinda trainded all the rogue 1.0 guys   and died then they started attackign the paladins and the paladins kicked the shit out of them. Maybe the 1.0 npcs are gimp on Morden Rasp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Skvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You can actually get all the paladins single fairly easily...<br />
<br />
Get on horse, run full speed through the camp and dont stop. All the paladins will give chase but due to geometry of the zone some of them get stuck on the trees etc and quickly lose interest in you and wander VERY slowly back toward camp.<br />
<br />
So just keep running around until you have them all seperate and then kill them one at a time.  Hardest part is finding them again once you have scattered them over the zone ;)<br />
<br />
Worked for me all be it with a death when I got stunned right at the start of my run through them and then seriously pnwed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Trysbrina67</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I did this two ways;<br />
<br />
1.  I have a bard alt, I aggroed one, ran away a bit and faded, the pallies were split enough to where my sk could pull and not get the entire camp.  2 at a time is easy even though they can not be mezzed.  Shaman was tanking it with no problem really, of course he's time geared +.<br />
<br />
2.  The paladins seem to corpse camp, I would snare one with the sk and run away a bit.  I would then FD, wait for clear message, stand up and rule 1 and run back to the one I snared, which is now unsnared and own it.<br />
<br />
I never thought about using Rogue 1.0 epic mobs, wouldnt a mob killed by another mob yield no corpse anyway?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zeerith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">To bad some of the Pallies are Immune to Movement Spells and other cant get mezzed ;)<br />
<br />
Allthough 2 at one time is doable indeed .<br />
<br />
I splitted them with FD after a little run . They Corpse Camp but if you are Fast and have an CoS ( or Class who can invis ) you can invis yourself and stand up.<br />
<br />
Pull then the Mobs remaining at camp who decided to cast some buffs instead of following you ;) Yeah Pallies are stupid .......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>BludrainHalovex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">What ever happened to simply FD pulling and going toe to toe with them?  I mean christ they're just pallies =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Krulik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If your smart, you will just FD the mobbs around for 5 min until you get them uncluttered a little and pull singles. I boxed it with a shm last night and got all 3 no problemo. All 3 dropped of the brown frog. Had to do it 3 times because i had a bad pull one time and accidentally gated my shm on another hah. It happens at 3am.   <br />
<br />
Notes: The paladins dont path. Once you move them around and FD, when your aggro clears they stay in place. The Brownish frog is snareable. The erudite is not. Also if you are having major problems, try to get at least 2 split away from the group, FD and wait for one of them to despawn. When it does, pop up and grab the remaining one. They despawn but if one is aggrod, it stays. You DONT need mezz classes and you really only need a slower/patcher.<br />
<br />
Dont see invis.<br />
Start out as Non-kos<br />
Hit max of i think around 750<br />
Avg hits are 175-500<br />
Weak hps<br />
Attempts to heal at low health but theyre suk heals.<br />
They dont flee or gate<br />
They dont always drop the blood.<br />
They jump around and attack all the skeles and zombies that path near them at night. The skeles actually helped me a bit on one of my splits last night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Azzyenya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Summon lowest level pet.<br />
Gaurd him next to you away from pallys.<br />
FD, and send pet in.<br />
If you wait to spawn the pallys for when your rdy. they will start buffing eachother when they settle down. send in pet so it hits the pally when it is in mid cast. Pull pet back. and when pally is done casting the spell it will come for your pet. walla.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Thenger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">So far I read that these guys depsawn, so what is the spawn time on them?  i shall be going after them either tonight or tommorow morning to get them out of the way and be able to do my final fight tommorow after the raids are done, or before.<br />
<br />
Oh my other question, do you need to do these guys in order, as in do you need to be done with the rest of the epic to do these mobs?  I have an hour lunch and if I can, then when I get home I will knock these out. :)  Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Trysbrina67</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The paladins despawn if not aggrod in some way at around (game time) 12pm, Tarnamil (the skelly dude) respawns at like 5pm and you can start the quest again.*<br />
<br />
In order to activate Tarnamil you have to be flagged for this, if you try w/o the flag Tarnamil will basically spit in your face.<br />
<br />
*  This is my personal experience from doing this portion of the epic, your mileage may vary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Thenger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Thank you Trysbrina for the info, guess I will wait till tommorow to give this a try, most likey in the morning which means it will be bot time, just need to figure if I want to bot a warrior, enchanter, druid, shaman and ofcourse Thenger.  I normaly do pretty well playing 3 toons at once, havn't tried 4 really besides just to buff.<br />
<br />
Guess my other question, can they be hamony pulled?  Well the higher level of harmony, my RL girl has a level 70 druid that I can bot, since she likes to sleep in.</div></div><hr />
