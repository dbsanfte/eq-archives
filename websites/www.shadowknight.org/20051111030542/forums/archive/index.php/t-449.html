I do almost all of my hunting solo and have done so for the last 49 levels, but I seem to have some of the crappiest armor possible.  <br />
I am an iksar sk, and this is the stuff that I wear:<br />
<br />
Orc fang earing, spider fang choker, blackened alloy mask, Sarnak Earing of station;<br />
goblin lords ring, bracer of scavenging, (forgot name of gloves, but from halloween gm event), Dreadscale arms, sebilit scale bracer, plat wedding ring;<br />
Tattered mantle, Rygorr Tunic, (forgot name of back item but is from same halloween gm event), (forgot name of belt but is ac 10; 5 str; and 40 mana), Dreadscale legs, Dreadscale boots<br />
<br />
For weapons i use either the noc blade or the greenmist and SBS and in ranger slot is a 5 ac, plus 5 int, plus 5 wis, plus 50 mana piece.<br />
<br />
Now i know most of you are going to laugh at this and first off say go hunt giants and buy better stuff, but I dont' get a chance to play much and really dont have time to sit in the commons and wait for something to come across.  What I am looking for is suggestions on better armor and where it drops.  Mostly stuff that can be done either solo or with maybe one or two other people.  So far I have managed to solo all of the stuff i have or get with at the most one group.  (except the stuff that is player made.)<br />
<br />
Ok, thanks for looking at this and let me know what type of constructive ideas all of you have.  :)<br />

Looks pretty decent to me.   At this point, the only way you're going to get armor upgrades is through raiding or buying.  If you're really worried about your gear, you could go hang out in Icewell with the rest of the 45-50 iksar community and hope to get some Royal Frosted Velium.<br />
<br />
Well, thats not really fair.  Its only 99% of the ones hanging out at the Icewell zone in that are iksar :p</div></div><hr />
