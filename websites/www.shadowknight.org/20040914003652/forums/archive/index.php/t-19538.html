<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Eggborn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Runes don't drop everyday.  SK's in my guild are rare, so I may decide to buy some of my 65 spells.<br />
<br />
What do you think are the most beneficial level 65 sk spells?  What is worth spending my money on?<br />
<br />
I see in the bazaar on my server<br />
touch of inny for 25k<br />
hate 8k<br />
voice 12k<br />
never seen cloak of luclin<br />
<br />
I most certainly have conjure corpse already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Carasak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">imo<br />
1. Touch of Inny<br />
2. Aura of Hate<br />
3. Cloak of Luclin<br />
4. Voice of Thule</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Squigle D'Muerte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Wish I was on your server.  They are all 40k except Voice which is 15K on mine.<br />
<br />
Voice is a raid only spell I have never cast a voice spell on myself and see no reason to start.<br />
<br />
Cloak is nice but hardly a requirement.<br />
<br />
Touch of Innoruk is a good solid spell but (depending on how much you cast life taps) it just an upgrade to the last touch spell so wasn't critical to me.<br />
<br />
Aura of Hate is very sweet.  Rogues will bless you when they realize their ATK is really going up by 125.  Nothing I know of increases ATK by more except disciplines.  Downside is that in a caster group it is useless.<br />
<br />
I would definitely go for Aura first cheapest and argueably the best.  <br />
<br />
I wouldn't even pay 5k for voice unless my guild really needed me to be casting it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Touch of Innoruuk is by far the best.  Aura of Hate is the 2nd best I would say, although unlike what someone else said its useful even in an all caster group, its still a very mana efficent damage increase for you, not as efficent as Torrent of Hate is but ToH doesn't increase your damage as much either.  Cloak of Luclin is good also, probally 3rd best although I can see it being 2nd best for some.  Voice of Thule is trash, the only real benefit to it is if you need to be memming 2 Voices.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vezax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">1 Touch of inny  30k pp<br />
<br />
Great for ae mobs.  I dont remember it once being resisted (neg 500 magic check I think).  I use it for DPS on raids and an emergancy heal for slow healers in groups.  An esential spell if you solo tanking stuff.  Far and away our best 65 spell.<br />
<br />
2 conjure corpse<br />
<br />
Not a rune spell, but imo easily our 2nd best 65 spell.  Its saved me from a lot of stupid corpse runs.<br />
<br />
3 aura of hate   25k pp<br />
<br />
Good spell, too many mobs are disease immune tho =P  Also recast that is longer then duration is bad -_-<br />
<br />
4 cloak of lucilin  10k pp rune mq<br />
<br />
Actually very good spell in a group/solo situation.  Worthless for me in a raid situations, I tend to take brells when I'm going to be doing tanking/pulling or str of tunare when doing dps.<br />
<br />
5 voice of thule dont have, ave price on prexus 15k<br />
<br />
Dont have, and I'm not going to pay the 15k for it people ask on prexus =P.  The only time I ever use Voice is on raids for whom ever is tanking.  <br />
<br />
Id prioritize getting at least touch of inny.  Aura of hate and cloak are pretty good as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Elysea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Is Aura of Hate really all that good?  I don't have it yet, I've still been using Torrent of Hate at level 65.  I grouped with another SK who did use Aura of Hate the other night, and the extra ATK was nice but it wasn't always up, and when it was up it was fading down.  I think I'd take a persistent, low-mana +47 Atk than a higher-mana ATK buff that I have to cast constantly and steadily decreases.  My opinion is pretty uninformed though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Savoline</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Aura of Hate is probably the best one till you get the AAs and ID4 that enhance innoruuk. I hardly find ToI making the difference when the shit hits the fan with only 470 base.<br />
<br />
Voice is kinda nice if you have the extra buffslot and the spellslot for it (i guess), helps when get awesome groupmembers like monks with SoT+Yak125 augment that just refuse to FD agro off =P<br />
Cloak of Luclin is well a selfbuff that gives a little HP, a nice DS and some AC. Something you have always up but hardly notice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">shit, I wish i was on your server, I've only ever seen two of my rune 65 spells for sale, one being voice for 33k+ (which is fucking stupid) and the other being Aura of Hate, only once, for 45k. (Again just greedy people that want my money:( )</div></div><hr />
