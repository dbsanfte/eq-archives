The aggro spells do work quite well though.  I was chaining CD and couldn't keep aggro off a monk in group.   Happened 2 times in a row so I was kinda embarrased when mob would ping pong back and forth between sucsesful taunts.  I then switched to scream spell and mob stuck on me.  Group was way ahead on time so I asked if I could try something on next couple spiders and they said no problem.  CD failed to generate aggro on any spider but worked like a charm on all others.  Same thing with ranger snare. Didn't seem like spiders worry about snare spells since they are spiders and used to webs lol.</div></div><hr />

as with all ldon adventures, radius does play a huge part in agro, so make sure you're standing close.<br />
<br />
the spiders might be one of the mobs that CD does have lower agro on though for whatever reason. the only one i know for sure are the wrulon's in HoH, one CD isn't enough to cover slow, 2 cds will do it though, and all the other mobs in HoH one cd is enough for slow.i'm guessing the spiders might be the same.</div></div><hr />

Then again I always stand on top of the mob and cast CD x2 as a min.  As long as the monk doesn't have ubah proc weapons or one thats dps just strait the hell up smokes my weapon I don't really have an agro loss prob.  Can't say its never happened, but then again the monks weapons and level over me (5 lvls) made a big diff in how hard I had to work for agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vermadas</div><div class="date">12-01-2003, 02:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I noticed this myself.  Anyone know if the spiders are classified as animals?  Because I have somewhat the same problem with the dogs and bears in Rujark.  Kind of like undead mobs have high prox aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Klotar AngedeMorts</div><div class="date">12-01-2003, 02:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have noticed this prior to LDoN.  Mobs that are of a certain type of intelligence (for lack of a better term atm) or animal-like follow different rules, and I have to treat them differently from other mobs to hold aggro the same way.<br />
<br />
Here are a few examples inside and outside of LDoN:<br />
<br />
Wrulons in Halls of Honor.<br />
Spiders in LDoN Mistmoore (but NOT Guk).<br />
Bugs in LDoN Tak.<br />
Bugs in LDoN Guk.<br />
Wolves in LDoN Mir.<br />
Wolves in LDoN Ruj.<br />
Pigs in LDoN Ruj.<br />
Spiders in Plane of Nightmares.<br />
<br />
I don't know how to explain it without coming off looking like I'm imagining things.  But I have 150 LDoN successes (unlocked 4/5 themes) and xp'd in PoN/HoH a lot (have 400+ aa points).<br />
<br />
Certain mobs I have more difficulty with than others, and the only common denominator is that none of these are humanoid looking mobs, they are either insects or animals.  If I can somehow manage to get 2 CD's off on the mob BEFORE the mob hits camp, I have aggro lock.  But if I only get off one CD or if I am not the puller, it's a different story.  If I am not pulling, one CD and one spear will USUALLY do, but if I don't have time to get both of those off, the mob may turn to someone else.<br />
<br />
Any other mob, a live frog, dead frog, sand elf, orc, goblin, observer, various other live and undead mobs -- NO PROBLEM, business as usual: one CD and it doesn't look at anyone else.  Some other mobs, like the examples I listed above, are... different.  I do have a harder (that does not necessarily mean that I am struggling) time to initially gain aggro.  There is a pattern.<br />
<br />
For example... let's say you are in HoH and a monk pulls a wrulon with a shuriken and does little damage (miss or 5 pts or something).  You cast a CD on the wrulon while it's incoming.  The monk stops about 20 feet in front of you but does not FD.  Who do you think the wrulon whacks on?  Yep, not you.  It's whacking the monk.  Now, let's say this time the pull is a Valorian Guard, exact same scenario.  Who do you think the guard whacks on?  Monk, WHAT MONK???  As far as the guard is concerned, there never was a monk.  This is what I mean by different reaction by different types of mobs.</div></div><hr />

Its not just CD either, the whole darkness line and terror seems to also do jack and shit too these mobs, but then again terror doesnt   do shit too anything IMO. <br />
<br />
In my experience best thing to do is get right in the mobs face and fire off a spear of decay and whatever damage you can muster on these mobs ....</div></div><hr />
