<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Destrukter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've noticed that when I cast zevfeer's bite, during the refresh time if I proc mental corruption (can't remember sod) that it makes zevfeer's look as though its refreshed, BUT you still can't cast the spell.  Point being you don't know when u really can cast it again unless you time it from the cast or repeatedly recast until the spell finally works :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lejina Bloodbath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Its a problem with the first gem slot. Been there forever.<br />
<br />
When you proc, the spells with a specially long recast time ungrey and seem to be available again while in fact they arent. Happens only with this gem.<br />
<br />
Mem Zev somewhere else and put in this slot a spell that doesnt have a special recast (ie that is longer than the 2.5sec default recast on all spells) and you wont notice it anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Woah, I did not know this... and yes, I have Zevheer's in slot 1 also.  Good to know!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Keyan Aubaine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yah, that's the reason why i originally put lifetaps in that slot... comes PoP and they turn out to have a recast, it took me a few days for me to remember why it was screwing up lol.<br />
Now of course i'm too used to have my lifetaps in this slot, so i'll live with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Krushum Gudended</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah thats my tap spot as well.  Was thinking of placing clinging dark there when I outgrow Spirit Tap and Drain Spirit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grimknot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I save slot 1 for the what imo is the most important sk spell...FD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Amphitryon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">hmm this could explain the problem i have with Voice of Terror..ive been putting it in the top slot and its a long-recycle time spell</div></div><hr />
