<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Derraj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">so yesterday I was talking to a friend, and he was saying how he had some spyware programs on his computer, and I thought Id see if I had any on mine so he have me a url to where I can find a free program to search and remove the spyware. I start it up, I HAD FUCKING 291 SPYWARE PROGRAMS ON MY COMPUTER. the prgram gave me url to some of the programs, I was thinking if I find out who runs the site could I sue them for invasion of privacy?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jupke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Useless, cause you agreed to the spyware.<br />
<br />
You clicked anwsered yes on some popups or you aren't blocking cookies or you just installed a program with &quot;spyware&quot; in and then all you have to do is read the small print somewhere hidden.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Unless you didn't agree to the spyware which you almost certainly did, you can't sue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Laronx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Get Mozilla if you want to look at that much Pr0n</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Derraj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I don't remember agreeing to any spyware shit, 3 were porn dialers I never downloaded rest were just monitoring what I did online and acouple took any usernames, paswords, personal info and credit card numbers I would put in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jupke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You agreed to download certain programs/cookies etc...that is enough, that is why it is called spyware, they are &quot;part&quot; of those programs. <br />
<br />
Like the Divx-drivers (those with spyware) wont run unless gator is installed.<br />
<br />
PS. Cookies are considered spyware too, so about half of the spyware really isn't spyware but just cookies that track your surfing behavour.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">yeah it's fucked up, I had like 250 registry entries / programs the first time I scanned a while back, one of them even changed my winsock file so that when adaware removed it I couldn't connect to the internet at all, had to un-quarantine it and check adaware's FAQ to get around it.  best thing you can do is update and run adaware and spybot s &amp; d every few weeks, or more often if you have especially hairy palms :D   sometimes they find stuff that the other missed, can't hurt to use both.  no sense getting mad, there really isn't much you can do.   FWIW I think I got a large chunk of them from Imesh, a shitty p2p program which I don't use anymore, thankfully.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Derraj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have Spybot s &amp; d, where can I get adaware?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">My quote in Derraj's sig has been replaced by a newtank quote?  God, I need a 9mm tylenol.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah - quit using Kazaa for your porn and you won't have such a big problem...google works just fine.</div></div><hr />

Not gonna find any really decent video clips though, just those 5 second ones that are supposed to make you want to pay money for longer ones...  Also no mp3s or, for us broadband users, movies, to be found on the web either.<br />
<br />
Kazaa sucks because of the spyware and distributed computing contracts they have - that's right they actually use your computer (and 4 million others) to set up a distributed computing network, the services of which they sell... But Kazaalite doesn't and has no spyware.<br />
<br />
AdAware is at www.lavasoftusa.com - don't forget to update the spyware definitions files and any other updates needed in both programs.  They each have an intuitive interface for doing it, just a few clicks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Rukgut</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">*makes note*  Google... for porn...<br />
<br />
Uh, yeah.  Adware is bad, m'kay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I was kidding on the google, jeez now we got's porn nazis! <br />
<br />
mmmmmmmm porn nazis</div></div><hr />
