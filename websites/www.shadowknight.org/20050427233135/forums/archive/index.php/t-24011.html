<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Leviothyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Everyone has told me to choose the race that I would enjoy the most...I am interested in Dark Elf's and Humans. (big difference right?) I also know that I want to be an SK...<br />
 Some quick info: I like to solo and group depending on the LFG status on the server.<br />
and I want some nice Roleplaying opportunities.<br />
  Just wondering what of the above races would fit into the roles above better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Culdahl1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Play what you think looks good...stats are useless</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">They will have the similair playability in the situations you descrribed.<br />
<br />
Humans are much more unique and will have less faction issues (not that that weighs heavily anymore)<br />
<br />
Since running the tutorial is pretty quick, I'd suggest you give them both a spin and see which you prefer...might try other races too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nbakwe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yep, pick what you like. In short order it won't really make any real difference play wise. You will wind up compensating for the small variations in race. <br />
<br />
Well, except for gnomes. They'll always be considered a foodstuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Leviothyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for your help everyone...decided on DE- sounds fun and a challenge also...thanks again!<br />
<br />
* hey Nbakwe, just a quick question, how do you make a sig like that, but with a link when you click on it. I want to put a magelo into the sig, but cant figure out how. Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Have fun being a smurf.<br />
<br />
I sent you the other help you asked for.<br />
<br />
PM me if you need further assistance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Role playing opportunity?  DE sks are a dime a dozen.  There are BILLIONS OF THEM. How much fun can it be to be a_dark_elf_shadowknight0537 ?<br />
<br />
Humans, however, are extraordinarily rare.  They might have even put in the human xp bonus that was supposed to be there (probably not).  And they have the highest starting charisma of all the sks!<br />
<br />
Reroll and put all yer stats into chr on a human sk.  Not a Joke.  Innoruuk is a boring god, go cazic thule.<br />
<br />
As a DE, you will be following in the footsteps trod by many other people.  As a cazic worshipping human, you will be blazing trails trod by only a few.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, go gnome and be hated by everyone, even your bretheren sk.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Human SK's can be Innoruuk (Freeport) or Bertoxxulous (Qeynos). Erudites worship Cazic Thule, not humans.</div></div><hr />
