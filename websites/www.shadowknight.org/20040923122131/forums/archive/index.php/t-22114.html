<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Askeer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Not gonna go into the details of the new quest, but if you have old VP key, and a small raid force, it takes 30 minutes to complete new key all within skyfires and it's really easy to figure out. Also the reward for those who did old key quest is that the key is actually a 30 hp/mana augment.<br />
<br />
Once inside VP, graphics aren't changed, and the spirit of the zone is the same. Still can't gate, but there's a zone out right inside tho.<br />
Trash is very easy to kill, probably hard ldon lvl, if that.<br />
We've killed Silvering and Hoshkar with 21 in raid, and got crappy VT / elem level loot.<br />
Phara Dar's door was locked, so we figured we had to kill the other dragons first, but since it was late and some people left, we wiped to Nexona, who is quite tougher than both hoshkar and silverwing.<br />
<br />
One very interesting thing to note (and that's why I'm posting actually) is that the faction given by the mobs inside is insane.<br />
I went from RTA to max Ally in 2 hours in the following factions :<br />
- antonican bards<br />
- mayong mistmoore<br />
- venril sathir</div></div><hr />

<br />
Think ill try and get 4 groups together either after VT tonight or do it in the morning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>tyrrax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just to clarify, you can now gate out of Veeshan's Peak.  I poked my head in after getting my key and gated out no problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vyrion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You don't have to gate out of VP anymore, there is a dragon statue to the left of zone-in that ports you out to skyfire.<br />
<br />
Not a bad little aug for free either.</div></div><hr />

<br />
my guild killed it no prob with 24 or so in raid and me tanking (most of the time).<br />
a VT / elem guild would probably need to double that number and have warriors tanking.<br />
<br />
<br />
Can you still do the old vp quest to get augment?<br />
<br />
Not 100% sure but I think you can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zeeta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Easy is a relative remark - especially if you are 11K + SK  :D <br />
<br />
Dragon hits for 1800 and AE rampage.  2K 4 slot AE dispell with a huge knock back. Very difficult to keep junk buffs up unless you have 4 insta cast items stashed away.<br />
<br />
He is a belly dragon - so all casters need to stand right under him soaking up all the AEs. Not difficult to keep a solid tank alive against him - the challenge is keeping your dps alive.  Fully slowable btw.<br />
<br />
Easy for guilds with much Time and GoD gear - but then again, the loot I saw linked is - at best - twink gear for these guilds (125 HP/Mana, FT2 etc)<br />
<br />
Nice addition for the early elemental guilds - and much much easier access if you already have the old VP key.<br />
<br />
I'm looking forward to the quests and items which is supposedly being given out by Nex, Hosh etc.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>DConquest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Heh, have fun finding them up to get the quests and turn in?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>ghoule</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The details of the raid are sorta sketchy, but a friend of mine who had moved to Veeshan several months back reported that his guild fielded 49 people to give it a shot. A drake outside VP has several guards around him, they killed all the guards (guardian wurms I think) and the drake becomes targetable. Hail him and he has you run to each of the 4 dragon statues in Skyfire and has someone click on them, he also gives each hailer a 4 slot tome for a combine for the key. Once this is done a Named will spawn somewhere in Skyfire. When hes killed, he drops 48 dragons bloods that supposedly are in chests. One dragons blood and your old VP key = augment and new key. As far as the new key I dunno, Kiz had his old one. From some of the stuff he linked, it seems very on par with elemental level loot, the raid force didnt wipe once inside, but it did struggle to do the named, apparently hes pretty tough.<br />
There is a thread on it on the shaman page, has some good links to other sites that are working out the details.<br />
EDIT: found the shaman link http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=22486</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Finally a way to fix my VS faction.  It's only been three years.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Vyrion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Can you still do the old vp quest to get augment? <br />
<br />
After you finish the old key quest you have to kill Harla Dar's Shade in skyfire, and turn in book for blood and combine for new key (aug).<br />
<br />
Apparently, unless you have the old key done already its much easier just to do the new quest. I saw alot of people farming their key in only a couple of hours after killing dragon. After word gets out tho, I bet these spawns will be highly contested.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>velin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Can you multi quest the key (and if so how)?  i have old key and friend of mine said i can use his book he got off the dragon.  thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />
