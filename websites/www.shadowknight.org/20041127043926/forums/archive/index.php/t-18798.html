<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KereithisFV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've only done about 10 adventures, and I have been making the groups- I know enough people to round up at least 5 in the level range.<br />
<br />
Anyway- I usually like to keep myself on the low end of the spectrum but all the mobs still con dark blue to me except on assasinations where boss is usually red/yellow.<br />
<br />
I've consistantly been getting 2-2.5 yellows per acventure.  Seems to me that with the aug drops/loot split that these are damn near the best I can do atm.  <br />
<br />
Anyone else agree?  Or have input on what xp is like when all group members same level?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Had a 60-65 group the other night, I was lowest in group at 60, 2 65's, 2 62's and a 61, I got around 6 blue total.<br />
<br />
Our usual, with like level range (say 60-62 range) is around 2-4 blue per adventure.  If we dip a little lower and broaden the range, xp decreases significantly.  In a 57-61 group, I picked up around 1.5 blue for a long adventure (went full 90 minutes) at lvl 59.<br />
<br />
Of course, xp at 59 seemed to go much slower than lvl 60 xp, and 61 is shaping up to be a little bit slow but not nearly as bad as 59 all things considered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kromglon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ya im lucky to get 3 blues at 54 in a ldon. Usually though Im above the average in the group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thakalas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Level 65 dungeons (average over ~62.5) is about the same as tier 2 PoP xp.  Hard 65s are supposed to be about the same as elemental, I'm not in elementals so couldn't say.  Not sure what lower dungeons are, haven't done any of those.  I usually get about a half AA each adventure in a 4 man group.  <br />

Of course, xp at 59 seemed to go much slower than lvl 60 xp, and 61 is shaping up to be a little bit slow but not nearly as bad as 59 all things considered. <br />
<br />
60 is still a 'half level' or whatever you want to call it.  People screamed when they tried to change it before PoP so they left it as it was.  60 takes about half as long as the levels on either side of it, it's a beautiful thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Arlevia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I did all LDoN adventures from level 61 to 65. Each adventure yeilded about 10-15% regular experience. This varied depending on the group configuration, and the number of MOBs we killed.<br />
I also dualbox a 65 cleric, and he received 30-40% AA per adventure. Ussually my group had an average level of 63+. Sometimes though, it would be less. (I had a 58 beastlord friend i adventured with a lot, brought the average down). when this happened, i simply selected a hard adventure and that effectively bumped up the adventure to level 65.  I did do a couple of level 60 adventured and i was lucky to receive 5-8% regular experience. We sliced through the mobs though, pulling 3-4 at once.<br />
It was common to go through adventures and receive no augments at all, and other adventures have them drop like candy. Most of the adventures i did were assasinations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">XP in PoP is better than LDoN.<br />
<br />
Loot in LDoN is better than (non-named) PoP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>TelimTor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">At 56, no matter what end of the group I'm on, I seem to get around 10-12%.  <br />
<br />
Back when LDoN first hit, I was in my early 40's... getting 40% xp per run!  Amazing... has it been nerfed or did it just slow down so much being mid-50's?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>StPatrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well, not that it is really matters, I'm only lvl 26 SK :) But I got a good xp in LDoN - 2 yellow bubbles with a group of 23-28, with Hard adv. So it is still good :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zakton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I was the low man in a LDoN with my wizzy alt and he made almost 4 bubs of orange exp at 44.   On the other hand when I do adventures at 63 I get a few blue bubs of exp even if I am the low man or the highest level.  Tier 2 is much better exp for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kaleyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ok, about this, maybe someone can explain a group I had the other night.  Was in MM LDoN, group level ranged from 55-57, with only one person being 57, and I'm 56.  Ok, so we did a slaughter kill 54, easily won so we killed 54 mobs right, well I got barely 3% xp...can anyone tell me what the heck happened as to how I'd get so little xp?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Astrakan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">My bet:  You didn't remember correctly what your exp was before the adventure started.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kaleyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">No, I remembered, because I just got done with my 18th AA ding with the HoH group I was in before this crawl so had 20%xp when I started, with the second to last mob, so the 53rd, I went to 23% and stayed there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Khat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Last week or so one of the adventures I was on netted me 5% xp.<br />
<br />
Another after that, 20%.<br />
<br />
The adventure that dinged me to 62 a couple days ago, 12%.<br />
<br />
Different dungeons, different people, different levels, different mission types.<br />
These are certainly factors as to what you can expect to gain xp-wise but haven't given it more than a passing thought nor have I seen a definitive post anywhere that nails it down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Walil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">At 65 doing AA on Normal Risk it's about 1% per kill. It seems pretty flat. The simplest reason you will get varied experience is based on what kind of adventure you are doing. If it's a low collect you're going to get less experience because you don't need to kill as much, if you do say a slaughter 50 you are of course going to get more experience because you willl need to kill more mobs. <br />
<br />
I tanked my first two hards last night and the experience was much better. I would say on the order of about 3-4 times as much. I'm not elemental flagged so I can't make that comparison but it seemed to be a bit better than BoT. If you have a good crew I highly suggest moving to hard missions if you haven't yet. My group was SK, Bard, Cleric, BST, Mage, Druid. All of our gear is from BoT and LDoN merchants.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Might just be me...<br />
<br />
Certain Themes seem to have more exp (guk, Miraguls).  Certain dungeons within a theme seem to have more exp.</div></div><hr />

Your level range indicates that you'd get a level 55 adventure, meaning you'd face monster levels of 49-51.  None of those are within 4 levels of you which is the sweet spot for experience.  Could be you randomly just got a lot of low level pops so that a majority of what you faced was level 49.  I'm not 56 yet so I don't know how experience flows at that level, but 3% shouldn't be out of the question if you're just killing the minimum number of mobs, being on the high end of the curve (i.e. closer to the break point to the next dungeon tier), and getting an adventure with low level pops in it.  If you want more experience, bump up a tier (by getting a hard dungeon or get in groups where the average level is greater than 57.833) then you'll be in a level 60 adventure and face monster levels of 54-56.  All close blues and a few whites should be sweet experience for you.  You said it yourself that the adventure was won easily.</div></div><hr />
