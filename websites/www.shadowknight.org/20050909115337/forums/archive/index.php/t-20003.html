<br />
Wondering how to set up my comp for dual boxxing.  Getting a second account shortly and I was wondering a couple things:<br />
<br />
Should I just copy the eq directory (so as to not have to patch)? If so- where to copy to...<br />
<br />
Easier to use EQwindows than built in feature?  if so- how do I set that up?<br />
<br />
Going Shaman after reading all the threads on the note of best partner, but was also wondering if anyone thinks any shaman race is better than the rest.  Leaning toward frog for rp reasons, she's going to be my Iksar main's slave...</div></div><hr />

You can, but it just takes up extra harddisk space and forces you to download each patch twice.  And you could copy it wherever you wanted to.   Which directory you install(or copy) EQ into has nothing to with anything.  As long as you remember &lt;i&gt;where&lt;/i&gt; you install/copy it, so you can find and run it, you're fine.<br />
<br />
Easier to use EQwindows than built in feature?  if so- how do I set that up?<br />
Some say yes, some say no.  You set it up by going to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eqwindows.com/&quot;&gt;the EQW site&lt;/a&gt; and installing it into the EQ directory you wish to use it with.<br />
<br />
Personally, I didn't bother with copying my EQ directory.  I just have the one directory, and it does have EQW installed in it.  When I play, I run the standard EverQuest.   If I need to box another character, I'll keep the one instance of EQ running, and fire up EQW.  Works perfectly for me.<br />
<br />
If you run into any problems with not being able to alt+tab between windows, follow the instructions on the second post of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shadowknight.org/forums/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=16520&quot;&gt;this thread&lt;/a&gt;.<br />
<br />

Troll or Iksar would be my choice... the more regen, the more canni is offset.  I'd probably choose troll simply so I could use a JBB, but both are good choices.</div></div><hr />

I keep three windows open and while it can be a bit annoying at times you soon learn to work it in a somewhat efficient manner.<br />
<br />
It does take alot of Ram though, so make sure to have atleast 512mb's worth. <br />
<br />
I would also suggest Troll for your shaman, they can use plate so it's easier to get some decent armour for them. The iksars pretty much have to wait till later to get geared out.<br />
<br />
As was said it's much easier just to keep one EQ folder and have both windows run on the same config. Atleast unless you have some reason to want to load some models on one box but not on the other.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Assuming Windows XP here...<br />
<br />
Download windows compatitility toolkit...instructions here: http://www.shadowknight.org/forums/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=19523<br />
<br />
That lets you easily alt-tab out of EQ.  EQW is NOT needed.<br />
<br />
You can then start a second instance of EQ, from the same directory.  All you need is a second account.<br />
<br />
I run two instances at times, with 2G of RAM, 1.7G processor, and a 128M video card.  It's not bad in normal circumstances.  Raiding is painful, I don't do that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zenobie</div><div class="date">02-13-2004, 10:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I run every day 2 EQW, sometimes 3. I have 3 different directories, it means I have to patch three times (but no biggie, it takes like 5 minutes). I prefer to use different directories because I use different options on my hydra.<br />
<br />
Main is all models enabled, full graphic options and sound in 1024x768, others EQW are no sound no models low graphic level in 800x600.<br />
<br />
It is very important to disable the sound in your others EQ, helps a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NorrynNoir</div><div class="date">02-13-2004, 10:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">EQ Windows is a waste of time, you don't need it. you can run multiple instances of eq without it and it's less buggy. you just need to download the application compatibility tool kit. then you can alt-tab out of eq, once you put it into windowed mode by hitting alt-enter.<br />
<br />
the guy who wrote eq windows stopped updating / fixing it last spring or so i believe because eq can window itself now.<br />
<br />
from what i've seen ram is the big issue with multiple eq instances. i can do it on my laptop which only has a 64 meg video card but only after i upped the ram to a gig from 512.</div></div><hr />
