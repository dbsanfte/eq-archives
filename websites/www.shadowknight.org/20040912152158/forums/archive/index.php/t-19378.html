<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gobb from Luclin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Yesterday we had a small raid force online, so we went after Vindi and then did the Hedge Quest in PoN.  On Vindi, I managed to get off an HT of just over 8200.  I was very proud of it, and it seemed to be pretty big at the time.<br />
<br />
On the hedge quest boss, I waited till he was down to under 5% did another HT - this time 9000 points exactly.  I was flabbergasted.  I had no magi focus gear, no ID gear on, and no bards in the event with us.  If this is a new 'feature' that the devs don't know about, please delete this thread asap :)  If there's a more rational explanation for it, please enlighten me.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Welcome to SK.org! I would like to be the first to congratulate you, this site is an excellent source of information. You were right to come here with your question, and since this is your first time here, let me introduce you to some of our mods:<br />
<br />
Brael, the nymph humping psycho<br />
Nocifer, the sword and board SK we've dubbed the faction king<br />
Mantisrose, the most popular SK on SK.org, if your criterion is who's on ignore. OK, he's not really a mod.<br />
<br />
Take a look around, click on some links, like the popular Arena, or the less used Armoury or Spells and Skills. And, there's always the Rant section. I'm sure you'll enjoy your stay here.</div></div><hr />
