<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kroog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've spent several hours in Iceclad killing dire wolves, but have been unsuccessful in getting the dire wolf stalker to spawn. I had a tracker with me at all times to check the tracking list. I must have killed hundreds of dire wolves so far, but no luck. I spent most of my time between the dragon bridge and the druid/wizard portal.<br />
<br />
Can anyone give me some information on the exact spawn location of the dire wolf stalker, or maybe some tips on how to get him spawn more reliably? I have all the other pieces of the map already, just need this last piece to complete the quest.<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xygoz Shadowreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My experience with DWS...so i grab KEI and just slaughter every wolf near the druid port/the big black blocks. I gotta go afk...hit FD and run off. I come back...naked...in the nexus...WTF? Fizzle SHIT AND THEN insult to injury i was killed by the stalker himself. OMFG im pissed now. Druid guildy ports cleric guildy there i get rez. Im recovering from effects and explaining to them what happened. Druid tells me uhh dude hes on track want me to get him? Druid pulls him back-I proceed to rip him a new one.<br />
