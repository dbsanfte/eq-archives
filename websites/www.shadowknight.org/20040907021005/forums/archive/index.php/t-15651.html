<br />
I am two parts from epic (hide and chick from hole) should i bother finishing?<br />
<br />
Do give me that &quot;if you have to ask then no&quot; shit either</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vaelenu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Obviously that's a superior weapon,  so you wouldn't pursure the epic for dps. I personally wouldn't waste my friends/guilds time pursuing something for RP/looks value alone, but having said that if you score a hide it won't take too long to go through the rest of it. Maybe put it on the back burner and take xp groups to Hate when you have down time. If you manage to pick up a hide then I'd say definitely finish it off when you have the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shintou Shinai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What she said above, espically considering that you are only hide and Kyrenna away from it.<br />
<br />
If you happen to get a hide and the only SK there that can loot go ahead and finish it. You won't regret it, even if you gotta bank it.<br />
<br />
People STILL ask me 'wow whats that sword'<br />
<br />
And the battles you have left shouldn't take too much time out of your guilds/friends day. <br />
<br />
So yeah, if you happen to get a hide.. why not complete it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'd finish it anyways, but it's your call.  I'm using my own epic less and less these days, but I do think it's an important rite of passage for SK's.  If you don't care about that shit, don't finish it =p.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vaelenu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Why is getting lucky on random loot a rite of passage for an SK? I've been to a zillion hate raids and never seen a hide drop - how does that make me less of an SK? Sorry but our epic is not about being brave, powerful, old school, determined, or whatever; it's about getting lucky on a random loot spawn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i agree, and thats why ive been trying my ass off to sell my soul leech MQ :p<br />
i have no idea how much to sell it for tho =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>yadaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">hey zia, if u want to, do your epic, its like a trophy that u have accomplish somethign real hard :D if not, sell me some mq lol O_o<br />
<br />
-yadaf-</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>zruky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I say go for it.  Its pretty much done, shouldnt take you too much longer.  Your call.  The horn is quite superior, but were you REALLY gonna use the epic that much anyways (cosmetic aspects aside).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Apokx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Do give me that &quot;if you have to ask then no&quot; shit either <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Well,obviously if you have to ask then don't.<br />
<br />
Frankly if I would have had the horn before my epic I wouldn't have completed it.<br />
<br />
In fact,I still don't have a horn,and I use my epic because it IS my best weapon.<br />
<br />
As far as I am concerned the fewer epics there are the more mine means to me.<br />
<br />
After a 3 month break,logged in 2 days ago and immeadiately got tells/inspects over it.<br />
<br />
-Gimped but proud 56 sk~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Goregan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Vinnayeny send me a tell in game if i dont contact you first, i  migth be interested in Soul Leech MQ if the price is right. Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Fenrix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Thanx for that pix Ziagwa....nyyoink!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Apokx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I &lt;3 Ziagwa's sig.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Flauer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I have the horn as well. It does look ubah, and nice dps =)<br />
<br />
As far as I am concerned the fewer epics there are the more mine means to me. <br />
<br />
But i have to agree, I still long to hold that baby in my hands and get some dark red blood splattered all over with it.<br />
I have the hide and BoA.. jus need that Soul Leech...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Khat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Avril is much prettier, I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Drakang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I love the dummies book in the sig.   I don't know how many warriors and paladins I have schooled in aggro management done by a class that can do it right.   Course the sad part is the number of SK's that I meet that still have no clue how to get aggro fast and keep it.<br />
<br />
Had my first rough time keeping aggro last night in LDON.  Had to kill 56 mobs so were moving fast and had 2 65th wizards and a necro unloading full tilt.  Course I think I can still count on one hand the time that I lost aggro long enough that it actually mattered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Oopsies</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Ziagwa, Please, Bless us with the beauty of your pics :D i can barely contain myself :P</div></div><hr />
