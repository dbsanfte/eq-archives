<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>draknorx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">One thing that was really bothered me is the knights holy/unholsy steed . The only difference between ours and the purchesed one is 5 AA insta-cast and 100k and 3 second cast ( at least i think ) . Can someone else tell me of a AA ability that you can buy ? i can't think of one and the 0 cast time for the hose really isn't that much of a difference . Couldn't the devs put a bit more into a 5 AA ability ??? I mean there or lots of things they could do to make it worth it . For instance how about it doesn't eat/drink , or gives a 20 ATK while mounted , mabye your trusty steed would venture into dungouns with you ( BTW i loved haveing it while it was glitched and allowed knights to use horses inside ) . Am i the only one  who feels like there should be just a little bit more for our horse ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
    * Provides you with the power to call the ultimate unholy steed to your side<br />
    * Movement rate is similar to most expensive store-bought horse<br />
    * Insta-cast, outdoor only, takes a moment to accelerate to full speed<br />
    * Cost: 5<br />

unless it needs to be updated</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>draknorx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">yeah i was using that until it really started to bug me cause it didn't look right , i actually thought it was 6 , then i used that mazaing tool called search that i've heard so much about ( =P to the search nazi's )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Drakonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">6aa to the best of my knowledge.<br />
<br />
Its faster than the buyable 103k one, second only to the Emp/Seru horses.<br />
<br />
As for gaining boosts of it... no need, it serves its purpose - gets you from A to B in a fraction of the time it would take to run it on foot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>DConquest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Let's see... you can spend 5aa on a Horse ( 5 - 7 hours exp time ), or try to round up 100k+ bypassing any other upgrades you could of got for that amount of cash?  In reality though, the Knight horse is the best in the game...  You can summon it on a CR, Bard speed, and instant cast time.  Very very very much worth the AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Saelaru Valsharen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I wouldn't be without mine... and it's 5 aa's ... purchased my horse for the 23rd aa ding i made.... not a wise thing, but hell, I just wanted that damn horse :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>draknorx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">the whole point of this thread isn't the fact that the horse is usefull but that one of our AA abilities can be basicly bought by anyone .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Rhowne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I don't mind.  In fact, it's more enjoyable to watch others race by on a fast horse and know they spent 100k just for that, when I only spent 5 AA.  The only thing I dislike about the Horse is that it no longer works indoors - I think there is a perfectly justifiable reason for my death charger to come to me in the depths of some murky dungeon (even if the practical use of a horse there is severely limited).<br />
<br />
I would prefer a unique look to the horse, but then again I think every SK would.  (Both SK and Paladin horses should have unique looks and possibly particle effects on the hooves/face, depending).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kizzestra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I would rather spend 5aa on my steed than 100kpp on it any day, end of story.<br />
<br />
My only complaint about the steed is the lame graphic. Paladins should get the unicorn or some similar graphic and we should get the nightmare graphic or undead mount from PoNB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>draknorx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">again this isn't about a plat issue , assuming you had a unlimited amount of plat , you can basicly buy our AA ability minus the instacast and no need of a bridle . I like most of you have posted bought my horse when i was first able to . But i'm just trying to show that if for instance mana burn was avaible for 100K would you buy it ? how about SoS ? ramapage ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
You answered your own question.  Unlimited plat dosen't enter the equasion since no one has unlimited plat.  Even if you had an insane amount of plat, why waste 103k of it when you can buy a better horse for 5AA?  To even have that much cash, you'd have to play the game one hell of a lot, so you'd likely have a lot of AA points anyway.<br />

That's a whole different kettle of fish.  A horse is merely a way to cut down transport time, or for casters, to allow them to med without &quot;sitting agro&quot; (The latter dosen't even require a 103k horse, you can just take a cheap slow horse for it).  The other 3 things would be unbalancing to the class structure if they were buyable for plat, whereas a horse is not.  Besides, Manaburn and Rampage are considered useless by their respective classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>shadowblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Ummmm unholy steed costs 6 aa :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Silence</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">first its 5 aas,  second its faster than the bought horses, and most bards ( short of the fof aa n puretone) the horse is worth far more aa's than 5,  it doesnt need any improvements, maybe that no food thing but thats what metabolisms for</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Dragantis Xy`Rath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Personally, I just want a better graphic. SHD and PAL alike. We should have the nightmare graphics and paladins should have a balding man in bondage.<br />
<br />
The speed is fine.<br />
The cost is fine.<br />
The comparison between bought and exp is fine. <br />
<br />
The bought horse is still slower than ours and there is no question about whether or not I would pay the money or the AA. If you are an SK or PAL then you are nuts if you buy a horse. Give me the graphics and I would be happy. I wouldn't mind the food thing, but I have innate metab3 for that. The dungeon thing would be cool but not nescesary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jorren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Oh, I love the idea of particle effects around the Hooves and maybe the eyes or nostrils....great idea.</div></div><hr />
