I'm new to EQ so I'm not doing any twinking.  I'm currently level 11 and I've been able to sell bone chips and have about 200 plat saved.  I have my 1hs and 2hs maxed.  I was wondering if it was worth it for me to try to max 1hb and 2hb at this point in time given my financial status.  If so, what should I use to raise them?  Or do I even need to worry about these skills with a shadowknight?  Thanks for any advice you can give me.<br />

nice little weapon to hold you over until something super nice comes along.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Droyt</div><div class="date">04-19-2002, 12:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a level 53 human SK and from the start I raised all five weapon skills (1hb, 2hb, 1hs, 2hs, piercing).  My reasoning was simple;  I would feel terrible if I ever obtained a great weapon and had no skill in it.<br />
<br />
I worked hard at it, and now all weapon skills are maxed.  Just got an Etched Velium War Lange 30 dmg 35 piercer, and with my maxed skill, I used it right away and improved my damage output.  Without proper skill, my damage output would have been reduced dramatically, making it dangerous for myself and my group.</div></div><hr />

I've found that Slashing weapons are much more expensive than equivalent blunt / piercers - with piercers coming in the cheapest.<br />
<br />
Keep you eyes open for a Centi Warspear, this is an excellent weapon with 20 damage and 30 delay with some useful stats and can be had very cheaply - i got mine for just 150pp!</div></div><hr />

cept now that i hit 51, all skills are going up again slowly yay</div></div><hr />

PS: Lots of great weapons that are pierce, 1hs/1hb/2hs/2hb out there for you to look forward to.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is this from a quest or can I buy and how much should it go for?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fycellia</div><div class="date">04-22-2002, 12:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, the MOSS is from a quest. The quest is entirely in East commons, go there with 500 pp, and send this /auction WTB moss. prepare for a flood of tells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shadon</div><div class="date">04-22-2002, 01:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The price differce depending on server. I personally have never seen a MoSS for 500...more like 700-1k on AB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scorpis</div><div class="date">04-23-2002, 04:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Moss isn't from a quest.. it's dropped in COM by the reavers (they also drop throneblade).. Moss is a nice weapon, I used mine to lvl 54 or so until i got major upgrades flowing to me (Noct Blade, 30/35 pierce, got a soulbinder too, finally got an AP at 55.. used it to lvl 58 when i got massive dragonclaw shard, then i got what you see in magelo profile)...<br />
<br />
You want to max your skills while you can.. i benefited from doing it earlier<br />
<br />
If you think there arent any good 1hb out there take a gander at these:<br />
<br />
Eye of the Rigtorgn  -  1hb<br />
Magic lore nodrop (etc etc)<br />
25dam/25del 10sta 100hp 25mana... SK only too.  (from gozz in west tov)<br />
<br />
and there's another 1hb from west tov from telk called Black rock maul of crushing.. it's sk only too and 23/23 + stats<br />
<br />
alot of nice pierce wepons too (lance of thunder for example (i got it the same day as i did the rigtorgn.. damn i'm a guild twink)<br />
<br />
anywho.. lesson needs to be learned to max all skills as early as possible then you wont be piercing for 100 with a 52 damage weapon</div></div><hr />

Don't tell anyone but you can max yer weapon skills so early in life its not funny. The secret? Go find your friendly local Soul Binder, bring your plethora of weapons, stand behind and to the side of him/her, and bring the pain. ;)<br />
<br />
So long as they con blue to you, you can just turn on auto-attack, and walk away. Come back and have one skill maxed. Rinse, repeat, blah blah blah (famous quote heh).<br />
<br />
 I have to try this with a twink to see just what level they are, but hey they were green to me @ 53 so I dunno what their approx level is.<br />
<br />
Just an idea to go try, so have fun.</div></div><hr />

I use, more often than not, a 1HB weapon.  I have a shield fetish, okay? :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gash</div><div class="date">04-24-2002, 10:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm going to go out on a limb here and advocate against spending a lot of time and effort training all your skills up early, and rather do it when (if) you need them.  Here's my experience:<br />
<br />
When I was moving through the early levels, I decided to just focus on 2-handed weapons.  I liked the harder hitting weapons, and figured it'd be part of my &quot;character&quot;, to use 2-handed weapons exclusively.<br />
<br />
Well, along comes Telk, in ToV.  Silly dragon drops a 23/23 1HB, nodrop, and I'm the only one there who can use it.  I already had my epic at that point, so I was a little dubious about when it'd be useful, although I had a nice shield (Atrementous) to go with it.<br />
<br />
My 1HB skill was pitifull.  However, I had gobs of unused training points, so plugged about 50 into 1HB, and then went hunting.  2 days(RL, not played) later my skill was maxed.  I thought, &quot;Damn, that was easy.  :P  &quot;<br />
<br />
Since then I've also learned what situations it's better to use that hammer in instead of the epic, and thus I get use out of both.<br />
<br />
One thing I'll admit, that the low delay of that hammer really cut down the time to train.  If the delay were closer to 50, then it might have taken me 4 or 5 days (which, IMO, isn't a big deal).<br />
<br />
Just some thoughts...  I know most disagree...  I think it's probably what some would call &quot;six and one half-dozen of the other&quot;.   :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Velnarin</div><div class="date">04-24-2002, 12:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">MAX THEM ALL.<br />
<br />
lol, I had my 1h and 2h slashing maxed out... at level 39 I got a Soulfiend Lance (quest).  My piercing sucked, so had to work it all the way up.  At like 42 or 43 I got a MoSS for 1k.  GREAT weapon for the price.  My 1h blunt was totally pitiful... worked it up in about 2 or 3 nights.<br />
<br />
So yesterday, looking at my skills... 1h blunt, 1h slashing, 2h slashing, piercing are all at 200.  I'm looking for a good 2h weapon cause my MoSS isn't so great for fearkiting junk.  What do I get?!?!?  A freaking Deathbringer's Rod.  2h blunt.  The weapon isn't bad at 30/40, no stats.  My 2h blunt was at 3.  Got it up to 45 or so last night, but needs more work before I go solo with it.  I just couldn't believe it... at least now all my weapon skills will be maxed out.<br />
<br />
BTW, I always use SK only weapons I've noticed.  For one, I love the fact that they're SK only.  Two, they're cheap as hell.  A weapon with similar ratio to a MoSS would be at least 3x as much if not more if it were usable by a warrior or ranger.  As for the DB rod, I saw a velium brawl stick I think, same damage delay going for 3k.  I paid 900pp for the DB rod.  :)  Now if only I could get a Sword of Pain...</div></div><hr />

 <br />
For example,I've got a Journeyman's stick (procs Tash),a sporali defender's blade,and a few other bits and pieces. I like using them all-the stick's godlike for improving solo spelluse (see the post in the Arena about the guy who soloed a WW dragon), some days you want quick weapons to help out the aggro/procs (I use a nice fast piercer for this),some days you just want to sit back and lay in the big hits (2handers) in a party.<br />
 <br />
Given,my standard is 1HS/shield,but everything's useful in the right hands.</div></div><hr />
