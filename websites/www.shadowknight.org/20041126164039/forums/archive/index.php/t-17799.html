<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gandalf Istari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings.<br />
<br />
I have recently created a Troll SK as an alt (my main is a wizard) and am working on PLing him (I have my wife's 54 druid for this) and was wondering if anyone could offer some tips or suggestions on places that would yield maximum amount of exp. I'm particularly looking for some out of the way zones, as I am 2-boxing the druid to PL my SK and don't like dealing with a ton of tells or newbies running trains around or whatnot.<br />
<br />
Currently my SK is lvl 25, and his gear includes Fungi Tunic, Swiftblade of Zek (for sword and shield combo) and Reaver (to work on 2hs) for weapons, with RBB for haste item (probabaly grabbing a CoF, CoM, or CCoM soon to replace that). I have focused on hp gear at these levels until I get him to 50+. Currently he has at lvl 25 about 1700 hp from his gear set up unbuffed. With temperence or Druid hp buff he is around 2300-2500 hp.<br />
<br />
Anyone have suggestoins on where to take him for some PL loving? From lvl 14 to lvl 25 I did the Sarnak fort in LOIO with ease, pulling 3-6 sarnaks at a whack for very fast exp (went from 14-25 in about 6 hours), having picked that zone because it is mostly empty these days and I was familiar with it. Looking to broaden my horizons at this point and want to take into consideration ZEM as well as relative emptiness of zones for PLing. I know everyone raves about Paludal, but to be honest on my server the place is filled with people 24/7 and so I'm looking for something a bit more out of the way.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any suggestions!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>TelimTor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">At that level, with that gear, I'd go to Sol A.  Should be able to handle that pretty well.  The bonus there is awesome.  If Sol A is too tough at 25, head to Najena for a couple levels.  I'd work Sol A until 40...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Azudno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I am doing something similiar myself atm.<br />
<br />
I'm PLvling my SK with my 55 shammy on the other account.<br />
Around lvl 25 I went to DSP, got 31 in a day. Went to City of Mist, got 37 in a day. <br />
I plan on staying in CoM for a couple more lvls, then head over to the Hole to get him 50+.<br />
<br />
Also using Reaver as 2hs, it rocks pre lvl 50.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">CC isn't bad at that level either, and you can farm velium if you need the cash.  In addition, I can't say enough about the Terror tunnel for learning to FD pull when you get to that level.<br />
<br />
Upper Guk is a pretty good place to PL too, as there are plenty of mobs and a decent ZEM.<br />
<br />
Pretty much any old world dungeon is going to be king for PL though, as the mobs just don't stack up with today's gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>TelimTor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I disagree, there are far better ZEM's to be had for those levels...<br />
