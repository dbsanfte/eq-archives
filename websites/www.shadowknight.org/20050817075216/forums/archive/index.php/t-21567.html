My wifes plays a shaman, so occasionally we are looking for a good place to go and like some variety.</div></div><hr />

My wife and I even duo sometimes in Plane of Earth.<br />

Also we did Factory in Innovation until we were geared up enough.  Did high guardians in justice, still do Valor Inner, some good exp there.   Armadillo Pond in Storms is great, like I said in another post.. if it's slowable.. we can kill it (barring uber mobs) :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Naelyan</div><div class="date">06-01-2004, 11:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally, I'm usually in PoV Inner. I can't find anywhere better for 6% a kill (I'm a bastard, I just make sure to out-DPS the shammy and take all the xp) and piss-easy kills, since I'm not flagged for anything past Tactics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nixpus</div><div class="date">06-07-2004, 03:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I always go to PoV right or left side of the castle. Easy pulls and good visibility...<br />
<br />
I guess inner could be better but I never liked that cave much.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oogoog</div><div class="date">06-07-2004, 03:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pulling those rock things nix?</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are 7 single pulls on the left side and 5 singles and 3 linked on the right side.<br />
<br />
Your favorite side will depend on your DPS... I prefer right side. Just remember to split the 3 spawn so that it will spawn with a good timeframe for single pulls. Once broke you can kill all 8 each spawn round = 1 AA+ pr hour (EDIT: I only give the SK xp btw)<br />
<br />
Been doing a bit of the inner cave lately but thats mostly due to the fact that a friend of mine popped along and then there are too few static mobs at the castle sides. Just remember snare in the cave... its a bit more important there than at the castle :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nixpus</div><div class="date">06-17-2004, 09:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">BTW does anyone here have experience with PoFire?<br />
<br />
Im thinking that the first field may be better xp than SRT / PoV?<br />
<br />
I know I should just go try but any info would be appreciated untill I get around to it ;)</div></div><hr />
