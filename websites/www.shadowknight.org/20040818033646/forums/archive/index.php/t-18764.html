<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Caktis1981</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">2 Questions I like to ask<br />
1. I just recently found out about PoM zone in being moved an hunted there a bit an enjoyed it. I heard about the flower quests in there, I do not doubt that they are good but are they REALLY good, stacking issue ect ect. And if so any information on what I need an where to hunt for the drops would be much appreciated.<br />
<br />
2. I am not much of a money maker, but I been pondering slaughtering my coldain faction to harvest their heads to sell in bazaar an ect, once in while i see sumone paying big pp for a big horde of heads very fast. Are they worth the time to farm their heads pp wise. I never do anything w/  coldain/dragon faction anymore an done the quests i wanted outa coldain/dragon cities<br />
Also if it is a good idea where is the best place to farm their heads. <br />
<br />
2 ideas I been pondering over for a while, any and all awnsers/opinions appreciated, thank you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They revamped PoM and then reverted it some... so not sure what is going on with that zone... /shrug<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ganaith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Flowers are gone. Pom is fucked. The entire damn place is so utterly gimped now, it feels like PoJ. The questpieces you are looking for dont drop anymore.<br />
<br />
Yes, farm me coldain heads. tons of em. in fact, i'll loan you three truckloads full of em.<br />
<br />
Sell me heads. Sell me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tantrissa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">All the PoM v2.0 loot is no-drop and pretty twink-worthy.  I spent a week or so in there 2-boxing.  I parked 3 twinks in the zone with invis potions, then I just killed the named/ph's I wanted until I got the drops I wanted, then looted w/ the twink.   It was pretty satisfying.  I ended up with a couple ultra rare research words which netted me about 75kpp for all my time in there.  I think I was just lucky though.</div></div><hr />

Yes, you were.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">A couple groups of guildies headed up to PoM last night, so yesterday, before we went I took a look at the message board set up to discuss the plane.  Apparently there are 3 versions of the zone (as someone indicated in an earlier reply) and some of the old quests (from V1.0) are still valid in V3.0.  However, it seems that some servers are having some problems keeping V3.0 up, and when the servers go down, V2.0 comes up on reset, in which case, everything is KoS, the quests are all gone/broken, and you can get very few of the old items by killing.<br />
<br />
FYI, if anyone is interested, as of 12/11/03 at 7pm EST, Zebuxoruuk is running PoM V2.0</div></div><hr />

I've heard the flowers are drops now but that's just heresay so take it for what it's worth. I have no desire to go to that zone ever again. New, old, or at gun point.</div></div><hr />
