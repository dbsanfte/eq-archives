<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ritter Bok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just a heads up for anyone camping the failed crypt raider in Kaesora. We camped this guy for 5 hours straight last night before he finally popped inside the library. It was quite funny as we had almost left 2 times and decided to stay (it was 5 am). But he finally popped and I now have my first of the illegible scrolls. I'm on Kane Bayle btw, if anyone has any questions my name in game is : Vhile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>wWanda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I also killed him last night.  Kinda thought he spawned on the second floor, was suprised to see him wandering by me while I sat there on waiting on a respawn.  And in case anyone doesnt know he is a skeleton.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Islekillyourass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I guess i was lucky with this guy,  i went into the library, cleared it once, and he popped /shrug.  One of the easiest camps i had i think, getting the item anyways... but i went in there by myself, with no maps, and had never been in this zone before.  so i got lost and eventually had to have some do a call of hero for me lol.</div></div><hr />
