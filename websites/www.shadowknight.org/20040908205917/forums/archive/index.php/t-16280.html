1. Gnomes are even smaller<br />
2. its not a mullet its hair slicked back, and not every person chooses that.<br />
3. a bad ingame design has nothing to do with proving your point.<br />
4. again, gnomes are about the same, erudites being even worse.<br />
5. you really are stupid.</div></div><hr />

Haha you prove how completely stupid you are. When I said, &quot;should we all be like drizzt&quot; I was referring to the comment about how a dark elf chosing to be evil seems to 'obvious'. I.E. the one not being obvious would be for a dark elf to take the path of a ranger, LIKE DRIZZT.<br />
<br />
You call me a noob?<br />
<br />
Dark Elves easily look the best, but I guess I should change to a gnome because they are so cute! Don't know whats wrong with you, but it is not a good thing if your sk looks &quot;cute&quot;.<br />
<br />
I doesn't matter what race you play get over it. Don't flip out when I post on a thread you make, when you are so obviously full of shit.</div></div><hr />

Yeah you are a noob, because you must not understand PLAIN english. again read the &quot;Disclaimer&quot; at the bottom of original post. Oh, haha this is funny, you call me stupid?. I beleive i was accepted into Mich state. You cant exactly be dumb as a box of rocks and go through admissions. Sad little boy you are :P now Fuck off DE..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Drynnious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Haha you are so stupid its almost beyond comprehension. First of all, just because you say not to post doesn't mean I can't/won't. Thanks for asking though. Secondly, there are different types of smart, or intelligence. Book Smarts, and Street Smarts or Common Sence  to name a few. Things like book smarts are what get you into good college's. Mich State is good, but not that good. How hard is it to get in there? GPA of 3.5 or better and like 28+ on the ACT? That's nothing.<br />
<br />
If you think DE are ugly ok thats your personal opinion, as messed up as it might be. Isn't almost everything an opinion anyway?<br />
<br />
Please learn some common sence and some reading comprehension then come back and we can talk like civilized people instead of saying stfu newb, and die in rl plz. Like you are now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Shirou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Depends on which school of psychology you believe in (About if everything is an opnion), but I agree, sense differs greatly from sub-type to sub-type.</div></div><hr />

<br />
haha Well i guess if spelling things right and having a clue what is going on, and CAN read and follow do's/don'ts, or even have a idea of what anyone is talking bout (run-on weee.) Then i guess i am dumb, if thats the case... everyone normal must be dumb too. Wuwu lets all be stupid ! <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Azkhar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">the term &quot;Basic&quot; Can be defined many ways, one is the average. the joe shmoe of society, hard working with enough intellect to stop watching TV or playing comp. games and do RL important stuff. Second, Basic is the Human core of the free mind. Free will, etc.. You get what im saying =D<br />
<br />
The love went away, cause there are too many Mullet inkies around.<br />
<br />
and Yes Computers can be defined of as intellegent, but can a Computer do your trig homework without being told to? No , it lacks the minds free will. It is still bound by the laws of its own physics...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Shirou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">But it can be ordered to do it (Like I was saying).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Drynnious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">It probably wouldn't be to hard, (well or at least not impossible) to program it to recognize trig symbols ect and be able to work out the problems. You could just have the computer scan the page and go to town.<br />

<br />
so isn't a human the same way? a computer can do trig problems just the same as you or i can... when you frist start trig didn't you have to have someone tell you how to do it? can you not write a program that tells the comp what to do with trig problems and how to solve them? you have to get the problem from somewhere right, it doesn't just appear in you head, so ineffect isn't that the same as telling a computer,&quot; this is the problem i want the answer to&quot;..... isn't that the same as the minds free will, if there is a error it is the computer's way of saying fuck off do it yourself, and if it doesn't have a error then it is working for you, the same as a human right? someone tells you solve this and you don't you are telling them to fuckoff and do it themselves, and if you do find the answer then you are working for them... got to love free will</div></div><hr />

<br />
You could say the exact same thing about humans. Without a teacher or a book to tell you how to do trig, its very unlikely that you could learn it well, and not have any error's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Azkhar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Of course it can be ordered to do so. But does your trig teacher plug a keyboard in yur butt and start typing lines of command prompt? Course not.</div></div><hr />

and the only reason you dont like dark elves is because you are jealous of our goddamn sexiness. smooth, dark, and always getting the ladies.<br />
<br />
i already explained this, so ill just copy paste it (chopped it up a bit, some didnt make sense in this discussion)<br />
<br />
&quot;It is about playing how and what YOU want to play. I am not going to say dark elves are the best, and I am not going to say erudites are teh suck. I am just saying that people play what they want to play, and you have no right to say they are wrong. I picked dark elf because I thought they looked cool, not because they have so-and-so stats or such-and-such advantage. Just quit your goddamn whining and play the fucking game.&quot;<br />

I pretend to respect the iksar, and have stolen thier most valuable artifact.<br />
<br />
Euridites shadowknights are few becuase they are weak, few live long enough to adventure far.<br />
<br />
Gnomes are not shadowknights.  They will never be shadowknights.  If I dress a kobold in dark armor and a large sword is he worthy of the shadowknight title? No.<br />
<br />
Humans are a short lived fleeting race.  They will never amount to anything and will be  long dead while I will still be reaking havoc upon norrath.<br />
<br />
It is commonly known that Dark Elves harbor battle foder in thier city.  Goblins, kobolds, ghouls, and leading thier foder force is thier trolls.<br />
<br />
Ogres are not unlike any other mindless beast upon norrath.  Similar to an ape who is trying to wield a sharp knife they will eventually kill themsleves or eachother.<br />

Before going to the warriors and palladins for help on how to play your shadowknight, I would recommend going to school.<br />
<br />
And for the record several if the SKs here did actually survive Kunark and Velious, but you wont find many of them posting in this fourm, they know that the player behind the toon is what makes the toon great, not it's starting stats.<br />

I'd play a kobold SK.  A cannibal kobold.  I'd hunt the warrens and Stonebrundt and later go to velius and camp the UD's.  Better than being a frog (which I saw somone suggest should be sk playable simply because they have a red and black model puh-leez)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Warscout</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">didnt say i was smarter than you fucktards just that i was better</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Ruuti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">Better, <br />
<br />
Better seems to be a term that is in the eye of the beholder.<br />
<br />
1. Majority says, that DEFs are better.  You can't wave a stick on most servers without hitting a dark elf SK.  So the majority,  at least where they are concerned are better.   They look nice...<br />
<br />
2. Stat wise and advantage wise Iksars,  trolls and Ogres are better.  Yea they are big dumb and ugly.  But hey, Ogres never get dazed,  and the stats are incredible.  The real question here.  Do you tank or do you cast,  and where is your bread buttered.<br />
The downside to these bad dogs is that you will pay to play.  In order to keep  up with your friends you will need to play more.  You will need to be focused on getting the best XP in any situation.  Cause you pay to play.  At the highest levels your advantages do not mean anything cause if you aren't fighting slowed mobs,  and you do not have a healer.  You will be going almost no where.<br />
<br />
3. For gaining levels,  the best race hands down is the Gnome.  For personal preferance people have chosen to hack gnomes on this board.  I can sympathize with them.  I like my troll,  because often in roleplay settings he is comic relief.  That is a place that gnomes hold as well.  In the end a gnome will beat your human, Erudite, and dark elf to 65 all things considered being equal.<br />
Trolls and Ogres and Iksar won't even show up for the race.<br />
<br />
4. Trolls are the best <br />
&quot;Troll - Kill and eat and shit and fuck. Christ, life is good. A wonderful example of man at the state of nature.&quot; - <br />
thanks Keevil.<br />
<br />
that is my opinion and why I played a troll.  Cause I noticed early on that trolls do not have to worry about looking good,  and they have a lot of hitpoints and strength,  which are things that a SK need.  That and a sk is supposed to be a blight on society,  not a fearsome dark general. (opinion) Trolls better embody a blight on society.  That and they just plain look scary. <br />
<br />
5. Nobody sucks.   Nobody should die.  You spend a lot of time playing the toon you have chosen,  whether you chose him for Vanity,  for the numbers,  or for speed of level gain,  you had your reasons.  The race that will allow you to  be content with your character and will inspire your imagination to keep playing is the best.    Seems this thread has gotten off track,  probably should be moved to the flame area.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hum, interesting way at looking at it.<br />
<br />
I've always looked at the class more as Shadow KNIGHT.  Meaning above and beyond all things I am first and foremost a Knight.  <br />
<br />
/roleplay on<br />
I am honorable in combat, I am not a coward who runs from a fight, I am the thing most feared by those who follow the light because I am the most like them, yet I am the thing they least understand.  I will kill you honorably, but I will kill you.  I do not sneak about, nor hide in corners, I wear my dark armor proudly and those who oppose me can test their beliefs against the edge of my blade.<br />
/roleplay off<br />
<br />
Honestly, it was looking at the class as a Knight of darkness that made me chose it.  It's also why I chose a Dark Elf, because I couldn't see Trolls, Ogres, or Iksar fitting the image of a Dark Knight like a Dark Elf, Erudite, or Human could.  So why a Dark Elf over Human or Erudite?  Cause I really like my ultravision. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Ruuti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">While you do have a good argument Mynka ,  the SK menu of skills would kind of contradict what you are saying.  So tell me where in the skills of an honorable combatant would we place  Invisibility,  and feign death.  While not cowards for sure,  anyone who stands in front of an angered ( place scary mob for your level here) ,   has to have a modicum of balls.  But the truth is that a SK is a tank type that is not constrained by the code of ethics adheared to by paladins.  Their spells and abilities are granted to them based upon the arcane pursuit of necromancy,  and as such they need not adhere to the exacting standards of a Knight in the strictest sense of the word.  That last part of my description was actually paraphrased from an EQ resource at some point.  While if you play your character as a brave and honorable guy,  by all means you are welcome to it.  Me I prefer to kick a little ass and make sure I am reasonably assured of Victory,  I also spread a little disease and raise undead to help along the way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At any rate, I disagree with the post thread idea.  It's silly.  Who cares what race other people play.  Main thing is that you find something you like to play.  It would be nice to see a relatively intelligent discourse on the subject however.  Curse words and reasonings like they look like a 'mullet' do not really mean much.  <br />
<br />
OK already.. LOL.. we get the idea you don't like them.  From a gameplay perspective many people do seem to think DE's look cool.  I think the obvious racial disadvantages for DE are no bash til AA time and then low strength and stamina.   Does increased INT make up for that?  The number crunchers out there could probably do a breakdown on how exactly the disadvantages affect a toon.  As far as looks go, its purely subjective.  I personally think gnomes are goofs and look kind of silly.   But people are gonna love their little gnome toons regardless of what you or I think.<br />
<br />
Trolls do look cool and the regen is attractive.  But bottom line is that you play these toons for many hours so play what you like.  Stats be damned!  LOL... have fun with the game folks!  Yes, it is ok to hate DE's.  Many races on Norrath do in fact hate them.  So that's actually a norm in the game world itself.  The interesting twist is why do so many people want to play them?  <br />
<br />
At any rate, I think you could have done a better job with this post.  Try to come up with something more intelligent than calling folks 'noobs' or telling them to screw off.  The Noob taunt is one of the more unoriginal taunts.  (Noob is so overused that by now it basically refers to people who disagree with the user's point of view).  I think your future MSU journalism profs won't be impressed if that's all you got.<br />

<br />
To the SK racist before him...<br />
 <br />
Since this whole post was a commentary about how one erudite dislikes dark elves.  I wonder where we get down to not being able to stand to look at our own troll and ogre toons?   To the human Shadowknight that wrote that.<br />
<br />
1.  Get enough imagination to play a race different than the one you play IRL.<br />
<br />
2.  If you played a human it is because you wanted to play something that looked cool.  But EVERYBODY playes dark elves.<br />
<br />
3.  If trolls and ogre players didn't like the way our toons looked we wouldn't play them to 65.  But since we did,  we know we are going to have a sound Numerical advantage over all of the human and Dark elves out there for about 50 levels.   No that I am 65 I see that it is all in the Equipment and the AA cause the race is now just an ICON.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>Amphitryon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">Jealous schmucks<br />
<br />
Theres only (2) SK races that ever amounted to anything<br />
<br />
Dark Elf<br />
<br />
Originally one race of elves, had an empire spanning across (2) continents, the race that brought magic to the Combine Empire, and perhaps brought about its fall. Only the combined strength of the other races kept the dark elves from expanding across into the Karanas (bloody kith) and even then the lighties could claim it as a victory. No foreign forces have ever conquered the dark elves.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Iksar - They had an empire spanning a continent and then some. Unfortunatley for them they got too big for their scaly heads and decided to take on bigger lizards (dragons) and got their asses handed to them. But they had an empire never the less, at least equal in size and strentght of the old elven empire<br />
<br />
Then we have<br />
<br />
Erudites - Lost a war with their lighty cousins, forced to live in a Hole in the ground and they managed to screw that up too and had to move back up<br />
<br />
Ogres - Kicked out of their own lands by Dorfs of all things, and made to be dumb as a bag of rocks<br />
<br />
Trolls - Even SoE says they have no culture, even Ogre SKs dont want to associate with them, they come to Nektulos to level..then they get their ass handed to the by Frogs and wind up living off the Dark Elves like a bunch of stinky green trailer trash<br />
<br />
Gnomes - the reason why birth control is a good thing.  A genetic abberation or some kind of rift in the space/time continium I dont know but god help us all if they start breeding with halfing rangers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>Ruuti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">hold on,  you pulling out some lore,  lets dig a little deeper shall we?<br />
<br />
<br />
1 Dark elves.  Not the true children of Innoruuk.  In fact if you really wanna get technical they are just some demented twisted light elves that were tortured into what they are today.  BTW they didn't destroy the Combine.  It took other Combine to do that.  Humans are their own worst enemy.<br />
<br />
2. Iksar- sure they were tough.  If you are looking for their origins you look to Cazic.  When he finally decided that he couldn't subjugate trolls from Innoruuk.  Then he decided to make a cheap knockoff.  Sure they were tough and had their day.  But they were not here from the start.<br />
<br />
3.  Yea well you rise high you fall hard.  But keep in mind it was the erudites that created necromancy,  which is what separates the men from the warriors.  So whether they messed it up or not they still had their contribution.<br />
<br />
<br />
4. Ogres.   Yea they are big and dumb.  Since you are so good at pointing out how tough other Races WERE.  Maybe you oughta find out what got Ogres and the rest of Rallos'  tainted miscreants Damned.  They got so damn tough that enslaving Norrath wasn't enough.  So they broke into the plains and declared war on the gods.<br />
<br />
<br />
5. Trolls  Gotta give you that one.  The trolls are so hateful that they can't seem to keep their own city.  Course this being a contest of who is the best SHADOWKNIGHT.  Then lets really look at this.  KILL FUCK EAT DRINK SHIT,   ain't life great.  (thanks again Kevel)  SO they aren't good city planners.  /shrug  To be honest it wasn't the frogs that took down Grobb.  Remember it  was other trolls that attacked Grobb first,  and it was just the scavenging little FRIBITS that snuck in after.  Do trolls have to be cici minded?  NO, stick to the whole kill rape and pillage thing.  Why? Cause they are the true children of INNY.  If you doubt it then take a good look at the big ugly bastard next time that you make it to Hate,  if you make it to hate. <br />
<br />
Gnomes.  Those little bastards seem hardly worth the effort to punt.  Little mucus nosed disease spreading snots.   Tell you what though,  you ever been harm touched in the nuts?  You won't underestimate them then,  they may not have it in the size, strength, scary, nasty, or mean catagory.  But those lousy little fuckers will cast till you can't cast any more.  What are you Dark elf and Iksar shadowknights gonna do to stop their casting, when they are sucking the life outta you?  NOT a DAMN THING,  Cause you can't bash!!!  Not till you get so damn strong,  by that time the damn Gnomes are so tough that they can to.  So lets not say that there is any reason to be jealous of IKSAR and or Dark Elves. <br />
<br />
Said it before and I will say it again.  Play what you like,  cause you gonna be playing it a long time.  If you are playing what you like, then you will never be wrong,  no matter what your reason for playing your toon.  To me,  A troll kicks ass.   Every one else should be Jealous,  cause I enjoy my toon,  and I do my best to make others enjoy him too.</div></div><hr />

But keep in mind it was the erudites that created necromancy<br />
<br />
This is not true.  Erudite spies learned a forbidden magic from the Dark Elves...the art of Necromancy.<br />
<br />
Miragul found that these outcasts not only studied the three schools of magic, but also a fourth. It was called Necromancy and a few lucky spies had returned from a distant underground city (Neriak, it was called, home of the dark elves) with both their lives and also ancient texts describing this art.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>Carshail Shel'rac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">Oh oh wrong lore senses tingeling...<br />
<br />
The Teir'dal never had a great empire, their current &quot;kingdom&quot; is the peak of their power since they left the Underfoot (the Teir'dal first showed up as Takish Hiz fell, they delivered the final blow to the Tunarian Elven Empire and scavenged the remains afterwards).<br />
<br />
Trolls are the second children of Thule, they weren't created by Innoruuk. The only actual mortal creation of Innoruuk are the Luggalds, the rest (the frog ghouls in Deepest Guk and Lower Guk and the Teir'dal) are just perversions of a former race. The Trolls started to worship Innoruuk during the Rallosian Empire because they grew bitter about being conquered and suppressed by the Ogres. Zraxthil, one of the Troll high shamans, founded a cult dedicated to Innoruuk, this led to the creation of the Broken Skull Clan that was later driven away by the Ykesha/Grobb Clan (can't recall it exactly). A lot of Trolls converted to Innoruuk after the fall of Grobb, but Cazic remains their main deity.<br />
<br />
The Ogre lore is corrected, they were both beaten by the Dwarves and failed to conquer Plane of Earth, but the Rallosian Empire is still one of the three mightiest empires ever built.<br />
<br />
The Heretics lost the war against Eruds followers, correct, they also were driven out of old Paineel (keep in mind that old Paineel has been recaptured now) and didn't create the necromancy, but, the studies of the Heretics brought necromancy to a whole new level (lichdom is an erudian discovery) and Miragul is still the greatest necromancer ever. The Heretics mostly stay out of other peoples affairs and prefer to continue their studies unbothered, that's one of the reasons why they aren't as know as the Teir'dal for example. Dartain is also a famous heretic and a great Shadowknight.<br />
<br />
The Iksar society is one of the oldest on Norrath since the Shissar fled to Luclin and the Rallosian Empire crumbled to ashes. Also they didn't start the war with the dragons, it was Trakanon who assaulted the Iksar navy and started the war.<br />
<br />
The humans, that were left out, also built one of the mightiest empire ever and managed to poison an important food resource of Antonica by summoning one of their gods, creating a heavy crisis in the human kingdoms.<br />

Just because you can 'Harm Touch' dont make you the big bad ol' guy on the block, HT will not always save you, if you are to die do so with honor. As i was saying... We as Humans in Real life... Humans were made as war creatures and they (we) find compition in everything including EQ. So Stop acting like a True human.... Role play a little... Dont let your coocky attitudes get in your way of becomming a Great Shadow Knight. Everyone can Gmones to Ogres can be all Great Sks if given the chance.<br />
<br />
You can prove your a Great Sk, by first knowing what u are doing, secound by not harassing other plays because what they play. third build your  character in the way you see fit, if your character is great in your eyes it IS great. fourth GET OUT THERE AND BE A SK WHERE DID THAT WHOLE HONOR THING GET TOO? Stop acting like little children and get out there and be a sk!<br />
<br />
/roleplay on.<br />
<br />
&quot;I may be a Dark elf, and i may be a Shadow knight but that dosent mean I am impervious to emotion,  I may appear Stolid but everyone shows emotion. Even the greatest of the hateful knights.&quot;<br />
/roleplay off.<br />
<br />
Now can we all grow up and get on with our lives?!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thank god, I hate people who feel the need to brag. I mean people who feel the need to blow their own horn about shit that really doesn't serve to prove anything. Easily faked and unprovable things like:<br />
<br />
He is now level 65 with a complete spell book and 250 aa, and undefeated in pvp.... yes even vs troll, ogre and other supposedly superior shadowknights.  <br />
<br />
Yeah, that's the kind of thing I was talking about. <br />
<br />
Whats Funny is you flame me, and then proceed to throw the same shit back in my face that you were flaming me for.  <br />
<br />
You mean ripping on the guy's magelo, saying that you could take him based solely on that then expecting everyone in the world to take your word that you would so own them in PvP without backing it up with a magelo of your own?<br />
<br />
Jupke has a magelo btw, it may be out of date, but it is a magelo none the less. Congratz on being an asshole and a hypocrite.<br />
<br />
You sir really need to pull your head out of your ass. <br />

Right back at ya big guy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First of all I am a Eruidte sk, one day a chanter illusions me into a dark elf. A strange thing happens. My height goes down, my muscles get ridiculasly smaller, all my armor looks much cheesier, AKA over elaborated nonsense. <br />
<br />
Dark elves are a race that look good with a robe and a wand not armor and a sword. Even at lv 65, DE sk's look like they could be solo'ed by a bixie and why? Because they look small and pathetic with a weapon that looks like they could barley pick up let alone wield with any sort of skill. And lastly when you choose a DE sk you get to look just like every other sk on norrath....... congrats.<br />

<br />
I wasnt ripping on the guys majelo. I was ripping on him for being a moron. A magelo doesnt prove anything. I dont need one because i know my avatar's capabilities and no one else needs to know, until they find themselves smacked down by the so called &quot;pussy weak Dark elf&quot; .... thats kinda the reason  like being one. We are often underestimated, even on a eq message board, let alone the game ...<br />
<br />
These big penis my race is better than your race threads are just pathetic. Every race can be a good shadowknight. Its all about gear and level's ......</div></div><hr />

You Cuss each other out because you are children and decide to go into the 'My guys better then your guys' thing. You know what? WHO CARES! People play what they want, and they play that race because they liked it not because of its statistics or anything, and they picked their class because they wanted to. Who really cares What race or what class you are. <br />
<br />
Amen, Seinharu. <br />

The true measure of a Shadow Knight is how well they play their class and how well they role-play it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u88"><b>Jodgrim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p88">Looking at your magelo. My dark elf Shadowknight would obliterate your geko ass in about 5 seconds(No great feat seeing as he is lvl 52 and you are supposed to be 65 with 250AA and all your spells)<br />
<br />
and looking at your majelo profile, you wouldnt last too much longer than our misguided iksar friend here<br />
<br />
That is ripping on their magelos, not calling them morons. <br />
<br />
And listing your accomplishments in an attempt to prove that you are a superiour SK is bragging. The only thing lvl 65, 250 AAs, and a full spell book proves is that you have a lot of free time. And FYI a winning PvP record only means that you are good at your class on red servers. Some of the best players I know suck at PvP, it proves exactally zilch on a blue server.<br />

You don't get get it because you are the one who is a moron.</div></div><hr />

No offense, but thats really overplayed, and as for bringing up junior high kids, I know a great deal who can use &quot;then&quot; and &quot;than&quot; correctly. You also said that we were 13 at the most, then gave us credit for being 15-20...it isn't your place to check them.</div></div><hr />

God I wish I would have known that when I was soloing through the days before and during Kunark or SoV.  Or before everyone realized that SK’s really did have something to contribute to a group during the SoL era.  That’s a whole other topic though.  I wish I had know that before I started soloing in PoP just to pass time while I’m waiting on a raid to start or looking for/forming a group/adventure.  And to think I'm gimp because I did this with the benefit of only my own spells and mana supply.<br />
<br />
I guess I need to go delete my DE SK because he’s so gimp and start over with a...  I don't know what race would please you?  Anything but DE right?  Let me just go do that.<br />
<br />
How many times has it been said that it’s the player not the race?  To many to count would be my guess.  Because our gear may not be the best and our stats may not be the highest, but we do it all the same.  And most of the time if we're gimped like you say and we are still here we must be doing it better than you.<br />
