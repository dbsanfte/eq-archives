<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Satist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So, here I am, on a Sunday, and having enough time on my hands that I can actually group...<br />
<br />
Keep in mind zI'm only lev 34  :( .  I pick up a group in OT, with a kinda normal line up, me 34 SK, a 28 troll war, a mage, chanter, cleric, and i think the other was like a wiz, or something (only saw 1 caster pet, must have been).  War is pulling, and I'm casting Engulfing Darkness either on incoming, or after the mob makes it to the camp, as we have no slower, not to mention, I HATE runners.  All this time, I had been given the impression of how war taunt and agro was the shit, and how we can't taunt off of them without chain casting.  <br />
<br />
Anywho, the fact of the matter is, I gain agro, and the war ain't taking agro back, with the only spells being cast ED, and CD.  As I said, ED was just to slow and snare, but I noticed that since I was gaining agro, and he wasn't pulling off of me,(either due to him not using taunt or whatever) so I started using CD to help prevent agro if the casters are stupid enough to nuke too soon, or chain nuke.  Oh, and I was not hitting my taunt button at all, either, as I know how that can ping pong mobs which at lower levels can make the healers job very tough, because of mana regen, etc.<br />
<br />
So, the question is, (i realize this calls for some supposition and assuming) am I still at a low enough level that I can easily out taunt a warrior, or perhaps war agro gain isn't quite as good as what I've been hearing, or perhaps, the war actually knew what he was doing and realized that it would be a huge PITA to pull agro off me, and keep it, so didn't bother?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Space</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">He may not of had his Incite disc or just had no idea how to play his class, but yes its only really at the higher end we have trouble keeping aggro off warriors once they get aggro proc weps/armor mods to go along with incite lines.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Maicom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">none of our snares have a slow component</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>SuDanger68</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Don't know what you exactly want. The war was 6 levels below you..maybe he jsut did what he should have done....be dps, not tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">At those levels, a warrior shouldn't be able to out-aggro you.<br />
<br />
Taunt will never, ever lower your aggro, however.  And if the warrior wanted aggro, he could always get it (for a moment at least) by using taunt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It becomes significant, assuming you and the warrior remain parallelly equipped for the content you're at, about the time when a warrior is dw'ing Time weapons.<br />
<br />
This kinda shows the perception problem.  People hear about problems in the high-end and project it to all levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You won't have agro problems at that level.<br />
<br />
Just use CD though, it's enough of a snare and super cheap agro.<br />
<br />
Around your 50's it will become very very noticeable that a equally or worse geared Warrior than yoy takes hit so much better.  When I get the chance to play Keevel I'm not usually the MT if we have our warrior.  Still you need to know mana efficient agro, how to pull and how to tank.  make sure you practice the 1st 2 now.<br />
<br />
Also don't mash taunt, but don't be afraid of it either.  It is another one of our tools, and though it isn't reliable, it has saved the bacon of a number of cloth wearing casters.</div></div><hr />
