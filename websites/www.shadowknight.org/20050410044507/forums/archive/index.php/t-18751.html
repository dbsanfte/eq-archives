<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lanjin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guys, here's the situation. I have a 55 DE SK with a lil over 1k ac and a lil over 2k hp weilding a war marshall's bladed staff. MR is only about 75 or so. Sorry I don't have a Magelo so you guys can look at. But anyways, is there anyway I can win? He has a full set of Deepwater gear. Which is equivalent to Blood Armor I guess. And after self buffs, he has about 3.5k hp and like 1100ac or so(not exactly sure). Only self buffs allowed I guess. (His rule...) Is there any way I can win? How does fear work on PvP situations? I know I must have shadow step and cancel magic memmed. Is there any tactics to look out for when dueling a pally? I know LoH is a bitch as well. I know some of you guys out there have plenty of experience fighting pallys. Any Tips and Tricks would be awesome.<br />
<br />
I'll try getting a Magelo so you guys can see what I got.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kromglon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Unless hes a retard,terrible gear or forget to hit the attack key you shouldnt be able to kill him. Levels is king and 6 is alot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lanjin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Figures, 6 lvls is a lot.  but what if i got to 65 and he was also at 65 but with more AA's. How would i go about kickin his ass?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>GubbaDaTroll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Here's what I would do: <br />
<br />
Buy some svm-gear: Velium jacinth wedding ring*2 (svm+14 each), massive flameguard helm(+17 svM),  maybe  velium blue diamond bracelet and bloodstained mantle(+10 svM) .<br />
 Now you should resist most of his annoying stuns and blind-spells. If you want to cheat a bit, buy an SvMagic-potion from some vendor.<br />
Next go buy some crystallized pumices(5 charges of nullify magic) from Shadowhaven. Zone to SH from bazaar and vendor in house up to left, left door, sells ´em. Why use pumices and not our own nullify magic spell you ask? Reason is you dont have to wait for the spell icon to ungrey if ye  use pumice, so in theory ye can use one pumice empty in 10 secs, 5 charges 2 sec each.<br />
<br />
Its also very  useful if you know how to &quot;Joust&quot; .<br />
Here's an link: <br />
How to JOUST (http://www.shadowknight.org/forums/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=13066&amp;highlight=joust) <br />
Ask some bored looking high level shadowknight in yer servers bazaar if he would have  some moments to show you how  to joust and train with ye a bit. If you know how, make an hotbutton for jousting that is /attack on, use disarm, /attack off in one macro. Pally without weapon is no threat.<br />
<br />
When the battle begins: Tell your selfpetbuffed pet to attack the pally,  he will prolly either use undead fear spell to send it away or kill it quickly with melee. Either way, pets only purpose is to distract the pally while you  spam the paladin with nullify magic from your pumices. Unload atleast 1 pumice on him(5 charges).<br />
<br />
Start jousting the paladin, hitting him with your 2handed weapon.<br />
Eventually the paladin will try to use his lv 59 over time heal &quot;Celestial cleansing&quot; , which heals him for 700 dmg with 250 manacost in  4 tics(24 seconds) .<br />
We dont want that , now do we.<br />
Whenever you see the spellmessage &quot;paladin soandso 's body is covered with soft glow&quot;, means he has casted the heal on himself.<br />
Now you just use your crystallized pumice again on him, he should not have any buffs on so his heal icon is in first buffslot, and thus annulled after you unload an charge from yer pumice on him.<br />
<br />
Keep on jousting, use pumice whenever he tries to use Celestial cleansing on himself and tap yer health back with Life leech and Spirit tap whenever you get below  80 percent hp.<br />
<br />
Eventually he will go oom from uneffective CC's, stuns and blinds and becomes just weak warrior..well weak warrior  with 2 lives.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lanjin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">friggin awesome, sounds fun. great link also. i take u've had a hand full of duels with pallys. man, i love this site. anything to everything is in here. really appreciate it Gubba, thanks <br />

<br />
EDIT: Im on euro times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>ZilshasisEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The problem with debuffing him like that is that if he has Two insta clicks you'll not reach his HoT at all. I have a 65th paladin and to give you some idea of the buff order I'll post my typical setup <br />
<br />
Jboots<br />
Yualp IV<br />
Resist Poison<br />
Resist Disease<br />
Pious Might/Divine Might<br />
BSS/BMB in your brothers case<br />
Aura of the Crusader (He will not have that yet, although if he's smart he'll have his AC buff here)<br />
Heroism/Reso in your brothers case<br />
Symbol<br />
Valor of Marr (25% self haste)<br />
Resist Magic<br />
<br />
As you can see I have one insta click and one near instant cast spell to counter said Pumice dispells, and your brother could have access to both. Toss in goblin earring and/or a tinkered scope and dispell is just not an option unless you can get your hands on some golem wands. But they stopped dropping or are just stupid rare now adays.<br />
<br />
Your best bet is to let the pet act as a dot and just go in full guns blazing. If he resists your spears you'll have to relay on not so efficient taps and in the end his HoT will heal more hp for less mana leaving you with a problem. I personally don't believe it's a fight you can win with that big a level difference between you. If you were equel level it would be another matter :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
One way you may be able to win would be to exploit his lack of ranged offense.  If you fought with kei up you could spear him as he approaches hopefully landing one and then run like heck.<br />
<br />
He will either follow which you should be able to now outrun him assuming equal run III.  Or he will heal himself in which case you should have a very mana efficient dot up and try and hit him with that.<br />
<br />
The trick is you never want to be in range when he can cast stun etc.  But you basically not gonna win =(.<br />
<br />
With Kei, pot9, mana preserve III and improved damage III with full spear line up and a good dot along with snare you may be able to wear him down if you have a significant anvantage in mana regen.  I am not much for PvP so I could be off on the tactics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Lanjin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i was wondering... is there any paladin sites that are like this one? i mean i would like to know how their strategies are too.<br />
im still setting up my computer, so i havent fought him yet. any links would be appreciated. thanks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Aailin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Having a 65 Paladin with a several Hundred AA, I can tell you that with a 6 level difference unless he's a complete idiot you stand no chance of winning.<br />
<br />
If you go the dispell route, and he has more 2 insta clickies (jboots/8th ring for example) add in his Yaulp which basically acts as one and your giong to spend so much time trying to dispell him that he's going to kill you before you even begin to do damage to him.<br />
<br />
Also with a 6 level difference your going to have a very tough time landing anything on him.<br />
<br />
The best advice I can give you, is to hit and run as much as possible.  Shadow step, Joust just keep moving, while you keep your pet on him.  Pet won't do much but it may keep him annoyed enough to turn and kill it.  When he does that wade in and hit him until he turns on you then SS back away.<br />
<br />
Truth is, even with the best advice from both pallies and sk's your not going to win.  6 levels is a huge differnce.  Especially when your taking into account he is over 60.  At 61 you get tremendous mitigation increases.  <br />
<br />
I'd imagine knowing your substantially lower then him his spell line up will probably include<br />
<br />
Yaulp<br />
Divine Aura<br />
Force of Akilea (if he has it)<br />
Quellious stun <br />
Force<br />
Stun<br />
Root (or instill if he has it)<br />
Celestial Cleansing....<br />
<br />
He will probably go for the quick win early.  He'll hit you with his post 60 stun and if it lands expect to be chainstunned to the point you can't move.<br />
<br />
If he's any good he will be able to alternate his 2 4 second stuns/6 second stun/10 second stun and keep you locked down.<br />
<br />
<br />
Its going to be tough even if you sub alot of AC/HP gear for SvM gear to resist because of the level difference.<br />
<br />
If you manage to resist some stuns he'll just go to straight melee and use CC.  He can also just DA to remem any other spells he wants since stuns aren't landing.  <br />
<br />
Personally, don't see anyway you can win this, but it will be a good learning experience anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Yaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It kinda sucks that they nerfed Fear spells in PvP.  When I was level 16 I dueled a level 22 SK and landed Fear on him, so when he snapped out of it he turned around and feared me.  It was a pretty lame battle, 2 SK's Fear kiting each other around Timorous Deep.  Neither of us were KoS there so the fight went on for a while.  I finally just shadow stepped to the top of some mountain and camped out to clear PvP status.  It was kind of funny though.  And now . . .  No more PvP Fear :mad: At least they gave us Uber HT AA's to dispose of those Pesky Pink Paladins.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zakton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Have your sound up or even better surround sound for blind fighting.  Use a slot for shadowstep as you will still be able to move around if he roots you.  Most people panic once they get rooted and/or blinded but its not that hard to fight with sound only and root means nothing when you can cast shadowstep.  Know your spell lineup by heart too.<br />
<br />
I have a friend that plays a pally alt and we have dueled quite a bit.  He swears that I somehow cheat when I get blinded because I move around and fight so well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>KlaoofQuell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">What I would do is this.<br />
<br />
1. Chain pell him while he messes around with pet.<br />
2. Have Both Spears up and nail him with both.<br />
3. Pop off HT. He should be at 40-60% now.<br />
4. He will begin casting CC now. Try to bash him to interupt.<br />
5. If he gets CC off, pell it.<br />
6. He will try to stun now. Have sow up and book it soon as you pell. go to the far end of the arena.<br />
7. Pet should be alive still if you are lucky. He will waver in indecision now hopefully.<br />
8. He will try to heal himself again now. Let him get it off. <br />
9. While he has CC up, hit him with dooming dark.<br />
10.Recast Spears.<br />
11. Cast Spirit Tap.<br />
12. He will be trying to get his stun off now again. Run in and melee hard.<br />
13. Let him get his stun off. You should resist one if he trys to start chain stunning.  The reason to do this is to trick him. He will not use LoH if he thinks that he can save it for when he really needs it. He knows that you have used your HT so he is not worried about being LoH happy. But...<br />
14. Soon as you come unstunned, spear him with your 400 hp spear. <br />
15. Bash him.<br />
16. Recast the lower spear.<br />
17. Now, if luck is on your side, he will be at 15% or so. He will want to use his LoH if he is watching his hp. Just hope you can kill him fast enough or you are screwed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Nenadar W'Vern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">To be honest, I think you do have a chance at beating him, even with the 6 levels difference.<br />
<br />
What I would look at is his likely spell line up.  Hes going to be trying to stun you mainly so he can get free hits and then hes going to be healing himself.  He has a few dd spells but nothing as major.  Maybe he will blind too.<br />
<br />
He will be buffed, dispell him to remove hp buffs.<br />
<br />
Keep your resists high so his spells dont land, stick to spears and tank him.  He will concentrate on hitting you and healing himself.  You just need to outdamage his healing.  HT has 2 purposes, to either force him to use his LoH or as a finishing blow(its fun when they accidently LoH you which happens to me a lot on TZ).<br />
<br />
If you can land a dark on him you have a very good chance.  Always use clinging darkness, the lower the damage and movement hinderance the harder to resist, so clinging is best for this.  Joust him, let him heal and waste his mana.  Use a proccing life tap and life leech if you have it.  Gradually wear him down, dont expect a quick victory.  It will take you a long time but you can win, despite the level diff.  As people have said above, just keep hitting him.<br />
<br />
Environment also helps, where would you fight him?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kript</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">First off, you'll have to kill him three times because of heals and LoH. The deepwater BP is a clicky heal so make that four or five times. Secondly, your MR gear is weak so he'll stun you to death....literally. The level difference can be a downside, but IS doable, but not with weak gear and weak MR. Pally wins. <br />
<br />
Your one chance may be to make him panic --a common thing that happens to bluebies when they pvp. But then, you can't panic yourself.<br />
<br />
BTW Fear has been nerfed, so don't try it. Also, buy a couple of pumice stones, hotkey them, and cast them on him. When he sees his buffs start dropping, maybe, just maybe he might panic. But it's a long shot.</div></div><hr />
