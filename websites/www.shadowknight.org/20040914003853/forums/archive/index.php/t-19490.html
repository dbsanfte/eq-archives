<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dkhar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Looking at these spells I find it odd they are conjuration instead of the normal undead nuke type of evocation, which I have been working on like mad, now to find out I can already cast these with ease.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>NorrynNoir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">evocation is worth it just for deny undead though. you shouldn't regret raising even though it was probably the single most boring thing you've ever done in your sk career. i know it was for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>lorddaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">my guild laughs when they see me using the low level undead evoc to work my skill....<br />
<br />
but on an easy raid with undead, my dps isn't noticable anyway.<br />
<br />
but evoc is up to 178..hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dkhar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I hear that man. I have been sneaking my low level undead DD's on LDoN adventures as much as possible. Up to about 150 now. I've only had 1 guy comment on it, who happened to be a wizzy throwing 1k nukes.<br />
<br />
EDIT : btw, I always thought you could not get skill ups off of green mobs but the day before yesterday (I think whatever), I was in Oasis of Marr waiting on our cleric to get back from afk. I had my low level DD up in preparation for any undead I could practice on and a Ghoul happened by. I nuked it, first shot I got a skill up ?? I nuked it 10 more time and ended up getting 2 more skill ups! Has something changed ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
You improve your spell skills any time you cast a spell, no matter what the target is though.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Krazaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Maybe they changed it, but you can skill up off your pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>DConquest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I would just DD my pet to get my Evoc up... but then again I've been at cap for a couple of years now.  Not sure if that changed as Krazaak said.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tsaryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Just a week or two ago I was killing time in PoK nuking my pet.. got a few skill ups waiting for group members to show.  So I'm pretty sure it still works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Squigle D'Muerte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Best way to increase Evocation:<br />
<br />
Get C3.  Go to Paineel Newbie area.<br />
<br />
Using lowest level undead nuke kill all the skels you see then run up on hill straight out from entrance.<br />
<br />
Once all the skels are dead (like 5) they will start to repop at bottom of hill provided you stay far enough away.  Range on nuke reaches bottom of hill so you are cool to just stand there.<br />
<br />
As long as you stay on hill, every time you kill a skel another will immediately pop in same place.  You can kill piles of skels this way AND you can get piles of bone chips for doing it if you want.  Beats beating on your pet.<br />
<br />
Only thing is if you see a newbie Necro/SK in area let them have it.  While it is normally empty they need it more than we do.<br />
<br />
I do this every so often and it has kept me in bone chips and got my Evocation skill to 227.  INT is only 147 with C3 so skill increases hard to come by at this point.<br />
<br />
Also when sitting around wayfarers camps keep your low level undead nuke up.  Most of them have undead wandering through camp may as well do something while you are sitting around.</div></div><hr />
