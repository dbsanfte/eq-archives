<br />
My question is ...<br />
<br />
Why do men play female characters... ?:confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Calamity_Daemon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">er..good point...I made a Female High Elf enchantress once...it was really wierd being a chick and I did it for RP reasons but ended up deleting her because I was very uncomfortable with being a girl</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Paegan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I play a female half elf bard sometimes. Two strikes against me? Maybe... but I'm comfortable with my sexuality.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wrelk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">For me, it wasn't so clear cut.  I started a female shaman for my wife to play..however, she never really got into the game, so after about 20 levels she cancelled.  However, instead of leaving her on ice, I decided to continue leveling the shaman to use as a buff bot.  At the time my main was a monk.  However, I eventually became the shaman full time, shelving my monk.  Instead of rerolling a male shaman, I just kept playing the female.<br />
<br />
It got ugly along the way; people hit on you even if you don't even act like a female.  I never even once mislead someone into believing I was not a male (referring to my wife, etc).  However, it was always uncomfortable to an extent.  <br />
<br />
This wasn't much of an answer, except to note that not everyone who is playing a female is playing one by choice...sometimes its just how the cards fell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Saelaru Valsharen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I choose a female DE simply because of the looks - by far the best looking race / sex combo in the game imo... (was pre-SoL back then) ...<br />
<br />
However, as I have progressed, I'm pretty sure I would change to male if given the opportunity - the thing with other males hitting on you is just unbearable (didn't know EQ acted like a contact agency at that time)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Drynnious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Chicks get free stuff. I play a male, and i don't give chicks free stuff, but if you want to flirt a little with someone, lots of people will hook you up, even at level 1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Makkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Because it's a role playing game (note; game), not a dating service?

<br />
The other reason is dumbasses give female toons free shit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Lizarde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I think if not for guys playing female characters, there would be no female characters at all.  Because if you knew for sure that the female characters were also RL females, they'd be harrassed so much that they would quit or re-roll as male characters.  Heck, even with the high percentage of guys playing girls, they probably get requests for cyber all the damn time.<br />
<br />
I never could roll up a female character, but have no problem with the guys that do.  I figure a good 70% or more of female characters are RL guys.  So it isn't such a big deal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ajrarn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Simple answer is : &quot;why not ?&quot;</div></div><hr />

I tried to get my wife to play EQ so it wasn't such a burden on us with my addiction to EQ.<br />
<br />
Well, I created a Wood Elf Bard and enjoy playing the bard.  Some folks hit on me but I just ignore that.  I figure it would be very annoying to RL girls playing on EQ.  I don't tell them that I am a guy unless they are my friends on EQ.  They mess with me but I have fun.  <br />
<br />
I like it because others treat you better just because they believe you are a female.  They are more abrupt to males.  Heck, I get into 100 pct more arguments as a male toon than when I am on my female toon.<br />
<br />
It really is no big deal really.</div></div><hr />

Actually most girls love attention, and like getting hit on. Unless they are married or something.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you cant manage to tell some guys who try to jump on you to fuck off tho, dont play a female char.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>UnholyWarrior</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Actually most girls love attention, and like getting hit on. Unless they are married or something.<br />
<br />
Im not a girl, however in my experiences with them (I know many) they don't like 'getting hit on'.  I suppose its human nature (not male or female) to like &lt;u&gt;positive&lt;/u&gt; attention; however to much 'hitting on' is not of the positive sort.  Its all how you do it, I suppose.<br />
<br />
By the way, married women like positive attention, too (preferably from their spouses)...<br />

So, all my other characters are male except my SK.  It is interesting if I am carrying a blunt weapon how many people assume I am a druid (even though I am in full plate).<br />

I really dont see the problem with playing a female character!  I've made female characters before and the only thing I didnt like was the run and fight animations.  Most look like they're handicapped or something.  Personally I like to choose characters that stand out and what stands out more than a female gnome tanking something!?</div></div><hr />

Three people have been banned or quit because of me (not something I'm proud of, but one can only take so much before they do take action). But on the flipside, I could never play a male character full time, I 'm a girl and I like looking like a girl.<br />

 I've had *way* too many guys accuse me of being male when I tell them that I'm NOT interested in whatever lame cybering ideas they have. Also been accused of being a lesbian, apparently no &quot; normal woman&quot; would refuse the advances of some sloppy, geeked out little sixteen year old idiot. Gimme a fecking break! <br />
<br />
 I know alot of guys that play female toons, and even more women that play male toons. Most play their male toons so they'll be left alone and can enjoy EQ without getting harassed.  <br />
<br />
 And don't forget that /ignore is always your friend</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yup. I play(ed) a male DE Enchanter for that reason.<br />
Female DE SK here, and yes, I get hit on a LOT during play. I have gotten used to it, and if someone is being an idiot and I don't know them... /ignore.<br />
<br />
I too have been accused of being a male IRL when I told someone to fudge off when they started to try and cyber me.<br />
<br />
As for guys playing females... I know a few, some started a female toon because the &quot;job&quot; seemed to be better suited to a girl char (Cleric / Enchanter at the top of that list.... go figure) but some made a female char because they liked the look of them.<br />
<br />
Personally? You hit on me, I will hit on you - just maybe not *quite* the way you'd like me hitting on you... *swings her axe*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Calamity_Daemon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Whenever anyone in EQ says they are a chick in RL some idiot ALWAYS and it never fails, says: &quot;r u a hott gerl!?&quot; and then usually this results in temporary silence then it goes ignored or gets into a large fight..whatever comes first</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Azaezel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Heh, as far as females getting hit on, I actually know one or two RL females who hooked up on EQ. One even moved to live by her BF she met on EQ and they are probably getting married.<br />

I certainly don't pretend to be female at any time, nor do I play along with the tards in the guild with male ogres who make &quot;advances&quot;. <br />
<br />
We do and have had a character or two who was female but is/was in actuality a male, yet pretend to be a female on and off line.  The one no longer in the guild even went as far as to send some of the acutal males in the guild pictures of &quot;herself&quot; which turned out to be his girlfriend.  Freak.  The current one is pretty much an ass and if it really was a female would be the most obnoxious piece of crap in existance.</div></div><hr />

It was a female wood elf.  I made it just to log on and chat with friends (I had quit and deleted.  I wanted to check in with old friends.)<br />

Yes, I am female. I play because my husband got me hooked. <br />
<br />
(Actually he bet me I couldn't make it to level 3 before quiting... When he got home that evening I was  around level 10 and pretty much told him he had to buy himself another account, because he wasn't getting his old one back, I was addicted!)<br />
<br />
At any rate, I made a male toon... And I swear the idiotic females that just threw themsleves at me, asking if I liked how their boobs bounced when they jumped, to asking how much I would give them for cyber... TOO WEIRD for me!<br />
<br />
I haven't made a male toon since. I haven't recieved any UBER loot, maybe a flower or two, but never anything worth while. <br />

Suppose it could be because I refuse to lie down on that cyberific bed...<br />

Look at the topic of this post,  and the person who replied to it.  This  person has a female signature.  But no woman that I have ever met has used these types of poorly phrased explicitives.  At least not any women who couldn't play the line for the Packers.  My assesment is that there is someone out there who just had to attack anyone they could find on this thread,  just because somewhere deep down it cast aspersions to their fragile manhood. <br />
<br />
Play whatever toon you want.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Ruuti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">You know Vinnayeny,  I wanna know if the best thing you can come up with is insult the equipment on my 65 sk?   Cause not having uber equipment means that really I have something that interfeers with getting Uber equipment,  like a life. <br />
<br />
Unlike you,  you lurk these boards and contribute nothing usefull to anyone.  You flame people who post on this thread cause they don't quite get why people would wanna play a toon that is not the same sex as them.  You don't even give a good explanation for why you do it,  hell no,  you break out with fuck tard, asshatt,  and fuck turd. <br />
<br />
 WHY?   <br />
<br />
Cause not only are you stupid,  you are fucking gay, AND in denial,  at your computer screen  there is a man that is as queer a 3 dollar fucking bill,  I don't even assume this because your toon is female,  I know it cause you are so god damn insecure you have to lash out like a rabid dog at anyone who happens to disagree with you on the subject.  SO the fact that your brother BILLY RAY forces you to be on the recieving end of getting  pipe in your ass doesn't make you gay,  just that you fucking love it does.  Now go lay in the bath tub and cry for a few hours.....</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">ill remember that while im making sweet love to my girlfriend right after ive looted 2 more peices of vex thal lootz thx~<br />
<br />
btw dont crai IRL cause you suck, i know...its not your fault.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Scrion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">Hmmmm...on second thought I deleted my old post cause it probably belongs in the flame section....<br />
<br />
So I'll post something actually constructive. Personally, I can't be a female in-game, just cause I wouldn't know how to play one. If a male wants to give it a shot, go ahead. <br />
<br />
The real problem lies in the 14 yr olds who are hitting on the female characters, hmmm? I mean, flirting is one thing, but I've met some sick, twisted indidivuals in EQ. Not as if they will go away...I think they are now as much a part of Everquest as anyone else. So I think anyone - male or female - who makes a female char is going to have to deal with them. I don't think you can escape human stupidity anywhere.<br />
To paraphrase Albert Einstein: &quot;There are only two things that are infinite: the universe and human stupidity. Of the two, I am only sure of the latter.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Ruuti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">its true,  I suck.  But it is only on your girlfriend while you are looting that Vt shit.  Enjoy your sloppy seconds....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Scarus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">It's funny.  Only an hour ago I was thinking that this place wasn't quite as much of a shithole as it was 3-4 months ago.  I'm glad that's cleared up!<br />
Seriously, why can people on here not just discuss* things in a vaguely adult manner?  Too many teenage goths attracted to the class?  Beats me.<br />
<br />
Back to the topic... I know one one female character who's definately a man in real life, he convinces players he's a lesbian.<br />
<br />
<br />
*Poorly spelt obscenities and &quot;lols I gots teh ubber loop&quot; do not a discussion make.  <br />
<br />
PS: There's only one T in fuckwit. Considering the complete lack of wit in your post that struck me as sort of ironic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>krayzii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">LOL <br />
<br />
<br />
 i like Scarus<br />
  He is one of the only people not to flame someone since this post started not to mention he hasnt called anyone a turd biscuit but lets see   <br />
<br />
hahaha dude its a VIDEO GAME imo your a fucking turd biscuit for caring <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
True it is a video game... Then why do such people as Vinnayeny Vloshanaal<br />
 feel that they have to be an asshole over a simple question:<br />
   Why do men play female characters... ?<br />
  i will tell you why.... it is because he is just a very insecure guy who got his ass beat one to many times and it makes him feel big to sit on the computer and poke fun at some person who he doesnt even know.... if Zado or anyone else doesnt agree with guys that play female toons then guess what ..... You cant do anything about it so just leave it be...<br />
Just because some chick turned you down doesnt mean take it out on some guy over the internet..... bro thats what counseling is for.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now i know your prolly thinking damn this Krayzii guy is fukking retarded and has no damn clue what he is talking about,you know what though... i have no clue what im talking about either:cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>krayzii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">That was a pretty fukking stupid reply <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Im sorry everyone...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Seinharu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">Lol your right you know i really think some of the adults on this thing are alot more immature than teens and kids! *Crosses her arms in front of her and kicks her feet lightly.* now now, on Eq i am a RL gal and play gal toons, I couldnt really play a male character full time, but i like to help my friends male chars lvl up (he said he cant play girls lol) .<br />
<br />
On my server ive bene hit on just a bit and it was on my first char on that server... a Dark elf Enc hit on me quite awhile, and a VS warrior a few more i know but i cant think of it atm) Im a bit of a flirt and i like to tease these ppl who hit on me it dont bother me really and have never been asked for cyber (some half elf in the bazaar dose that /shrug) <br />
<br />
yet human stupidity and compition shall  be imortal dont you all think? o Btw girls if your gettin hit on just play with their heads... and if they get the message they my never hit on yeh again... and as a girl IVE NEVER gotten free stuff cause i was a girl, yet i know a guy who plays female chars alot and thinks its because they get free stuff and are more fit to play a certain class.. i personally belive hes gay... he's married on all his female chars to guy chars that are prolly guys in RL (Eq of course)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>krayzii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">I agree with everything you just said<br />
:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Seinharu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">:p  hehehhehe, anyway.....<br />
<br />
Most guys play girl chars for either their Pleasure, They want a girl they can look at, but not touch, They are Gay, They was to experiance what its like to b a female? (I remember a younger friend of mine talking about opposet Gender day at her middle school, the guys stuffed their shirts with huge baloons, then stuck their friend's ,who didnt want to lose their so called dignity, faces inbetween their 'boobs' ballons..../shiver)<br />
<br />
But girls who play guys want Pleasure... Guys they can look at ect, Want respect, do not want to find relationships in game unless they are Lesbians, They want to be treated not with bein hit on, and just like maybe even better with all the poker guys.... lol.... <br />
<br />
Anyway..............  (Do i say Anyway to much?) its not a big deal people have their own issues and we shouldnt care, if your a honry pervert and want cyber either look for a online prositute or go to a strip club.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>krayzii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">:D  Haha  Nah actually in RL i got a habit of sayin anyway way to much but *anyways* i was gonna play a female necro but i decided to just play a male gnome necro because i think it is funny to see a midget FD LOL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>Seinharu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">LOL! i see my friend had a gmone necro and he loved to use glitches and Fd.... i think he was banned /shurg</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>krayzii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">LOL....That sucks<br />
 hahaha my friend got banned for doin suntin like that also bad thing is, is that it was one of my only RL friends that played EQ LOL i ended up givin him the alt account i hadnt used very much but i think he learned his lesson.</div></div><hr />

I have a DE warrior thats female that I play from time to time...only because with the back view on I can watch her ass cheeks sway when she runs and fights.../shrug. Better than spending 100$ at a strip club..=)  <br />
<br />
This is possibly one of the most depressing statements that I've seen.  I don't know how anyone could compare sitting in front of a computer screen watching a toon sexually with the actual human interaction of a strip club.<br />
<br />
I play one female character (halfling warrior) simply because I like the two tone look of the plate mail armor.  I also wanted to play a halfling warrior, and think that the male halfling model looks way to pudgy (not all halflings are fat) and the helm graphic is awful (thought not as bad as half elves mind you).</div></div><hr />
