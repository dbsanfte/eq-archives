Was just trying to help keep threads cogent by making a place for it. :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
But seriously, if you don't contribute to a thread and I see a bunch of bumping posts just to raise your numbers I might have to do something.<br />
<br />
Signal vs Noise &gt; all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lejina Bloodbath</div><div class="date">03-25-2002, 12:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Whats the point to pump up your number of posts?<br />
<br />
So the peoples may see the number and think &quot;wow, this post must be important look at his post count!&quot; and they have more interest in what you are saying?<br />
Give me a break.<br />
<br />
Its the content of your posts that is(may be) worth something. Your number of post dont give any added value to what you may say.<br />
<br />
The peoples are here for informations and to talk of the shadowknight class, mindless thread spammer looking to increase their post count should be locked out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
True... but you know it man.. we all liked our regestration dates.  <br />
<br />
Gotta say though, thanks for getting this new board up and running so fast man.  :D</div></div><hr />

R.I.P. May 2000 Registration...<br />

Oh well, I'm a Shadow Knight, I'll just figure out something underhanded...<br />

I was a member of the knightwatch since sometime late 2000... granted not quite as old as some of you guys, but old enough to qualify as &quot;sorta&quot; old school...  <br />
<br />
I never cared about the number next to my name... I dont really care about it now honestly...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bludge</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 12:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I personally think post counts on any message board lead to spamming and meaningless junk posts. Sure, most people won't do it, but inevitably, you end up with people saying things like...<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;yo, wassup&quot;<br />
<br />
and<br />
<br />
&quot;hehe&quot;<br />
<br />
and<br />
<br />
&quot;Peasley, I love you&quot;<br />
<br />
If you want to see post count stupidity at it's worst, check out the Vault.  I don't even bother going there anymore.<br />
<br />
<br />
I've had 3 different names and registration dates and post counts at TKW.  None of them were really important to me in the least.  Now, Bludge is starting anew here with zero. No big deal.<br />
<br />
I am a message board fanatic. I have accounts at all the boards and different names at many simply because I registered with whatever character name I was playing for that class or at the time I registered on that board.   The continuity of someone at The Safehouse saying , yeah Bludge, I saw your post over at TKW&quot;, means nothing to me.  I've had people quote me to myself more than once when they didn't realize both were my different handles and it just tickled me more than anything else.  It's all about the info for me.  You either have it or you don't.  A post count bloated with pointless replies just doesn't cut it. <br />
<br />
Of course it's ridiculous to expect every post to be insightful and helpful, but post counts don't really increase the quality of the board, they just increase the amount of crap we have to sift through.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Just my .02</div></div><hr />

Oh...Peasley, what is the live music capital of the world? And what qualifies it as such?</div></div><hr />

The thought has crossed my mind. If it remains to be such a big issue i will probably look into doing just that</div></div><hr />
