<br />
This affects necros pretty badly pre60 as well, there's several discussions on the necro board. In one patch they've killed 3 of the primary 4 ways a necro solos. Charm nerf, aggro kiting nerf (now pets get -way- too much aggro, so we lose a ton of pet dps) and the fear kiting. All we have now is root rotting and aggro kiting without pet.<br />
<br />
Fear has become less and less viable with PoP, but to lose it as an option entirely brings up the whole &quot;balancing&quot; thing.  If we can't fear kite, we need to have other options, necros and sk.<br />
<br />
It's the same story - they nerf SK and claim it's because to have a bunch of spells, when 95% of them are utterly uesless.<br />
<br />
Thanks VI. Keep on screwing the SK/Necros, we love it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Keyan Aubaine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The new pathing isn't flawless yet, but is already better than the old one. Fixing the many retarded pathing bugs everywhere is a good thing in my book, i just wish all the players screaming for fixes when it doesn't benefit them would realize fixing things that don't benefit them is as important, if not more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have always had a mob go in a straight line when I am fear kiting it,  when using either my 51 SK, or my 21 Necro.<br />
<br />
On a rare occasion I have had mobs go back and forth as you put it, but usualy they just go in a straight line, sometimes but rarely changing direction 90 degrees if hit hard enough or stunned.<br />
<br />
Now I know of some places, Velks for example where my groups had Bard Fear song on, causing the spiders to run back and forth, so all we have to do is keep slashing away non stop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Venae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I don't see that a mob running in a straight line is that big a deal anyway.  If I'm kiting in a place where I don't want a mob to stray too far, I just keep track of my fear duration.  When it's close to wearing off I back off and let the sucker charge me again.  When we get back to around where I started kiting, fear again and off it walks on the same path we just went.  Not 100% efficient, but less annoying than dealing with adds that my mob paths into...at least for me.<br />
<br />
Sorry if that's incredibly obvious or something, but it works quite well for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rugs Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I honestly enjoy using the original fear as much for a taunt pulling spell in PoP as when it lands and makes the mob run away :)<br />
<br />
Ya, I dont get why some of our disease based stat taps dont land on nearly anything these days and fear only works on 55 or under mobs.  Seems by this account pallies shouldnt be able to stun 55+ mobs.<br />
<br />
The day the make lifetaps disease based im gonna get a noose, hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>dzenith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Omg no, you can't exploit bugged/bad pathing to get super easy exp with no risk anymore.  This definately needs to be changed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Spylmann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">And we were ALL using it for exploiting, as we will all admit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Makkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It's just changed quite a bit. Most of the zones I tried were changed, but some are the same. I jumped the gun a little when I tested 3 or 4 zones and the mobs all pathed to the center of zone when feared..<br />
<br />
Bear in mind I have a necro - fear kiting isn't viable past 60 for xp, but it's still something I have quite a lot of experience with. <br />
<br />
This mostly affects lower level characters. They'll just have to adjust to the changes. In some zones, it's simply no longer viable.<br />
<br />
Define &quot;exploit&quot;. There is(was) no exploit when mobs go side to side when hit. It was the way pathing worked then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>cigarskunk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">They @#$%ed the JP poacher camp - now the poachers all run to the west - basically right through thier buddies - nearly got me killed several times this evening.<br />
<br />
Worse yet, they increased the aggro range of the poachers resulting in even more lost time due to adds and getting a buddy killed as well.<br />
<br />
And just to add insult to injury, I think they broke the darkness line - those poachers were running way faster this evening under dooming darkness then they were a few nights ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Amphitryon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Personally I like this pathing change for kiting, now I have a realy good chance of knowing where the mob is going to go and set him up like a billiards shot.<br />
<br />
beside it make sense the mob would run in a beeline away from you on a fear..i want to get the hell away from you...having them run around like headless chickens all the time never made much sense.<br />
<br />
I think the biggest complaint in this is that mobs are not getting stuck in walls, stuck in paths that go nowhere, etc..that basically the  known but rarely spoke of exploit spots are dissapearing. and that what VI is doing, fixing the oft complained about pathing problems..course that automatically included cleaning up the pathing exploit spots too<br />
<br />
course they could make the mobs in PoJ fearable again, not that it would do a lot of good now since they prolly wont get stuck anymore (which is the only reason people wanted to hunt there in the first place)<br />
<br />
and dont feel too sorry for the necros since they can still just root rot mobs..takes more mana but they are far from being helpless.<br />
<br />
The upside once again is the mobs should path nicely when aggro kiting, less of a change for them to take weird tangents trying to get to you</div></div><hr />
