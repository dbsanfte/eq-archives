<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shaion De'luthien</div><div class="date">03-25-2002, 06:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">On top of my head, here are some:<br />
<br />
Shadowknights and paladins are: Baron, Sir, Duke.<br />
Cleric is: Baroness, Venerable, Exarch. <br />
Shaman and druid are: Baron, Venerable, Elder.<br />
Rogue is: Baron, Veteran, Marauder.<br />
Warrior is: Baron, Veteran, Marshall.<br />
Enchanter, magician and wizards are: Baron, Master, Sage.<br />
Necromancer is: Baron, Sage, Lich.<br />
Monk is: Baron, Brother, Sensei.<br />
Ranger: Baron, Veteran, Hunter.<br />
Beastlord is: Baron, Venerable, Elder.<br />
Bard is: Baron, Veteran, Impresario.<br />
<br />
Then of course, the girls have alittle different, like Lady instead of Sir, mistress instead of Master, Sister instead of brother, Muse instead of Impresario, Huntress instead of hunter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lilubo</div><div class="date">03-25-2002, 08:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">why?!?! why must i share the title with a stinking paladin? i would prefer a individual title like...errr....i don't know... something else other then &quot;Duke&quot;:p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xarshaaz Dreadbones</div><div class="date">03-25-2002, 10:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the replies people, and I agree, they could have made up a little more titles, for instance the necros archtype title is same as mages classtype title...<br />
<br />
And my god why? Why do we share a title with our no-good good-doers?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">synnoira</div><div class="date">03-25-2002, 11:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">do they have a turn off title function yet?<br />
in the event that sometime i wind up with one i don't want to be carrying it around<br />
those names fit for pallys but they just seem to go with sk's for me<br />
ronin, shogun, khan, that sort of thing i'd like</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xarshaaz Dreadbones</div><div class="date">03-25-2002, 11:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why not just revenant or reaver or something in that direction... As for myself, I would like the title master of death or something :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lilubo</div><div class="date">03-25-2002, 12:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i say that we demand that VI gives us a new title or.....errr.....me and my troll brotheren (sp?) will steal there wives/girlfriends with our superior troll cha and we will eat there children too :p<br />
muahahahahahahahahaha :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xilith</div><div class="date">03-25-2002, 12:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally I think for the highest level of aaxp they should use each class' lvl 60 name.<br />
<br />
Grave Lord Xilith sounds cool, but I guess it could suck to be <br />
Grave Lord Blah the Grave Lord...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Duke Vendric Ravenkrest</div><div class="date">03-25-2002, 02:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally I don't mind Duke that much. Not after being one. It's kinda grown on me. That and...<br />
<br />
&quot;A nobleman with the highest hereditary rank, especially a man of the highest grade of the peerage in Great Britain.&quot; - Dictionary.com<br />
<br />
But then, then, the title I would prefer as our class title is Lord...<br />
<br />
&quot;A man of renowned power or authority. &quot;<br />
&quot;A man who has mastery in a given field or activity. &quot; - Dictionary.com<br />
<br />
But I still think Duke has its place in our titles. For us, I think the titles should be...<br />
<br />
Baron, Duke, Lord<br />
Baroness, Dutchess, Lady<br />
<br />
Other classes have their name issues as well. Take the rogue title Marauder, for example. I can't think of a single rogue who likes that name. Also, what's with Necro's being called Sage in Archetypes and other int casters being called Sage in Class titles? Does that seem a bit off to anyone else? And wouldn't Master be a more appropriate Class title for int casters instead of an Archetype title?<br />
<br />
And personally, as far as the knight classes go, I don't see any harm in us sharing a title. We are, after all, both knights. Anyway, here's an idea of what the could have done:<br />
<br />
Warrior:<br />
. Combatant Veteran General<br />
. Combattant Veteran General<br />
Cleric:<br />
. Acolyte Exarch Patriarch<br />
Paladin: <br />
. Baron Duke Lord<br />
. Baroness Dutchess Lady<br />
Ranger:<br />
. Scout Veteran Hunter<br />
. Scout Veteran Huntress<br />
Shadow Knight :<br />
. Baron Duke Lord<br />
. Baroness Dutchess Lady<br />
Monk:<br />
. Pugilist Brother Sensei<br />
. Pugilist Sister Sensei<br />
Rogue: <br />
. Pilferer Bandit Brigand<br />
Shaman:<br />
. Seer Theurgist Elder<br />
Enchanter:<br />
. Charmer Mesmerist Sage</div></div><hr />
