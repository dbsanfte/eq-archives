<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tropics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was reading on the Arena section and it seems fear is now a spell that people are using for taunt? I am taking it that mobs that are too high for fear or invoke fear are the mobs to use this against? I had never thought about using fear to taunt. A mob that is immune to fear still gets taunted pretty good from this? I was using Clinging Darkness since comming back to EQ. When I left DC was nerfed only months ago and CD was the new main taunt spell as the Terror line sucked, and still does it seems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Marruk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You are correct.  Fear generates really nice aggro against mobs that are immune.  It really shines, imo, for mezzed mobs.  Disarm + taunt + fear and you should have a nice aggro lock before mez is even broken.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's good non damage aggro generation.<br />
<br />
Only time I use fear is in high risk ldons, GoD trials, and Raids(minus uqua). For just a regular group I just use CD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Fear is good for non-damage aggro - CD breaks mez - and for when you need more aggro than you're getting from chaining CD alone.  Otherwise, CD is better, especially considering affliction haste 1 tribute.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">We use taunt for taunt, fear for non-damage aggro. The taunt button is one of our best tools, you may have been mixing up taunt and aggro terms.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Arikash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I don't think I've used my taunt button since I started tanking in PoV, to unreliable.</div></div><hr />

... so you've never lost agro once? grats</div></div><hr />

 :eek:  :eek:  :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tillesia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I don't think I've used my taunt button since I started tanking in PoV, to unreliable.<br />

Wow.  I can't imagine why you would stop if you know how taunt works.  It's annoying when it fails, sure, but being put atop the aggro list at the push of a button is pretty nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Arikash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I do know how taunt works, it puts you on the top of the aggro list +1, which is a good reason not to mash it.  And no, I don't lose aggro very often, and when I do, I just cast CD again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Try just casting CD once to get agro from your chanter who just failed mezz and slow on a mob in GoD..... CD does shit, and THAT is where Taunt is your only option. It doesn't matter how much agro they have; with the push of a button, you get more than them. No, it doesn't work every time, but when it does, both you and whoever you just saved breathe a sigh of relief.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Oagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Aye, mez is outrageous aggro.  My chanter buddy and I will play aggro games on mobs occasionally.  Mez will steal it everytime, now matter how much I've built up.  We're fortunate that we have the snap aggro we do.  However, to say you don't have to use the taunt button means you're handicapping yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Your new sig sucks almost as much as SK's who think they're too cool for the taunt button.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Probably time to post another taunt clinic, or bump one of the old threads for the newer SK's.<br />
<br />
If you are not using it, you are short changing yourself as a tank. And no, using taunt does not mean mashing taunt.<br />
<br />
If a 3k hitting add is loose and on your shammy, cleric or chanter, believe me you won't have time to cast Fear or CD, nor will a single cast likely be enough aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Menon Lifeblight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">If you've lost aggro,<br />
<br />
Successful taunt + aggro spell &gt; No taunt + aggro spell<br />
<br />
Considering how little time it takes to hit the taunt button, taunt is always worth a try when you lose aggro, regardless of how often it is actually successful.  Just because it isn't &quot;reliable&quot; doesn't make it worthless.  It's an extremely valuable tool when used correctly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Successful taunt &gt; No taunt + any aggro spell<br />
<br />
Fact: Fixed your quote.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Thats not always the case.  He was right in the original statement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Culdahl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I use all the tools to get and hold aggro...IMO, you can't have to much aggro and the spells we use to generate aggro use very little mana.  On pulls I hit incoming mobs with festering darkness which brings them directly to me even if a slow is cast.  If the slower gets overzealous and slows, dots and debuffs back to back then a simple fear and/or taunt will fix that.  I usually only use CD when I'm not sure whether the mobs are immune to fear (I.E. - normal LDoNs)...IMO, fear generates more aggro then CD does.  When breaking mezz I taunt, cast fear, cast festering darkness, then attack.....I have had VERY few instances where I didn't get instant aggro on the break.</div></div><hr />
