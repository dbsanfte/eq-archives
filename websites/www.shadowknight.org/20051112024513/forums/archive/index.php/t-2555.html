<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xelbaaz</div><div class="date">06-13-2002, 01:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi folks!<br />
<br />
When EQ released in March of 1999, I played a Rogue to 22 and started an Erudite Enchanter in July of 1999, which I still play today.  I love my character, but have always been intrigued with the SK class.  I've been wanting to start one up, but I keep going back and forth on what race I should pick.<br />
<br />
I started a Gnome SK, because I've always wanted to play a Gnome, but I stopped...<br />
<br />
I started a DE SK, because I liked the way that DE SK's looked in the old graphics, but really hate the way they look in the new Luclin graphics, I stopped...<br />
<br />
I tried playing an Ogre SK, almost mainly for the high STR and STA of the Ogre race, slamming, etc...  but I stopped...<br />
<br />
Thinking about perhaps that a Troll would be nice for the Regen, and thinking about that regen in the higher level (post 50's), how nice it would be, adding AA points into more regen, maybe adding a Fungi tunic, and soloing to my hearts content in FG or something...<br />
<br />
A buddy of mine stopped playing EQ (51st lvl DE SK) and I've played his toon a bit, reading up on the SK spell lines, reading what spells work well in different situations, etc.  From an Enchanters perspective watching SK's Shadow Vortex Line, prior to breaking mez, etc.... so I'm not completly clueless... but I don't feel right really playing my buddies SK, because I'm the type of person that leans more towards accomplishing things myself, i.e. - I'd never let anyone play my Enchanter, never PL'd, etc, because it's important for me to do it myself, just to say, &quot;I did it!&quot;<br />
<br />
So, with all that...  (and I've read other posts here for that past week or so, reading the input from other people) I'm wondering what you guys think...<br />
<br />
Troll?  Gnome?  Ogre?  I might go DE just for the Ultravision, to not have to go through the blindness I went through with my Erudite Enchanter, etc....<br />
<br />
Thanks for any tips, hints, links, help, etc.<br />
<br />
Synd is a pretty prominant SK on my server, so maybe I should ask him some of these things online as well...<br />
<br />
Thanks again!</div></div><hr />

Most just say go with what feels right. I do not think one race has much of an advantage ove the other. Maybe at some point but not enough to notice. Just do your starting stats right. Like my DE this time around I put it all into stamina. Thats a hard one to raise. Str is easy dex is easy agility is easy. You need stamina in high end game for more hps which equals to tanking more, at the very end this can be the difference of 300 - 600 hps more. Go with what race you like to play.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xelbaaz</div><div class="date">06-13-2002, 02:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yea, I was going to dump as many, if not all points into STA as possible...<br />
<br />
To quote Jihad from Xev (another person I considered to be prominant on Xev) a while back when I asked him:<br />
<br />
&quot;Dump all of your points into STA regardless of race&quot;<br />
<br />
(not in any order)<br />
I think Peasley, Jihad, Anaryllis and Synd are all people who play SK's that I respect, I guess I'll keep asking them questions and bug the sh*t out of them.... =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Steam</div><div class="date">06-13-2002, 02:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I concur..<br />

My preference based on that...<br />
<br />
Erudite<br />
Iksar<br />
Troll<br />
Human<br />
DE<br />
Ogre</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nasiir</div><div class="date">06-13-2002, 02:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">At the high end, all races tend to cap out important stats. <br />
I'd agree that it all boils down to aesthetics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peasley Grunglefunk</div><div class="date">06-13-2002, 03:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">no love for me xelbaaz? =)<br />
<br />
woops didn't read farther down =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">synnoira</div><div class="date">06-13-2002, 03:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">agility 75, after you've checked that (i think only erudites and ogres have to add points) it's all about what looks best</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xelbaaz</div><div class="date">06-13-2002, 03:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What does the 75 AGI buy one?<br />
<br />
Is that a cap of some kind?  a cut-off?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Steam</div><div class="date">06-13-2002, 03:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What does the 75 AGI buy one?  <br />
<br />
It's a huge difference in AC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Skurrge</div><div class="date">06-13-2002, 04:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, if you like looking like Kelsey Grammer, go for the erudite.. on your downtime, people can play handball off your forehead.. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kanekra Soulreaver</div><div class="date">06-13-2002, 05:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If I had it to do over, I wish I had made a Troll SK and put every point in to STA, well maybe a few into int also, for soloability. If you dont solo much, then I would say ogre. I wish many times that I could slam, as I always use a 2 hander. So IMO Troll or Ogre is the way to go. Of course, most shortcomings can be overcome with gear and skill, but it would be nice to have nice stats to start with. Make what you want and think you'll stick with however.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xelbaaz</div><div class="date">06-13-2002, 05:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've played an Erudite this whole time, well aware of the shiny forehead. =)  <br />
<br />
But my Chanter is DOPE!  <br />
<br />
Don't mess!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pheargore</div><div class="date">06-13-2002, 06:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Trolls are the only race that live in balance with their habitat...<br />
<br />
(well other than other races deemed evil that can't be played by players)<br />
<br />
That is why I play one.<br />
<br />
All the other cities are too big, take up too much space and have too much trash around :)<br />
<br />
- Peace</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Skek</div><div class="date">07-02-2002, 07:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally I love playing the Lizzy, though the xp penalties blow goats, and the hunchback of notra damm would feel right at home in cabalis.  Don't get me started on our women's taste in makeup.... :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Really if you're thinking End Game, Lizzies are good.  They can wear 90 perc of all the top end armor, have a natural ac boost which is nice when your kit starts evening out with all the other people you play with, you can see in the dark, and finally have a nice balanced set of stats.  Again if I could start again, I would pump everything in to sta.<br />
<br />
On the other hand... you got to play what feels right for you.  Originally I started roleplaying as a Lithhy with a Lithp, but we had a character playing in guild at the time called Sasaris.. Lol it got so bad at times I eventually gave up.... you try typing Thatheritheth thalamie thandwich a few times and you get the picture.  Heh heh was fun for a while, and that's how I started along the long trail :D <br />
<br />
Certainly made me feel more into playing the character.  Basically all the stats in the world make no difference if you're not having fun.  Think up a persona, try it out and if you like it... play it.  Don't let others sway you from what you enjoy.  Heck it's a long road to 60.</div></div><hr />
