Looked around the SK guild and couldn't find them. If you know where they are please let me know!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Saruton</div><div class="date">03-30-2002, 08:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most of them arnt found in Cabilis, just ask a friend to get them for you in the Outpost or Grobb or even Neriak ( not sure if they have them ). And some can be found at the Necro Spell Vendors in West Cabilis. Those in the cave on the left hand side of the Necro Guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Litoc</div><div class="date">03-30-2002, 09:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Which cave are you talking about? I found the little huts but no cave? Or is it in the area where you enter WW?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Saruton</div><div class="date">03-30-2002, 11:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you are in West Cabilis looking to the entrance of the Necromancer Guild just before the bridge, turn left and behind some rocks you should see some NPCs. Those are spell vendors. To get to them just swim along the channel and hop out of the water at the end of it. Warslick Woods exit is just north of the vendors. Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

For the missing spells. I got them in Oggok. A friend made a new Char there and got the spells for me.<br />
<br />
Hope you will get your Spells soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drakvar Shadowstalker</div><div class="date">03-31-2002, 11:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The spells that I couldn't buy in Cabilis I got in Grobb.  I was also able to do this without any help.  As a Lizard the guards didn't seem to like me that much, but the vendors selling the spells didn't seem to care what I was.  Seems plat is all they care about.<br />
<br />
You have to be careful however.  After buying the spells I invised just intime to avoid a guard heading down the hall to the vendors.<br />
<br />
Good luck and I hope invis don't fail ya</div></div><hr />

<br />
Many of your spells are available from the Necro Merchants near the Arena in Cabilis.  However, 4 Spells are not available:  Summon Dead, Shadow Sight, Invoke Fear, and Breath of the Dead.  These four spells can be purchased in Grobb or Oggok OR you can ask a friendly necro mancer to create them through research.  I think Oggok would be difficult to do on your own, but Grobb can be done fairly easily.  As stated, the merchants in Grobb will sell to you (indifferent) but the bashers do not like you.  Use invis to get there and time your de-cloak for when the wandering guard leaves that area; purchase spells; cloak; then depart - simple.  Have FD memed just in case you happen to draw the guard's attention - like I did (invis dropped before he wandered away :( ).  Good Luck!!<br />
<br />
Also, remember that Life Leech is a quest spell.</div></div><hr />
