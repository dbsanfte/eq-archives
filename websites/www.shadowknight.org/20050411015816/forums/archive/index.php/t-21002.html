<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kutsokare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First time poster here, long time lurker.  Just an idea I had recently:  Let's say you can't pet pull, due to the &quot;pet is/is not green to the mob&quot; issue, and at the same time there is no one able to tag for you in FD pulling.  Would it not be possible to create a cross between the two, i.e. You have your pet guard far behind you, Pull mobs, FD, and make your pet tag for you with /pet attack.  Then you /pet hold him and he runs the single behind you?  Flame me if you will, It's just an idea I thought i'd throw out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You have to hope the other mobs you pulled go back and reset before the pet dies.<br />
<br />
I dont know if the pet will go back to where he is gaurding, just stand in place and not attack, or come to you where you are FD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You can definitely try that, but you could also just whip out a lower level pet...we have a collection of pets that specialize in 'conning' green...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmm, I feign, /pet attack, /pet backoff all the time. Never had a problem with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rhumba_Kween</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Pets also respond to /pet hold while fd'd</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>DConquest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well if I understand this right... all the mobs will aggro the pet anyway if he's &quot; not green &quot; to them or one of them has a pet of their own.  <br />
<br />
What I used to do on a few pulls that included a lot of running room ( Like Rumblecrush ) is park the pet out to a side.  Run up to mob and cast your favorite aggro spell... get some distance and do it again.  Now send your pet after the mob.  Have a &quot; scouter &quot; ( preferably a rogue ) tell you when the pet attacks the mob and /pet back off or hold.    Wait a sec until your pet runs back to his guard spot and FD.  All the mobs will camp you a sec, and the target mob will immediately make a mad dash at your pet.  Have your scouter tag and reel him in.  Note this works best with bard speed, but isn't impossible with sow / aa depending on the mobs you're trying to pull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Strange, my pets never once responded to commands while im FD</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rhumba_Kween</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Strange, my pets never once responded to commands while im FD<br />
<br />
<br />
Do you have the commands in a hotkey that may have another portion of the hotkey that cannot be done while FD'd? I'd think that could make a difference, but not sure.<br />
<br />
I type my pet commands in when I'm FD'd, vs. using a hotkey.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Lejina Bloodbath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My pet respond to my commands regardless if i type them or if i use a hotkey when im FD.<br />
<br />
You probably just suck Brael, face it.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for the original question : those mobs are green, pull em all and beat the shit out of all of em. Problem solved.<br />
<br />
But, seriously, yes, your pet can tag for you. I did this a few time when killing VS. I'd tag VS, get him and a guard, so i FD. Then VS walks back home a tad before his buddy, so i sick my pet on the guard and /pet hold him back to the buff room. I now have my pet fighting that mob alone in the buff room and VS almost back to spawn point. Once VS back home, i stand and go help ole Jobeker.<br />
<br />
Can be tricky cuze the pet will go for the last mob that attacked you, so if in my exemple VS would have been the last mob to try to hit me, theres good odds the pet will ignore the guard and go straight to VS in his room. heh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
  That way you know he is going for the one you want him to, not the one who stomped you last:)<br />
<br />
Poor lil jabober is kinda dumb:(<br />
