I know my skill is too low at the moment but was wondering if it worth the cost of raising skill above 235 to attempt to make this armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nathus</div><div class="date">03-31-2002, 09:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">if its something you would like doing, then its worth it. If you want to get your smithing up to make it to wear, by the time you get your skill that high you will most likely have better armor.<br />
<br />
To get my smithing to 210 it has cost me around 8k so far, as well as days of nothing but padding farming/vendor mining.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bubonic</div><div class="date">03-31-2002, 09:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe I think I do it for kicks would be fun to make some alts and twink em with the stuff.   I got 6kpp right now and already have 151 skill. If anything I can twink a second DESK, a DEW or a DEC with the stuff.</div></div><hr />

So its not a one time deal, knock yourself out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Skek</div><div class="date">03-31-2002, 10:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Go for it.  Iv'e noticed a tendency for Verant to put quests in the game that require a high competence in various trade skills.  I find it nice that they've finally admitted that trade skills other than jewelcraft and alchemy, are not going to have any place in the world economy.   Making these skills valid for another reason such as a quest is only good news for those people who bust a gut working those skills up.  Just look at what's available out there now....<br />
<br />
Bane weapons<br />
Garzicor Quest (Using an EBN as my 2hs weapon just now and it's fabby)<br />
Thurgadin Prayer shawl etc etc<br />
<br />
Those are just a few that spring to mind.  You can bet your bottom dollar that there will be more.<br />
<br />
Now... If they'll just fix the damn trivial fizzle thing.  It's no fun spending 2 months on a quest, only to have the result fizzle to nothing on you.  It's never happened to me yet, but I've heard of plenty that is has.</div></div><hr />
