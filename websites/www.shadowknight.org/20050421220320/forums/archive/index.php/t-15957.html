<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>igniti0n</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">yo guys... i keep coming her and see you all talking about greenmist... im a fairly new SK and i was wondering if someone here could post an Inventory stats pic of Greenmist and one where it is being held. Also could you please either name and/or put pictures of swords etc that have like a flaming visual graphic... u know flames coming off it...???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Auronan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The sword looks like a cool looking 1-handed katana. I know when I got mine way back when, I would walk into zones and people would stop and look at it, wondering what it was and saying, &quot;Man that thing looks cool.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jackkal Darknite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">the walkthru has a link to a screenie of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kentsin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There are only 4 weapons I know of with a flaming effect.<br />
<br />
SoulFire<br />
Fiery Avenger<br />
Fiery Defender<br />
Spear of Fire<br />
<br />
The first 3 are all Paladin epic weapons so to speak, and the spear is another paladin only weapon from PoFire.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aelali</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The Greenmist basically looks like a Velium swiftblade, or if you have never seen one, go to the Warrens and look for a bronze Katana. That's the animation it has, which is pretty sweet IMO.<br />
<br />
I have noticed when I get into groups that 1 of 3 things happens when they see my weapon: A) The think it's a Velium swiftblade, and that I'm a looser. B) They say &quot;Hey, cool sword, can you link it&quot; Which is then followed by &quot;What does the proc do?&quot; ...which is then followed by a &quot;Damn that's nice&quot; OR c) The person who sees it knows it's the Greenmist and craps his pants. (I've been surprized aserveral times to join a group and instantly see &quot; IS THAT THE GREENMIST ?!?!?!?!&quot; coming from someone.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, there is no particle effect (like epics have) and I have noticed that many PoP items have particle effects (which used to at one time be an epic only think as far as I know) but I think it would be nifty if they added a particle effect to the Greenmist... Doesn't need to be anything overly flashy.. and actually I think the coolest thing would be to add a slight, mist looking green glow to the blade... well.. just a thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>krikk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I agree, a simple green glow or almost totally transparent mist would be awesome. The proc looks really cool, one of my favorite spell graphics. <br />
Here's a link to pic of sword/stats if you still wanted http://www.angelfire.com/mi4/greenmist/GMstats.jpg <br />
After having it for like 18 levels, I still rely on this sword sometimes in bad situations where I need HP bad, or need SV magic. It's a great weapon and not too hard to get if one knows what they're doin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Elrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Just a quick question - sorry for the hijack, but - does SA effect greenmist proc?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Nope.  SA only works with the imbue-self line (VE/SoD/SoC).  And since Greenmist proc is a dot, it doesnt work with SCF or ToL either.</div></div><hr />
