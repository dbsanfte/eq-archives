<br />
E: Let the punting commence!<br />
<br />
But anyways despite my personal feelings (and my experience in game with most Gnome players being jerks) they are a relativly good race to be an SK as their stats are simular to those of Dark Elves. <br />
<br />
Trolls are still the best SK though! *GRIN*</div></div><hr />

Despite what people say not as many around as I thought there would be.  The have decent starting stats and I always wanted to be a gnome melee class just dont like playing warriors.  Heck I am having so much fun I am debating stripping my main and going to my sk full time.  As for the &quot;they Roxxor dude&quot; stuff lets face it the most SK twinks you see are Dark Elves and if you don't believe me just walk through EC at any time of day and see who is twinking.  Anyway  as to the most gnomes are jerks I can't argue with that, but gets kind of annoying hearing everyone put down the gnomes then you see people cheering on troll dark elf and lizard twinks on this board every day.</div></div><hr />

It will make things more interesting than any other SK cookie cutters. Clockwork armor is only made by gnomes with tinker skill. It might be better armor for warriors than Sk but worth a fun. :)<br />

Here's a link (http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_tinkering_gnome.htm) to EQtrader. It was war/clr only but now SK can use it.<br />

In my opinion the big deal with Gnome SK's is just a stupid fad.  If you need proof look at what happined when Erudite Sk's were introduced.  The Tox n00b area were crowded, twinks running rampant. Nowadays take a look around.  How many Erudite Sk's do you actually see running around now.  This all lasted about a couple of weeks.  I have a 31 Gnome SK in my guild that is selling off all his gear and making a bard now.  <br />
<br />
To me the bottom line is people are briefly flocking to make twinks, figure out that SK's are not an easy class to play, and then move on.  In the short run this will make it harder for the &quot;real&quot; SK's to find gear.  Remember the old CT when some jerk would want a decayed drop for his twink...same thing applies.<br />
<br />
Also E is just as good an answer.  I thought the gnome Necro was a slight stretch at first but the male gnomes especially have that mad scientist/crackpot look to them.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thenger</div><div class="date">04-05-2002, 10:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know, I just find the idea odd m'self.  All other SK races seem strong in mental and physical powers.  When you look at a gnome, he stands what 3 feet tall, and looks better to be thrown infront of a dragon to take the attention of the real raid.  I find the whole idea rather insulting to the Shadow Knight class.  <br />
<br />
You have ogres, big nasty and mean.  Trolls pretty close to Ogres in what is felt.  Humans, well humans can pretty much be every class except what two, and I have no problem with human SK's except their night vision sucks, but all in all is a proud member of the shadow knights.  Dark Elves, well what can I say I feel in love with the race while reading R.Salvator books a long long time ago, and I had to create a dark elf SK.  Dark elves, what they lack in physical prowess, they make up the mind, and I see them as perhaps the most cold and ruthless race.  Iskar another good race to be Shadow Knights, the whole back ground of the race as being evil to the core.  Erudite a race I have no problem with since they are an off-shoot of the human race as well as having a dark and evil past.<br />
<br />
Now all these races are seen as being evil and not to be messed with, and I have respect for every person that plays a Shadowknight and what race they choose.  They are in the end the true die hard players who choose a hard class and race to play full time.  As for gnomes, I don't see them as being scary in any shape way or form, they are not a race to instill fear to any creature.  Let them play their necro's and warriors, but leave them out of the true evil path, the path of the shadow knights!</div></div><hr />

Well I guess it makes sense for the two least intelligent races to be the only inteligence based hybrid.  Second I can't believe people saying they wont help a gnome Sk no matter what.  Man I remeber when EQ was fun.  Seems like it is turning into a bunch of uber 60's preaching their opinions as the only way things should be.  Just kind of sad that you worry so much about what someone else does.  Now gnome pallies bug me since gnomes are not even considered a wise race, but hell if I run into one I am friendly and if one is in my group and doing his job who cares.  Guess I should jsut be a dick since he is obviously a twink.  Guess I am just rambling, but it really is just amazing to see people say they wont help gnomes or anyone else just be cause they like a different race than they like.</div></div><hr />

honestly the more variety of race/class combos the better (within reason)<br />
if a race can worship evil gods and produce warriors i see no game logic why they couldn't be sk's (i'd like babarian and half-elf sk's too)<br />
and personally i think there's nothing wrong with a little humour in character design, i liked the big fat old ogre and troll models, seeing a tiny evil gnome sk as MT is something i look forward too<br />

I have never understood the concept of small races being tanks - the thought of a Gnome wielding Innoruuk's Dagger(TM) just does not fit in my world.<br />
I can understand that the short, stalwart dorfs may be paladins and knights in their own respect but I am opposing the idea of short, 'jacks-of-all-trades' gnomes trying to pose as heavy hitters. It just does not fit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess it's alright that Humans and Erudites can be Paladins and Shadow Knights, but Gnomes cant?  Gnomes in EQ are are neutral race, thus they have access to both good and evil classes now.  Humans are also neutral, as are Erudites I believe.<br />
<br />
I had a gnome warrior to 54 and he was fun.  You wouldn't believe how hard it was to even stand toe to toe with any other warrior race.  But you know what?  It's all about your own personal style, and how you want to perceive yourself in this fictional world.  Not everyone are power gamers who have to pick the best class, best race, and best equipment otherwise the game is no fun.<br />
<br />
As for playing a gnome shadow knight, it's the most fun I've had in this game for over 2 years.  Its so fun to stand around beating on something and have someone pass by and say &quot;wtf is that?&quot;  I would think other shadow knights would be happier that there was an addition to the group.  There's nothing like a gnome with a skelly running around spreading destruction and disease :P<br />
<br />
And while we do not have regen or ultravision as an advantage, we do have our intellect and faction.  We also have clockwork armor which helps bring us somewhat up to par with other races.<br />
<br />
For me, there's no other SK race I'd play.<br />

<br />
Lets take a look at dark elves.  Dark elves are not strong, beasts of battle either.  Dark elves start with a lower strength than gnomes do.  Dark elves are more of a lithe, stealthy race than out-in-your-face warriors.<br />
<br />
Erudites are weaklings too, but they're shadow knights.<br />
<br />
High elves are wussies, and are Paladins.<br />
<br />
A dwarf Paladin is ok, right?  What about a gnome paladin?  If a gnome can be a paladin, then why can he not be the anti-thesis of the Paladin?  If your race can be a cleric, Paladin, and Necromancer.. than you damn well better have a shadow knight.</div></div><hr />

It is just a fad that people have to play these new sks/pallys/rangers but, if they decide they think that the path of the darkelf sk is overplayed and that want to play an int shadowknight class gnomes are a great choice, no bad vision like humans or erudites, a high starting intellect, and the stats arent too far into the gutter.  As for not having enough items for other SKs that is just stupid, if the person was not powerleveled to a high lvl why can't they get help on armor quests or such?  And on my server there are tons of SK items floating around in EC, /trade channels and they go real cheap to cause it just happens to be not a ton of people play shadowknights. And even with powerleveling, dont tell me there isnt a lvl 50 or so vah shir or beastlord in your guild, my guild has 2 over 50 and my guild has about 10players over lvl 50 alltogether.</div></div><hr />

My first character in EQ was a gnome necro on Rallos Zek.  I knew nothing of stats but I thought playing the minature little guy would be cool.  The minute I logged in after creating the lil necro I was blinded and killed.  Didn't know that, screen just went black next thing I know I'm outside somewhere.  Nice welcome to Everquest :D<br />
<br />
Second I made was a barbarian warrior on Quellious.  Played him for about six levels and decided to try another server.  Just for fun I made a troll shadowknight on bertoxx I wasn't seriously considering playing that particular race and class.  I didn't know what stat went where so I put some into WIS and STR.  <br />
<br />
Log in and some troll with this bright orange colored armor (bronze) gave me some leather armor.  I freaked out, I could actually see the leather armor on my character model !  He told me where to go and how to get out of Grobb and I started killing frogloks.  Worked my trolls butt off... well not really to get enough cash to buy that next piece of l33t leather armor...  :D<br />
<br />
Unfortunately I soon found I loved that TSK and would end up becoming addicted to the damn game.  Much later myself and five other friends would all make gnomes with similar names just for fun.  We'd play them when there wasn't anything to do with our mains.</div></div><hr />
