<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sethius</div><div class="date">08-26-2002, 05:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">While I'm not the most experienced sk, I quit my 51 druid to start an sk and he is now lvl 42 as of tonight, I do have some knowlege. I play a DE sk, and have enjoyed every minute of it. I ,however, really don't think race makes all that much of a difference overall, and for the most part good gear can correct and low points you feel your race has. Sure I often would like to have the stamina and strength of an ogre, or the regen of a troll, and it is true that one of the main advantages of a DE is more mana with less gear tinkering, but throughout my whole career as an sk I have never had any problems, and usually kinda tease the ogres or troll sk's because I usually have had higher ac and hp's than them *because* of gear(due to the fact my gear is decent), unless they are majorly twinked.<br />
<br />
    This was gonna be a response to the post about iksars but I decided to make it a post on it's own. I've never played an iksar sk, but the fact of the matter is they have advantages in some areas, and disadvantages in other areas... just like any other class race combination in eq. All stat based disadvantages can be fixed with proper gear anyway, because a lvl 60 DE SK would not be equiped in the exact same gear as a lvl 60 Ogre SK, because the DE would require focus in areas that the Ogre would not and vice versa. In the end their stats (providing they have both put approximatly the same amount of work into their character) are going to be very similar because they have both put aditional time/plat into the areas they are lacking in.<br />
    <br />
      I would agree that an iksar would be a challenging race to play for any class, due to the fact that only kunark(and some of luclin) is intially accesible to them, however with work they can move around decently. KOS to everywhere is a pain, but can be fixed. EXP penalty is a major pain IMO, as post 50 exp is annoying as it is, but does a 20% exp penalty(or whatever they have) negate the iksar as a fun class to play... by no means at all. They can't wear plate armor, true, but they do get good high end armor, and no matter what race you play as an sk you are going to be able to get your ac to 1300 or more with work, and at the same time get a good deal of hp gear. This is all talking end game though, and until then you may feel jipped.<br />
<br />
     The fact of the matter is though, this is a game, and part of the fun is taking what you are given, and making something of it. The game would suck if everyone could easily attain 2000 ac 7k hp and lvl to 60 in 4 days /played. We'd all be halfling warriors then, and our hairy feet would smell bad. The point I'm &quot;trying&quot; to make is, though iksars may have it harder at times, it's a game! My druid was a heck of a lot easier to play and lvl up than my shadowknight, so if you don't like the pain of being a shadowknight, be a druid, maybe it will suit you better. <br />
<br />
    Greater Risk/challenge = Greater Reward. Take the time to lvl up an iksar sk to lvl 60, you may find you have some advantages you would not have as one of the other races, not because of stats, as every races magelo's is gonna look basically the same hp/ac/stats when they are well equiped for their race/class, but because of skills and natural abilities. Vice versa other races may have there own advantages. In the end, race won't matter as much as we think, cause looking through those magelos I've seen DE's that had way more hp's and ac at 60 than trolls or ogres, due to good gear, but then again I've seen ones that didn't cause the trolls/ogres were better equiped, check it out sometime on the magelo site, it is very interesting to see how much difference gear actually makes, and how it seems any race can potentially cap off all their stats and ac(well soft cap and more that is) and still have room for a good amount of hp gear. <br />
<br />
   If you like being an iksar, play an iksar... it is not impossible to get to 60, I know lots of lvl 60 iksars of many classes. Sometimes we all go to far with what class/race/whatever beats what, but it really doesn't matter because it is a game, and if you are slick you can make any race/class combinations extremely powerful. I remember one time in my 30's as an sk I was grouped with a troll sk who was several lvls higher than me, and we got talking about ac and hp's and come to find out, I had much better ac and hp's than him, and he was very impressed... BUT a couple weeks later I was grouped with this gnome sk who was several lvls lower than me, and we got talkin about ac and hp's, and come to find out his ac and hp's beat the crap out of mine. The moral of the story is, gnome sk's don't suck like I thought they did =Pjk hehehe Seriously though it just goes to show that in the eq we play gear makes more of a difference than anything no matter which way you look at it.<br />
<br />
    To end this post I just wanna say that I don't think any of the races are better than the others for being an sk, but that all require work and attention in areas that the others do not. I like that my DE didn't require as much attention in the int department, but I don't like that he required more attention in the str/sta department... but so what, I got over it and enjoyed the game anyway. Again to state, if I wanted the game to be all about being easy, I'd go back to being my druid, cause that was much easier IMO. What I wanted was to have fun and beat the hay outta things, and my DE SK does exactly that, so I'm satisfied.<br />

&lt;sarcasm&gt;I know that everyone in eq has such excellent skills in literature that a post worded as one paragraph must be terribly unheard of and determential to the eq society as a whole&lt;/sarcasm&gt;<br />
Guess I won't post at 6am in the morning and think that people won't bash me for it.</div></div><hr />

I didn't read much further than this for two reasons:<br />
<br />
- One, you're right.  This is the sentiment that everyone pretty much expresses-- that in the long run equipment can make up for any deficiencies in starting stats, thus your choice of race for a shadow knight need not be dependent on statistics.  Of course, at lower levels stats can have an effect because you won't have the equipment, so choosing a race based on stats isn't entirely out of line, IMO.  But I feel that choosing a race based on something more meaningful (looks, RP, etc) will benefit you more in the long run.<br />
<br />
- Two, reading such a long message that is formatted as a single paragraph is terribly difficult.  I would prefer that you edit it to break it up into separate paragraphs to make it easier to read through.</div></div><hr />

Use paragraphs please.<br />

Thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zanix The Unholy</div><div class="date">08-26-2002, 10:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">as long as he's in the same topic, it's one long paragraph.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Skurrge</div><div class="date">08-26-2002, 11:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, you can be on the same topic and use multiple paragraphs.  To not do so is just bad schooling.  Besides, I actually managed to read 3/5 of it and if frankly is not on the same topic all the way.  It's a bit of a ramble.<br />
<br />
In English 101, we learn that we can have one topic supported by 5 paragraphs.  Generally, you have your introductory paragraph, 3 supporting paragraphs, and a conclusion.  If you are going to write this much about a topic, then it is generally a good idea to use that formula.  It lets you get your ideas together for yourself and it lets others see your thought flow and it makes the whole thing more readable.<br />
<br />
Anyway, regarding the topic: no, race is not a end-all-be-all and there is no one good race or one bad race.  Each race choice brings its own set of headaches and rewards and it is up to the player to see which set of headaches and rewards they can live with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Squigle D'Muerte</div><div class="date">08-26-2002, 01:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would like to make sure to qualify the statement:<br />
<br />
Race stats differences do not make a difference IN THE LONG RUN .<br />
<br />
If you are starting out with your first char or unable to twink it will probably make a difference to you for a long time.  As an evil class there are a lot of places you just can't go and without a lot of faction work buying/selling can be a pain.  A high STR can help you avoid frequent long runs to sell loot.<br />
<br />
If you are a twink then the stats really don't matter at all.  But the factions and special abilities do.  Starting faction kind of sucks for all races but some (human) are easier to fix than others.  The special ability Regen is very useful if you plan on soloing.  <br />
<br />
Once SKs hit about 48 they become class-non-grata to most exp groups.  Everyone wants warriors and monks and it can become hard to get a pick up group until you are high enough level that you can start impressing them with your level.  So IMHO it is good to be able to solo since I am not willing to wait an hour + for a group when I can't get one in guild or with friends.<br />
<br />
The experience penalty sure does hurt in 50s but I would rather spend my time fighting more battles than spending it medding.  <br />
<br />
It is a matter of personal choice but there are some differences.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry, but I disagree with this comment strongly.  Granted, SKs still seem a bit of an unknown to some (I had to chew out a chanter in UD a few nites ago after she said that we needed a tank (WAR was leaving).  Umm--duuhhh hun--WTF am I?  Needless to say, we were 100% fine after the WAR left), but I seldom, if ever, had a major issue getting a group unless the zone was/is stuffed, which basically equates to everyone having a hard time getting a group.<br />
<br />
I also believe that I am not the only one to experience that at 48+.  Perhaps it is the server you are on.  Im not sure though.  You can, however, help change their mind with your play though<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nnod</div><div class="date">08-27-2002, 08:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">just for the record, as a 54 SK, i had to act as main FD puller and main tank/taunt for a Kael raid. no one ever died, we killed lots of giants, and while only crap loot dropped, it was still a fine test of the SK skill set. and it was fun!<br />
<br />
my point is, it is a bad idea to pidgeon hole classes (or people for that matter). people who just go around saying what is wrong with classes and races are really missing the point. all EQ is about is enjoying yourself. if a gnome SK with 10 str and 100 int works for you, go for it! :)</div></div><hr />
