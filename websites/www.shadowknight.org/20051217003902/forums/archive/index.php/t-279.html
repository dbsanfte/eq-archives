I'd definitely consider soloing too, have a 57 chanter on 2nd acct to help.<br />
<br />
If its just a grind and there is nothing else better, wish me luck :-)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alhazro</div><div class="date">03-31-2002, 06:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Or katta guards if you dont mind the faction</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Skek</div><div class="date">03-31-2002, 06:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">IMO the best place to blast 59 in to oblivion is in Howling stones.  Take a strong Melee based group into the south wing, and you'll do about a blue every 40 mins to an hour.<br />
<br />
The key to getting through is volume.  Avoid Luclin and Velious, as the mobs there have alot more hp, and are therefore slower to kill.  Velks is only good xp in a well equipped group who can do huge amounts of damage and slaughter mobs fast.   Bear in mind that even light blues are good xp if you can kill large quantities of them.<br />
<br />
Stick to old world/kunark dungeons as they tend to follow this rule.  Use dungeons instead of outdoor zones too, as you can get very large bonuses to fighting in them.<br />
<br />
Go for it, and good luck on 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caithris</div><div class="date">03-31-2002, 06:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Best place for exp imo is now Cazic-Thule.  Its certainly harder than most exp zones, but I don't have as much fun pluggin thru exp unless there's a high risk of death lol.<br />
<br />
Just won't keep me awake otherwise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mystina</div><div class="date">03-31-2002, 07:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For group I would recommand chardok in tunnel or past it, and velk pit dogs or spiders if dogs are camped.<br />
Both camps bring best exp if you do it with a 3-4 persons groups, exp drops very badly as soon you invite a 5th in group, 3 is uber exp if you got enough dps.<br />
If you do velk dogs in small group be very careful if Khelkar Icepaw happens to spawns, I tanked him the other day in a 3 persons group and he hurts.<br />
<br />
For solo with chanter bot (would be my choice if I were you) Katta near bank seems a very good place to go, you could do Basement in Karnor too.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">googaba da troll</div><div class="date">03-31-2002, 08:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Howling Stones is good.  I spent all of 59 there and did not use my gate potion or OT hammer until I dinged 60.  You can do zone in, or if it is camped, you can jump off sight side of North stairs onto a hill, which is generally a safe area.  Just watch HT's on your pulls, they sometimes will get the chanter instead of you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drakang</div><div class="date">04-01-2002, 08:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I still can't handle 2 elementals at once but I see alot of 59ths Soloing the entrance area to The Hole.  Especially if you have an enchanter to mez the second half of the double pulls until its broken and keep you hasted and set on Clarity.  Mobs range from high 40's to around 55th, and the 25% bonus to XP there is nice.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">William Shaf</div><div class="date">04-01-2002, 09:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I went through 59 in 4 days solo at the zone out in Chardok.<br />
<br />
I two-boxed my wife's Shaman (kept her ungrouped) while I did it, and with Epic, Regrowth, Alacrity, and her slowing the sarnaks, I had more health finishing the fight then starting it.  With this setup, I could easily take on 3 mobs at once.  <br />
<br />
Get yourself C3 and you can do a blue and a half an hour there.  I averaged roughly a blue an hour like this, without clarity.<br />
<br />
Dinged 59 on a friday night, and dinged 60 on the following Tuesday after work.  I also attended 3 guild raids over the weekend, and had family over on Sunday.  <br />
<br />
Good luck man, I've heard horror stories about 59 from other people, I just got lucky with my setup.<br />
<br />
:D</div></div><hr />

<br />
With the right group it's very fast xp and quite fun.<br />
<br />
My fave place - zone in, turn right, 2nd left and camp just past the portcullis.  Pull the 2 large cavern sections that you pass getting to the camp spot.<br />

<br />
your trolls of neriak and ogres of neriak factions go down, but i have yet to see that effect me other than i cant go to that arena.<br />
<br />
/shrug...never went there anyways</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jice Virago</div><div class="date">04-01-2002, 10:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">After getting sick of losing XP constantly pulling for my guild, I told them all to get bent and spent a week XPing.  I went back to my roots as a soloer and made my level in two spots:<br />
<br />
Sebilis- Just hanging around near hall in jail, toe to toe against blue con frogs I found here and there.  You need a good mana pool to do this, but you can usually hit up whatever enchanter is in Necrosis for C2 while you are there.  Critical factor in soloing here is to remember to dispell mobs to pull them, as you want to strip off any haste and Sow they have.<br />
<br />
Maidens Eye Gorangas-  The Grey is easier, but no where near as good XP wise.  Just pull a red guy and fear kite him around the entrance.  Only drawback is making sure you dont get trained.<br />
<br />
Other spots Im convinced would work-<br />
<br />
Chardok-  With good gear, you can toe to toe in chardok for mondo XP, but getting C2 is much less likely and its more risky overall.<br />
<br />
Howling Stones-  Again, its pretty remote and risky, but the XP you make here is outrageous and the mobs are fairly easy if you avoid the HTing ones.  Might be too remote to be worth it.<br />
<br />
Skyfires-  They take forever to kill, but the Wurms are pretty easy to fear kite and reliable XP.  Expect druids in the zone to get pissy with you though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Blackeagle Dwimmerlaik</div><div class="date">04-02-2002, 04:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">solo exp in chardok while bumming c2/3 and haste &gt; all<br />
<br />
you can kill non stop and you can kill fast... make sure you pay the enchies for their mana, they'll try to refuse, but I personally feel bad going back to the same person and asking for repeated refreshes if I'm not giving them something in return<br />
<br />
you could probably solo shrooms in fungus grove without much trouble, even without crack or haste...<br />
<br />
sebilis can be good too.. my favorite solo spot there is the iksar jail, those necromancers just keep casting and casting and I keep interupting and bashing and proccing... can kill them nearly non stop.. get c2 from a nearby enchie and you can do them non stop.. caster npcs are wusses, hehe</div></div><hr />
