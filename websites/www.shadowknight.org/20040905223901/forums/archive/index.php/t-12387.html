<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sars</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Looking for everyone's input on which they think would be better for a EQ player that has played for a year. I have all the expanions and kind of prefer to stay away from the large races, as I have 3 vah shirs...<br />
<br />
I would greatly appreciate any help that can be given. Many thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grimbad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Both good choices.  Iksar have quite a rough time leveling, with the inability to wear plate, and the exp penalty.  However, Iksar have debatably the most advantages at the end game.<br />
<br />
Humans, being the middle ground, do not have any advantages.  On the good side, they don't have any DISadvantages either.<br />
<br />
Depends on how quick you wanna get to 65/AA.<br />
<br />
If quickness of leveling is most important, go Human, the Iksar penalty IS noticeable.<br />
<br />
If being just raw bad ass once you FINALLY get to 65 and all that AA is more important, go Iksar.<br />
<br />
Iksar also look cooler than humans imo.<br />
<br />
Personally, I'd play an Iksar if I couldn't be a Troll, and yes, the large size is VERY annoying in old world dungeons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sars</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks, I'll stick with my Iksar...save human for something else like a pally or sommat.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lord Vedar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Iksar <br />
Pro:Regen, infravision, and inate AC<br />
Con:Can't wear Low and mid level plate, Level slower, Hated in old world area<br />
<br />
Human<br />
Pro: Best liked in old world towns, Fastest Leveling SK, wears all plate, balanced stats. Damn sexy.<br />
Cons: no infravision, no regen.<br />
<br />
Just best to play what ever you think will be the most fun. In the end game race matters little and in the begining race matters little.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>GenoReaper999</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Go human! theres still time!:cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>SorishMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Iksar has a nice starting city... you could probably get to level 5 within a few hours and without leaving the city.<br />
<br />
I know nobody likes to do quests anymore, but I have a young geckomancer who I've been doing a lot of the newbie quests in Cabilis with.  By the time you reach your teens, it's very likely that you'll already be well on the way to becoming a master smith, potter, tailor, baker if you do the newbie quests.  I found that to be an interesting quest design, kind of like the Shar Val quests (but the SV quests were too convoluted it seemed, and I dislike kitties).  The storyline is decent as well as you do your quests and gives you a better feel for the iksar race (they're not evil but more neutral, just proud and wary of past mistreatment).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Lunaticfringesk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">IMO, it primarily boils down to the XP penalty.  IKS are superior to humans, due to the abilities that they have vs the human, but pay for it dearly via the XP penalty.  Flip a coin if you ask me, or take the one that looks cooler to you.  Gear and player ability make far more of an impact on the character than race ever will.<br />

Just a few questions from some of the other posts:<br />
<br />
Quote:<br />
&quot;However, Iksar have debatably the most advantages at the end game&quot;<br />
<br />
What exactly are these advantages?  As an IKS SK, I'm still trying to figure that out...  <br />
<br />
<br />
Quote:<br />
&quot;Fastest Leveling SK&quot; [one of the benefits of being human]<br />
<br />
Is this really true?  I’m not sure that they level faster then any other non-large / non-iksar race.  Additionally, castersrealm, which, granted, is far from the most reliable source of info, reports that the gnome is the fastest leveling SK.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>GenoReaper999</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i admit iksars look cooler nekkid, but with gear, humans just look badass!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The race to choose....<br />
<br />
The biggest issue between an Iskar and a human would be the xp penalty. If you have the patience, then go with iskar for the AC and the regen.<br />
<br />
If you want to level a bit faster, go with a human and buy some regen and nice AC stuff.<br />
<br />
However, a important question should be &quot;how much do you want to tank&quot;<br />
<br />
If you are going to accept the Iskar xp penalty, mabye an Orge is an option with High HP, and cannot be stunned from the front in melee.<br />
<br />
I am an Orge SK, and see myself as a tank with some cool casting abilities, not as a caster that can fight.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>nnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">the high end advantages that he was reffering to are probably the armor choices. we get the same armor as any other SK in high end game, plus a natural AC bonus, plus regen, etc. we only have to suffer the lack of plate till we can get into Velious quest armor and higher.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Lunaticfringesk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I guess so..<br />
<br />
His comment (&quot;Iksar have debatably the most advantages at the end game&quot;), however, still leaves me confused.  Perhaps Im interpreting it wrong, but that seems to be a blanket statement across all other races.<br />
<br />
Once you get into Velious armor (even full Thurg, not even SS/Kael), you are probably going to hit the alleged AC softcap, reducing the appeal of the AC bonus considerably.<br />
<br />
Trolls also have regen, so that sure doesnt vault the IKS ahead of the troll at the end game.  It is primarily this inherit regen ability that justifies TRL/IKS leveling the slowest.<br />
<br />
The remaining skills of an IKS just arent that significant to analyze.<br />
<br />
So, like I said, what advantages do IKS SK have at the end game.  Believe me, as an IKS, I would love to hear them becuase I just dont see it!!  :) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Chavo Guerrero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">you guys are forgetting about forage, I can't count how many times I was forced to go back to PoK to buy food and water while you iksars are having the time of your life with forage skill and survive in the wild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Lunaticfringesk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Bah--that was one of the abilities that I considered not &quot;significant to analyze.&quot;       =)<br />

Some of the new foods that are now out, you can be out for such a long time, its almost inconcievable that you will be out for so long that you wont go trucking through PoK / Nexus (bazaar) at some point and not be able to get more.<br />

<br />
Go human if you like fumbling around in the dark. <br />
<br />
:p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Jupke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">No race is better then the other, all differences are gone past level 30 with some gear tailored to your needs.<br />
<br />
All that matters is LOOKS. Make that the base of your choise, nothing else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Lizarde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I would agree with the people who advise that you try the one you think would be the most fun.  Probably the biggest convenience you get with an Iksar is infravision.  While you get spells to deal with this later, it's nice not to have to stop and cast them every now and then when you enter a dark zone.<br />
<br />
Iksar regen is very nice, especially at low levels where mobs aren't doing a lot of damage.  You can level very quickly because you spend less time resting between battles.<br />
<br />
Iksar miss out on a number of nice plate armors until they get to their 30s and can start hunting for Ry'Gorr.  Dreadscale is nice but is, IMO, a much bigger pain in the ass to quest than Darkforge.  And later on, Iksar cultural is horrible compared to human cultural armor.<br />
<br />
I think Iksar look cool, though I never really warmed to the plate look on Iksar SKs.  Human's in plate look great, IMO.  I prefer the Iksar look overall though, and never regretted my choice.<br />
<br />
Faction is no longer an issue, especially with the PoP expansion.  You don't need to do any faction work to train or bank in PoK.  You didn't need to do faction work to bank in shadow haven or shar vahl.  You only need to do a couple of really easy quests to buy/sell in shadow haven, and can buy/sell without any faction work in PoK or shar vahl.<br />
<br />
Exp penalty can be a real drag.  If you choose troll or iksar, be aware that you will level slower than others.  That is probably the biggest reason why I would say go with the one that you think is most fun.  Because if you don't enjoy playing an iksar, you're going to be spending 20% more time not enjoying him. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Toltanus Thule</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I've played both, and in fact I have a 56 Iksar Sk laying around that I am thinking of resurrecting because Erudites are overrated IMHO..<br />
<br />
Pros I have found with Iksar: <br />
Regen, AC Bonus, Infravision.<br />
<br />
Forage is forever stuck at level 50 and it's not to be used except in dire emergencies.<br />
<br />
The quests in Cabilis are phenomenal, way better than the newbie quests that Human SKs get.  There is a reason why people slaughter countless Sarnaks and Explorers just to be able to get inside Cabilis and that's Greenmist.  But if you do the whole thing as an Iksar and use the quests as a guide to where to get XP, you will find it to be that much more rewarding.  At least I did.<br />
<br />
A lot of people think being KOS in the old world has a negative effect, but most of the places you are going to want to get to as a Shadowknight can be fixed with faction work, like Neriak.  Aside from that, there is nothing the old world offers an Iksar that can't be bought in Cabilis or these days, in the Plane of Knowledge and it's a good enough excuse to just go and kill everything anyway. ;)  I guess it would be cool to bank in places like Kelethin or Felwithe, but in all honesty, who the hell cares?  If you really want it, the faction work is not impossible.<br />
<br />
The armor that Iksars can't wear are offset in the low and mid levels by things such as the questable Dreadscale armor, which is equivalent to Darkforge, Greenmist armor, which is equivalent to Blood Ember, and in between you have armors such as Rygorr Chain that should do just fine for you, not to mention the Velious armor quests.  You'll be fearkiting a lot anyway as you level and solo in the 40+ range, so keep that in mind when you think of how important armor is to you.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, the new Iksar character models are about the ugliest thing around (and it's great how the Iksars suddenly go to looking NOTHING like the Iksar statues all over Kunark), and the armor looks like ass, including that they used the female helm look for the males.  You can turn it off on your end, but if people have it on on their end, you'll look like a fag.  <br />
<br />
As far as humans, the whole vision thing can be overcome with judicious use of the gamma adjustor and you also get Infravision and Ultravision spells as a Shadowknight, so I don't think the whole vision thing is any kind of problem in the long run.  You can wear just about all the armors Shadowknights can, you have more cities that you start non-KOS to, you can use the Outpost if you need to, you can faction yourself to non-KOS in Cabilis and work on Greenmist, and your new model and armor looks cool.  Oh, and you level faster, about 20% faster, which is a yellow bubble faster.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Life is different on Test... I figured I'd be able to pickup something like a Centi Warspear for pretty cheap, instead they still sell for 200pp or so.  (Guess I'll be killing rats for a while... or doing a lot of questing for armor/weapons.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
AC is nice too, but I don't know exactly how much I'm getting atm. Its nice but its not a massive difference<br />
<br />
Forget the human 'no night vision' disadvantage. At level 22 SKs get an infravision spell at 49 we all get ultravision.<br />
<br />
It comes to this in the end -&gt; Iksar sk will regen and have more ac<br />
<br />
But a Human will have gotten there faster. And be working on AAs.<br />
<br />
AAs do not have a racial xp penalty.<br />
<br />
Iksar will be stronger than a human of identical level and gear, but will take longer to get there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Daeneb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Gear limitations are a factor as well.  There's a lot of good, cheap stuff out there for Human SKs.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>SorishMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Because of the racial advantages that iksar / troll get in terms of regen.  There also used to be class-based penalties (hybrids got another 20 pct penalty), but those have been taken out.<br />
