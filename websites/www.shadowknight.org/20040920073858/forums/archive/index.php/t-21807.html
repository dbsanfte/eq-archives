<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Akronis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know generic AA advice threads suck but it seems like I'm running out of worthwhile things to spend on and it's making me want to PL my friends' characters whose info I have outside of raid time rather than xp myself. These are what I have (can also see in magelo, think I have em all ticked there):<br />
<br />
general<br />
run3<br />
innate metabo3<br />
regen3<br />
magic 1, poison 3 (gave up on resists because they will come with gear and I get 500 on raids anyways)<br />

EVERYTHING but:<br />
spell casting deftness at lv 0<br />
spell casting expertise at lv 1<br />
spell casting subtlety at lv 0<br />
finishing blow at lv 0<br />
<br />
class<br />
all maxed except double riposte (heard this was actually a curse more than a blessing?)<br />
<br />

all PoP abilities except coup de grace, flash of steel, mastery of the past<br />
<br />

immob bash3<br />
vicious smash1<br />
death's fury1<br />
improved consumption of the soul2<br />
<br />
The rest of the GoD aa's seem to suck in terms of level of reward for amount of work they take. Any suggestions or advice on what's good or useful that I don't have or should I just bank 30 for omens and keep PLing the chanter who has around 250 aa? =P<br />
<br />
Guild is currently working on getting through Uqua and farms time weekly, I tank occasionally on raids (time phase 1-3, sometimes CT, some ikkinz plows) but not all the time. When I do xp it's usually LDoNs for points, since EP or KT grinds for AA don't really seem too appealing since there isn't much worthwhile to spend on. Sorry for being annoying and thanks for any worthwhile tips.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dakkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Assuming the question is serious:<br />
<br />
SCE3 is marginally useful if you ever use invoke fear for passive taunting (not many do).  10 AA.<br />
<br />
Convalescence doesn't exactly hurt but is another 18 AA.<br />
<br />
Your dex could use raising for exp groups.  15 AA.<br />
<br />
Otherwise there's the old chestnut of resists.  But as your resists are very high to start with you might prefer to bank another 100 AA then decide what to spend them on when OoW comes out.  If GoD AAs are anything to go by I very much doubt saving 30 points will get you very far in OoW.<br />
<br />
There you see, I just found you another 150 odd AA to go for - bet you're happy now :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Maicom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">except that you can only bank 30 aa's</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Save up to 30 and just spend AA when you get to 30. Well since you got Pet Affinity might as well max Death's Fury. I would then just work on intense hatred and double riposte/flash of steel. I suggest spending once you get 30 AA, so when OoW does come out you can just buy some of the better AA's at launch.<br />
<br />
I only have 285 AA's and already feel I've ran out of decent AA's and getting bored. So now I don't even join XP groups, I just run around and solo older content and farm tribute items. I figure I can farm enough tribute items that before I go raid I can go turn on a bunch of tribute and then turn most of the tribute off when I'm done raiding for the night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If I was in  your shoes (didn't look at magelo, just your list here), I'd spend points on critical affliction and intense hatred.<br />
<br />
-Bolas</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Akronis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Any sweetspots for tribute items you feel like sharing? =P<br />
<br />
I guess I could finally cave and do the double riposte line, I just thought it would in turn get me riposted more when tanking since I would be hitting more, but I imagine the difference would me marginal. Death's fury doesn't seem too bad if it is only 3 aa per rank up to 5. I can't say I'm too thrilled about intense hatred, 45aa for 15 point DS increase seems kinda unrewarding, but then again I've never really liked damage shields anyways :/ My dex doesn't really need raising, I left out a few +6/+7 dex augs in my magelo that gets me to like 303 with enchanter haste, so it's not that big of an issue. WTB new greaves though, Cazic has dropped 2 and Guardian of Glorification has dropped 1 pair in all our kills. I will eventually finish critical affliction too, but since I only have one dot I use consistently and our guild druids and necros are bitching about this AA, it doesn't really motivate me to save the 25 for ranks 2 and 3.<br />
<br />
I'll definitely have 30 banked for omens release, and in the meantime I can just finish up a few of those above and farm ldon points/tribute items so I have +40 augs ready for when I eventually get a helm, bp and greaves.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm still looking for the best time to obtain -&gt; tribute gain ratio.<br />
<br />
I got lucky once and made 22k tribute in about 10mins in The Tenebrous Mountains. Usual runs there in 10-15min I get atleast 2k tribute, which makes up for tribute spent for raids for the day. I run there with horse, kill the named and then go somewhere else, it's really quick.<br />
<br />
I just started this past weekend in trying to find good drops in various zones. Next time I clear The Tenebrous Mountains named , I might to run over to the grey and see how that goes. I'm also going to try LoY since you can go there from PoK now (i think). I'm trying to find places I can run through about an hour before or after raids. The key is dropable/tradeable items, some really poor items are worth 2-20k in tribute, and the sorry mobs that drop them are easy for an EP+ SK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm at about the 680 mark for aa, but for some reason I still feel that there is soooo much to get yet.  I'll comment on a few of the aa lines that you haven't completed yet though, hopefully it might help.<br />
<br />
Double Riposte: I left this till quite late too, around the 300 aa mark if I recall.  While it's true that a riposte isn't all that often which means a double riposte is even less frequent, if you tank I believe it's worthwhile.  If you don't tank much (although I'm sure you do), then it has little value since to riposte you have to be getting hit.  Also, for those of you wondering, you can't riposte a riposte.  For a very short time after discs were introduced you could but that lasted only days (just after Kunark release I think).<br />
<br />
Finishing Blow: at lvl 1 it's a fun toy but doesn't go off that much.  Even up to lvl 3, where it goes off a bit more but has the same level cap (45 I think), it has limited value.  The PoP ugrade, on the other hand does have a bit more value in that it raises the level cap of the mobs that can be FB'd.  Up to the 2nd last level of Coupe de Grace, it wasn't doing much for me; but when I got the final level (up to 58 I think?), THEN it was working in LDoN normal adventures, PoTactics ogres, etc. and it was firing off left and right.<br />
<br />
Intense Hatred: Levels 1 and 2 are relatively cheap, I spent my banked points on 1 &amp; 2 on GoD release.  I've just come back to it and am working on lvl 5 now.  Like Double Riposte, DS doesn't do much unless you are tanking; and like small hp/ac upgrades, by itself 3 pts of DS doesn't mean much but it all adds up.  At lvl 4 you have the same DS innately as you do with Banshee Aura, without the buff slot and spell gem, and it never wears off.  For normal xp groups, I routinely have 70 pts of DS on plus 34 pt reverse DS.  Sure getting hit for 900+ and doing 100 back doesn't mean squat, but getting hit for 60 and doing 100 might.  It's unresistable free dps.  It hurts to spend 12 and 15 points on it yes, but the lower lvls of it I think are worthwhile since it's a linear increase with increased costs.<br />
<br />
That's all I can think of.  You've got the good stuff already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well there are rumors that SOE might reduce cost on GoD AA. If they do, they would give your AA back and you can re-invest in reduced GoD AA skills. I dunno if they would still plan for that or not. That would make GoD AA more attractive once cost is back in-line.. They based AA cost on damn elemental AA rate that  hurts casual gamers mostly cuz most casual gamers got stuck up to tier 3 that AA isn't as fast as tier 4 would give.. Pfft. Rebalancing GoD AA cost would help casual gamers as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Lol. Most of the GoD AAs are useless to active/raiding guild players on the whole, so I wouldnt go so far as to say that casual players have missed out on anything worthwhile...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>kharan_zechts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Do resists... and finishing blow is kinda neat too. Grab double riposte too... its shitty but its a little bit of dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Finish out resists.  If you're moving into Uqua and beyond, the majority of AEs are prismatic or chromatic.  Wouldnt be such a problem if PC/EC stacked, but they dont ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Rueeliar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Ak, you're a slacker.<br />
<br />
Double Riposte and Flash of Steel.  I did those around 250.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Belyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Lol. Most of the GoD AAs are useless to active/raiding guild players on the whole, so I wouldnt go so far as to say that casual players have missed out on anything worthwhile...<br />
<br />
<br />
If you mean casual sks instead of players then you would be correct.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>AThousandYoung</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Play on SZ or some other PvP server to combat boredom.  Don't go evil SZ though or you'll be able to get overpowered easily and will have a harder time fighting on even terms.  If you must play an SK go to one of the other PvP servers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Szork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Hey Arkonis.<br />
<br />
Personally, I find Intense Hatred to be one of the best GoD AAs.  It's not really usefull when raiding, but an extra 15 DS when solo (or duo with a healer class) is great.<br />
<br />
Aten neck: +8<br />
Dain's Ring: +10<br />
CoL spell: +10<br />
Banshee Aura: +12<br />
IH AA:  +15<br />
___________<br />
Total DS: +55<br />
<br />
I think Shaman potions stack with all this as well.  I'm pretty sure you can add another 6 from that VT cloak (cloak of icy shadows maybe?).  I find it worth the time I put into it, anyhow.</div></div><hr />
