Bane of Piety (12aa pts or so)<br />
Allows the SK to choose a Diety (other than their own) who's followers will be subject to the unholy might of the shadowknights tainted mellee attacks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Drakonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I pick Agnostic! :p<br />
<br />
Slay Healer is still the best idea on this line in my opinion.  Ability to do Slay crits on any NPC capable of casting a healing spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jupke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Can i get slay warrior ???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Maniacles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">one ability that definitely needs to be make it into the aa lists is<br />
<br />
insta cast invis. 5aa<br />
<br />
Rule #1 could get revoked then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Taelia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">They have it ..... pre-nerf Circlet of Shadow... 0.1 (might as well say insta click) right click from inventory. Can invis running. I recommend it for every SK and Necro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sithanator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">To fit with role play content it would need opposed to your god. If you follow Inny you be against tunare. Bretoxx would be probably against Karana or rodict. RZ would be Brell. CT not sure about.<br />
Later<br />
Sith</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kanigit007</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">oo.. an SK of Innoruuk could then be very effective in PoG vs. all those Tunare bastids - oh, and imagine the implications this would have in duels or PVP.<br />
<br />
Ya, gimme Elf Druid/Ranger Bane baby.  I'd be happy.<br />
-<br />
<br />
I need to read more Eq Lore on the parthenon of gods tho to see what other diamatrically opposed diety combos there are.  <br />
<br />
I think the Troll SKs deserve a &quot;slay froglock&quot; ability. (or slay Mithaniel Marr followers - which would include 90% of the frogs<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Too bad deity aa can't be balanced</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Silence</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">aye, since Rallos is an equal oppurtunity hater... not just brell, hes not too fond of any of the light gods that sealed him in the his plane</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ziglug D</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">&quot;Cazic-Thule is allied with Innoruuk and Rallos Zek, and is the enemy of Mithaniel Marr and Erollisi Marr.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
im a deity freak, I spend time thinking about that when I make a character about as much as I think of stats, because I am one of the few roleplayers out there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Maniacles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">taela<br />
<br />
See, the point is that that skill should be available to all sks, not just old school and ebay rich sks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Inquestion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If Pallies get slay undead, we should get slay living.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">the only problem with SKs getting &quot;Slay Living&quot; is that (pre-LDoN, of course) there weren't really any high lvl undead mobs for pallies to DPS to death for uber xp or loot or whatever; on the other hand, could you imagine 6 or 12 SKs getting Slay Undead -type crits on a boss mob or god? that plus super-HT, SKs would be the best DPS in raids by far, i think.<br />
<br />
It would &quot;unbalance&quot; us even more (meaning giving the warriors more to bitch about) than anything, and though making us uber, would probably screw up some other shit. I don't think that Slay Undead &quot;unbalances&quot; pallies too much because of the fact that (and i'll admit that i'm not exactly end-game, so I can't say for sure) most mobs by the time that you get lvl 59 for the AA, or most mobs that matter, aren't undead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">It would be easier and more likely for us to get something that lets us get Slay Crits on Pally/Cleric class mobs.  But its useless and theres far better things we could go for</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Taelia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Not sure what to put with it, but I think some more aa's to help increase our DPS with the new melee changes coming into effect would be nice. Since it is an aa and not an innate change in our DPS abilities and if it was not over done it would be a good addition to our current aa's.<br />
<br />
Also Manaicles my point was with this item in game SOE is considerable less likely to give this to us as an aa. And if they do the recast timer I am sure will be long. No way they will give a insta cast invis you can use again in a short period of time. Gather Shadows being as unrealiable in duration as it is, to make insta cast invis worth the aa it would need to be usable again in a short time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>gavain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">i would serously like to see our un-holy steeds changed to skeltal horses instead of just black...now that would be awsome.<br />
<br />
<br />
another thought for class aa that would be great in pvp situations would be insta cast shadow step, maybe for a longer distance than normal shadow step, however still in the same zone, and takes a few mins to recharge the ability. <br />
<br />
any thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>kharan_zechts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">from what ive heard from a few pallies is that slay undead 3 isnt really all that great for dps. The super big crits are more of a show off thing.</div></div><hr />
