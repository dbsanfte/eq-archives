<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gnomercy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey everyone I have been really considering a shadow knight for a long time. Now I hear alot of gnome bashing going on. Why ? Their starting stats are &gt; the DE's they may not look as good but In my opinion with new models turned on they looks pretty evil. They have 5 more sta and I think 10 more dex then DEs and the same INT If I'm not mistaken.  And if you think about it a gnome MT is nicer to have then say an ogre seeing how when u got a fatty MT its tuff to manuver around him to get into the action. I dunno just a few cents. Let me know what you think. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Manslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Its just that nomes being able to be a SK is a new thing so almost all of them are twinks/alts.  Some people just perceive Twinks as not real SK I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gnomercy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Its just, no offense to anyone out there DE sks are a dime a dozen, you can grab atleast 6-7 out of a single zone. Gnome Sks are rare and not many people have the &quot;balls&quot; to play them.  Just thought being different would be fun. But not willing to be ridiculed about it. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mantisrose</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">first of all most all gnomes are twinks which they are not real sk's in my oppinion.<br />
<br />
<br />
Gnomes should never have been made an sk class<br />
<br />
<br />
their stats arent that good and De's get alot more str then compared to gnomes<br />
<br />
<br />
you have balls for playing a gnome more like stupidity to me<br />
<br />
<br />
all gnomes deserve to be fed to ogres</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nincom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have to reply to the above post that states:<br />
<br />
&quot;Gnomes should never have been made an sk class&quot;<br />
<br />
This is not true.  They should of had an SK class to begin with.  Being that all races that have an SK (with the exception of Troll/Ogre) have both a necro and war, which is what they are.  Also it is for a role-playing factor that most want to play a gnome sk.  There is something sweet about seeing a small race kill most things that are twice(at least) thier size.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Trysbrina67</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">the point of having gnome sks was to show the rising influence of Berrotox (or however you spell his fucking name) among gnomes, while pallies under Brell formed to address this new threat.  yes a gnome SK is kind of funny, but /shrug play what you like.  Gnomes were listed as a &quot;neutral&quot; type race and evil is gaining a foot hold in Akanon in the form of necros and sks.  Its not like they gave wood elves, who are overwhelmingly good in disposition the ability to become SKs, even if their warriors can worship Rallos Zek.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nincom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ok so I missed one race that doesn't have a war and a necro.  But alot of peeps try to miss those big foreheads.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">gnomes are to cute to be real sk's... halflings on the other hand, now that would be a race worth remaking for</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jobrill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Dorf or Barbarian SK, and you got me. Otherwise, Erudite for me. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Razaduuul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">yeah...<br />
races missing one of the parent classes that have SKs:<br />
<br />
ogres<br />
trolls<br />
erudites<br />
<br />
Those with both classes before gnomes:<br />
<br />
humans<br />
iksar<br />
dark elves<br />
<br />
<br />
seems prettyeven split to me, not enough to make a case out of, I think the growing influence of bertox is the only explaination.<br />
<br />
Still they just don't fit IMO, but then I refuse to ever play any short race. they're all  ugly.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Bulvyne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Most of it has to do with the &quot;coolness&quot; factor.<br />
<br />
Gnome SK's just aren't &quot;cool&quot; in most people's books. <br />
<br />
Personally, I don't think they should have been made Pallies or SK's. &quot;Such and such race has a Necro and Warrior, so they should have SK's&quot; is an extremely weak argument. If that's the case, where are Ogre Necros? Troll Necros? Both races have warriors and SK's, so they should have necros, right? I just don't agree with that argument at all.<br />
<br />
VI put them in simply because gnomes are one of the least-played races in the game. They wanted to provide another set of class alternatives to entice a few more folks to play gnomes. <br />
<br />
As for the race/class itself, I know very few gnome SK's on my server. The one that was in my guild for a short time took a lot of crap for being a gnome sk in the first place. But, if you do your job, kick ass and don't screw up, you can usually shut people up pretty quick. <br />
<br />
All I would recommend is, play what you WANT. As you get higher in levels, stat differences mean less and less. <br />
<br />
But be prepared: if you play a gnome SK, you're GOING to look GOOFY! ;)<br />

Aye Luna, VI has a history of doing this, introducing something new and making it slightly better than the previous incarnations. Why? To get people, old and new, to try it, of course!<br />
<br />
If they introduced gnomes and they had WORSE stats and they levelled slower.... who would play them?<br />
<br />
Iksar were introduced and they received many super benefits in an effort to make them popular, right out of the starting gate.<br />
<br />
Same with Vah Shir. <br />
<br />
They wouldn't make all these cool new things and then ruin their introduction by making them 'mediocre' from the start.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Nosebarsher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Hehe, i've been hoping for gnome sks since i started playing EQ.  I quit a while back and restarted my account once i heard gnomes could be sks :)  i made a gnome sk on a different server and loving it.<br />
<br />
Oh, my old main char was a level 54 troll sk who was made in Nov 99, so i'm an old skool gnome sk ;O<br />
<br />
Anyone else reroll their sks to be gnomes?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kainzzothewindmaker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">HAH!<br />
<br />
I played a TROLL SK to lvl 54 as well before starting My GNOME. Troll was on drinal and my gnome is on Sullon Zek which i love to play! No one ever thinks i'm a SK when PvPing and I always get told &quot;I thought you were a rogue&quot; after I HT them :p<br />
<br />
I enjoy being small, deadly, &amp; hard to hit!<br />
<br />
Soloing is abit different as a gnome is more geared for fear-kiting with it's HIGH mana &amp; lower STA than the fatties.. . BUT as gear improves its MUCH easier to max out STR/STA than it is INT.<br />
<br />
<br />
Conclusion:  GNOME = WIN!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>25psi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Gnome SK is a seekening sight (Pukes on the floor). They should have never been given ability to be Necros either. Gome Mage - YES, Wizz - YES, Chanter, Cleric - YES. Even Warrior is OK. But Necros and SK are just WRONG for gnomes!<br />
<br />
And yes they make a great dish especially if with a side of Hafling Garlic Dressing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Gnax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">IMHO, Gnomes are superior to DE SKs for 1 reason only ... they are not KOS everywhere you go.  Sure, you may have to be sneaky some places (like druid rings) as a Gnome, but not nearly so much as a DE.<br />
<br />
Statwise, race really doesn't matter.  All stats can be compensated for by gear.<br />
<br />
Of  course, the best reason to play a Gnome SK is ... they're DEAD SEXXAH!  Just go up to that cute wood elf druidess and offer her &quot;hot gnomish sexx0r&quot;(tm) in exchange for a sow... you'll see what i mean.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Zakton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I do have to say that the Gnomes get some nice SK Tinkered armour that gives really good bonuses.  But I wouldn't switch out being a DE SK just to play a Gnome one.</div></div><hr />
