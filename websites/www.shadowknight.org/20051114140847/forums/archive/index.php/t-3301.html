<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Saknar</div><div class="date">07-07-2002, 04:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok so me and two of my real life buddies decide to head to the arena to practice a little PVP.  None of us have much experience doing it so we wanted to improve our skills.  I am a 40 sk, my buddies are a 46 mage and 46 ranger.  Needless to say the Mage owned me.  He had an earth pet that continuously rooted me while he stood back and nuked.  Now I was always told to ignore the pet and just kill that caster but with it rooting me should I just kill the pet asap then go after the caster.  I managed to get a Harm touch off on the mage and a few life taps but that was it.  He resisted all of my other spells.  THink with lifetaps and harmtouch I took himdown to 60% before he killed me.  Now the ranger, hehe this was a long fight.  Despite the level difference we have nearly the same ac and hps.  He was using a wurmy and centi ls, I was using a 30 37 2hs.  Of course my spells would not stick with exception off my various taps so fear snaring did not work.  Just got cancel magic so I fizzled a lot and notice that it removed all my self buffs and never took away his root hmm.  Anyway we both got pretty low on health then he hit me for a nuke with 249 pts.  I though wowa didn't know rangers at 46 could nuke that much.  I got on the phone and he used a right click from a bow he was carrying.  Well we then duked it out.  He killed me and only had 130 hps left.  Still made me happy that I almost beat him without using my dots, fear or snare.  Oh btw I started with a pet and he killed him quickly after snaring me.  I would be happy to get any suggestions on how to kill the mage although I think that most responses are gonna tell me to get closer in level.  What is the main strategy with mages, ignore the pet or kill the pet right away.  Thanks for the suggestions.  Now I am gonna take my 51 chanter and get a little paybacks.</div></div><hr />

Everytime the pet returns, Re-Fear and continue after the caster. Use all the dots you have, since mages can't heal themslves. throwing a snare on the pet may not be to bad of an idea either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Skek</div><div class="date">07-07-2002, 10:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's also worth dispelling his pet first as he's bound to have burnout on it... alternately... start with your pet... fairs fair... and use it to distract his pet while you make short work of him.   Pets tend to ignore attack commands if something is already beating on it.  Oki... your pet wont last long, but it will give you time to debuff/dot the mage.  It doesn't take many whacks of the sword to kill one.  Once your pet is dead, use fear as suggested above.  Of Note... don't try and fight his pet.  A good mage will be able to chain summon pets using the summon/get lost combo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brael</div><div class="date">07-07-2002, 01:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">dispell him and his pet, since you dont have boil blood yet use heat blood on the mage, its on a fairly hard resist check so it should land, if your rooted and cant dispell it you can try shadowsteping away espically if his pet is snared, it will give you some time to get away</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baelic</div><div class="date">07-10-2002, 01:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mage should be a pice of cake, I wouldnt even worry too much about dispelling him unless you use a fast damage weapon and he has a damage shield, just fear his pet or snare it if fear won't stick and dot that mage. Its obvious he has high mr so just use your heat blood, siphons and sword to take him out, always finish with ht, ie wait till mage is at or under 2 bubs of health, if you do it right though you should not even need ht for the mage. <br />
<br />
If fear sticks to his pet then send yours in on mage it will distract him alot and add some nice disrupts. Sounds like you mr is low if you are getting rooted by the pet, get it 70 if possable, both roots and snares are usually resisted.<br />
<br />
The ranger you should also be able to beat if you get your mr to 70 or more and don't get snared, if he dots you ignore it, a ranger dot at that level is no worse than your heat blood, just dot him back.<br />
<br />
Use your 2hd weapon and learn how to joust by hitting him turning off attack and avoiding his hits then running back in and hitting attack again. You will dice him up especially if he sticks with his dual wield.<br />
<br />
Sounds like he also has high mr so I wouldnt worry too much about snaring him, try with clinging darkness a few times it only costs 20 mana, otherwise use heat blood and some atk debuffs, siphon str to reduce his attack rating and then siphon life back as needed, wouldnt worry about shadow step against the ranger he will just bow kite you, unless you can't get ya mr up and need space to dispell his snare, then by all means use it and click off all your buffs before ya start as cancel magic just removes a random buff. Pumice stones remove the top buffs.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Soulforge</div><div class="date">07-10-2002, 03:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A few simple things to remember for a duel that i usually follow.  Against pc's, your dots are junk due to resist rates.  of course if u could get snare/fear to land, it'd be awesome but i've found that i just blow too much mana getting snare to land inthe first place, and when i try to fear it lasts anywhere from 1-10 seconds.  Don't try.  I've had little more luck with our disease dots, but still not worth it. what i use in a duel?<br />
1) Primary tap<br />
2) Shadowstep<br />
3) Nullify magic/Cancel magic<br />
4) Boil blood/heat blood<br />
5-8) Whatever stat taps you prefer and spells you prefer against certain classes.  sometimes i load cancel magic here too in adition to nullify magic.  TAKE FD OFF (i've hit it too many times in duels accidently... sure they laugh their ass off,but u take a beating too)<br />
<br />
In most fights i don't bother dispelling the opponent because of the number of clickies out there (i keep 2 on me so i'm not dispelled).  We have a few buffs that help us in a duel such as our tap proc buff, cloak of akheva and DS at higher levels, so don't worry too much bout em.  Root/snare lands? go ahead and click ALL your buffs off yourself, then ur nullify/cancel magic can have it's way with the unwanted ones first shot.  I start the battle w/ boiling/heat blood just because it lands easily, then i'll stat tap, and go melee.  if your life gets to around 60 try to tap it up to 80-90 or so(low resist, damages him, heals you... what could be better?).  if interrupts are a prob shadowstep and tap him.  with pet classes as mentioned before, fear that pet before you start on the owner.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps with your mage and ranger friend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Groobash</div><div class="date">07-11-2002, 02:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mages have some spell or AA thing now that lets them make their pets become fearless. I haven't yet dueled a mage with it, but wonder if invis makes pets lose their target? :)<br />
<br />
If they don't have it tho, like they said above, fear the pet and forget it while you bonk the mage. They're pretty helpless with their pet to defend them. /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baelic</div><div class="date">07-11-2002, 10:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah ya probably right about that fearless thing on high lvl mage pets, had trouble with fearing a lvl 60 mages pet awhile back. A fellow sk just snared it and it caused no trouble.<br />
