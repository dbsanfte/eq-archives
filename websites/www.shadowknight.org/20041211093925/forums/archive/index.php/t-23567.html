<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Goregan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone got info on how to do this, i know you can somehow but not sure and couldnt find anything where you need to gather x amount of certain parts from orc/skeleton where you learn there weaknesses and so on. Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lucard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I could be wrong, but I think you have to buy a book first to initiate these quests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Greggthegrmreapr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i don't think you need to buy anything.  i just slaughtered a lot of orcs, and when i dinged 12, i was given the choice of orc or gnoll mastery, and got a spell that lets me have advantages over orcs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>CursedBlue</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There are apparently 3 sorts of masteries perhaps giving their individual skills... one you gain for free at 12. The other one I know of is continuously kill one type of monster such as undead, orc, or goblin and you will able to receive a title in addition to proficiency against them. Also you can do a quest by collecting their lore pieces. The orc mastery quest you can start at commonland crossroads. Its inside that tower (looking for that one building in the middle of crossroads...not hard to find). Inside adjacent to the door are shields and swords hung on the wall...behind one shield gives you a scroll for the quest...good luck  :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Goregan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">bah Cursed beat me too it, i went looking for these quests and found the orc one on the inner wall on tower at the crossroads in Comm, let the board know if anyone finds a zombie or skeleton one please.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>CursedBlue</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Muhahah!<br />
<br />
I have yet to find any other quest, but am collecting pieces for undead... Orcs and goblins are okay but how cool is undead slayer!!!  :D  I am not aware of collecting any other pieces so far *cept gnolls maybe but thats in qeynos*<br />
<br />
I'll give you guys a heads up when I do find out   :cool:<br />
<br />
Edit: Found out you can get items for elemental enemies and golems</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Berren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yes, you get the quest from a book.  I'm working on the Orc Lore quest right now.  You get a book as a drop, mine was titled Orc Society, after reading through the book, about 10 pages, you get the quest.  You have to collect various body parts, i.e. heart, spine, spirit, eye, of an orc.  After doing so you finish I would think.  Currently I still need a spirit to finish.<br />
<br />
I do believe there is also one for the undead as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Xilith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think the book ones (the old Mastery quests that the Tactics system replaced) just give you a trophy for your apt. as a reward.<br />
<br />
The titles are for killing 500 (I think) of the appropriate type.<br />
<br />
The special abilities are chosen at certain levels for doing nothing other than getting that level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>CursedBlue</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Please define trophy... I thought it might give an alternate skill or title but it seems neither...Only thing I can think of is a house hold item &quot;Mounted Orc's Head&quot;  :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Goregan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">main EQ2 site info on this  (http://eqiiforums.station.sony.com/eq2/board/message?board.id=quest&amp;message.id=2186)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>CursedBlue</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Was a joke earlier o.o; You litterally put a head up of an orc on your wall...thats useless to me!  :mad:</div></div><hr />
