<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">If you use your horse in a zone where you cant normally summon it, it will grey all your spell icons out... really sucks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sarrasis Darkmist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ive had my gems grey out on me 4 times now!  I wasnt sure what was causing it.  Its so friggin annoying to have to camp and come back.  (not sure if zoning fixes it because I was too far from zone out each time)<br />
<br />
Anyway, thanks for the heads up as to what is causing it and I hope they fix it soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Naubi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Procing something will fix it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Marder Blacksoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Problem is, it won't even let me sit down to camp.  It treats it like I am in mid spell cast and won't let me loot anything, click on anything, etc.  I always wind up having to /q to fix it.  I have /bug reported it 4 times now but they certainly seem in no hurry to fix it do they?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Saruton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It seems after about a minute or two the spells are usable again. And happened for me two days again. Its quite an annoying bug.</div></div><hr />
