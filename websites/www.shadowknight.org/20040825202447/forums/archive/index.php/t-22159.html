<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Banuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My search skills are apparently the suxx... I'm trying to find the video of the guy shoving his head into the sheeps hind end, I have numerous people who haven't seen it and say it's not possible, I gotta gross the poor bastards out... <br />
<br />
If you happen to have it on hand just drop the link here, or the thread name its in, i've through different threads for 2-3 hours with no luck =(<br />
<br />
Please, help me, help them!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Khat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It was a Clearasil commercial if I remember right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Androsulach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I remember seeing it, but I forget which thread it was in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Cestodas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Where else than on sk.org would a thread headlined &quot;help&quot;, contain a request for a movie clip with some guy sticking his head up a goats ass?<br />
I love this board :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Androsulach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">But you understand why he did it.  Hell, I think that thread is here somewhere.<br />
<br />
Try searching for asshat or ass hat.  I think that video was linked for one of the newbs to explain what it meant.  Not 100% sure, but I seem to recall asshats in the thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Askeer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I seem to recall asshats in almost every thread :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Androsulach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">True, it is used at least once in a lot of threads on the board and not just here in Flame On.  It'll take some work, but I'm sure he'll find the link.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Khat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Here is the thread:<br />
