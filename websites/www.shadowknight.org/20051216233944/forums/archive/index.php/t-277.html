I was wondering if anyone has ever bought or tried one of those books on tips to make thousands of plat and levels in a couple of hours and if they work or not... i'm figuring with the high prices in the eq economy and so many people being able to pay 45k+ for items, there has to be some neat tricks on it other than buying low and selling high (i hate being a pc vendor) and even trying to save every pp you make.<br />
<br />
If the books do work, which tips books are worth it?<br />
<br />
Thanks for the time:)</div></div><hr />

On Xegony, GFay is the same as EC on most other servers. If you have the patience to sit there listening to auctions and haggling prices/trading up and down, you can make some real platinum fast, but as I don't have the tenacity for it, I'm broke as hell rofl. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Other than that, don't waste your RL cash on those stupid books, they're all sh**. If you wanna make lots of plat, heres 2 ideas.<br />
<br />
<br />
1. Head down into CC and farm the geonid tunnel for a few days. In one day of this with my wife as Cleric, we made near 800pp from the gems they dropped. Not too bad ey? :)<br />
2. Get amiable or better faction in Paineel and go farm the guards that are JUST down from the elevator. They drop some plat, and bronze gear that sells for a few as well. Easy to make 600pp in a day if you stick to it :)<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nasiir</div><div class="date">03-31-2002, 06:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been very very surprised with the experience and platinum I have been getting in ToFS. At level 53, once I get a rhythm going, I can get a blue bubble in about 40 minutes or so, which I'm guessing isn't bad exp, worst case, and at best is really good exp for my level. I camp the 6th floor area with shades. When you zone into the 6th floor, go straight ahead through the first intersection to the deadend, then head right, as if you were heading to the incoherent spirit, but instead of going right at the fork, head left for a room full of 5 shades. Once I kill all of the shades, I move towards the exit, just nearby (from the zonein, head to the deadend and head left instead of right), and there are around 7 more shades to pull. I'm not sure, but due to the &lt;ahem&gt; favorable pathing when mobs are feared, you might even get better exp from pulling the gnoll looking things to the zonein spot and fear kiting them (you can definitely get insanely quick exp doing this as a necro). However, I think taking advantage of said pathing is tantamount to exploiting. In addition, each shade can drop as high as 10plat, plus gp/etc, certain spells, gnomeskin, crystalized shadow, and crystalize weaponry so in a day of hunting, I racked up about 1k worth of plat (probably 85 percent in plat and gold). I hit 53rd the night before last, and even though I haven't really been taking full advantage of my weekend to put in a lot of time, I'm already half way through 53rd.<br />
<br />
*edit*<br />
Also forgot to mention, that if you want to just make tons of plat semi-easily, you can always farm RM for Hill Giants, who can drop 30 or more plat per giant. You can easily make tons and tons of plat doing this for a long time.</div></div><hr />

sebilis is the best spot for getting xp and loot together i've found<br />
the geonids are good, also usually camped because of that<br />
ToFS i haven't been to for the loot but it's a great dungeon anyways, i've certainly not been unhappy with the loot i've had out of there...and due to the keys thing it's usually not camped<br />
and in OoT theres a giant named Gornit (?spelling) who is reliably rich and you can kill cyclops to occupy yourself between pops<br />
also those droods in WC are ok for small change</div></div><hr />
