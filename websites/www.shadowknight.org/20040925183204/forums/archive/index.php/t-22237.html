<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Powa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I remember that SOE stated about melee like rog/mnk/war will be able to look for mob's opening, then use disc etc to deal great dmg. It's already been in, or they just forgotten it?? i never heard of anything about it for a few months heh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Noctix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">They abandoned the opening system.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>bastardlunatic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">would someone care to explain the mechanics of it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">would someone care to explain the mechanics of it?<br />
<br />
Hard to explain the mechanics of something that the players never saw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zakton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If I had to take a blind guess I would say that the &quot;opening&quot; system had problems due to client to server lag.  Plus they already hit like 5 hotkeys during a fight why add more?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Krushum Gudended</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">wish I only had to press 5 hotkeys during a fight</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Baaguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The whole concept sucked donkeys in Tijuana 'cause it couldn't get a job anywhere else.  If people wanted to play online Tekken or Mortal Kombat, they would, but they won't so they don't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Krudler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The whole premise was based on supposedly finding a mob's weakness.  A warrior would be fighting a mob and a message box would open up telling them they've found an opening on the mob or some BS.  If they pressed the button it would weaken the mob by making it do less damage or allowing the group to do more damage...etc.  As was said before it never was implemented so it's hard to tell exactly what it would have done, but it did look pretty stupid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Agarwaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It was (brokenly) implemented on Test during the testing for the new melee discs system.<br />
<br />
In essence you had a bar (or was it word, I forget it was that pathetic) in the combat window change colour, which meant ‘hit x disc NOW’ only by the time you hit it, it never worked, and since there was no game graphics or sound to indicate the event (eg a block or parry) you could never activate your disc easily (eg riposte).<br />
<br />
I know I slammed it, I am sure a lot of other testers did.  The aggro dots disc line however got my thumbs up /mutter.<br />
<br />
The idea stemmed from the DAoC combat system IMHO, which is far superior in this aspect.<br />
<br />
However without the associated combat animations and effects working reliably real time the system blew, and I don’t doubt the idea of reworking the combat animation system reduced the dev crew to a quivering mess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Parasite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Asherons Call 2 also had this opening System.<br />
They even had blinking arrows flashing around the mob when you were able to do such a critical hit opening or so :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Thought this was a copy of the FFXI system?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Derraj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">it probably does.<br />
whats good about them stealing ideas from other games though is the fact that you won't have to buy a new game anymore! SoE will take ideas from other games and it will be just like your playing the game they stole it from.<br />
<br />
kinda hard now to guess what SoE will steal next from other games in order to try and get more players, anyone want to try?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Skvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">kinda hard now to guess what SoE will steal next from other games<br />
<br />
Probably a lot less than other games have stolen from EQ over the years</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Eatpeople</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">IMO, Horizons stole EVERYTHING from EQ.  Somehow, they made it worse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Paynreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">IMO, Horizons stole EVERYTHING from EQ.  Somehow, they made it worse.<br />
<br />
Really? Care to elaborate? Now im all curious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Eatpeople</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">You can download and play Horizons for free for a week.  I cancelled and deleted after a day.  Best thing to do is see for youself.  All I can tell you is that all but one of the races are the same, ans all of the classes are the same as EQ.<br />
<br />
The combat system appears identical.  I guess if you are into tradeskills, it may be better.  I however, am not.<br />
<br />
If Artifact , the company that made Horizons, didn't file for Bankruptcy two weeks ago, EQ would be able to sue, and prolly collect.  Suing bankrupt companies is like kissing your sister.</div></div><hr />
