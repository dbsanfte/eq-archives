<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Roorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hiya!  I was in a group that was wandering/crawling through Nadox (LoY) last night and we stumbled/were lead to a room that we entered from below by walking up a flight of stairs through a &quot;trap&quot; door that had a lever up to to open.<br />
<br />
This room had several mob spawns (three of which aggroed when we neared the top of the steps).  In this room, a named (sorry, can't remember) spawned which we killed.  Upon his death... a High Priest something or other shouted some nonesense, and two other mobs (untargetable, but tradeable) spawned, one lying on the ground.<br />
<br />
At this point, some guild chat with some member guilds indicated this was an &quot;unsolved&quot; triggered event.  I have looked at various class boards and haven't found anthing.<br />
<br />
Since you can't target the mobs, you can't get a hail out of them (didn't respawn to untargetted hails).  Also, we killed everything in the room, we even triggered the initiation mob a couple times doing so... <br />
<br />
I have searched on Nadox through the forums but didn't get a hit on anything close (for the threads that I read, skimmed some of the titles.)<br />
<br />
Can anyone provide information or a link for this event?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Roorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks for the link, but this is inside Crypt of Nadox, not in Dulak's Harbor...<br />
<br />
I'm talking about the High Priest quest from one of the zone in's from the mines...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Morgrist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Not sure what the trigger is,but apparently this is the mob that triggers Innoruuk.<br />
 <br />
Odds are it's a &quot;kill all of X mob,thus siccing angry Hate god on your people&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lovamoor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If I'm not wrong, it's the beginning of Bloodspear the Wretched ( http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=11611 ) script event. <br />
I did it with 4 others lvl65, was tense sometimes with our weird classes combo but we prevailed. Drop was adapted with the level intended of the people doing this scripted event (55-60).</div></div><hr />
