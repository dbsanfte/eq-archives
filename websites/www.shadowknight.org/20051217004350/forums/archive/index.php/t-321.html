<br />
I'm thinking melee crits, to up my damage output a wee bit.  I buff up enough to add tank about anything my guild does.  Crits seem good as a &quot;reward&quot; for getting the xp because it has more &quot;fun&quot; value than the alternatives.<br />
<br />
Eventually, I will get level 1 in all 3 tank abilities and then PE.<br />
<br />
So I don't want to get a tank disc for my first point.  The other alternatives I'd consider:<br />
<br />
Chanelling Focus<br />
Spell Crits<br />
<br />
I suppose most people get combat fury first, eh?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nocifer Deathblade</div><div class="date">04-01-2002, 04:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cuz I solo or duo alot purely for exp grinding, I would invest 2 into mental clarity first thing. It'll just cut down downtime per fight. :) I dunno about your goal and way of earning experience so it can be different approach for you..<br />
<br />
I would do combat fury last thing after getting impt stuff first. ;) I think lvl 1 mental clarity &gt; lvl 1 combat fury. Lvl 1 fury is just mostly for eye candy for most ppls. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brael</div><div class="date">04-01-2002, 04:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">seeing as how your leveling slow getting the &quot;good&quot; abilites would take awhile, so ya... go with something fun, it doesnt go off much though so if your expecting more damage... youll be disappointed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xilith</div><div class="date">04-01-2002, 04:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm expecting a 1% increase in my damage.<br />
<br />
One point of mental clarity is 10 mana per minute.  That would be one Drain Soul extra every 22 minutes, or about 30 (healing + damage) a minute increase avg.  Counting a lifetap as damage+healing = double damage that is about 0.5 dps change.<br />
<br />
I generally solo for my xp because I'm not on much during non-raid times and can't commit to a longer group endeavor (though I desperately want to try the new Cazic).  I do most of my soloing for xp in Fungus Grove due to convenient location, safety, and ease of soloing.  If someone has a better spot for a lvl 60 SK with Epic, Soul Defiler, Fungi but nothing truly uber (no Palladius Axe or Tunare Flamberge) feel free to PM me.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pajita</div><div class="date">04-01-2002, 05:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Channelling focus seems to be more of a tank ability... if you're not getting hit, you don't need to channel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jarxle</div><div class="date">04-01-2002, 06:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am at the same stage, I should get my 2nd point this week and I think I will put it into Crits.  I know it is just eyecandy, but hey that will be much more fun for me.  I have approx the same ecquipment as you, I do have a primal so that helps a ton.  I will start another thread about nerfed aaexp.  <br />
<br />
Go for what is fun, that is why I play this game :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mystina</div><div class="date">04-02-2002, 05:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My first archetype was the crits for exactly same reasons as yours, and I don't regret it.<br />
Crits go off pretty often with more than 200 dex, even with only 2 points in it.<br />
<br />
You scores a critical hit! (57)<br />
You Bash a_mob_01 for 57 points of damage!<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leyrin</div><div class="date">04-02-2002, 10:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Best xp place ever is still Sebilis.<br />
<br />
Grab a Ranger 60 with Epic/Primal, a Direcharm chanter, or a Bard.<br />
<br />
Mostly because of the Hasted/Sowed mobs there.<br />
<br />
Even Krups are soloable. Just Fear Kite em.<br />
<br />
The only problem is the people always training my XP spot, aka the Upper Exit. :p<br />
<br />
For the fear Kite you start at Zone out then they move along to jump in water but mostly Fear will wear off at the room with 3 spawns.<br />
<br />
But duo you can easylly camp Disco 1, or Disco Hall.</div></div><hr />
