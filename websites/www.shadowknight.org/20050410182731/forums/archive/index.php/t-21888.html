<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Necplur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I need some advice on getting and keeping aggro. Are there any guides?  I thought there would be a sticky . . . While I seem to be doing OK,  a 54 MNK friend (crazy twinked) just rejoined the group and it seems like I lose aggro more than I want to.<br />
<br />
I've done reading and searching here,  but I have some questions:<br />
<br />
At 49, I have Voice of Shadows loaded.  After this buff, I have three (four)ways to keep aggro:<br />
*  Terror of Shadows<br />
*  Clinging Darkness<br />
*  Taunt<br />
*  (proc'ing weapons, but is not determinant, I have to wait for it to proc.)<br />
<br />
I normally pull with Terror of Shadows/Darkness.<br />
<br />
Once engaged,  I continually hit taunt and the occasional Terror of Shadows.<br />
<br />
1.)  Should I be doing something else at this level?  While Clinging Darkness seems like a good Hate increaser,  it can be resisted (like the constructs in the Hole, it never sticks at my lvl. . .)  Terror of Shadows seems to be never resisted.  And while my role is NOT DPS, it seems like it takes forever to cast (though I realize lucy says it is only 0.75 seconds longer . . .)<br />
2.)  Does taunt work well/in the next few levels?  How well does taunt work?  I use it continuously.  And once I lost KEI and mana after a TPW in the Hole last night, I used that only,  and it almost seemed to work better.  Is this only because at my level dk blues can be taunted with a skill of 180 (my max) and at lvl 55 dk blues no longer will be taunted with this?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1.  Open with a CD or two<br />
2.  If you lose agro (and only if you lose agro) taunt and cast CD again in that order.  Taunting when you have agro is useless.<br />
3.  Resists or immunity from spells doesnt change their agro generation.<br />
<br />
That should be all you need to know in an exp session at 49</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Trysbrina67</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It doesnt matter if clinging darkness is resisted, it still generates aggro.<br />
Spears (when not resisted) give a nice chunk or aggro and damage.<br />
<br />
My suggestion would be to use Clinging, highest terror and a spear to help keep aggro until you hit 60+(to be honest 2 clingings + melee should be enough aggro for 99% of fights).  In the 60+ game the mobs you fight are too high level to be affected by fear and fear spells generate more aggro than the terror line.<br />
<br />
Taunt is a skill check, when you successfully taunt you gain the aggro on the mob + a small amount of hate.  Taunt has the best success rate on dark blue mobs and below.  Using taunt on evens, yellows and reds tends to have a lower chance of success.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">alternating CD and Terror should leave you with zero problems in maintaining aggro.. honestly you can just chain CD and not even have to turn attack on  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Spam CD<br />
Get a Throneblade of Yekesha (not worrying about DPS atm) get a dex buff...between the prodc and Cd you'll never worry about agro with the Monk until you get better equipped, then you just spam CD/Terror for a bit..2/3 CD's at beginning of fight and you're golden (fear when applicable)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>StPatrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have almost the same problem. One of my guildies - monk lvl 60 - I group with, has damn fast + 200-300 procs weapons. This always makes me difficult to keep aggro, because damn, I want to &quot;play&quot; with my spells too (dots, group buffs). When grouping with that monk, I have no option but only cast high aggro spells. And those I use - Fear and CD, with maybe Festering on a pull (and thanx for explainations to me in some other thread here about Fear). So basically chain casting Fear and CD works pretty good to me. Also, if you lose aggro only rarely to a monk, I personally wouldn't mind that at all - monk can quickly FD and let you have aggro back if he wants to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nambkab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">At level 49, casting Fear is a good way to get everyone killed.  Best bet is to forget Terror except on Mez breaks, and just pull with CD, cast another at camp, one about mid fight, and one towards the end just to clinch aggro.  Should have no more problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">fear and cd are my fav tools at 65 have both mem'd all times.<br />
<br />
Now for 49 if you can afford it spell gem wise i'd say put cd then in the spell gem right next to it put terror of shadows open up with cd then cast tos during its recast, after that drop a cd and hope you can hold agro with melee from then on. Only thing i remember really about 49 was i would have trouble keeping up with chaining agro spells but then again i never had kei and rarely had c1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Oagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">At your level, just mem CD.  Chain it.  You won't have any problems.  You're sitting on the fence trying to be DPS, which we really aren't, and a tank.  You're a tank, or you should be striving to be one.  We all wish we did more dps.  We can do decent burst dps.  However, when you have a monk with high proccing weaps (from the sounds of it, he is using a copper hammer and orb of forgotten magic), just use CD, and keep using it.  <br />
<br />
Cheap mana cost, great aggro.  No more problems.  Stop worrying about seeing the line that you were the one that killed the mob.<br />
<br />
When you get to higher levels (tier 2 and above or 55+ mobs) start adding fear (yeah the lvl 15 spell) to the lineup.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Excessium</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">WTF, nobody has flamed him for not using the search button yet???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Was hoping Khat would post here with her sig first...just seemed appropriate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Excessium</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I've done reading and searching here,  but I have some questions:<br />
<br />
 <br />
Also he is a liar.  :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Khat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Was hoping Khat would post here with her sig first...just seemed appropriate.<br />
<br />
By the wording Necplur used it sounds like he's seen it already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Necplur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">First, I just wanted to say something that I don't see enough here (maybe since we're supposed to be lovers of death and hate . . . . ) <br />
<br />
Anyway,  Thanks!  Great info.  Now, let's see if  can keep aggro from my lizard friend with his Orb/CHaoS (and six levels my senior . . . I can do it!)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
To Excessium:<br />
Also he is a liar.  :mad:<br />
<br />
I'm no liar.  I may be bad at searching and stupid, but I am no liar!   :o <br />
<br />
And hey, nice sig, Excessium.  But couldn't you find a better card?  I mean, come on, 2/2?  You're better than that.  Maybe an Eastern Paladin or a Mercenary Knight or something?<br />
<br />
<br />
To Khat:<br />
Aye, I did see that super cool sig!  Very cool.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kilkulan Darkwarrior</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">this may sound dumb as hell... but I never use CD.. I use Festering...  I have never had aggro problems</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ashrai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Most folks use CD over Festering for mana purposes, it's nice and cheap and does the trick. I'll use Festering situationally, especially in exp groups if I'm tagging off a puller and the mob is snareable- gives a ton of time for debuffs to land.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">i use festering if i am the group snare..<br />
i use cd for everything else one groupable.<br />
<br />
i use cd for MA/Boss tanking on raids<br />
and use fear for everything else i need to do</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Ramgar SK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I use both my main snare (Cascading) and then Clinging for aggro.  One of each and I have aggro for the whole fight, usually.  If someone manages to take it, I just taunt and CD again.<br />
<br />
If you are recasting Festering for aggro, you are wasting a lot of time and mana, CD is fast and cheap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Excessium</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">To Excessium:<br />

Man, that card is a classic. I used it for what it represents and that damn quote on it. <br />
Well anyway, if it makes you happy... :p <br />
