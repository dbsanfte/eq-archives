<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Amphitryon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ive seen the lists of who has IC and greenmist but Im wondering how many of us are out there that have BOTH the IC and the Greenmist?<br />
<br />
Im figuring the numbers must be near microscopic across all servers<br />
<br />
I am proud to say I have finished both (and didnt buy a single peice of either quest, I was present through the entirety of both quests.) -  I should also add I play a DE SK and I went through bone chip hell since Kunark came out to get Ikky faction.<br />
<br />
(yes I am a quest nut, I did the dark forge quests back before the CT revamp and the   small additions that were made to get decayed armor pecies easier - CT was where a SK learned to hate lol)<br />
<br />
anyway, any one else out there that has gotten both?<br />
<br />
edit..oh yea..since i dont have a sig<br />

Only greenmist may see any use possibly with Emperor fights only because of Shissar bane; I'm not down to do another time sink for a 2nd shissar bane weapon thats a 2 hander.</div></div><hr />

hehe if the law of averages holds true, Id guesstimate we have not quite 30 sks serverwide who have both, talk about an elite few!</div></div><hr />

Only 2000 bonechips saved up, not near enough I'm afraid.  But a good start. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Auronan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I have both and I was the first on my server to get the Greenmist, and the first (and I think still ONLY) Iksar to get the Epic, likewise on my server.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What is the IC quest?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Dobbin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">wow, if there ever was a noob question, that'd be it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>grosbras2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I never tried greenmist as an ogre I do not use 1HS period.<br />
 2 HS , 2HB piercing but never 1HX, an ogre can smash and 2HX was always much better at every level (look at the price at the bazaar, I bought all my weapons until the epic). <br />
Now That I have finished epic I do not see the use to try greenmist, moreover as an ogre I kill on sight everything which is not ogre , except DE (I needed vendor in ro when I was younger, and neriak is much better for vendors), and troll sometimes. So my iksar faction (as most faction on norath) is maxed KOS, so I do not think I will ever try it.<br />
<br />
But I agree with you cazic was very fond memory even if it made me mad, I have finished 4 sets of decayed before having my last legs (which was graphically bugged at this time) and my camping of the pyramids (and the following CR) .... what a memory, new sk who can &quot;simply&quot; camp the crusader outside CT cannot understand ;)<br />
<br />
So just to say I am not sure that many ogre will ever try greenmist except for the fun of the quest itself.<br />

Ogre rule.</div></div><hr />
