<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gargar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've read all the posts on this board and others that i could find about Rhazar... even read tons of articles that weren't about him but mentioned him. I've tried all the possibilities mentioned to try and get him to spawn. Literally been out here for over 3 weeks every evening. Sometimes 6 hours... sometimes one. No friggin pop.<br />
<br />
I usually come on in the evening and play. 5pm to 2am <br />
It occured to me that maybe his spawn is on a diff time (say mornings?) <br />
<br />
My question is does anyone know what TIME they got their Rhazar spawns? I could be way off base here but DAMN i'm pissed at that little fugger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kyrkii Sa'Kyttn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">10pm PST, think I have too many screenshots :D <br />
<br />
I was there about 3 or 4 hours clearing the valley before I got him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dester</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just park a mule there (tracker preferred if you have one) and let your friends/ guild know your looking for him.  Will probably get him w/ in a few weeks for now effort, and still probably long before you see the hide drop in hate.<br />
<br />
Dester</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Stugein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I camped in RM after MQ'ing the AC piece of jboots for a friend (well, attempting to at least...Brother Zephyr was up, not Hasten).  When I logged in about two evenings ago Rharzar was flying around near the sphinx on the hill there.  Unfortunately I didn't have the firepower for him at the time so I just went invis, snapped a screenshot of myself with him, and left.  This was around 9:30-10:00 EST real time.  Not sure about in-game time.  I didn't think to check.  Also don't know if he had just recently popped or if he had been up for awhile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gargar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hey thanks.. the reason i even ask is that i put in a petition. Well, one of the guides told me that he couldnt help. HOWEVER he did say that he was on his regular spawn schedule. (whatever the F that means)  Kind of got me thinkin okay..  that doesnt sound like a PH has to be killed...   sounds like he pops at a certain TIME...      WTF do i know.. . looking for things that arent there maybe!  lmao<br />
<br />
In any event.. thanks!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fezzika</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">From my experience, Rharzar is a totally random pop...just mow all the drakes and he'll spawn.  I cleared for about 3 hours and he spawned.  Don't think he has a regular spawn time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Gargar, guides are nothing more than volunteer players, infact my character and alt combined have every power a guide has already (minus instant cast memblur, and non kos to all npc's) without having restrictions on our power.  Basically the guide program is a waste and guides can't do anything including giving you ingame hints.  When they say that Rhazar is on his regular spawn schedule you're simply reading to much into the comment, all it means is that the spawn isn't reported as being broken so is therefore working for all the guide knows, and will tell you that much.<br />
<br />
Also, he still spawns saw and killed him the other day for a friend, spawned as I was running through rathe mts so I figured what the hell and annhiliated him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Yaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I had to camp Rharzar 2 times and both times he spawned for me after about 20 minutes of slaying all the little drakes around the sphynx's hill.  Guess I am just lucky, but yeah, totally random spawn.  Guess my dice were loaded good for me both times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ganodoar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Rharzar is definately a random spawn. It took me one hour to get him to pop and I even saw Blackwing (bard epic drake) once. Interestingly enough he popped just as I was helping to take out the evil sphinx who argoed the bard heading to loot Blackwing. Just keep slaughtering the drakes in the valley and praying. Also kill the lizards too. They seem to be phs for drakes, which in turn are phs for rharzar/blackwing. Hope you can get Rharzar soon. Too bad the decrepit hide camp makes Rharzar look like a sick joke.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nafien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Chipping in my 2cp,<br />
<br />
I saw Blackwing 4 times before I saw the Rharzar.<br />
<br />
When he spawned it wasnt on the slopes of the hill but on the area around it.<br />
<br />
I just orbited the hill and slaughtered everything I came across and he popped after about 2 hours.<br />
<br />
Naf</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Eludicous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">a couple of hours... try days here and no go.... I slaughtered everything that moved around the sphinx and the sphinx itself and nothing 3 days straight 5 hours plus.... NOTHING =) can wait to do it again!<br />
<br />
LOL<br />
<br />
The things we do for our epics....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Stugein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Lucky spawn that will probably piss off Gargar:<br />
<br />
Went back to RM (read my first post in this thread) to attempt to MQ jboots for my friend again.  Once again Bro Z was running around like a goon so Hasten was nowhere to be found.  Oh well.  I went to the drake area to check on Rharzar.  Oh look, he's up (and damn hard to see, he blends well with the hill).  I called a few friends over to help me.  The group was Myself (55 SK), 52 PAL, 60 SK, 65 CLR, 53 BRD, 60'ish Shammie.  No sweat.  We mulch the little bastard.  I got my spine, there is much rejoicing.<br />
<br />
As soon as I stand up from looting the spine:<br />
<br />
{Bard} Hey guys.  I'm showing Rharzar up again.<br />
{Everyone else} !<br />
<br />
So we run over and mulch Rharzar II and gratz two SKs on a spine that night.<br />
<br />
I just thought it was interesting considering how long folks usually have to wait for him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gargar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">ARRRG!   Gratz to you man. I dont get pissed over stuff like that. Just makes me happy people have better luck. <br />
<br />
<br />
As im slaying everything on and around the hill in Rathe... there is the thought lingering in the back of my head &quot;DAYUM, i cant imagine having to slay 400+ drakes in Hate for the hide.&quot; Well, i am determined if anything. <br />
<br />
(had crap luck with the ghoulbane as well, didnt want to quest it and had to camp the stinkin shin lord for 35+ hours.) <br />
<br />
Thanks all for your posts and info.<br />
<br />
Going on a fear raid sat, so HOPEFULLY i'll have better luck with the soulleech!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Uggliey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">5-6 hours total camp time here over about 2 nights.  Got him about 8 PM EST.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gargar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">GOT that sumbitch! After all the time spent clearing the area trying to get him to pop, i finally talked 3 other guildies into coming out and helping. (they were bored so i didnt feel TOO bad).  All 4 of us spread out and killed everything. 5 mins after we started, POP! He beat down 2 of us, we called for reinforcements and got the spine. <br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help and info</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>vilesoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">We took out rharzar the other week.<br />
<br />
Forces were:<br />
<br />
<br />
first time<br />
me (55sk, and a goddamn twink)<br />
65 druid<br />
60 bard<br />
51 enchanter<br />
53 monk<br />
<br />
The bard got aggroed by the sphinx, and we wiped.<br />
<br />
<br />
2nd round<br />
me<br />
65 druis<br />
51 enchant<br />
53 monk<br />
58 cleric<br />
63 mage<br />
<br />
owned his ass...in a major way...basically we pet tanked him while me and hte monk got our ranged weapon skills up.  The cleric was healing the earth pet (i still wonder why he didnt use the fire pet, but oh well)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ashrai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Went out there last night, killed drakes (and everything else) for about an hour with a bored mage friend. Rhazar popped on the face of the hill, he's bright glowing green, can't miss him.  Forces were me, 65 Druid bot for heals, and 65 Mage+pet. <br />
<br />
<br />
So just kill everything around and on that hill and eventually he'll pop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kowl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I finally got my spine on 2-19-04 after the server came back up. I killed everything around the sphinx for about 30 minutes then noticed a little green drake flying towards me. I started to FD and call for some help when he smacked me 5 or 6 times and I died. Well I ran back and got my corpse screaming at my guild for help the whole way. Had 9 people show up and we made short work of him.</div></div><hr />
