<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kahel Everhate</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I did a search for info on Rhazar and found shtuff, nothing really useful about him all debates on how to spawn him, could care less. If i waited out Stormfeather I can survive a wait for rhazar.. anyhow here is my question.<br />
<br />
I am not guilded and have worked on my epic with my 61 sk and 56 clr g/f while duoing her's. I can pick up in a hate and fear raid easy enough, but i wanted to know if anyone thinks we could duo the lil green drake? i figure its probably not a good idea to duo him and was considering kiting him with dots, pet, spears and horse :D. Clr can heal me of the nuke dmg. I do realize he ch's, and have heard he has a relatively small mana pool. If need be i could probably gather up a few friends 65 mage  and shaman.<br />
<br />
i have the GB and BoA, only need the last sword and hide, which of course are the two fun pieces. <br />
<br />
Would appreciate any info yall can post on how hard he hits and if he maybe duoed. Thanks!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Paradox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Just keep killing all the drakes on and around the hill by the southern Sphinx.  Eventually Rharzar will spawn.  You'll end up killing Darkwing a few times (drops item for bard epic, just ooc that he's dead and a bard will come).<br />
<br />
Rharzar does not see invis.  His pathing, if not aggro'd, will take him around the hill, but not out of that area.  Get a soild group of guildies there to help you kill him, he's a little green drake, looks harmless - but he's nasty as hell.<br />
<br />
It can be a long camp, I spent several hours each day over several days trying to get it to spawn.  Finially, it did and I had 3 guildies show up (shaman, monk, necro - all 60+) and the 4 of us barely lived (mainly because we weren't buffed).<br />
<br />
Hope this helps - have fun!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Datul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Did this guy just this weekend.  Camped him solo for about 3 hours of drake slayage, and then ran away like a little frog when he popped. <br />
<br />
I ran him around the hill with the sphynx on it for about 10-15 minutes while I convinced my roommate to login his 63 mage.  I boxed up my 55 cleric and ran him over.<br />
<br />
I think that I ran the drake out of mana, since he was casting on me whenever I let him in range and then I ran out of range before his hits landed.  He didn't try to heal once during the fight with me, and I tanked him while the mage used his Black Steel and Air pet and I tossed out the occasional CH with the cleric.  Think it took all of 2 mins to kill him with just the 3 of us.<br />
<br />
Good luck on this punk, he aggros from across the hill when he pops, and your first sign of him will usually be - You have been struck by the judgement of the gods, or You resist the Reckoning spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kahel Everhate</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">so the bird can be duoed or treoed ... sweet thanks Dat!! That will help considering I am unguilded.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Did it with sk, shaman, necro, druid.  Very easy fight, hit for 288 max I think.  Casts alot too.  Could have done it with just shaman and sk.  Disease slow landed easy if I remember right.  Hardest part was getting him to spawn.<br />
<br />
Biggest problem you may run into, is if you have people waiting on the hill while your tank is running around killing drakes and the little bastard aggros them.  Best to catch him quick, so he doesnt beat up your other party members.  Little green drake, kinda tough to see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I killed a few drakes, he spawned within about 10 min... ran over to the enterance of the area and called in a few guildies.  Had 'em buff and pulled him to the enterance of the drake area.  Easy fight.  1 group of 60+ is overkill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kahel Everhate</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">For the reference of everyone reading and posting on this, lol...<br />
<br />
Ok i know yall have guilds to help you with this... I don't :) I was asking if you thought it would be possible to duo or trio this drake, with a 62 sk , 57 clr , maybe a 62 chanter and 65 mage... remember please I have NO guild :rolleyes:  .. my resources are limited. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Space</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">aye not hard did him 65sk/65shm duo without breaking a sweat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kahel Everhate</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Heya Space, with my 62 sk and 57 clr, would you recommend kiting him with spears and dots or straight melee him... I have heard that while he is magic resistant , disease spells land easily, so i am tempted to kite with spears as well as blood line<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ffejdoow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I just wanted to see if I could pop him one day and after about an hour and a half of killing everything that moved he popped.  <br />
<br />
He is a nasty thing.   I did a OOC asking if anyone wanted to help kill him and got two folks that way.  <br />
<br />
We did it with a cleric, a mage, a shammy, SK, and one other.  I think i was the highest a 57.  <br />
<br />
We just went toe to toe with it and took it down after about a 6 min fight.  <br />
<br />
I think you should try to maybe one or two more folks to help.  I know your not in a guild so just offer 300pp to anyone who will help.  That will get you a full group fast!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Malize Mikage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I happened to get the (innocent-appearing) little green drake to pop at a time most of the people in my guild were offline or heading out to get some sleep (things like this happen when you're West Coast and most of your guildmates are East Coast). The only guildie I could get to help was a 58 BST. I had been helping clear the area not only for Rharzar but for Blackwing, so the bard alt I was helping pulled in her 64 RNG and duo-boxed her mother's 62 CLR. Me, well, I'm a 53 SK (was 52 at the time this happened).<br />
<br />
We went toe-to-toe with the drake and it was about a 6 minute fight for us as well. The RNG got a bit chewed up, but none of us were ever really in danger of being killed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>anubis1179</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">one full group of who ever was on from my guild we had a SK(me), cleric, sham,Necro,wiz?, and encht was a easy fight. just got lucky that i was in RH making some plat off the RM HG and was he was up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Milon-MT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Killed him tonight with me(65sk) and a 62 shammy, wasnt hard even tho it is cleric mob he didnt CH or try to heal himself during fight cept 1-2 times and his HP never gained more than 2% so it was gimp healing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Vaelenu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">looks harmless - but he's nasty as hell hahaha .. my experience exactly! /shiver<br />
I was about 57 at the time and he certainly gave me a hard time. Went to RM to look for the camp site, and he found me. FDed under him for an hour while my guild pissed around doing other things and finally came to help me - I was convinced he would be KSed! I have a screenshot from afterwards of my guild gathered round his little body ... looks like a toy, but I assure you he is fun! ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Thingiemethong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">It took me a couple evenings ( 2 - 3 hours ) killing greens before he spawned on the day of patching after killing a couple greenies.  <br />
<br />
I tried it with my wife's level 54 Druid and myself ( 61 SK ) but no luck.. evac was our friend..  <br />
<br />
Got some extra help ( 65 enc / 65 cleric / 65 mage / 56 Ranger / myself 61 SK ) and we took it for a dance..  <br />
<br />
It was a massive overkill and very nice of the people who helped me..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Hudroponik_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">on mith marr RM is always full of druids , chanters and bards .. all 55+ .. i jsut /ooc bringing a mob to the tower on the giant hill lets kick his arse !  i need drop for epic !<br />
<br />
of course everyone was there when i got there and he was dead in about 5 sec ... solo spawned him in like 45 min , pain in the ass he is, but , its fun dragging him half way across the zone to an army waiting !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>halcyonforever</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I have now spent nearly 20 hours trying to get Rharzar to pop, I have killed Blackwing nearly 20 times, and still no little green drake.  Anyone heard if he might be broken?<br />
<br />
Or is it just my absloutely terrible luck.<br />
<br />
Chushan</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Paradox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I spent several days trying to get Rharzar to pop.  When he did finially, he spawned 3 times in a few hours.  Each time I was there and he didn't spawn I did a /feedback.<br />
<br />
Paging a GM does not help, they just say that they can't help stubborn NPCs to spawn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>halcyonforever</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Ok so as I am finnally getting sick to my stomach of killing drakes I head back for one more session of boredom, and the green bugger is there.  <br />
<br />
/petitioning can only bring a few certain results, some NPC's are known to the guides and GM's to be bugged and not spawning, so it never hurts tocheck.  True that they cannot do anything about making him appear but would suck to spend hours doing spawn dances for a mob that is lost in programming or stuck in a rock somewhere.  <br />
<br />
The gm that talked to me was very supprised that it took me so long but everything seemed to be working better.<br />
<br />
Now to get a Soul Leach</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Laymon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Just to clarify, is it necessary to kill zazamoukh (evil sphinx) while trying to get the little green drake to pop? Has anyone seen them both up at the same time?<br />
<br />
At 51 everything on the hill is no threat at all but zaza is still a little tough to solo.<br />
<br />
Luckily he's still non-kos to me (even after killing him twice) and i'd like to keep it that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Paradox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Leave the sphinx alone - he has nothing to do with the Rharzar spawn.  And yes, I've had Rharzar spawn with the sphinx up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Konghol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">After about 3 hours of killing drakes he spawned. Soloed him np, hit 278 or so max and had around 15khp, didnt even need harmtouch XD         http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=613739</div></div><hr />
