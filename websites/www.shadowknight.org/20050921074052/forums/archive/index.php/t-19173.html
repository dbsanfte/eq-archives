<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dknight</div><div class="date">12-28-2003, 08:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The biggest thing to know about this guy is that his hit box is retarded small.  It makes him really, really hard, especially if you don't know about this prior.  For this reason I tanked him as the Warriors had such a hard time finding his hitbox and not being able to get initial agro.  With the new target circles it might not be such a problem but it totally screwed up our first couple of attempts.<br />
<br />
Another problem that comes from his super small hitbox is that casters have to be in melee range to land spells.  If you're not in melee range you get an automatic resist.  Make sure that's clear to all debuffers and nukers.  He is slowable but it is partially resisted.<br />
<br />
Garudon has an AoE based Cold DD+Dot.  Make sure everyone has a buff spot free for the debuff and max out resists.  With Bard AoE resists and druid resists it is pretty easily resistable.  Without bard resists it lands a lot as we didn't have a full time bard at the time.<br />
<br />
From my experience with him there is no place to get where wall blocks his AoE.  So take this into account.  Have some heals massed or your healers will get tore up by the DoT.  We semi corner tanked him best we could, but it doesn't exactly work right for whatever the reason.  Have your best warriors shrunk and ready to AoE taunt if you do use a Knight to tank at first.  Which worked for us best at first.  I pulled him from theater down the column over to near the small steps that you use to enter the golem filled area.  I casted CD/fear on him quite a few times on the pull to build up agro.<br />
<br />
I didn't deal with the CH chain, so I can't tell you what pause to use there.  I was at the time around 8K+ hps and 1500+ AC w/ shield fully buffed.  He hits for max around 1000 or so I think.  Don't exactly recall.  Doesn't flurry, but does enrage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As an alternative to the long pull, you can have your raid hug the wall opposite the commanders and Garudon and clear the small room in the far corner.  Have your MT engage and pull him there.  Kinda gimpy but he walls easy enough in the broken portion and melee can still get to his asstastically small hitbox.  This can't be stressed enough, it is small.<br />
<br />
There will be a few spawns you need to clear first before you engage but they're about as tough as the mobs on the way to Garudon's area.<br />
<br />
Garudon looks like an oversized Ashenbone drake, melees for 980, and aes for 650 initial dd + dot.  Didn't notice any rampages or flurries but does enrage.  Rough guesstimate of his hps would be close to 200k or so, maybe a touch higher but I didn't parse the fight so can't give you a true total.  Don't recall the cheal timing for the fight but the MT wasn't in danger at any point during the encounter with 4 clerics.  As for the AE, have druids/shaman/pallies patch heal groups as needed.<br />
<br />
This is not a bad target to farm since I know on my server most guilds didn't bother with it.  Has some decent drops for all classes.<br />
<br />
Good luck and have fun.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Josahd</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 11:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I tried him a while back with a friend's guild.<br />
<br />
Hitbox is smaaaal... the tank coiuldn't hit it, couldn't hold aggro, was damn near impossible to melee, was damn near impossible to nuke... bastard was ping ponging everywhere so as soon as you found a spot you could hit him, he moved.<br />
<br />
2nd attempt we tried using a necro to skelly form  him.  Worked for a bit, the hitbox was probably about the same size, but you could see *where* to hit.  Then the necro died, clerics died, tank lost aggro, same story... got farther, but wipe (we were far from an ideal raid though).<br />
<br />
Just something to try.  A good pin seems essential to victory, and there's not many spots inside the theater that will work.  Holding aggro if you can't melee is also a plus, so having a knight tank makes sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Makkon</div><div class="date">01-08-2004, 04:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">3 or so nec can keep him in skel form pretty well all the time, helps with burrower too. its a high 40s spell and pretty common there is a cold based version (chill bones) and fire based (ignite bones) - also a version without the skel form - useful cuz it has a stun component<br />
<br />
im told the new target ring is actually a mobs hit box but i havent really played the sk on a mob that it was an issue with usually on the nec for raids<br />
<br />
his aoe is pretty resistable iirc with circle of seasons + bard song<br />
<br />
not a bad mob for his loot table imo</div></div><hr />
