Has this made them into a spell which can now be removed by Cure Disease instead of Cancel Magic?<br />
Yes, that was the goal behind the change to the spell lines.<br />
<br />
Getting slowed by an NPC is incredibly debilitating to players, and up until now you either had to just be sad until the spell wore off or risk dispelling all of your positive buffs while trying to remove the slow.  This change should add value to classes that can cure disease and make the spell line more useful. <br />
<br />
We are aware that there is a problem with slow spells generating additional agro due to the disease component, and hope to have that fixed in the next spells patch.<br />

WooT! No more waiting for slow to wear without losing 1/2 my buffs! Yay Diseeeze!</div></div><hr />

Though, what is our lvl 9 SOL Spell &quot;Despair&quot; Isn't that a Disease debuffer?</div></div><hr />

So buff MR if you want to resist.<br />
<br />
Btw, Malo does not lower the disease resist of a mob, only Scent(necro spell) and InsiduousDecay(shaman) lower the DR of a mob.<br />
<br />
Despair is a weak ATK debuff on a disease resist check.<br />
The SKs have no spells with the ability to lower the resists of a mob.<br />
<br />
Oh, and the shaman slow are harder to resist than the chanter slow. They are also faster to cast and cost less mana.<br />

In SG, versus sirens, I seem to resist only once per 5 or so slows they cast on me (thats with about 150 MR). In Sebilis the shamen there hardly ever slow me, I probably resist 9 out of 10 slows from krup or reet shamen.<br />
Its not a mob level thing either, Sirens are under level 54 (dont know their exact level), krups are about level 51, and reets are 55.<br />
Even greenie ench mobs can slow me easily, I remember when I soloed my way up Tower of Frozen Shadow to get the keys to get to Abrahms, the erudite ghost enchanter mobs in the library were slowing me 50% or more of the time, and their nukes/dots were landing (where even high level shaman mobs I resist their nukes/dots). I can't remember the last time I was slowed by a greenie npc sham.<br />
I dont know what causes npc ench spells to seem to be so hard to resist compared to npc shaman spells, but I dont think it carrys over to pc ench/sham casting on mobs, I never see much difference in how many times ench or sham has to cast slow before it sticks, but then again I am not the one casting them. I do think it would be more noticable if pc ench slows were less resistable than sham though.<br />

Hopefully I'm wrong, but I'll be they just lower the hate component of disease spell, and that would be bad.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Moongaden</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 02:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">DC was indirectly nerfed last year when they made all spells less resistable.   I (and all the SK's i talked to in game) said that DC seemed to be giving about 1/3'rd of the aggro.<br />
<br />
We used to be kings of aggro,  now we're almost playing like bards chain casting DC if we ever want to get hit</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Walil</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 02:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They really need to change the aggro on slow. It's completely insane right now. I had a ranger, warrior, and rogue in my group last night and none of them could pull off me. The only person who could was my shadowknight. Using spells like the screams and Dooming Darkness I could get aggro but it was a pain. <br />
<br />
If the changes to aggro indirectly effect disease cloud I think we can live with it. We have a ton of other spells that are hefty in mana cost but do the same job. Trust me, it's better to have disease cloud nerfed then having to rez your shaman after every pull.<br />
<br />
As far as I'm concerned. Sk's are still the kings of gaining aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rhumba_Kween</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 03:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry we should not have to live with it? Capitulating because it benefits another one of your chars seems wrong to me.<br />
<br />
Why should we have to be nerfed because of a change to another class?<br />
<br />
Enchanter changes have caused so much indirect nefage its not funny. Pet aggro is a prime example. Their pets got too powerful when they could gain aggro, so VI changes the aggrro that pets can get to almost nothing and they indirectly nerfed mages that rely so heavy on their pets.<br />
<br />
I think it is very important that we submit through dev corner letting them know to not nerf DC when they change aggro for the slows.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Walil</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 04:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Look I'm not saying fix my shaman at the cost of nerfing the shadowknight class. If they absolutely have to reduce the aggro on disease in order to fix the problem then I can live with it. <br />
<br />
 I like having the option to cure slow without removing buff spells. In my opinion this more than makes up for my shadowknight having to change her spell line up a bit to gain aggro. <br />
<br />
 Now if they can fix the slow aggro issue without changing the way Disease Cloud acts as a taunt that would be awesome. Since they haven't specified what their solution is I'm not really going to worry about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Attyla</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 07:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hrm.  Well, then I guess you'd be fine and dandy with the aggro as it currently stands now...<br />
<br />
Yes it is convenient to not have to strip all yer buffs to remove a debuff.  It's clear that your &quot;convenience&quot; at our expense suits you just fine.  So from all of us SKs to you:  Get Bent.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I think the aggro issue is just fine as is.  Having Slow with a large aggro value, simply places a greater premium on having an SK in the group to keep the Shaman from being eaten. <br />
<br />
Frankly, it's pretty small of you to say that the convenience impact for YOU, outweighs crippling the one thing that an entire class can bring to a group/raid.<br />
<br />
EDIT:  True, it's too early to make a big stink about it.  However I've already made my submission to the Dev Corner (should call it the Hail Mary forum) asking for a clarification on what they mean by &quot;fix&quot; the disease component.  Hopefully, it's spell based, not spell line based.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darko</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 08:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I also remember them stating something about lowering agro that Dease counter generate, I am hoping this wont affect Dease Cloud spell, cause that would reall y screw the SK taunt abilities....<br />
The have done this once before &quot;unintentionaly&quot; a few months ago, when they lowerd the agro enchanter debuffs generate, which effected Shadow Vortex  etc..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Walil</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 09:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Read my reply again. I play both a sk and a shaman. Both are level 52. I'm not saying nefing disease cloud to fix slow aggro is a good solution, but I am willing to live with it since SK's have plenty of other aggro spells. In the situation I was talking about before I used the scream spells and dooming darkness to draw aggro. I dont even have disease cloud memorized.</div></div><hr />

Sweet Innoruuk! What's wrong with you?! <br />
<br />
Spell Line-up at 52 is <br />
<br />
1)Abduction of Strength/grim aura/mental corruption etc..<br />
2)Feign Death<br />
3)Scream of Pain<br />
4)Dooming Darkness<br />
5)Invoke Fear<br />
6)Life Leech<br />
7)Siphon Life<br />
8)Shroud of Pain<br />
<br />
I am pretty much happy with this line-up but if any of you have suggestions for change let me know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">synnoira</div><div class="date">04-04-2002, 01:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">shadow vortex or disease cloud for scream of pain, scream of pain is the strange choice you have there<br />
if indoors obviously invoke fear comes off and disease cloud comes in for sure<br />
if you have another snarer (ranger, etc) in group with you you might want to have dooming replaced with clinging, lower mana faster casting for the aggro<br />
to be honest i think i'd have DC in before abduction of strength, not having DC up seems very odd</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Walil</div><div class="date">04-04-2002, 03:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry it should be should be Shroud of Pain in instead of Scream of Pain. I did just get finished playing around with DC tonight though. It does make a big difference on pulling aggro for cheap mana, and it's a nice pulling spell all around. Over all though, I still go my previous statements.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brael</div><div class="date">04-04-2002, 04:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1) Torrent of Hate (Scream of hate if torrents over 52)<br />

6)Life Leech <br />
7)Siphon Life <br />

<br />
Or like me they figured it would be better to use the upgrades as they came along, and no it isnt required. Our attack and ac drains create aggro really well. Judging from the tenor of your post I probably wouldn't take advice from you either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">synnoira</div><div class="date">04-04-2002, 02:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i haven't seen a lot of aggro off the ATK drains personally, not to compare with DC anyhow<br />
i'm sure you know this but DC is something you want to be careful of pulling since the DoT lasts a long old time and who knows if you get an add you may need to switch too<br />
i use shadowvortex to establish aggro and follow that with DC i find that combo works very effectively and is quick and mana-cost effective, shroud of pain and clinging darkness to follow up if really required<br />
btw if rooted casting DC on self breaks root i've had to do that a couple of times when rooted on pulling back, since the damage is so low from it its doesn't make a big difference to your health bar in the subsequent fight<br />
i've never dueled, can't see the point, but i've read here that casting DC on self when dueling a chanter is also a good way to stop mezzes due to the DoT, but i can't tell you how true that is from my own experience</div></div><hr />

Dooming Darkness<br />
Banshee Aura<br />
Shadow Vortex<br />
Torrent of Hate<br />
Vampiric Curse<br />
Feign Death<br />
Disease cloud<br />
<br />
This is my set up 90 percent of the time.<br />
<br />
If soloing obviously DC comes out for Invoke Fear, Dooming comes out for Cascading and banshee out for Boil Blood.<br />
<br />
If I have another snarer present who is always on snares then Dooming comes out for Heart Flutter (sweet taunt spell as well as debuff).<br />
<br />
On raids I switch Banshee for Steelskin to soak up AE damage etc. and replace DC with Drain Spirit.<br />
<br />
I agree that our Attack drains have little to no agro esp compared to SV, SoH, and DC.<br />

btwI dont seem to be getting emails when replys are made to threads that i have participated in. Anyone notice this or is there something else i need to do?</div></div><hr />

hmmmmmmm<br />
<br />
Do we have other spells to generate agro? Sure...but none of them make as much agro as fast or for such limited mana. <br />

Yes good point, if they REDUCE the aggro on my slows I'm certain to be killed more often. <br />
<br />
Also I am not saying Nocifer's advice is bad, but if he presented it in the same elitest fashion to the sk's on his server I would understand why they ignored him.</div></div><hr />

<br />
nocifer is a nice and good sk and is very knowledgeable. brael is a big meanie but knowlegeable nonetheless. <br />
<br />
the reason that i think this topic is so touchy with the sk community is because the possibilty of nerfing DC agro would deeply impact the SK as a class. DC is one of the best taunt spells, due to its small mana cost and large taunt. shadow vortex and other spells are good but DC only costs 10 mana so you can chain cast it all day. agro control is the area of expertise of SK's and nerfing DC could have a seriously detrimental affect to how i for one would play the class. it is just speculation on whether verant in its infinite wisdom/laziness will cause the new tweaks with disease resist to affect all spells rather than just the slows, but i can say for myself that i sincerely hope not.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ueuelr</div><div class="date">04-04-2002, 10:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't understand what all this discussion with DC is. Some people love it some people don't. It's just a prefference. I personally do not use it, and yes I am the main tank quite often and no I do not lose aggro. This is my usualy spell lineup<br />
<br />
1) Abduction of Strength<br />
2) Dooming Darkness<br />
3) Life Leech<br />
4) Heart Flutter<br />
5) Shroud of Hate<br />
6) Torrent of Hate<br />
7) Shroud of Death<br />
8) Feign Death<br />
<br />
If i'm not the snarer in the group is use Torrent of Pain for the group AC buff in the second slot. As you can see I use Heart Flutter as my main dot/debuff and aggro generator, and Abduction of Strength ocasionally. When I tank, and I snare, using  Dooming darkness and Heart Flutter will guarantee aggro for the rest of the fight, especialy if I pull and get both spells before anyone else does anything. Even slow will not pull the mobs off me. If I break mez, i use 2 or 3 taunts, cast heart flutter and  that is sufficient to gain aggro. If mob has been mezzed more than once and slowed, use 4 taunts, abduction of Str or Shroud of Hate (which ever needs refreshed) then HF and you're good to go. Also if you need quick aggro, Life Leech is a nice fast taunt and Heal, I'm sure is much faster then DC! <br />
<br />
In my opinion I think Heart Flutter is a better option then DC, unless the fights are realy quick. It provides descent Dot/debuff for the whole fight, and you only need to cast is once. If I have clarity I see no reason to use a much more inferior spell, mana is not an issue. Also I refuse to use a lvl 9 spell at 56, makes me feel like all my levleing is wasted.<br />
<br />
I also have grim aura up all the time, thanks to my Sword of Pain, and if I need to conserve mana I use my BE Gauntlets to snare.<br />
<br />
So here is my side of the coin. I get a little annoyed at all the people that say their way is the only way, kinda reminds me of religious zealots. SK are a pretty diverse class and we all play our way. Try to show some tolerance. DC is a good spell, but now that good to make a flame war out of it! And I personally do not believe DC is a class defining spell, and the SK class depends on it to gain aggro. If you depend on DC so much, maybe is time to review your play style, there are more options there (even try hitting the taunt button).  Teling the Developers that you rely on DC only, they'll just tell you to learn how to play your class.</div></div><hr />

Can't count the number of times it has saved a caster from certain death for me, and because I am a troll (not the brightest start in the sky) the low mana cost is perfect.<br />
<br />
I will really be pissed if this nerfed, even by an oversight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yep but very understandable. In *most* cases its the natural order to use the upgrades to spells as you get them. Unless you read the boards and get into the discussions it might never occur to you to break out that level 9 spell in the back of the book.</div></div><hr />

I did a personal choice, I try to have some rolepay in my character. And Ueuelr Starburst (not me) will not use a low level spell if he has a better one, it's just too demeaning for him. And you have touched on another point which I missed, and that is the mana pool. That is another factor that will make people choose their spells.<br />

Second, Krushum I will not argue with you, I have to come down to your level (of stupidity) and you will beat me with experience.</div></div><hr />

What the hell is up with you these days ?<br />
<br />
Get real, DC is a frelling level 9 spell, and you're all acting like if it was our number one class defining ability!<br />
Sure it's a great way to agro without spending much mana or even losing damage with a long casting, you won't find me saying it isn't a very useful spell, but guess what ? If a level NINE spell becomes less efficient at level 60, i wont be whining about it saying they nerfed SKs.<br />
<br />
Hell, i almost WISH they would nerf it (and i highly doubt this will happen) just so you would lose that lazy and whiny attitude. Shadow vortex, heart flutter, darkness... we have a crapload of spells to agro if we want to, and you're all complaining about a possible (and unlikely) nerf of a frelling level nine spell ? Commenting on the abilities of a poster simply because he prefers not to use that damn spell ?<br />
<br />
You do realize what the hell you are arguing over ? A level NINE spell ? a mere 5 dmg nuke with a lousy 1 dmg/tick which just happens because of VI's poor hate list coding to generate a lot of agro ? Even if we lost some of the taunt value of this stupid spell, we would still keep all our 10 thousand other ways to taunt.<br />
<br />
I'm reaching the 200 played days on my shadowknight, i also have 180 played days as a warrior, and almost 80 as a rogue, all of them have been part of the high end raids at one point or the other, killed tunare, fought the AoW.... i've done it all. I have been a poster on the knight watch for a while, and a lurker for much longer before that. I dont keep DC memed most of the time because i prefer to fit in spells that enhance my dmg output or my ability to tank more.<br />
Yes the spell is extremely useful to taunt, i'm not going to deny it, but without it mobs still stay glued to my blue ass like flies on a troll's. Are you going to question my abilities as well, or are you going to lose that lazy attitude and realize you're able to do much more than chain cast that frelling spell you got when you hadn't even left your home city's surroundings ?<br />
<br />
Days like this you guys remind me of the nerfhouse or the monkly business boards, damnit i know tihs community is able to do better.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rartawk</div><div class="date">04-05-2002, 01:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The big usefulness of DC from my point of view is not so much in getting aggro and keeping it, but in its current incarnation ( less aggro than it used to be ) it is like having an extra and more effective taunt button.<br />
<br />
Yes if I'm doing MT duty, aggro is easy to keep with our other spells. However, more often than not I use it to get aggro for long enough to settle things down when a mob is ping ponging about. With the low mana cost you can do it all day long. In these respects DC is indeed a unique part of our spell line up.<br />
<br />
I think it is a bit premature to get up in arms about a possible nerf, but as we know it wouldn't be the first time SK's as a class and this spell in particular has been adversely effected by changes Verant has made for completely unrelated reasons. <br />
<br />
Whether you use DC or not doesnt make you a better SK, but listening to the advice of some of the most experienced SKs going around will.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keyan Aubaine</div><div class="date">04-05-2002, 02:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree Brael, discussing it is indeed healthy, it's the whining and attitude i cant stand.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So let's analyze this further...<br />
<br />
Some data:<br />
Shiftless deeds (level 44 enchanter slow) has 12 disease counters<br />
Forlorn deeds (level 57 enchanter slow) has 16 disease counters<br />
Tigir's insects (level 58 AE shaman slow) has 16 disease counters<br />
Turgur's insects (level 51 shaman slow) has 16 disease counters<br />
Plangue of insects (level 54 disease shaman slow) has 16 disease counters)<br />
Remove greater curse (level 54 cleric spell) is 5 attempts to remove 9 disease counters (this gives an indication of the 'weight' of a disease counter)<br />
<br />
Disease cloud (level 9 SK spell) has 1 disease counter<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What conclusions can we draw from this?<br />
<br />
We know that all spells are made of several 'levels' (internal name meaning effect in this context) and the total result of each spell is a simple addition of all those levels.<br />
This means not only the beneficial/harmful part, but also the duration, the stacking, the hate generated....<br />
For example the enchanter spell bedlam raises your str by 50, lowers your agi by 25, and gives you a 350 hp rune, once you have spent the rune component by taking at least 350 dmg in nukes or melee, the whole buff fades, including the 50 str and the neg25 agi.<br />
<br />
The hate component of slow spells is the combination of each level, the actual slow effect, and the new disease counter. What VI is going to work on is removing the extra agro from the disease counters, the agro from the slow component will remain.<br />
It's unkown whether the hate generated by disease counters is a fixed amount or if it's proportinal to the number of counters<br />
This in my opinion is the key point. If the hate is proportional to the number of counters, then DC will keep pretty much its efficiency as it'll only lose 1:16th of the agro slow spells have gained, in that case the agro of DC comes mostly from the other levels.<br />
On the other hand, if the hate generated by disease counters is a fixed amount, then we cant tell for sure what the effect will be on DC, as it'll still keep the agro from the DD and the DoT on the other levels.<br />
<br />
The agro of a spell is not based on its resist check at all, for example torrent spells have little to no agro and are all checking against disease. This change will not affect all spells that check against disease, the only part that will be affected is the disease counter, it is obviously present in several disease based spells, but is totally independant of the resist check (this is why it's present in slow spells which are magic based).<br />
In the case of asystole and heart flutter, the first has 4 disease counters, while (surprisingly) the later has none. This patch might end up lowering the hate generated by the disease counter part of asystole (but the AC/str/DoT parts will remain the same, with equal agro), but should not affect heart flutter in any way.<br />
<br />
Finally, another point that needs to be taken in consideration is the way VI will modify the way agro is generated by slow spells. They might simply lower the agro generated by disease counters, it's obviously the easiest solution, but this will raise some other 'problems', for example shaman's big DoTs that are curable (ie have disease counters) will have a noticeably lower agro. The other option is to lower the hate generated by the slow component by the amount of hate added by the disease counters, in this case the hate created by slow spells will be back to what it used to be, and none of our spells will be affected (slow spells and procs will ALL keep the same agro).<br />
<br />
<br />
Conclusion: Disease cloud may not even generate most of its agro from the disease counter (and it certainly does not generate it just because it checks against disease), and even if it does, nothing allows us to say if fixing slow spells will affect the agro it can generate. Our class possesses many other ways to taunt with spells, and we are still able to create it from melee damage and procs when the mana conservation is a real problem (groups without a bard or enchanter). It's also true that we are able to replace that spell slot by other spells at least as beneficial (although in different ways i agree), i don't see any reason to be alarmed, and no reason to run around yelling nerf (after all a level 9 spell losing efficiency as you level is annoying but acceptable).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ronak</div><div class="date">04-05-2002, 05:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">DC was my staple up until my mid 50's. At about this time, I started<br />
regularly grouping with a couple chanters who had heart attacks if I<br />
cast a DoT on a mob with more than 1 in camp. I started using shadow <br />
vortex, and a bit later, shroud of pain. Certainly a bit more mana intensive<br />
than DC, but I have never had a problem with aggro since I stopped <br />
using DC. Hell, I sometimes overaggro with just a few casts of SV/SoP.<br />
<br />
Last night was the first time I memmed DC in about 5 months, believe it!<br />
For the first time in ages I was in a bardless/chanterless group, in CT, and<br />
DC performed its function perfectly. (low mana, good aggro spell)<br />
<br />
A nerf to DC would have zero impact on me, but that doesn't mean I <br />
want it nerfed. It is one of our tools, and a very good one. <br />
<br />
As many of us know already, you can't just sit back quietly if something<br />
is screwed up or nerfed, or it will start a trend. Nothx on DC nerfage,<br />
it's still nice to have it to fall back on once in a while. <br />
<br />
Side note:<br />
If you have a chanter that doesn't mind DoTs, a very low mana taunt <br />
alternative (IE, ZERO mana) is BE gaunts. Gotta love 0 mana aggro 'spells'.<br />

Ever try keeping agro with our other high agro spells in a group with no mana regen?  When you are the puller ?   Does it mean i'm LAZY because I can't afford spending over 10 mana on a taunt or I force the group to wait for me to med ?<br />
<br />
If I had a perma KEI/C2, It wouldn't bother me much to take away DC, but when I'm in my ghetto groups grinding aaxp it IS my class defining ability, and I for one would be pissed off if it does happen.  But I don't see much point in getting worked up about it until it does happen.<br />
<br />
BTW, if you don't think a SK's class defining ability is to be able to manipulate agro in either direction, both quickly and efficiently, what do you think it is?  I have noticed my spells doing a lot less agro over time, and I didn't realize as darko mentioned that SV and SoP had been nerfed, but it makes sense to me that they had.  If SV, SoP, and DC all become nerfed, it will be a kick in the balls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">velourea</div><div class="date">04-05-2002, 05:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">nice, informative post keyan. (add keyan to the &quot;knowledable sk's list&quot; if you haven't already :p) personally, ive always believed that DC caused so much agro because it is a combination of a dd and dot. i think combination spells cause significantly more agro than single effect spells (e.g. like darkness with a dot and snare). this is just my personal speculation tho.<br />
<br />
anyway, while DC is certainly not the only way to get agro, it is the most efficent that i have seen. i would love to cast Shadow Vortex every time a rogue/happy caster really pisses a mob off, but due to mana constraints at my level it simply isn't possible. even with clarity, it's barely enough mana regen to keep myself buffed with Shadow Vortex/Scream of Pain/Grim Aura/Scream of Death(some spells a few of you prolly have sitting collecting dust). I could cast SV but i'd have to stop every so often to med while the rest of the group is good to go. DC is the most convenient spell i have atm for agro management. I fully understand that this can change as i level, but for me and the majority of the SK population that isnt quite level 60 yet, DC is an invaluable tool. even casting something like clinging darkness is a bit of a hassle compared to the ease of DC.  while many of the high-level sk's can find many other ways to taunt, i have found that for my general purposes, DC is the best way to make a mob love me. <br />

Assuming that both my shammy dots EB (poison) and Plague(disease) have fairly high counters I am not getting the crazy aggro like I do with slow. The level of the mob is also incredibly important. <br />
<br />
If it's high blue-red it sticks like glue, anything lower and it comes off fairly easily and stays off. As an example I've been hunting in ME trying to get my SoG. The hunters/tribesman/4arm guys will spend the entire time trying to pummle me, the toilers/followers etc will come off after a taunt + spell combo. <br />
<br />
After I do get them off I can have my shaman throw EB which is normally a huge aggro generator but they hardly seem to notice. So anyway, thats what I've found the last couple days.</div></div><hr />
