<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Derraj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">the answer is no, your supposed to pull up beside her and ask her for her number. and check out her tits while your doing it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Loneshadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I had something like during my practical exam...incredebly pretty blonde with a skirt on a bike passing by....almost missed the corner, haha but was worth the upskirt :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I want to know if Chayde would drive behind her</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kebsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The answer, of course, is no.  The biker must drive on the side of the street; you must maintain the designated speed and pass her on the left.<br />
<br />
Why is this such a difficult question?  You people are morons.</div></div><hr />

Acutally bikes are considered moving vechiles, and if they are not in a bike lane, you have to stay behind them until it is safe to pass.<br />
<br />
This is in the California DMV handbook. (Or it was when I took my test, they renew those things ever year)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Zakton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Morale of the picture:  Always have a bike rack on your car.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Yes, the picture looks like they're driving across multiple lanes in a parking lot, as any driver will tell you, normal rules of traffic do not apply there and you can do anything you want as long as you remember that pedestrians have the right of way unless they're in the way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
According to this, it's ok to run people over in the parking lot if they are in your way ? This is great news :D Fucking old hags at the grocery store are gonna get it now!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly most state's laws  are jsut like this.<br />
<br />
Trust me on this, I'm a bike commuter, so i have to keep teh laws on hand, since even the cops don't know the bicycle sections  of the vehicular code.  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />
