<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Atlis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I recently finished the Greenmist quest from start to finish.  As a Rallos Zek Ogre on Quellious, I spent uncountable hours faction hunting the Iksar bandits.  Many a newbie now have a Bracer of Scavenging.<br />
To get my khukris from the Crusaders of Greenmist, I maxed out my indifferent faction, and proceeded to target Lord Giczik.  Then I used my Ornate Velium Pendant for its Alliance benefit.  At amiable, I was able to acquire my Crusader's Khukri (after, of course, Penance and the work thereafter).<br />
When speaking to Lord ?Korzin? to get the Hero's Khukri, he said I was not ready for him, and to perform tasks, or some such similar speech.<br />
I was gutsy, however.  I gave him the Crusader's Khukri and the Visceral Dagger.  Although he did not see me fit for the task, he still rewarded me with a Hero's Khukri.  Proceed to Arch Duke Xog.<br />
Again, I was amiable to Arch Duke Xog as I was the other Crusaders.  I spoke with him, and he requested the Stupendous Tome and my Hero's Khukri.  I promptly handed him the items, expecting my Lord of Pain's Khukri.  He laughed at me.<br />
After filtering Tells to a separate window and sitting AFK for a day and a half, I finally got a hold of GM Brewko, who took the tome and khukri away from Xog and let me try again.<br />
I was not completely idle, however.  I went into Dulak and hunted a few Iksar sailors.  After taking their meat and paying the merchants in Gunthak, I found my local shaman who, after a failed attempt, made an Illusion:Iksar potion.<br />
As an Iksarized Ogre of Rallos Zek, I was still amiable, but Arch Duke Xog managed to hand me the Lord of Pain's Khukri.  I then proceeded to the Greenmist quest, which gave me no trouble, even as a fat Ogre.<br />
<br />
Long story short - don't bother getting Ornate Velium Pendant to trick the Iksar.  Go kill some lizards, instead.</div></div><hr />
