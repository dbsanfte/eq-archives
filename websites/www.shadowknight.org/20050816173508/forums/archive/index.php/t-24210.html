<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zarzac</div><div class="date">02-09-2005, 06:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In reading the hunting grounds boards here I consistantly see that most people are of the opinion lev&gt;aa.  I see your points but as someone who has good baz gear and not in a raiding guild I see things a bit different.  <br />
<br />
From what I can tell the best I see for solo'ing aa xp at higher levels for us sk's is around 20% of an aa an hour.  (If I missed someone non-time or better geared doing better please let me know where).  I am now lv 52 and hanging out in solB to try to get in on pick up Naggy raid( I know he is lame compared to high end encounters but since I never did with my main something I would like to do).  I can solo (without aggrokiting/ fearkiting just stand and fight) imps/bats/beetles and pick up about 25-35% of an aa an hour and almost 0 downtime.  Which, from what I am reading for someone without elemental gear/access is better than I will be able to do soloing at 65 or even 70.<br />
<br />
My bigger concern however is that as I level the &quot;what's your hp/ac/aa's ?'s&quot; start coming hard esp 65+.  Without that uber gear I know it will tough to get in good groups.  I know this because my main (69 clr /yawn boring) has been in many groups where the group leader/members frown on sk's tanking ( esp in mpg/rift even sub 67/68 lv sk's in wos sometimes) unless they are in the best gear or have a ton of aa's.  <br />
<br />
Going this route or working on my aa's now (esp since it seems I may be able to get them quicker) may be a better idea.  When I do get a group now at this level I get &quot;man you're a great tank&quot;  vs. if I was lv 65 (and would most likely be in same gear). I think that if I worked on leveling now, I would both have a harder time getting groups and being of great value to the groups I was in.  Also, I would be actually getting less aa's per hour when I wasn't in a group and having to solo than I can now at lev 52.<br />
<br />
Looking forward to the comments / flames :)</div></div><hr />

Up to 67ish, you can kite vxed for decent AA.  NC isn't quite as fast as vxed, but it's a lot safer.<br />
<br />
I haven't personally messed around with droga/veksar much, but if you want to straight tank I'm sure there is a sweet spot level somewhere between 60-65.<br />
<br />
If you solo the majority of your time, then I could see doing AA before levels, because as you get higher your solo options decrease.  But the times you do get a group, your AA at level 70 in MPG/RS far exceeds anything else you'll find.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Culdahl1</div><div class="date">02-09-2005, 02:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">XP to 65, grind out some defensive AA's and get back to XP....LvL &gt; AA's.  I am also &quot;casual&quot;, but with OoW loot you can easily break 5500hp and 1400ac unbuffed and I'm sitting at 6Khp and 1500ac ATM.  You'll get your best XP/AA in BoT/tactics and/or NC/WoS, which you'll easily be able to do at 65 with decent gear and a few defensive AA's.  With only my PoP defensive AA's I can easily tank any XP mob without a heal if it's slowed (just using a LT every once in awhile)....you won't encounter anything that requires defensive AA's until you're 60+ anyway, as I tanked BoT just fine without a single AA until I hit 65 and started to grind AA's (sure the AA's helped, but you won't NEED them unless you're tanking named mobs).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KlowdKill</div><div class="date">02-09-2005, 03:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I didn't get the hp/ac/aa question till I went to BoT, where a paladin with 500hp more than me and the warrior was pleaded to join the group.  He had all his defensive and hp aa's at 65, I was 62 w/ 0 aa's though.<br />
<br />
If you can solo grind aa's at 52 to save up 30 for your defensives at 55 faster than a 70 sk can solo grind aa's that you feel is on par with your gear, than that's a great path.  But since you notice an improvement in tanking when mobs in MPG quad + rampage you for 7 attacks of 1200 max, yeah you're going to need those aa's before goin there, vs mobs that barely hit for 200 and don't even double half the time.  I went 65, wasn't able to tank 6way but could do rest of WoS, so that's when I stoped and grinded away on aa's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daegul Mistweaver</div><div class="date">02-09-2005, 04:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd be interested to know myself at what rate a 70 SK can grind out solo AAs in a public (non-flagged/keyed) zone.  Or boxed, that's basically just solo w/ less downtime.  But to compare, would be helpful for the original poster to state what his AAs/hour ratio is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nastard</div><div class="date">02-09-2005, 04:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A 70 sk can grind aa's a lot faster solo than you guys realize. With oow exp being pretty damn nice, and borderline light blue/dark blue mobs in Bloodfields being an easy solo tank with no downtime, you're gonna find it's better exp than anything you can kite at 52.<br />
<br />
And if you're concerned that you can't tank MPG easily without all your defensive aa's going into it, screw it. Go to the eastern murkglider caves in WoS to grind those aa's. Pretty much no risk, they're all lined up in a perpetual loop and most are single pullable. Even poorly geared SK's are gonna be able to get an AA every 45-60 min without breaking a sweat there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keevel</div><div class="date">02-09-2005, 05:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Staying at 52 to do Dragons or wait for people is fine<br />
<br />
Grind out tanking AA's  (Katta Graveyard can be fear kited and guards pulled single from maximum range - don't mess with the gargoyles) if you are waiting anyway.  It'll make you better 65+ when you eventually move up, but don't do AA's thinking they'll be a bigger power boost than levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">defila</div><div class="date">02-09-2005, 07:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">At level 52, how many AA's can be considered critical under the General Abilities/non-level restricted category? Don't Archetype abilities require level 55, Class abilities 59, and PoP, GoD and OoW abilities 60+? Sure, 10 additional STA/INT/MR/CR/FR would be nice to have to go raid Naggy and Vox, as well as Run, Regen and Metabolism 3, but I'd be climbing the walls after EXPing all that time with so little to show for it when compared to the real gains I could have instead with levels, and the skills, spells, hit points, disciplines and access to other AA's that come with them. <br />
<br />
Sure, you could bank the AA's, but I'm positive that you can gain AA's a lot faster at higher levels, given my own experience at 68 when I'm just &quot;goofing around&quot; soloing pieces for the Veeshan's Peak quests in places like Nadox, Umbral Plains, Siren's Grotto, and look down and see that I've made 1/2 or 2/3 an AA in the hour or so I've been there. I don't solo anymore for EXP, per se, but if that's possible while just running around questing with a Virtue/Steeloak and a C3, then any concerted effort I put into soloing would easily net that or more.<br />
<br />
That said, I did what most people do around here -- I kept levelling until the content I was tanking handed me my ass (for me, that was Wall of Slaughter at level 65), then I made a serious commitment to finishing my defensive AA's. Having benched my SK for a rogue circa Luclin, and quit during PoP, my SK didn't even have the basics of Archetype abilities done, let alone PoP defensives. 40 AA's later, I (and those that heal me) can measurably see the difference -- the bad news is I have another 40 defensive AA's I want before I get to play with the fun ones.<br />
<br />
If you want to be a dragonslayer on this toon of yours, go ahead, knock yourself out. I have a guildie who has put close to a 500k plat and countless hours camping drops in places like PoFire for a little gnome warrior twink he plans to 1-group Vox and Naggy with someday. His plan has a twist though -- he's levelling his twink to 55, getting access to the Archetype AA's for offensive and defensive AA's, and then Sacrificing him down to 52 again. He's insane, but he knows it, and just sees decking out his twink as another pastime, a Barbie doll.<br />
<br />
You said in your post that if you levelled, you'd be decked out in gear that gets you compliments on your tanking today. I couldn't tell if that meant you had really great gear for your level, or would have to upgrade your gear as you progressed.<br />
<br />
Do yourself a favor and look at the thread/post counts here at SK.org. What's the busiest section, right behind General and Flames/Rants? Oh yeah, the Armory, where we talk about new gear, weapons, and toys. You're enjoying a tank class, and a good deal of that enjoyment, as you said, comes from being able to tank well. Get over it now, and just accept the fact that your gear dictates what you can and cannot tank just as much as your level and your AA (or in my case, the lack thereof).<br />
<br />
What's that sucking sound I hear in the distance? Oh, its the sound of your main's bank account being pissed away on the latest upgrade for your alt. It could be worse, you know, you could have picked a ranger or a rogue.<br />
<br />
Anyway, enjoy your alt, and don't let the min/max crowd make you nervous. You're just misinformed that the best higher-level SKs can do for EXP is 20% of an AA per hour solo.<br />

<br />
I remember going for run3 at lvl 51 and seemed like I got 1 aa in the same amount of time it took to level from 50 to 51.<br />
<br />
It's just a matter of how/where you wanna spend your time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zarzac</div><div class="date">02-10-2005, 05:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the feedback so far.  <br />
<br />
I still haven't seen anyone post a aa per x time though.  I guess that is my biggest question.  I can get an aa about every 3 hours or so solo'ing at my current level in current bonus zone (Naggy Lair).  <br />
<br />
With server population and available groups declining soloing is more and more a way of life (Whoreing my clr in pok has officially ended with back to back 10pp donations for conviction).  My fear is that at higher levels I will have to work much harder (yeah im lazy and fear/aggro kiting &gt; work than just standing there and tanking) to get my aa's and I will still only be able to get about one aa every 3 hours.  If I could fear/aggro kite an aa every hour/hour and and 1/2 i would but am curious if this is possible in sub time gear.  To answer the gear ? I have magnetic or better in pretty much every slot BoDistruction / Buckler with regen+2 from OOW at lv 52 im about 1075ac/4300hp unbuffed.<br />
<br />
So, if there is anyone out there that is soloing aa's (true soloing - only one account so can't box)  in gear &lt; time that could give me about how long it takes you to get an aa soloing I would much appreciate it thanks :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wyrdlan</div><div class="date">02-10-2005, 12:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Are you looking for completely solo numbers? Obviously at 70 you can get AA much much faster in a group. Example: RCoD camping names with three people in my group, 68 SK (I'm the DPS hehe), 65 Enchanter, 68 Cleric the enchanter was getting an AA an hour on a 90/10 AA to exp split.<br />
<br />
<br />
Completely solo I'd say it wouldn't be unreasonable to get an AA an hour if you're particularly good in Vxed or someplace like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keevel</div><div class="date">02-10-2005, 12:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heck at 55 in Katta I get a blue of AA per kill...which leads to an aa in 2 hours or so considering down time (assuming I have KEI).<br />
<br />
So you definately haven't hit the sweet spot.<br />
<br />
Understand that 1 AA is approximately the same exp as leveling from 51-52.<br />
Exp gotten is determined by exp per mob, your level in relation to the mob, ZEM, group size and any penalties you might have.<br />
<br />
Basicall, for best exp, you want to find a mob within 5 levels of you, that is soloable and is in a Zone with a descent exp modifier.<br />
<br />
Zones with good exp modifiers seem to be more common at 60+ (though this includes areas that require you to earn access) that for 50-60.<br />
<br />
While solo exp at 70 might be hard to find at the rate of 1AA per hour, finding a zone to solo for 1 AA in less than 3 hours will only get easier as you progress.<br />
<br />
The sweet spot for you might be found at 60 or 65 and you might want to pause to grind a couple, but you'll only have and easier time getting AA (even solo) after you're done with dragons and stuff and return to leveling. <br />
<br />
If you're looking to solo while only tanking, not fear kiting or anything, your choices will be much more limited, however.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oagan</div><div class="date">02-10-2005, 01:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">At your current level, you need to go no further than run 3, possibly metabolism 3, then get back to leveling.  You are at the stage where the benefits of leveling definitely outweigh any aa advantages (other than the two mentioned).  <br />
<br />
It has been repeated time and time again that levels&gt;aa's.  At minimum, you should level to 65, then work on your defensive aa's. Once you're done with those, start on some of your offensive aa's.  I believe there are numerous posts outlining the best progression of aa's (which to do first), so no need to repeat them here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KlowdKill</div><div class="date">02-10-2005, 02:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Level 62, PoV gave 2% per kill (either camps)<br />
level 63, BoT gave 2.5% per kill (4 way)<br />
Level 64, RCoD gave 3-4% per kill (Granite Smasher)<br />
Level 65, WoS gave 3% per kill (West wall)<br />
Level 65, MPG gave 4-5% per kill (DEK)<br />
Level 70, WoS gives 3%, 2% occasionaly per kill (west wall)<br />
Level 70, Sol Ro gave 3%, (any entrance guards up to pot clickies to the mini-names.  Asston of hp, but alot easier than WoS.  Trade off if you have the DPS in a group but can't tank WoS.  Ornate drops off trash except BP, we did loot leather legs off one besides the mass amounts of all the other minor pieces)<br />
Level 70, MPG was giving a friend 3% per kill (DEK)  But he's an idiot, i'll find out myself eventually.  Probably has leadership on....<br />
<br />
&quot;but klowd!  That's not a big difference!&quot;<br />
your right billy, it's not!  But major difference was- Where I was with DPS classes in PoV w/ 0 aa's and suck badly on dps (rangers specificly, rogues, monks etc.) i'm now grouped with a rogue that tripple bs's for 2,100 normal (with might).  45min per aa is the average I get in WoS, don't know the kill rate of the rest.  SolRo was by far the slowest kill rate-Lack of dps choices not flagged along with mobs having an asston of hp.<br />
<br />
I fully believe 65 is the stoping point for lvls to grind out those aa's, for every class.  It's so irritating grouping with shamans without cannibalization, wizards that are amazed they crit for 2k in WoS, rogues that are being out damaged by the shaman pet.  Equally annoying having a tank that dies every pull one rounded.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oagan</div><div class="date">02-11-2005, 12:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with Klowd.  The design of the game Post PoP was designed for people who had the AA benefits.  Without the defensive line-up, you're going to get creamed a lot in the later expansion zones.  Get to 65 and get your aa's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kazbuk</div><div class="date">02-12-2005, 07:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">These are some of the places i solo'd if its any help<br />

PoJ 1%aa per kill, very quick kills, no down time, probly bout 30-40% aa per hour depending on your gear<br />
<br />
Droga 1%aa per kill, 2-3min kills, some downtime for medding but can do those taskmaster thingy quests from the overthere, and get decent amount aaxp added on to that. Probly bout 30-50% aa per hour if ya do the taskmaster deal.<br />
<br />
PoV and HoH aggro kiting, 2or 3% aa per kill, aggro kiting, somedowntime for medding.  Don't think i ever spent a full hour doing this so not sure about total.<br />
<br />
Great Divide dwarf guards in the tunnels in the SE part of map, 1%aa per kill, can fear kite, did this spot a bunch when i was raising giant faction. probly bou 20-25%aa per hour<br />
<br />
Now at lvl 70<br />
NC the murkgliders down in the gully or whatever it is, 2-3% aa per kill, aggro kiting, some decent random drops like augs and that shield, probly bout 30% aa per hour<br />
<br />
PoF 10%aa per kill, aggro kiting bout 8-10 min kills depending on resists, bout 50-70% aa per hour for me.<br />
<br />
PoN strait tankin bout 1% aa per kill quick kills.<br />
<br />
haven't tried solo'n in GoD much, cuz i hate running way the fuck out there</div></div><hr />

<br />
To other posts yes I realize group xp or aaxp &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; solo xp at 65+ :)<br />
<br />
but from what i read on razbuks post it will still take about 3 hours to solo an aa even at higher levels so if I can crank em out at this rate very easily now I think that will be the way to go.  Thank you for who posted :)</div></div><hr />

The mobs are all below level 55 so they can be feared, staying at level 57 keeps them within the 5 level range bonus, PoN has a decent ZEM.<br />

I know they're under 55 though, Lucy says nothing about max levels for the fear spells.<br />

I guess you could always fear kite the raven spawn at the rock near the river.<br />

get as many aas as you can until you need the req. levels.<br />
<br />
Aas are best there, pretty decent too, then go for Levels after about 200 or whatever heh.<br />
