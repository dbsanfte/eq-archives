<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Pre-PoP Advancements<br />
<br />
General Abilities:<br />
<br />
Innate Run Speed: A+, A, A<br />
Run 1 will let you out run most mobs in indoor zones.<br />
Innate Regeneration: B+<br />
Regen 3 will hardly have a noticable affect when you are tanking. It is equivalent to mitigating 1/2 a DPS when tanking. It will decrease the time you have to wait if FDed in a sticky situation with low health, and it is a prerequisite for mind &amp; body rejuvenation which has mana regen.<br />
Innate Metabolism: B+<br />
Decreasing your food consumption is convenient, it frees up inventory space and significantly lessens the cost of using stat food.<br />
Innate Fire Protection, Cold Protection, Magic Protection, Poison Protection, Disease Protection: C-<br />
Assuming you are aiming for the end game, resists are almost the only stat you won't max with gear, making them viable to spend AAs on.<br />
Innate Charisma: D or B<br />
Charisma can help if you tank with divine intervention, and most end game gear does not have enough to cap it.<br />
Innate Intelligence, Stamina, Dexterity, Strength, Agility: D<br />
If you're aiming for the end game, all these will end up capped by gear. If you are not aiming for the end game, you can still gain more power spending AAs elsewhere.<br />
First Aid: D<br />
Bandages are rarely useful.<br />
Innate Lung Capacity: D<br />
Rarely useful.<br />
Innate Wisdom: F<br />
The only alternate advancement ability with absolutely no benefit for shadow knights.<br />
<br />
Archetype Abilities:<br />
<br />
Combat Agility: A, A-, A<br />
Combat agility has the bonus of slightly reducing interrupts while decreasing damage intake.<br />
Combat Stability: A, A-, A<br />
Combat stability makes your damage intake less spikey and more consistent.<br />
Natural Durability: A-, B+, A-<br />
When tanking meleeing mobs, natural durability is not as beneficial as combat stability and agility because the 10 percent improvement is only on your base hitpoints, and does not include buffs, so in a situation where you're taking a lot of damage quickly, CS or CA has a better chance of keeping you alive than ND. However, it also helps with spell damage while CS and CA do not.<br />
Spell Casting Fury: C, B, A<br />
This is the only ability that scales up. When you are going to get this, you should get it all in a row, because the first two levels are significantly less powerful/points than the third. This increases DD spell and proc DPS, is required for the 7200 damage harm touch, and stacks with theft of life.<br />
Mental Clarity: B, C+, C-<br />
Scaling costs without scaling improvement. If you're using your extra mana for damage, the most you should expect is about 1 dps per point of mana regen.<br />
Combat Fury: B, C, D+<br />
This is only a one percent increase in melee DPS per level, and has scaling cost without scaling improvement.<br />
Channeling Focus: B-, C, D+<br />
Scaling cost without scaling improvement. Will help you cast spells while getting beat on.<br />
Spell Casting Expertise: B, D, D<br />
The first level of this will prevent clinging darkness and fear from fizzling, which for many shadow knights are the staples of agro generation.<br />
Natural Healing: C, D, D-<br />
Scaling cost without scaling improvement. See &quot;Innate Regeneration&quot;. Is a prerequisite for mind and body rejuvenation.<br />
Fear Resistance: D+<br />
Is a prerequisite for complete fear immunity.<br />
Finishing Blow: D<br />
Minorly speeds up killing low level mobs.<br />
Spell Casting Deftness:  D-<br />
This will only slightly decrease the casting time of Augmentation of Death, Shroud of Chaos and Cloak of Luclin.<br />
Spell Casting Subtlety: F<br />
If you are in a raiding guild and you never tank this could be helpful, however it is counter productive if you are tanking or need to tank. Well placed FDs will be much more effective in non tanking situations.<br />
<br />
Class Abilities:<br />
<br />
Physical Enhancement: A+<br />
You need one level in each of CA/CS/ND to get the full benefit, but this is the best improvement per AA point available.<br />
2 Hand Bash: A or C<br />
Bash slightly increases damage output, decreases damage intake if you stun the mob, and helps interrupt casters. C for trolls and ogres because slam is viable when not illusioned.<br />
Pet Discipline: A<br />
This keeps little Goner alive and well, and allows you to pet pull. If you consider this AA as letting your pet stay alive for most situations, it's by far the most DPS you can situationally gain using 6 AA.<br />
Soul Abrasion: A-, B-, B+<br />
With maxxed dex SA3 using SoC adds about 4.5 dps, and will mitigate about 5dps when tanking combined with SCF3 and ToL3.<br />
Unholy Steed: A-<br />
It's a very useful tool but doesn't really increase your power much. It speeds up recovery time from death, and is helpful for agro kiting and some pulling.<br />
Leech Touch: B<br />
This can be a life saver, however HT has to be available.<br />
Improved Harm Touch: C<br />
Not in itself very powerful, but it is a prerequisite for Unholy Touch and the 7200+ HT.<br />
Fearless: C-<br />
It's a useful ability when raiding fear casting mobs, but the prerequisite cost is very steep.<br />
Body and Mind Rejuvenation: D+<br />
It has a very steep prerequisite cost, and is only a minor gain in power.<br />
Double Riposte: D+, D, D-<br />
Scaling cost without scaling improvement. With how often you actually riposte an incoming hit, this is only an extremely minor increase in DPS, and only works while tanking.<br />
<br />
<br />
PoP Alternate Advancements<br />
<br />
PoP Advance:<br />
<br />
Planar Durability: B-<br />
this adds half as much HP per AA point as natural durability.<br />
Planar Power: C<br />
minor increase in stats.<br />
Advanced Innate Strength, Stamina, Agility, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.  Warding of Solusek, Blessing of E'ci, Marr's Protection, Shroud of The Faceless, Bertoxxulous' Gift:<br />
see general innate stat categories.<br />
<br />
PoP Ability:<br />
<br />
<br />
Theft of Life: A+, B+, B<br />
The low point cost of the first level makes it a great bargain, the second and third level have a lower points/gain ratio.<br />
Unholy Touch: B<br />
For general day to day fighting this isn't necessary, but can be invaluable in a raiding guild. It also allows you to solo some mobs you couldn't otherwise.<br />
Speed of the Knight: C, B-, B-<br />
About 3 percent improvement in melee DPS at the third level, stacks multiplicatively with Knight's advantage to add about 7.5% DPS together, and more swings slightly increases your melee produced agro. The first level is a lesser bonus than the next two.<br />
Lightning Reflexes: B-<br />
One percent increase in avoidance per level, regular combat agility is 2.5X the gain/point.<br />
Innate Defense: B-<br />
One percent increase in mitigation per level, regular combat stability is 2.5X the gain/point.<br />
Knight's Advantage: B-, C+, C<br />
About 3.75 percent improvement in melee DPS at the third level, stacks multiplicatively with Speed of the Knight to add about 7.5% DPS together. Cost scaling is greater than bonus scaling.<br />
Consumption of the Soul: B-<br />
Further increases the life saving capability of leech touch.<br />
Touch of the Wicked: C+, C, C<br />
This can be useful with leech touch. This shouldn't be considered until you have either UT3 or CotS3 or both. The first level puts HT closer to Unholy Aura disc timer, the third level lets every other HT have Unholy Aura without wasting much time.<br />
Fury of the Ages: D+<br />
0.5 percent increase in DPS per level, not a great bargain.<br />
Coup de Grace: D, D, C<br />
The final level of this puts it in a range where it might slay a fleeing mob worthy of being killed.<br />
Flash of Steel: D-<br />
see double riposte.<br />
Mastery of the Past: D-<br />
This doesn't help with any spells regularly cast by level 65 shadow knights.<br />
<br />
<br />
Recommended Tanking AAs ordering.<br />
CA1, CS1, ND1, PE, CA2, CA3, CS2, CS3, ND2, ND3, PoP AAs (PD/LR/ID).<br />
<br />
Recommended Combat AAs ordering:<br />
CF1, KA1, SoTK1, SoTK2, SoTK3, KA2, KA3, CF2, CF3, double riposte 1, FoTA1, FoTA2, FoTA3<br />
<br />
Disclaimer:<br />
These rankings are subjective, and alter with situation. The letter rankings comparing AAs in the same class are tiered to provide most benefit for the least AA to the best of my knowledge. Different classes of AAs, however, are far more open to situational differences, and debate. Feel free to make comments and suggestions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gagmog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Wow<br />
<br />
This is a great starting point for those of us justnow looking into AA.<br />
<br />
Great guide</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Menon Lifeblight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sticky please.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">adding the point costs for each level would make this even better, but its nice to have the efficiency and dps comments included all in one place, thanks for posting this new version</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Under Touch of the Wicked might want to update that its...pretty useless now that UA only lasts 5 minutes. Thanks SoE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">dyrkk,<br />
it is meant just to be an efficiency guide. the AA guide gash posted has point costs and sometimes better explanations of what the things do.<br />
<br />
zero,<br />
i wasn't even thinking about the brief period that you could get two HTs both with unholy aura per one UA, i meant that you get to UA every other one. i'll reword it for clarity anyway</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>ZilshasisEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Quick Note : <br />
<br />
You cannot buy PE untill you have spent 12 points in Arch type AA skills. Having gotten CA1, CS1 and ND1 is only six points, thus you'd need to spend another six before you could buy PE and thus continue your tanking path.</div></div><hr />

wrong.<br />

It depends on whether you're using MC or SoC ... along with your dexterity for proc rate. <br />
<br />
I refer you to the AA guide, which I'm not sure you read.  Bold mine.<br />

Window did some really nice work here, and you respond with  nonsense that just proves what little reading comprehension you possess.  Thanks for your uninformed opinion, now please drive through.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Blargon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If I'm wrong, I'm wrong, but fuck you for being an ass.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Pumak Deathbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Thanks muchly. My heas was hurting trying to figure out where to go with my AA. Now I at least have a guide ..woot</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Neric Ikolis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Very well listed indeed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Nice indeed but don't want to have 2 sticked threads with same AA related stuff. I could ask Gash to see if he can merge your thread into his thread and credit it to you. It could be easier to read in one thread all about AA and make it more complete and less sticked spaces as well in a forum.. What do you think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Gash merging this information into his guide should be good, if he doesn't mind the work. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Done. :) Just added yours into my post under Gash's. Alot easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ganaith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Cheers noc, good for some noobs or doubters!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kuvak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Sad thing is, soon as Gates of Discord comes out, this will be obsolete :(<br />
<br />
Kuvak</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">yeah kuvak, that's why i finally got off my ass and finished it. hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Not necessarily,  Windows can upgrade guide after GOD and I can replace his old guide with new one. That won't be a problem. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Squigle D'Muerte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Very good but if you solo a lot (like me) 1st Aid really does come in useful after a bad fight, plus it is cheap.  I will say however that I used it a lot from 51-55 some from 55-60 and very rarely 65.  Mainly I guess because when I solo now I either overpower mobs considerably or I lose hps so fast when things go balls up that I rarely end a fight badly hurt, dead yes but not badly hurt.:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Eggborn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I still love my horse more than any other AA's I've spent.<br />
<br />
I do a lot of trade skilling and running around.  In order to actually get to a group in time or make a raid---the horse is an awesome tool for getting there.  Plus, I am a shadowknight!! Knight types should have a horse!<br />
<br />
The mana regen is great too.  I am almost always on the thing.<br />
<br />
No waiting on me! and very little &quot;ETA???? &quot; tells unless I zone slowly.</div></div><hr />
