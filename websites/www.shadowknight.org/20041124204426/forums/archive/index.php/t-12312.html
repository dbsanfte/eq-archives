<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>TheDarkness</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I am in agreement here - not that I desire to get res capabilities, mind you - but just for the point of the matter. Pally's as a mix of war &amp; cle are very discernable in that since, plus their own 'new' abilites they gain from the mix. ( ie. they get a res like a cleric, they get tanking like a warrior, and they get something neither has in 'lay on hands' ). I think its a good mix, but mind you, I don't play or research pally's. Same with rangers - the buffs, the damage output, then the great bow damage. Again...don't research those, so I have no idea on missing pieces, etc. But there are plenty that Necro's get that we don't. Forget the 'mold' of an SK bc if we have to fit a roleplaying mold, then the argument of holding off on giving us 'ability blah' is ridiculous because we would cease to be a hybrid. Fact of the matter is, we are a hybrid. We got some buff's &amp; debuff's in the form of taps...I like those - well done and creative! We get a snare dot, plus other dots...cool. We get to tank...ok. But where is our slow? Like a haste tap or something? How about the root, charm, mez, and of course, the res? Not the full blown stuff a necro gets, but versions nonetheless. What we got though...hate spells? Bah! Slow generates enough hate...ask a shammy! ;)<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I love my SK, and will never have another primary take its place, but in the point of suggestions, etc, I agree! Either 'where is our gimp version of blah that a necro has' or nerf the necro. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Darko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">WTF is wrong with u people? must u always bite the hand that feeds you?<br />
<br />
The class is very well balanced as is, we have a well defined and NEEDED role in both group, solo, and raid situations.<br />
<br />
The only possible change needed is the fix of the exisiting 65 spells, and quit asking for situational crap, leave the board some dignity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ganaith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Truly, this is a dumb post. Where is bick?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>TheDarkness</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">From reading these boards, I am pretty sure I have discovered the problem with SK class...the people that play it, and are posting here. Soemone makes an obvious statement, and they get flamed. Someone says 'hey, HT sucks' and they get flamed bc, quote, it was 'fixed'. Maybe if you're ubber lvl 65 with the AAs. There is constant bitching about the spell line, the AAs, the lack of quest, etc, etc, etc but when someone makes an observation about an obvious situation, you ppl bitch. You all need to go play druids or something. The fact of the matter is that our role is limited...solo, we fear kite - period. But some of you insist that the lvl 55 cap isn't a problem. In groups, we can pull, but every freakin' other class out there seems to only think monks can ( /ponder ). In groups, we can MA...until a serious mob walks up and the amount of AC you have doesn't mean dick compared to the hitpoints you have, which a warrior will always be able to have more. Buffs? Ours are gimps compared to true buff classes, which if you fight in PoP zones, you best have a shammy to make life good. Aggro? Most groups sure as hell don't want to wait for you to build aggro to give to the warrior on XP grinds, plus if you are MA, the hate spells aren't great aggro spells...good, but not great. In raids? Put it this way...hopefully they let us come along. And quest? I don't even have to mention it.<br />
<br />
And before you post bullshit about 'then why the hell do you play an SK' I'll answer it - I want to melee solo, and the idea of being a paladin makes my skin crawl, and there are 400 to 1 rangers out there compared to SKs. I play an SK for what the description says it is - mix of a warrior &amp; a necro, and, since its a hybrid, a lil something here and there that is 'new' compared to the necro &amp; warriro. That's what a hybrid is. That's what pally's are, that's what rangers are. If you want your own defined class, play a druid, cleric, whatever. Don't bash ppl making obvious statements about the definition of a class and what is lacking.<br />
<br />
Oh! And learn the difference between serious and not serious post ( aka the decapitate one ). I see why other classes are so ignorant of SKs and why they disrespect us...bc most of our class if filled with dumbasses who just wanna stare at their DE hottie toon.<br />
<br />
Bottomline: if you don't have a reason to post a 'for' or 'against', backed with validity &amp; information, from a constructive point of view, STFU.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Trysbrina67</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Either 'where is our gimp version of blah that a necro has' or nerf the necro.  <br />
<br />
Why would you want a gimp watered down version of a necromancer spell other than to say you have it?  Or why would you want a spell that the &quot;parent&quot; class used at 34 and you are given at 57+?  Part of the reason why shadowknights spells tended to suck was because they were unimaginative and low level hand me downs from necromancers.  Until we started getting even partially useful spell lines that were unique to the class did the situation improve.<br />
<br />
So aside from the &quot;they have it and we don't arguement&quot; why do shadowknights as a class really need Sacrifice and Convergance?  Don't get me wrong, getting stuff like the higher end taps, DoTs, root, mez, undead slow etc would be quite useful, but would not exactly be conducive to game balance.  In my opinion aside from a very small amount of spells the shadowknight class is doing quite well.  It is alot more fun than it used to be 1 or 2 years ago and in general true complaints about our class and other classes have decreased dramatically on these boards.<br />
<br />
If someone wants to suggest something, they have every right to suggest it in this forum, but not everyone is going to agree with them for a variety of reasons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>TheDarkness</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Agreed! I wrote my last post VERY hot headed due to my disdain with the immediate bashing of question answer, etc. IMO of the SK class, I love it for what it is - a mixture of low level versions of necro spells with melee ability. Cases in point are our lifetaps, dot snares, etc. To the question posted on 'why to want a gimped version of a necro spell', I ask, what else do we have? There was further developement in that post, which I greatly respect, and honor the opinion of, but nonetheless, I support the addition of any and all lower level spells of a necro, even if they would not be used very often, as, IMO, it 'completes us'. Take pally res...in a pinch, it's much greater than no res at all! I am all for new additions to our list, but I wouldn't mind giving up aggro spells for an increase in melee dps ( to be closer to a warriors, and help us keep aggro when being an MA ) in exchange for root, slow undead, MAYBE a mini mez, and a res spell, like the necro. I am just of the opinion that if you have a formula, stick to it, and IMO, VI has fallen away from this formula for SKs compared to the followed formula for pally's &amp; rangers, therefore, I support the starting question / suggestion.<br />
<br />
Again, I am all for disagreement - just not vagrant slaughter of an idea. Respectable post there Trys, thanks.<br />
<br />
Btw...IMO, I don't count lvl 65 AAs as a 'fix' for problems / issues for things affected before lvl 65, aka, HT. At 65, having a 8k HT is pretty minute as you are fighting mobs with 100k HP, not to mention the mobs you fight along the way to lvl 65, which I believe is the 'issue' still mentioned nowadays about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zakton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Necros can rez because they sacrifice a char to get the exp for the rez.  A sacrifice means that you lose exp like you died and can never get it back period.  You can't even get a rez to regain your exp after a sacrifice.  This the emerald that necros use to rez someone up to 93%.   This is NOT something SK should get as a class.  We don't have that much control over corpses that warrant us getting it.  I agree it would be nice to be able to rez myself for 90% like a Pally but this would be very overpowering for us.  We can solo effectively and even if we die we can summon our corpse.  And now someone is suggesting that we should be able to rez ourselves for 90% too?   Not gonna happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Drynnious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">A rez doesn't have anything to do with an sk. The poster is just a power-gamer and wants to be able to do everything and everything. Want a haste buff too? Maybe Aego and KEI?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>TheDarkness</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The irony of it is, what can necros not do? I mean seriously, they have a lot of abilities, and I think we are more the antithesis of the necro than anything else. I mean, necros tank through their pet, just as well as we can. At 55, I dueled a 61 necros pet. With it hasted, the pet waxed me; no contest. Not hasted, I survived with 9% HP. In all honesty, I do think the necro is WAY over powered, but hell, if that's the way it is, for that reason alone, I support getting as much as we can of what they have to offer. To me, its common sense. I am not as complaciant as others here. ;)<br />
<br />
Edit: forgot one thing...as ridiculous as you make it sound that this was asked, you lose all creditability when you say 'why don't SKs have ageo, KEI, super run'...that is not the point - necros don't have those in case you didn't know.</div></div><hr />

First of all the necros 61 pet is SIX levels above you. No wonder it wasted you. <br />
<br />
I wasn't even referring to necros when I posted the aego, kei thing. I was showing the fact that the poster would want something stupid like that so they could have everything and be super uber l33t! I.E. A powergamer would want all the abilities like that. <br />

SKs should not be pacifist...why would it be worng to pursue all you can from your class like everyone else out there? Do any of you teenagers complaining even have a logically backed reason to add to the discussion, or does thinking just hurt too much? Is the only reason some of you play SKs because you only want to be evil, bc the mean boys at kindergarten are still taking you milk money? I refuse to dilute my time any longer by spending it reviewing and trying to streghten or dispute suggestions through logic...it has obviously escaped some of you, and I fully understand why others avoid the boards, or posting, all together.</div></div><hr />

Sks SHOULD be limited of course.  I would settle for being able to sacrifice and get a 50%.  I am not a power gamer nor do I want to be.  I have wondered why palys get such a kick ass effect, the only thing sks get is FD.  Our coffins are RARELY used.</div></div><hr />

My coffins are more used so far then the pally's rez in the guild, i think both are on the same level of use.</div></div><hr />

Necros coffins are much cheaper and stackable, so everyone goes with those.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Drynnious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">The ties between parent class and hyrbird are begginning to dissapear. Get over it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Mallce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I have played a Pally till lvl 52, and then I wised up, and started to play a real class, so I started playing an SK. Not for one day do I regret it. My SK is currently lvl 54, that being said, I think I have a pretty good grasp at the balancing at least to the 50+ game.<br />
<br />
First of all, a Pally gets all the lower lvl (1 or 2 tiers behind if memory serves me correctly) cleric buffs, and a lot of the lower lvl cleric spells. Shadow Knights are a lot more than 1 or 2 tiers behind our caster counterpart. I know that if we were brought as close to the Necro as the Pally is to the Cleric, that would cause some serious balancing issues, but I think we should be brought just a little closer. WE get boil blood at 53, come on at that lvl a lot of the mobs have 15-20k hp (if not more), it's a pretty useless spell by the time we get it.<br />
<br />
Pallys have a pretty good haste spell (25% I'm pretty sure), so I really don't disagree that maybe we should have a haste tap. I think that would help us out a lot. If not that, maybe we should get the necro ud slow spell (shackle of bone I think it's 35%) I think it's called. We are supposed to be &quot;masters of the undead&quot;, so I don't see a balancing issue there. A Necro gets that at lvl 20. It would be nice to be able to slow UN, and there I don't see much of a balancing issue, since there are not too many high lvl UN zones. Also I think if we were given that ability we may be more desirable on some raids.<br />
<br />
I love our class, it's the most fun I ever had playing EQ. I'm not bitching, I don't think we suck. I also don't think the class of SK should be revamped entirely, but I do think we could be &quot;tweaked&quot; a little to bring us closer to the other classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Trysbrina67</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I never saw the shadowknight class as a &quot;master of the undead&quot; in my view we used necromantic power to augement our melee fighting ability.  The masters of undeath seem to be necromancers, and rightly so.<br />
<br />
As to a haste tap, with SoV everyone is pretty much at the haste cap anyway so at raids itd be pretty pointless.  If a mob NEEDS to be slowed before the MT engages it in PoP, it has been slowed long before the MT ever sees it.  Changing Aura of Hate and Pain to a group buff 80+, would help us alot more than a haste tap.  The paladin self haste does not stack with SoV either I believe, and granted its nice as a solo spell or a spell to use when you lack good haste it is however situational.  What we dont need are more spells that are ONLY useful during x situation.  I'd rather have spells that can be used 90% of the time and are useful.<br />
<br />
As for an undead slow for the shadowknight class, 35% at 61+ is jack.  Aside from slowing to kill a few lowb type undead what will it do?  Something in the lines of 50% would be more effective (like BST slow) but that probably wont happen.<br />
<br />
As far as ressurections go, Clerics get a long line of them up till their best one of 96% (aside from Divine).  It fits then that a paladin would get some of this line.  Necromancers however get 1 rez spell from 1 to 65 that the method of which to use it fits in with the role and mysitque built around them.  Would this be useful for shadowknights?  Yeah a little here and there like paladin rez, but do we need it?  I'd say no, we dont.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>dzenith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Ok, let's take a huge logical leap here:<br />
<br />
If there is a wipe, that NEEDED an FD class to still be alive to res, why wouldn't the necro just do it?  Why would we need to be able to res when there are several other classes that can already do it?  Why would you want a necro ability that is useful in very rare circumstances that having more than one person with the ability makes all others with the ability redundant ?  1 necro reses one cleric and that is all that needs to be done.  Having 1 SK do it instead doesn't give us any kind of advantage.</div></div><hr />
