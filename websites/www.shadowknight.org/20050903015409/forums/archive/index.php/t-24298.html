Dragons of Norrath – Good Faction Quests / Missions (work in progress)<br />
<br />
In order to start these Quests you need to have at least indifferent faction standing with the Keepers of Norrath, you can raise this faction in different ways, 1) You can do group missions with your friends or 2) do single person alliance quest’s from the wayfarer’s camp in lavastorm.<br />
<br />
Wayfarer’s Camp (loc positive 220 negative 44 - East of Nagafens Lair zone)<br />
<br />
Wayfarers Mercenary Elanye will offer you single person quests<br />
Wayfarers Mercenary Bitral will offer you single person quests<br />
<br />
In order to get the quests hail the npc, and click accept to the quest you wish to under take.<br />
<br />
Also at the wayfarers camp is Wayfarers Mercenary Youra. When you complete any (good aligned) group missions you will receive a Norrath’s Keepers Token, this will automatically appear on your cursor, and you hand this into the aforementioned Mercenary, and this will raise your faction with the keepers of Norrath.<br />
<br />
Norrath Keepers Camp (loc positive 3648 negative 530 – NW corner of lavastorm)<br />
<br />
Kanetheus Forestwalker will offer you group missions for 3-6 people<br />
Bianca Galgraith will offer you group missions for 3-6 people<br />
Boldger Bristlebeard will offer you group missions for 3-6 people<br />
Gordish Frozenheart I am unclear what he offers at this time<br />
<br />
All of the above names apart from the last one (for the time being until unlocked) will reward you with a various amount of Radiant Crystals and a Norrath’s Keepers Token upon every successful completion of the mission you accepted.<br />
<br />
The Radiant Crystals can be traded with other players or can be used to purchase items from the merchant at the camp; this is basically a more advanced LDoN points system. (At this time the Merchant is not in the game)<br />
<br />
After completing a various number of the above quest’s and missions you will eventually become Indifferent faction with Norrath’s Keepers, and this will unlock further development with the Keepers of Norrath.<br />
<br />
<br />
Gift of the Keepers<br />
<br />
In order to progress from here you must first speak to Chieftain Relae Aderi, you do this by hailing him and following through the dialogue, he will send you to speak to Private Nylaen Kel’Ther, and he will assign you 3 quests.<br />
<br />
Quest 1 – Greed of the goblins<br />
Kill 11 Stillmoon Laborer’s inside the temple of Stillmoon<br />
<br />
Quest 2 – Creating an antidote<br />
Loot 5 Boiling Lavaspinner Bloods from Lavaspinner’s Lair<br />
<br />
Quest 3 – Burning Arrows<br />
Loot 5 Delvian Goblin teeth from Tirranun’s Delve<br />
<br />
Upon completing each quest you shall receive approximately 40% aa exp and 220platinum and faction to the Keeper’s of Norrath, once you have completed all 3 you may go and hail Chieftain Relae Aderi once more, and he gives you more work to do, you then go and speak to Keeper Dilar Nelune, and he gives you a mission, for this you will need a minimum of 3 people and a maximum of 6.<br />
<br />
Mission 1 – Children of Gimblax<br />
Relae must have already told you that Gimblax plans to exact vengeance upon you for killing the goblins in the temple. We have learned roughly where this foul goblin is and highly recommend you find your way to him before he finds you.<br />
<br />
Upon completing this mission you must go back to Chieftain Relae Aderi and hail him once more…. Congratulations you have now received 2 AA and the new ability Gift of the Keepers – Your devotion to Norrath’s Keepers grants you increased Statistics (+10 to all stats cap).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Valor of the Keepers<br />
<br />
After completing the above, I am sure your hungry for more action!!!!<br />
<br />
To start of this part you must once again go and Hail Chieftain Relae Aderi, and he will send you to speak to Private Nylaen Kel’ Ther, when you speak to the private he assigns you 3 more solo quests.<br />
<br />
Quest 1 – Turn the Tides of the Sand<br />
Loot 7 Sandy Goblin Blood from the Stillmoon Temple<br />
<br />
Quest 2 – Recover the Lost Map<br />
Loot 8 Shredded Map Pieces from The Ascent<br />
<br />
Quest 3 – Defend the Kirin Contact<br />
Kill 9 Kirin’s in The Ascent<br />
<br />
Again for each quest listed above that you complete you shall receive approximately 40% aa exp and 220platinum and faction. Once you have completed all 3 of the above you must go and speak to Chieftain Relae Aderi, and he will send you to speak to Keeper Dilar Nelune, this will open a new group mission Sickness of the Spirit (this is not needed to be completed for progression) he will also ask you to speak to Lieutenant Ekiltu Verlor you will be offered an Event.<br />
<br />
Event 1 – Calling of Emoush<br />
You must hurry. The Dark Reign are slowly making their way deeper into Tirranun’s Delve. We have heard they seek a magic that the delve goblins possess that allows them to create a great, sentient, and dangerous dervish of stone. This dervish is a danger to everyone in the delve, but if the Dark Reign are able to capture and harness the dervish, they will most certainly use it in the army they build. You must find a way to put an end to this magic posthaste!<br />
<br />
Maximum Players : 24<br />
<br />
Upon completing this event you will loot a stone from Emoush and go back to Chieftain Relae Aderi and hand it to him, upon the hand you shall receive another 2 AA and the new ability Valor of the Keepers (+250 hp / mana / endurance) You will also receive your new class lvl 69 spell.<br />
<br />
<br />
Next Ability (unsolved at this time)<br />
<br />
To continue with the progression you once again hail Chieftain Relae Aderi and he sends you back to Private Nylaen Kel’Ther, who once more assigns you 3 more quests.<br />
<br />
Quest 1 – Snowfoot Revenge<br />
Kill 10 Snowfoot Goblins in The Ascent<br />
<br />
Quest 2 – Protect the Waters<br />
Loot 5 Purified Nest Water in Stillmoon Temple<br />
<br />
Quest 3 – The Sacred Scrolls<br />
Loot 7 Ancient Scroll of Wisdom from Thundercrest Isles<br />
<br />
Once again upon completing each Quest you shall receive approximately 40% AA and 220p and faction.<br />
<br />
Again you must now go and hail Chieftain Relae Aderi, and he will send you to Keeper Dilar Nelune this will have opened another 3-6 person mission History of the Isle, and he will also ask you to speak to Lieutenant Ekiltu Verlor, and this will have opened up 2 more Events which appear to both needed for the next part of the progression.<br />
<br />
Event 1 – Trial of Perseverance (Not completed at this time)<br />
There are still more parchments and tomes we wish to lean about in Stillmoon Temple. Some of these documents may provide the Dark Reign with the ability to bring ruin to the world. You must use your strength, stamina, and wherewithal to uncover these scrolls and secure them before the Dark Reign can get their hands on them.<br />
<br />
Maximum Players: 24<br />
<br />
<br />
Event 2 – Volkara’s Bite (Not completed at this time)<br />
Deep in the caverns of the Lavaspinner’s Lair is the queen of the spiders. Her name is Volkara and hour by hour she builds her army of lavaspinners that weave and kill by spinning webs as hot and deadly as the lava that surrounds them. She has taken to the flavor of the blood and flesh of mortals and she must be stopped. You must go there in the name of Norrath’s Keepers and Firiona Vie to stop the flow of blood in her caves.<br />
<br />
Maximum Players: 42</div></div><hr />

Think there's more Lavaspinner drops required, but less kills in Stillmoon. Will verify later, but it seems that though the path is similar, Evil/Good progression DOES differ slightly.</div></div><hr />

Max of 24 isn't really much of a raid.  Most fairly casual guilds could probably muster that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xulan</div><div class="date">02-22-2005, 01:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">True, we are down to 12 on a really good day however, but yeah could probably.  I read further that the mobs only hit for 500ish, and the &quot;difficulty&quot; in the event is really just the boss mob fight mechanics.  So, it's looking more and more possible.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There was 5 drops in Lavaspinner as well. The kills in Stillmoon was 8 or 9 though and it was Stillmoon Guards.<br />
<br />
You can easily do the Stillmoon Kills for a full group at the same time. Each member will get creditted for every kill.<br />
Since the kills are different from the Goodie side, this wont work for a mixed group ofcourse.<br />
The zone is easily soloed, the mobs practically wont hurt you if you get them single.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I 4 box.  Can I group my toons together, get them each the same solo Task (not group mission) to kill X number of mobs (20 in Stillmoon for example), and they all get the faction reward?  <br />
<br />
In addition, one thing I'd like to try is to combine a solo Task and a group Mission to maximize the hits.<br />

<br />
Guide for Evil DoN Progression <br />
<br />
So, you want to follow the Dark Reign? Just follow these simple steps to get there and soon you'll be enjoying the life of killing and slaughtering all of those who follow Friona Vie. <br />
<br />
First thing is first, the Dark Reign just won't START to like you because you want to follow them, you have to prove your dedication to them. <br />
<br />
Go to the Wayfarer Camp in Lava Storm Mountains just east of the Soldung B entrance at /loc 2200, -50. When you get there, you might want to talk to either Wayfarers Mercenary Varein, Jeryx, or Elanye. They'll give you some soloable mission to increase your faction for the Dark Reign. Once you've done enough of these missions, or the groupable ones (from someone who has indifferent faction or better), then head off and talk with Zaerr Ty'Dal in the Dark Reign Outpost in Lava Storm Mountains at /loc 3000, -350. Follow the text and soon he'll ask you to help out in the most meager form possible. Find Officer Sirrikis Ryktor and chat with him. You'll get 3 tasks that will be automatically put into your Task Window (Alt + Q). <br />
<br />
First Tasks <br />
<br />
Task: Blood of the Basilisk <br />
Zone: Tirranun's Delve <br />
Objective: Loot 5 Simmering Basilisk Bloods <br />
Walkthru: Invis to the center of the zone where there are 4 basilisks. Kill them. Loot the bloods. Win. <br />
<br />
Task: Clearing the Path <br />
Zone: Stillmoon Temple <br />
Objective: Kill 8 Stillmoon Drakes <br />
Walkthru: Only Stillmoon Drake mobs will complete this task. You can be grouped to complete it as well. Kill them. Win. <br />
<br />
Task: The Burning Poison <br />
Zone: Lavaspinner's Lair <br />
Objective: Loot 5 Caustic Lavaspinner Venoms <br />
Walkthru: Kill the Lavaspinner spiders and loot the venom. Win. <br />
<br />
Once you've completed those quests, go back and talk with Commander Zaerr Ty'Dal again. He'll give you a character flag and tell you to speak with Officer Vacax Rol`Tas and accept the mission. <br />
<br />
First Mission <br />
<br />
Task: Have Note Will Travel <br />
Zone: Tirranun's Delve <br />
Objective: Kill a number of goblins in the zone to spawn the named at the end of the zone. Kill the named and loot the piece. Then you need to kill 9 goblin guards on the way back to the zone in. <br />
Walkthru: I'd suggest a full group for this. Many of these goblins Complete Heal and Gate. They come in packs and at one point, we had 7 in camp. The named hits for 1k, but we had a monk tank it and 2 shamen keeping him up was over kill. <br />
<br />
Once you've completed that quest, talk with Commander Zaerr Ty'Dal and receive your new AA and character flag. <br />
<br />
Gift of the Dark Reign: Level 1 <br />
Effect: Increase all stats by 10, Increase all stats max by 10. <br />
<br />
If Commander Zaerr Ty'Dal won't talk to you anymore after that, its because you need amiable faction to progress. So do a few missions with friends, I'd suggest the Animated Statue plans. Once you get to amiable faction, talk to the Commander again. He'll direct you to Officer Sirrikus Ryktor and he'll give you another 3 tasks to complete. <br />
<br />
Second Tasks <br />
<br />
Task: Army of Stone <br />
Zone: Stillmoon Temple <br />
Objective: Loot 5 Animated Guardian Essence <br />
Walkthru: The objective says it all. Kill the golem mobs and loot the items. Win. <br />
<br />
Task: Blood from Sand <br />
Zone: Stillmoon Temple <br />
Objective: Loot 7 Impure Goblin Blood <br />
Walkthru: Goblins are pretty plentiful in Stillmoon Temple. Kill them, look the bloods, and win. <br />
<br />
Task: Reap the Kirin Mind <br />
Zone: The Ascent <br />
Objective: Loot 3 Pristine Kirin Brains <br />
Walkthru: This task was a pain in the ass to do solo. I'd suggest invising and conning everything in the zone as you make your way up. You'll see a Kirin or two on the way. If you can kill them and find a brain, more power to you. I managed to solo my way to the top and I just killed the 2 static spawns there. Loot and win. <br />
<br />
Go back to the Commander and talk to him again. He'll send you over to Officer Vacax Rol`Tas who will send you on a mission. <br />
<br />
Second Mission <br />
<br />
Task: Drake Egg <br />
Zone: The Ascent <br />
Objective: Loot a Drake Egg and kill one 'a goblin guard' <br />
Walkthru: Get a splitter for this one. You can invis to the top to where you will see 2 'a drake', either one of those will drop the egg. Loot it. Invis back down *Do not succor*. You will see 2 golem guards, and 2 goblin guards, get those split, and kill one of the goblin guards. Port out since there isn't a zone out of that instance. <br />
<br />
That's as far as I've gotten. The next step I believe is the 24 person mini raid on Emoush the Destroyer. You can flag 6 people past this point if they've done everything up to this. Your Gift of the Dark Reign AA will increase to be... <br />
<br />
Gift of the Dark Reign: Level 2 <br />
Effect: Increase all stats by 10, Increase all stats max by 10, Increase HP/Mana/End by 250</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Klotar AngedeMorts</div><div class="date">02-22-2005, 01:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How significant are the faction hits for solo Wayfarer tasks?  I am doing goodie missions with the guild of course, but the faction gap stays status quo (they are 2 - 3 faction levels above me) and I would like to &quot;catch up&quot; if I can.  I was doing that, or trying, by killing evil guards but it's slow going due to the respawn or risky if doing more than one solo.<br />
<br />
I generally have a few hours before the rest of the guild group gets on (which I have been playing alts/twinks during) but if the hits are worthwhile, I might try to get caught up doing an extra Wayfarer task or two a night.  Are they as much of a hit as token hand ins?</div></div><hr />

Yes it's possible.<br />

If you go good faction with an evil raced character, prepare for pain. There are a lot of things I really like about this expansion, but the very punative way the faction system is set up is not one of them.</div></div><hr />

Can you be more specific?  Just a lot of additional time making up faction or inability to get the full bonus?<br />
<br />
We are still raiding trials roughly 4 nights a week so I am feeling really stuck doing much progression on these and still debating whether to align good or evil.   I have turned in 1 evil orb and have a good one in the bank in case I decide to switch but with very few guild members walking on the dark side with me... well...  I am afraid I wont be able to comvince them to do any of the evil events that take more than a group.<br />

My guild chose to go with good faction (85% of the races are good). What that leaves me with is a choice of doing evil missions with pick up groups or switching inefficiently between good/evil missions with guild groups, neither of which are viable; or I can go good side and group with my guild and friends.<br />
<br />
The frustrating part is that people that have done fewer missions than I have, have already recieved their rewards, while after close to 30 missions, 3 raids, a bunch of solo tasks, and lots of guard killing I am still dubious. Perhaps being a Dark Elf Shadow Knight that worships Inny starts with the worst possible faction, but raising it is a chore. I have a DE friend that has more missions completed than me and he is still dubious as well.<br />
<br />
The whole good/evil thing I'm sure looked good on paper, but the implementation was done poorly. Let everyone start with the same faction to both and then decide. Or have a single faction. The way it is now, you are punished for a decision you made five years ago, that is if you still want to group with your friends.<br />
<br />
I don't normally rant, but this has been a bit frustrating.<br />
<br />
As far as whether or not we can get the same rewards, I can't answer that but I am making that assumption.</div></div><hr />

Actually, I think the implementation was brilliant. Faction is chosen, in that I can do missions with my friends and not worry about losing/gaining faction unless I want to.<br />
<br />
As for the starting point, it makes sense. You're not being &quot;punished&quot; your living with the character you chose. When you chose it years ago, you knew that you were an evil character, and that good characters hated evil. You don't really have to ping pong all that much, as faction doesn't seem all that hard to raise. Saying that a Dark Elf Shadowknight being hated by Firiona Vie as a faction beginning is &quot;punishment&quot; is akin to the EQII theory of: Any race can be any class of any faction! It sucks. It's stupid. You chose the harder path, now you have to live with it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't see such a negative effect now. YOu can buy from both merchants, and what's stopping you from progressing? Your guild goes good, that's fine and dandy, you can still go with them. Maybe I'm missing something here, but so far the only detriment I'm seeing is &quot;My guild's groups are mainly doing goody missions&quot; So? Play pickup bingo, like most of us have to do.</div></div><hr />

Exactly.<br />

It is far more practical to just cave in and do Keepers faction like everyone else, but it takes you an extra assload of time/work to get to the same point rewards-wise as everyone else.  Yeah, that's a bit imbalanced.</div></div><hr />

One of my closest in-game friends just came back from a several-month hiatus, so that kinda took the urgency off a move a bit.  I've been considering guilds on a few servers, but my RL schedule is a bit stupid ATM, so I've not really found anything that fits my schedule as well as I'd like.</div></div><hr />

The Male Half Elf Bard shithead at the mercenary camp gives you Evil Faction if you give him a crystal.<br />
<br />
The female gives you goodie faction.<br />
<br />
Both sides get nearly the same rewards, shards are tradeable.<br />
Both sides get progression quests/tasks.<br />
<br />
Can't an evil person attend a Goodie mission and get the crystals/shards - turn it into the evil bard guy, raise his evil faction normally, and then progress his evil tasks, while he goodie friends go with him and collect crystals at the same time for the items they want?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The question is: will max faction be capped based on starting faction?  Because if it is, then there is a problem!<br />
<br />
To clarify... let's use the popular woodie crown quest as an example.  Ignore the scalp and illusion modifiers.  As a DE/Inny/SK, I started at scowl and maxed at amiable.  Several of my goodie alts started at dubious and maxed at ally.<br />
<br />
See what I'm getting at here?  Now if it works like Velious factions where you can max ally any of the three -- fine.  But if you cannot max both factions no matter which one is your default, that is not fine.  And if you don't know for certain whether you can or cannot fully max, then you should not be posting that it doesn't matter.  If after a gazillion missions I max out faction but my it's only warmly to goodies or something, I will not be pleased, because it means I should have stuck with evil and have a better chance of maxing it.</div></div><hr />

I can put up with it now, but I am still pissed thinking the those psuedo pansy do-gooders are not paying for it now.   They should have the same faction that we start with now.

Last time I checked, there were only type 4 proc augs, no type 8.  And though they changed the names of all the armor and weapons, I'm not sure they changed the names of the augs (will look later unless someone else does).</div></div><hr />

Just tested this. Amiable faction with Dark Reign, and I can buy from the goodie merchant, completely visible. Not sure if this is intended, or if it's a hold over while crystals are still untradeable.<br />

That being said, I believe the goodie camp 125 tap aug is the same as the evil aug, so not sure you can get two. Will check later tonight.</div></div><hr />

Zone: Tirranun's Delve <br />
Objective: Kill a number of goblins in the zone to spawn the named at the end of the zone. Kill the named and loot the piece. Then you need to kill 9 goblin guards on the way back to the zone in. <br />
Walkthru: I'd suggest a full group for this. Many of these goblins Complete Heal and Gate. They come in packs and at one point, we had 7 in camp. The named hits for 1k, but we had a monk tank it and 2 shamen keeping him up was over kill. <br />
<br />
Actually not true. There are 4 Delve Clerics in the zone. You only need to kill them to get teh named to spawn. The first 3 give a message saying something to the effect that they were unable to reach the alram before they died. Upon killing the 4th, it says that it triggered the alarm and then the named spawns.<br />

<br />
Killed some random number of creatures and eventually Boss mob spawned....you will get 4 emotes as you kill...the first three say so and so creture failed to raise the alarm...the last...that the alarm has been sounded and the named has spawned.... <br />
<br />
note...you can kill the drakes as well as goblins to spawn the named ( I know this cause i was experimenting with what level pet i could pet pull with....and cleared all the drakes and got first emote) <br />
<br />
Some of the Drakes at zone in in the south can see invis....of the normal gobbies, only the Delve Evokers can see invis.... <br />
<br />
as you work your way in and north, it is worth noting that the center rectangular room does not have any wanderers in the center....they go around the raised edge of the room...so you can be visible/rebuff/rezz in the middle of the center room with no issues...you can also pull to there and the other mobs wont add (assuming you pull single in the first place) <br />
<br />
the north and south rectanular rooms have 2 wanderers that path through them...but once cleared offer spots from which to pull...north or south depending on which direction you need to go... <br />
<br />
all areas of the zone repop...20 min or 30 min...not sure of exact timing... <br />
<br />
the named when it spawns is called &quot;Goblin Task Master&quot;, and it spawns just outside the last room to the north, where the building opens up to a open cavern (this is where the basiliks are in the normal zone)... <br />
<br />
The named is immune to run speed changes, but was partial slowable...I had no real trouble tanking it as a 70SK (10.5k HP, 2k AC), but it had a fair few hp and took quite awhile to kill....ran low on mana with druid healer (but he started at 50m) and was able to heal with shammy while he medded a bit. Named did not see invis. <br />
<br />
After killing named and looting note, 3 groups of 3 Delve Guards spawned....one batch of 3 at the north end of each rectangular room... <br />
<br />
while the guards have the same name...i think there are variations in class...like the other gobbies in zone ...but of higher lvl....as the amount of casting and melee damage varied alot from guard to guard...some of the guards saw invis and some did not.... <br />
<br />
I was able to pet pull single all of the mobs in zone....I was using the LVL 64 SK Pet spell ...Invoke Death...which is i think lvl 49....I was buffing pet with khazads, oak, wunshi (+ misc shammy buffs), and mage toys...plus using Quiessence before each pull....so pretty buffed green pet.. <br />
<br />
It is worth noting that i still lost quite a few pets on inc when pulling the delve guards....never in a way that resulted in a multiple pull....rather becuase i would attempt to snare the inc mob, get resisted...and the mob would stay aggroed on the pet adn kill him first then turn to me....I think this happened mostly with the pally mobs...as they would stun the pet...and do quite a bit of damage while it was stunned...(could probably rejigger my hot keys to heal pet on inc more efficiently...but never got around to it) <br />
<br />
also worth noting from my previous attempt that fd splitting of these mobs is a real PITA....1 in 3 resisted snare on pull...and lots are casters who will cause your fd to fail alot...pet pulling was far far easier... <br />
<br />
quite a few of the mobs will gate, which can be quite annoying... i had several gate despite the fact that i had my sk meleeing and mashing the bash key, and with 3 pets mage air pet/shammy pet/sk pet all beating on the mob to try to interrupt...( as a side note thought i was being skillful and pet pulled first see invis mob to zone out to clear my way in...when mob gated....i got trained by about 20 mobs....couldnt zone all the bots out fast enough...hehe) <br />
<br />
and finally...on the almost win....after killing the last set of guards....i was checking the path with SK for see invis...and found one...so i succored the rest of the group to zone out....mission updated while all the bots were zoning...and none of them other than druid porter got credit for the mission completion.... <br />
<br />
SO....dont evac...fight your way out...or evac/port one at a time...so when one of the folks triggers the mission update....the other folks wont miss out... <br />
<br />
i'll be going back to do it again...since most of my toons missed the quest progression flag....i'll update if i notice anything else worth posting... <br />

I have done the first 24 persons raid, first 42 persons raid and the second 42 persons raid. I have got the +10 to all stats aa, the +300 HP, Mana and End. I just finished the plus 3 free aas and 1 more buff slot. The raids are cake. I solo all or most Task. My advise is if your evil do evil. However if you do decide to do good you are in for a long ride. Faction is the key here. Your fraction decides what task you are ready for and mission you can do. As to the fastest way I would suggest you kill the guards every chance you get. Get your task done. Always do missions. Like I said the key to getting all the aas and loots is faction. Plus a bonus I have found is anyone anywhere can add you to there shared missions list. So if you have friends doing missions and thier group is not full have them help you out. Send them a tell and see if they will add you to thier shared list and get a free crystal to turn in while they do the mission and you do your thing. You can only carry 1 crystal at a time in bank or inventory so after you get one turn it in.  <br />

Kill any see invis along the way, reinvis, etc. Reason being is, there is nothing back there - you can afk if you need to, have a beer, whatever. Same goes for the middle room that normally has a couple basiliks in it - none present in the instance. Also, had no trouble here FD splitting the guards, and none of the 9 saw invis for us. Overall, an easy task. Won with me, boxed cleric, boxed druid and a shammy buddy.</div></div><hr />

I've done this mission twice now (once for me and once for a guildie) and received my 2 free aa points and 10 to all stats.<br />
<br />
If you have a porter - to save a bit of time at the end, after killing the named and 9 guards, I just invised and ran to the zone out.  There were see invis mobs on both missions between the group and zone out, but the first time I ran by them and they didnt agro.  The second time they agroed right away...you can use your mini-defensive disc, or your resistance disc or HS to help avoid snares/stuns...but I made it just fine without those.  Once you reach the zone out, everyone in the group gets the reward.  You zone out and have your group port to lavastorm and meet up with them there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
- all casters now see invis....Delve Clerics and Delve shamans, in addition to the Delve clerics which previously saw invis....means you have to clear a few more mobs than before....<br />
<br />
- task seems to have 5 steps now...kinda weird in that it seems that the Named mob now has two steps....the new step update when we killed the Goblin Task Master....and the very next step when I looted the note....it may be that there had been some exploit there that got fixed...not sure...<br />
<br />
- None of the Delve Guards on the way out saw invis....may have simply be luck of the RNG...or may have been changed to compensate for the higher number of see invis in the normal mobs.,..<br />
<br />
Based on a couple of times through now...i'm thinking that the number of kills to spawn the named is in the 30ish range....have tried to keep exact count...but always get distracted...but its about that....<br />

Did this one yet again....yes i must be a masochist......a couple of the Delve Guards did see invis....so my post patch run where none did must have just been simple RNG odd streak...</div></div><hr />

Emoush is located in the very back of TD, where the basiliks normally spawn in the non-instanced zone version. Anyhow, the 3 adds do not hit very hard, despite their lvl 70 con - we had an SK, Ranger, and Monk tanking the guards ( we didn't realize that when Emoush deactivates, not only can you not hit him, but he doesn't hit you either ). Anyhow, I tanked Emoush and we got him to 10% before the guards repopped with 20 ppl. By the time we downed the guards again and pulled Emoush for round 2, he was 27%, and yes, he summons on pull at that point. No problem though and the AE was more annoying than threatening. Pretty easy and fun event. Loot was a decent lil ring with a few stats ~120 hp and 41% haste.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Averse</div><div class="date">05-02-2005, 02:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Finally got DoN this weekend and havent really read up on it.<br />
<br />
All of my guild is doing good missions.<br />
<br />
Can I do good missions with them and get a token to turn in to the evil guy and work evil faction, and still be able to buy from good merchants?<br />
<br />
Basically what I am trying to figure out is &quot;what benefit would I get by doing the good faction work that would require me do pursue that option?&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brael</div><div class="date">05-02-2005, 02:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can buy from either merchant.  You need faction in order to get missions from a camp.  In addition to this you need faction for the AA's.  If your entire guild is on good, unless you're in a raiding guild that does evil raids too you would probally be better off on good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darknyss</div><div class="date">05-04-2005, 05:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So basically:<br />
<br />
Your faction can only be determined by what actions you do with the faction tokens, not what missions you do.<br />
<br />
Your faction determines when you get AA's and unlock tasks in each of the camps that your character can start.<br />
<br />
(and now the important question)<br />
Are you required to have the faction to JOIN an event/mission/raid?<br />
<br />
The way I see it... either faction works like some sort of new type of flag, (where you need to have people faction-flagged to join your missions/raids)<br />
or the faction is simply character based, and anybody can join your raids, but only the people working on that particular faction will benefit.<br />
<br />
If the latter is case, the question then becomes, is the time required to &quot;switch&quot; factions greater/lesser than it would be to have a guild alternate between doing good and evil raids/missions.<br />
<br />
Unless highly lopsided, I don't see why a guild would feel that alternating raids is so terrible (especially considering the crystals are tradable).<br />
<br />
However, if faction acts like a flag for joining a raid... then yes, this is a terrible way of setting this up, especially after all the &quot;bogus&quot; crap they gave us about wayfarer camps and how all of Norrath was beginning to work together.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, only the person getting the mission needs faction.<br />
<br />
...the faction is simply character based, and anybody can join your raids, but only the people working on that particular faction will benefit.<br />
<br />
Exactly.  Assuming, of course, that by &quot;benefit&quot; you mean &quot;increase her/his individual faction&quot;.  Everyone still receives crystals, whether you turn-in the token is optional.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brael</div><div class="date">05-04-2005, 05:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only thing faction determines is what AA's you can get and what missions you can request.  Joining missions, getting rewards (faction token/crystals), and buying items are all independant of faction.</div></div><hr />

I thought faction didn't matter for the raids seeing emoush, Trial of preservance (sp), and the giant spider thing didn't matter for what faction you where on...... since 2 out of the 3 hand ins from these things the raid was started on the good side.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darknyss</div><div class="date">05-05-2005, 10:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Than I really don't see the problem with this set up... unless your guild is so lopsided towards one faction and NOBODY is willing to help people on the other side.<br />
<br />
Granted, it would bring a bit more of an RP aspect to the game... but it's WAY too late to try and bring a good/evil seperation between high end guilds.<br />
<br />
This is more of a hinderance to the high end guild... rather than a clear cut obstacle.<br />
<br />
Now another question comes to mind... are lockout timers on the good side and evil side connected in any way?  Perhaps splitting the faction in a guild will allow twice the number of large dragon raids... although I'm pretty sure I'm wrong on this, considering I'm only starting DoN progression.</div></div><hr />

When did I say faction mattered besides for AA's and getting missions?</div></div><hr />
