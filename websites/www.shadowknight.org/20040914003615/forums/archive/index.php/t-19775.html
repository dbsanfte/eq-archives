<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zjinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is 20k a fair price for ToI?  There's been 1 copy for sale in the Bazaar for quite a while.  If I buy it, I won't be able to afford the rest of my 65 spells at the moment.  Or I can just buy the others and hope for ToI later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">All I can say is that ToI is prolly our best level 65 spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bloodmere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Had a similar experience on my server. ToI was at 15k for a looong time but i finally found a copy for 10k. But as the previous poster say,  i have experienced this too, the spell is VERY usefull so if you can affort it buy it as fast as you can (though 20k feels a bit much)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zenobie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Just bought it 25k. Price seems high, but I've never saw it to sell before yesterday.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Menon Lifeblight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I would have paid 20k easy, if I ever saw it for sale.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Duck_72</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Won a rune in an xp group on Mith Marr, ToI was what I got...<br />
<br />
Sold it for 75k about 10 minutes after putting it up on my trader</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gneeker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Never ever saw ToI for sale, 20k would have been a steal when I was looking for it.<br />
<br />
Of course server prices may vary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zjinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I haven't been very lucky with turn-ins, so I went ahead and bought it for the 20k.  One less to worry about.  Thanks for the replies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Thack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You're all going to hate me, but I found it for 5k on day.  Got very lucky. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'd pay 50k for it... haven't seen it for sale in at least 4 months.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">19k here about oh umm 3 months ago...farmed like 14k straight when i saw it for sale off seblis scarabs, then sold my bst friend who was canceling eq for abits WLK for 6.5k to get the rest for it. Then 3months later friend came back and basically gave me bst so ended up paying 16k for that WLK back hehe. Oh well in that time found some cash camps and made some money so not to big a deal. Now to get the money to pay friend back for the ID4 ring then next feat...finding bst 65 slow for sale heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Morbent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">On tallon zek TOI is 59k with no competition whatso ever, just yesterday it was selling for 49k when outta the blue put one up. Im only packing 35k so i got ways to go.....with the unresistable tap and a PVP server i can see why the tap is so expensive and I WILL HAVE IT!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">aye it owns for pvp becomes your main source of dps, now mostly in pvp i just chain ToI/ToV back to back due to resists heh, against some time members only able to use ToI though =\.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Timmius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">If touch of innoruuk is your main source of dps in pvp you're doing something wrong =[ It should be supplemental.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>lorddaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">nothing beats critting your ID4 ToI, then critting the heal for over 2300hp. even mades the pallies cry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">it's killed you before timmius and yes of course its supplemental but not all of us own vanazeers or whatever your using. I didn't mean to stand there and blast like a wizzy heh, well except when fighting bards...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Daikoku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">On TP 20k is the baseline for any rune spell (there are some restrictions, but basicly 99% of the population can get any rune for that price with a little patience, some spells are less) <br />
<br />
The top guild on the server set that price up and the next 2 EP guilds followed suit.<br />
<br />
<br />
Was a pain for a while for them with the e-bay crowd doing the buy/resell thing, which is why it is not wide open.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dai</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, you killed me using harmtouch while Allye and I were fighting your group of 5 or 6. =/<br />
<br />
What i'm saying is regardless of the weapon you're using, inny shouldn't be your main source of damage in pvp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>NorrynNoir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">if i saw ToI on Xev for 20k i'd buy it, assuming i had the cash. cheapest i've seen it is 65k so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Mahsk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">commonly 35k+ on MT. don't see it for sale very often. I think I payed 30k about 5 months ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kenshi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">regularly, when it is up, ToI goes for 20-25k on 7th.</div></div><hr />
