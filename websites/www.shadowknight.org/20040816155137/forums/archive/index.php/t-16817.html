<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Black Knight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I wanted to ask, is there any SK quests for lower levels? Right now I'm level 14 twink (Yes, I twinked ok?), but I was wondering if there were any good quests I could do in my 20s. Heres my Magelo.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>GrihmmReapar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Why dont you put your skills and AA's on your Magelo's I wanna know how much hp and the like you have lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Black Knight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yes I am, just not to the extream, I didn't want or could afford to do that. And since even my main is limited on money, I might do some quests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>XebarisTP</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">A year and a half ago, it would have paid off to do some of the Darkforge quests (prob. targetted at lev 30-40 or so), but today there's the Bazaar, and though people traded before, the market is now overflowing with newer and better, dirt cheap items.<br />
<br />
This makes a lot of old items pretty worthless now. What was attractive for a lev 40 char a year and a half ago would be discarded by newbies now.<br />
<br />
So save yourself the trouble of camping rare mobs for rare drops, unless the quest reward is worth it. It feels like EQ advancement is largely reduced to gaining levels and platinum. Of course, there are probably a few quests, here and there, that are worth doing, but I can't think of any for a lev 20 character, off-hand.<br />
