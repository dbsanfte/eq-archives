<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bleuw</div><div class="date">08-29-2004, 02:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If there is already an exhaustive thread on this subject please provide the link so I can read it, but I can't find one here.<br />
<br />
I really liked when you could just spam level 9 Disease Cloud on a mob to keep agro.  Then I read that was nerfed a while back and it became much less effective as a taunt.  When PoP came out, I pretty much began using Festering Darkness and my taunt key exclusively when I wanted agro, and this worked very well for me through the PoP expansion.<br />
<br />
But grouping in the past few months, and especially in Kod'Taz and GoD zones, others in my groups seem to frequently get agro on mobs I'm tanking, despite frequent recasting and even spamming of my taunt key and Festering Darkness.  I was very suprised recently when I grouped with a Berserker could not even TAKE agro from him despite my best efforts, even CHAIN CASTING Festering repeatedly.  Please look at my magelo linked in my signature - I've got decent weapons for agro and I just don't understand this.<br />
<br />
I've since grouped with another SK who said he casts level 15 fear and the lowest level darkness spell for agro and that combination is better than what I've been doing.  I tried using the level 15 fear, but get casting messages that (a) it doesn't work indoors (mostly where I play) and (b) my mob is too high a level for fear and is thus immune to it.  So is it doing anything at all to cast fear as a taunt on a mob when fear doesn't even work in that zone or on a mob of that level?  And by the way, when did the fear line of spells get nerfed for SKs?  I learned how to play my SK and leveled him up years ago by fear kiting.  We can't fear kite anymore?  Doesn't it completely defeat the purpose of having a fear line of spells if we can only use it to fear kite low level mobs that can't damage us anyway?<br />
<br />
But I digress.  I would mostly appreciate feedback on the two or three spells you always keep memmed for agro in situations where you are the MT.<br />
<br />
Thank you :)</div></div><hr />

I've never seen a message saying I can't use fear indoors.  I don't think fear works on mobs over 55 so you'll get the message it doesn't effect them, but you still get alot of agro from it.  Also, I smash the taunt button every time it comes up.  Even though I fail about 60% of the time</div></div><hr />

fear only if there's a chance the mob will need to be mezzed.<br />
whether or not these spells can affect the mob does not change the massive amount of agro they produce.<br />

Yeah, my first mistake was not noticing the search feature in the title bar.  I just flipped through the first several pages of posts in this section and didn't see anything on topic in a post title so I posted this.<br />
<br />
But I just entered &quot;agro&quot; in the bar search engine and found one post in the first couple of pages with a title concerning fear and taunt that probably has good info about one of the questions in my post.  So in the future I will look more carefully before starting a new thread.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

if you already have the mobs attention, taunt does nothing for you so when you're mashing it you're losing the ability to hit it when you do not have agro.<br />
<br />
taunt is like a 50 or 60% chance at being put on the top of the hate list for the mob. if you're already at the top you gain almost nothing. IE, you can have a warrior with dual EB/anger 3/wa5 beat on a mob for an hour, having a completely insane amount of agro. then if he turns off attack, you hit taunt successfully and take one swing at the mob, you will have agro.<br />
<br />
so... you leave taunt alone until the mob turns to someone, you press it and if you're lucky you've got agro without doing anything else. then to put yourself substantially over their agro you cast something like clinging darkness.</div></div><hr />

A successful taunt = Top of hate list + 1<br />
<br />
Think of this in numbers.<br />
<br />
If you're at 1000 hate above the rest of your party  (fear x2 = guaranteed agro holding IMO) and you get a successful taunt... <br />
<br />
You are now at the highest hate point +1 hate point (and you've just lost like.. 998 hate points)<br />
<br />
Don't believe it?  Get some insane agro going on a mob along with a rogue or something with high dps, then hit taunt with the rogue still going hard at it.  Great for anyone with high dps that you have an uncanny hate for... they'll peel in a flash.<br />
<br />
Warriors tend to love peeling agro on me when I've been TMing or I've tagged on pulls and they snag a successful taunt... it guarantees them to hold agro through the battle if I use fear to tag.  Yes... this means that if a warrior wants to peel agro.. he's gonna have to have a clue about how taunt works... <br />
<br />
Its nice to have warriors send you tells asking them how they can hold agro better... I bet I find 50% of them being taunt mashers... the rest don't optimize the use of their incite line... <br />
<br />
The above I learned from both this site and SteelWarrior... I have this site to thank for this ( I am a reformed taunt masher)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DConquest</div><div class="date">09-01-2004, 09:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You'll be fine either way really.  There's other game mechanics, such as ranged aggro and pet aggro, that makes things more complex than simply taunt = top + 1.  It's also been shown that taunt simply just adds a little aggro when you're on top of the list ( like +1 aggro heh ), so no you're not going to lose 998 aggro by hitting taunt.  <br />
<br />
Worse thing that can happen is you don't have taunt up at the exact moment you lose aggro and have to wait a sec... best thing is a Caster or Pet has built more aggro than you but hasn't exceeded the range &quot; cap &quot; to make the mob go after them ( or pets can't steal aggro from you  :)  ) and you taunt and get up to their lvl + 1.</div></div><hr />

BTW, The fear message isn't that it doesn't work outdoors, it's that the mob is too high a level, which doesn't matter, you still get agro from the spell.</div></div><hr />

Something else that will really help is replacing your 75 lifetap aug with the 100 or 125 dd + stun proc from Guk.  Fear is good, but it's mainly a spell to use when you're tank mezzing Mezable mobs on raids.  No reason have both fear / Clinging up in an exp group imo.  If in a single group and you get a stray add, use taunt to attempt to get it off a caster.  If the mob is that bad ass that the casters can't CC it, then by the time you target / fear your caster would be dead / low health aggro anyway.</div></div><hr />

Clinging Darkness if the mob is not going to be mezzed, or is immune to snare.<br />
Festering Darkness if there are no other SKs, necros, rangers, or druids in the group.<br />
<br />
And I'm sorry, but I completely agree with Elkar.  There shouldn't be any more taunt mashers at your stage in the game, so read this thread thoroughly.</div></div><hr />

I mem CD when I'm unsure of the mobs level only, but I always have FDarkness mem'd and cast it on incoming mobs (or pulls if I'm pulling and the mob isn't to far from group).  FDarkness + occasional fear works great because the DoT holds aggro over time and fear can be cast to keep aggro or to safely get some snap aggro on an add...also, fear won't break mez as others have suggested so you can get the mob to hit you while the CC gets it under control.  One more point about Fdarkness - If you can get the mob snared before he reaches the group a good slower can slow him earlier which can save a ton of mana for the healer.  BTW, if I can hold aggro on more then one mob at a time and you are struggling with aggro on one mob then perhaps you should consider /deleting that SK as you are making it more difficult for the rest of us to get a group.</div></div><hr />

When I 2box my shaman, I pull with festering, set my back to a wall (if there is one), and put on auto-attack (you'll notice I have no proc augs). With just one cast and attacking, I can keep agro after my shaman slows, casts breath of trushar on me (these two usually land on incoming, if snare landed), debuffs, casts blood, and then casts EP leg clicky DoT.. then I click his epic, and while that is casting I switch back to the SK to cast a CD, and agro is basically locked.</div></div><hr />

So a successful taunt, when you already have the mob's attention, is +1 to your hate.  Very wasted.<br />

Don't mask taunt, don't do drugs, don't snare mezzable mobs with mulitples in camp, stay in school, and keep taunt poised for when the mob turns on someone else.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think I know the answer.  It is the retard who's SK twink is better equipped than your main.  The very same retard who uses Mental Horror and has enough mana pool and regen to chain cast Festering without ever running oom, and thus saves a spell gem slot because he doesn't mem Clinging also.  And it is the very same retard who prefers to cast Festering in 1.6 seconds rather than Clinging in 1.8 seconds.<br />
<br />
Regarding other comments about my Magelo vs. my knowledge of what are the best spells to use when playing a SK in a MT role, I forgot to mention my main is a cleric, and my SK is my alt.  I originally made my SK to FD camp Ragefire for my cleric in Sol B.  Since then, I have grown to love the class and consider it the most fun of all classes to play.  Unfortunately, I have only been able to play my SK outside of raids, in exp groups, for farming, and generally to support my cleric.  I am not a professional SK, I am a professional cleric.<br />
<br />
I appreciate the helpful information in this thread, and feel like I have accomplished my purpose of getting professional advice on how to play my SK better.  By using Festering and Fear for agro and using taunt strategically instead of spamming it, I've seen a significant improvement in my ability to keep agro (with less effort!) when grouped with others who have high DPS or use high agro spells (necros and shaman) but who don't make any effort to minimize or control their own agro.<br />
<br />
Thank you again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
  So your Sk twink is better equipped then my main and yet you're asking questions about holding aggro?  Also, I still don't understand why you would chain cast festering over CD....they generate roughly the same aggro and have roughly the same cast time (.2second difference..plz).  Even if you could chain cast festering without depleteing mana, you would be better off using that mana for other spells like spears for dps, tap buffs for group resists/dps and AC tap buffs for tank purposes...Also, mental horror doesn't proc on every mob and without it out our gimp mana pool is usually inadequate.<br />
<br />
P.S. - I can buy an ebayed SK that is better equipped then yours, but that wouldn't make me a better SK!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have a relatively low mana pool (once had 305 int but switched stat focus) and low mana regen (ft4).  However, chain casting those two, with Mental Horror, generally keeps me FM at all times.  When the crap hits the fan I have almost a full mana bar to burn on taps; which is why personally I don't use Festering for aggro -- I do use it to snare though.<br />

I haven't had to try other spells to see if they generate more aggro, so basically I'm not messing with what is working perfectly now.</div></div><hr />

In reality if you open with CD+fear that will usually hold aggro for an entire fight if you have a good weapon, then if someone dose pull aggro taunt+CD+fear and you should be good.  If someone consistantly is pulling aggro (in my experience it's usually a rog with yak augs *yay*) lengthen the opening chain until they don't anymore CD+fear+CD+..., if you've got the bst slower situation where he's chaining slow just to get it to land then you may need to chain contiously until it lands. Per cast fear generates more hate than CD, I'd almost say twice as much. CD casts slightly faster and uses less mana.<br />
<br />
I only mem FD if I'm snaring mobs that run, I replace CD with it and only use it to snare, I don't use it in my aggro chain, it's a waste of mana that could be used for life taps (damage and mana being saved for the healer), even if you do have the mana regen to chain FD continously that's mana better spent elsewhere.<br />
<br />
I can tell you you didn't get a &quot;can't be used indoors&quot; message on fear unless it was a bug.  You will get the Immune message, it doesn't matter, if you don't get it the stop using fear you'll prob end up training yourself.  Also, for aggro purposes being snare immune doesn't matter either.  I have used terrors, they don't work real well I can remember having to chain them to hold aggro.  Don't usually us voice either, it's a fine spell but I don't have the spell slot for it or the buff slot for that matter much of the time, maybe after OoW comes out.  I have used fear+invoke fear in a continous chain before, it complete overkill and drinks mana almost as fast as a FD chain, but I haven't found anyone who can get aggro without taunt when I'm doing it.  And there's all my secrets for those that read my rant in another thread.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fair question.  I've often thought that people who play a cleric or buffing/support class as their main for a long time do tend to be a little more eccentric/defensive/quicker to react in anger/assholelish than others.  But let's review the situation here before deciding whether I reacted unreasonably in this case.<br />
<br />
I came here and made a nice, polite and respectful post about a fairly narrow issue of how to play the SK class.  I'm pretty sure I came to the right place, this board is generally acknowledged as the best source for such information.  Early on in this thread, someone mentioned that I could have done a better job using the search engine on this site to find this type of information, and after doing that, I agreed and said I would do a better job of looking around before just posting here in the future.<br />
<br />
But then some person with less than 80 aa on his main character referred to me as a retard and made other offensive remarks about my post.  After looking at that person's Magelo, it was clear to me that he was no more than a wannabee smack talking n00bi who wasn't even qualified to give advice on how to hunt at the KC inzone.  Based on his equipment and aa, he could not possibly be flagged to even enter the zones that I hunt in and was generally referring to for advice in my post.  Also, I never said I did not know what spells to use for agro, just that I would appreciate some testimonials about what spells and techniques work best for others in specific grouping situations with players who can generate huge agro (e.g., necros, shaman, berzerkers) but who are lazy about controlling it.<br />
<br />
When someone calls you a &quot;retard&quot;, do you consider that a personal attack?  I do.  And when someone thinks its fun and sport to publicly ridicule me in a highly insulting manner based on my flaws, they have invited me to do the same with them, and their shit better be squeaky clean or they probably won't end up enjoying the experience.<br />
<br />
Peace.</div></div><hr />

I know and have talked to people who don't have a character over level 40 that know more about Shadowknights than you do. I'll even give an example on this board; Keevel. Take a look at his magelo; he's a level 51(?) ShadowKnight with not exactly uber gear. He can't do some of the things you can do because of this. But I would be real life money, that if he had a character as well-equipped as yours is, he would be able to run fucking circles around you, and do things you couldn't even dream of pulling off. Anyone who knows the class would be able to, without having to come to this forum and ask us about agro. Jesus fuck.<br />
<br />
So fuck off, take your &quot;high-and-mighty&quot; shit elsewhere, because obviously not too many people on this board have a lot of respect for you. We don't want you here. No one wants you here. Go play in traffic. Maybe someone will mistake you for a useless animal and run your ass over. Or maybe they'll know who you are and do it anyway.</div></div><hr />

You pompous fucking sorry excuse for an SK.<br />
<br />
Let me refresh your memory:<br />
<br />
I tried using the level 15 fear, but get casting messages that (a) it doesn't work indoors (mostly where I play) and (b) my mob is too high a level for fear and is thus immune to it.<br />
<br />
Remember typing that? Yes, that was you. That was your level 65, UBER GEARED, KT flagged, USELESS fucking ass that posted that. <br />
<br />
30 seconds on search would have told you that 99.9999999% of SKs who have two braincells to rub together use Fear for agro. And the REASON it works is that the mobs ARE immune.<br />
<br />
However had it not been for the 80AA unflagged peons here, you'd have been turning down any exp groups indoors cause your dumb ass thought you had to be in outdoor zones for it to work.<br />

<br />
Grouping with players who can &quot;generate huge aggro&quot; is not a problem for a minimal competence SK in KT or Yxtta experience groups. Bleuwjob is working up to this level it seems, so these mundane tactics and basic skills that are known to the average 80-aa newb have apparently not made it onto the 'special' short bus reserved for shitty highend SK twinks.<br />
<br />
There is nothing very different or special about aggro in Kod'Taz, the mobs just get to the camp faster than earlier zones. With less time to solidify aggro, this just means that you want to hit the mobs with your aggro spell as soon as they come into range-- but a tank SK should do that normally anyhow.<br />
<br />
At range, Fear is the best choice to accumulate +Hate#, snares like CD and FD work as well but slow down pull/exp rates. Terror line spells are horrible at range for aggro, btw. Any combo of 2-3 casts of Fear/CD/FD results in enough aggro to trump other classes for the initial engage/slow part of a fight. Beyond that, 1-2 more CD casts after that add hate list padding againt heavy aggro DoTs/Necro Snares/etc...it isn't even needed most of the time.<br />
<br />
Melee/proc aggro are also part of what SKs can do to stay on top of the hate list. DD/Lifetap procs are low aggro relative to procs with a stun/debuff component.<br />
<br />
And if you want that last amount of extra hate still, go ahead and buff up VoT...but you shouldn't need it or its minor aggro addition.</div></div><hr />

Somehow I don't think so.  I can (and do) kill Emp Ssra, AHR, and Lord Seru with less than two groups.  I can kill AoW with 6 people, including only 2 clerics.  While I'm sure any of these older content mobs would still be a guild raid for you, you limit your argument to the simple fact that I came here asking for more information regarding one narrow issue.  Look at the bigger picture, son.  You have progressed to your current level of competence in EQ after spending the last few years reading this board for information on how to play an SK.  My lack of information regarding one narrow issue of one class in EQ pales in comparison to your overall lack of progress in this game.  It is you that sucks at EQ and as an SK my friend, not me, and there is no doubt I could beat your gimp ass into the ground on on either my cleric or SK.<br />
<br />
And simply stringing together a bunch of angry words to try and insult someone does not produce an effective flame, it merely shows you lack creativity and style, much like the EQ character shown in your Magelo.</div></div><hr />

Nah, my profile was authentic until the recent problems Magelo had regarding server names.  Last time I tried to update it, it listed me on the AB server, so I had to go in and change the server name and click &quot;update&quot;, which then replaced the &quot;authentic&quot; badge on my profile with a &quot;premium&quot; one.<br />
<br />
If you think I'm so far gone as to lie about my equipment, I invite you to log in a character on my server and would be happy to let you inspect me.  If you want to do that, please just post or message me and I will make arrangements to meet at your convenience.  In the meantime, I will again have an &quot;authentic&quot; profile when Magelo fixes automatic update.<br />

I've really enjoyed the Welcome Wagon here, and look forward to many future posts.  If you agree with me that this one has become fairly well played out, why not just join me and move on to other content.  On the other hand, if you prefer to just continue this thread, by all means feel free to do so.  I have plenty of time.<br />

Ok, but your basis for insulting me is pretty much limited to the fact I came here and asked a question because I didn't already possess one item of knowledge (regarding use of the fear spell for agro and my request to learn what other SKs use for an agro spell lineup).  Now tell me, where is a person going to pick up such information if they haven't been reading this board for the past year(s) or even month(s) or unless they have a friend who is an SK or often group or talk with other SKs?  The factoid you use as the singular basis for claiming I suck is not written anywhere else outside this board, is it?  I think I signed up for this board about 2 years ago and then never came back, and in fact just noticed it again on a class links section of another board.<br />
<br />
So along I come, over 4 years after creating my SK and playing him almost on a daily basis, and ask a simple fucking question and get my head torn off.<br />
<br />
So yeah, I admit I didn't possess the gem of knowledge you consider as fundamental to playing an SK, but that hardly means I suck as an SK and should just give it up and cut my losses now and delete my character.  If you look at my Magelo, you will see that I've done a lot of quests and things that would make it virtually impossible for me to be completely incompetent and worthless as a SK.  But if you are going to judge and insult me for not knowing ONE THING DESPITE my obvious success and play time on my SK, I think it is extremely fair for me to counter that you COMPLETELY and TOTALLY suck as an SK, and this fact is clearly proven by every single thing Magelo shows about your character, in whole and in any part.</div></div><hr />

No. You didn't.<br />
<br />
You asked a stupid question- stupid because there's no excuse for you not knowing it at your stage of the game and stupid because the question shouldn't even need to be posted since the answer is in Search about 50 times.<br />
<br />
If YOU want to use your Magelo as the reason why you are so much better than the poor little people who have to do a full raid to kill Vindi then you sure as fuck better expect that we're gonna hold you to what your Magelo states: that you are a very nicely geared KT flagged SK who should have fucking known better. Get it ?<br />
<br />
You didn't get your head torn off. People were actually pretty nice to you. Even when they told you that it was impossible for you to have gotten that Fear message you still insisted. Still, they did not flame. Usually telling people here that you know better than them is guaranteed to get you flamed to hell and back. <br />
<br />
If you want to use people's AAs and progression as a barometer of their worth in life then yea you're gonna be held to the same standards. See...the little gimp you look down on who needs a raid to kill Vindi...is exactly where he should be, doing what he's supposed to be doing. You on the other hand are so &quot;uber&quot; and yet you're here on the boards asking us how to keep agro.</div></div><hr />

Some of your comments may be fair, but regarding the above, I saw what I saw.  I looked at what I saw long and hard to make sure I was actually seeing what I thought I saw.  So within the next week or so, I will go back to the place where I now think I saw what I am pretty sure I saw at the time (Hard BB LDoN) and will either come back here and post a screen shot of this or not.  If I don't, I hereby admit in advance I was wrong and somehow hallucinated this very clear memory of mine.  I've been wrong before, and will be wrong again.  I do admit now that what I claimed regarding this issue is suspect even by me, because not a single other person has seen the same thing.<br />
<br />
But regarding the rest of your comments, this seems to be the least tolerant of all EQ class boards when it comes to lazy searching by a first time poster.  In reading more on this board, y'all seem to flame harder than anywhere (except the flame section of many server boards) when someone stumbles over here and asks a first time question they could have answered by spending more time reading the board or searching first.  I can appreciate this probably happens a lot and gets tiresome as hell, and maybe people should know better.  But why not be just a little bit nicer about this and cut some slack to a first time poster (as the person who initially responded to me here did)?  Why are we still talking about this on the 66th post of this thread?<br />
<br />
And Ashrai, I also admit I am a much better cleric than SK.  I never claimed otherwise.  I just came here to ask a question and started arguing with people who insulted me.  I have met very few people in EQ who play any class better than the class they grew up with and leveled first.  To me, its the same thing as learning English as your first language - even if you move to China and learn Mandarin, you will always still think and count in English.<br />

<br />
Much of the feel for playing a SK comes from fucking around and soloing, learning mob speeds and spell vs. aggro ranges...not to mention pathing and resets.<br />
<br />
Any idiot can take his 7k mana cleric, PL an SK and sneak past the learning curve, but it bites you in the ass when you are in KT and you can't hold aggro as a tank.</div></div><hr />

Hmmm, an SK who started as a Druid main thinks it funny that I'm a cleric with a SK and an enchanter alt?<br />

Look Ma, I can use Google too!<br />

Seriously Ash, a Wood Elf Druid main?  I bet your knowledge of SKs is second to none.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, my cleric is 9915 hp raid buffed atm, with about 8400 mana buffed.<br />
<br />
But thats besides the point.  If you were a more careful reader, you'd have read just a few posts up that I've been playing my SK over 4 years.  No gold star for you!  I made him about 6 months after my cleric, and leveled them at the same time.<br />
<br />
Next . . .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ashrai</div><div class="date">09-07-2004, 07:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bleuw you don't get it do you? All you are doing now is just reacting to everything. You're our new Newtank. Welcome to SK.org.<br />
<br />
Yep, old Druid main here. Difference between me and you (and the difference between you and everyone else in this thread with alts or old mains, or multiple mains) is that we're not coming to a class board for a twink's class, asking a stupid question, then getting upset when people tell you you're a retard.<br />
<br />
<br />
Most people have alts. And twinks. Your point? Since you completely missed what my point was: At no time have I ever gone to the class boards for any of my alts and asked a question and then when I'm told I'm wrong, attacked everyone in sight.<br />
<br />
You really need to work on your rebuttals, logic is usually an integral part of those.  <br />
<br />
And again, in case none of this sunk in the first ten times we told you: people were really really nice to you (for this place anyways) until you started attacking someone based solely on his # of AA and his Magelo- proving yourself to be a complete and utter waste of bandwidth.<br />
<br />
And no I didn't Google you. Your guild name was right there on EQRankings. Listed right next to your SK.<br />
<br />
As to my knowledge of playing an SK. My knowledge is what it is, based on 2 years of playing my SK. It's a little more than someone who's played for 1 year and it's less than someone who's played for 3. It's 2 years worth of knowledge, nothing more nothing less. Again, I'm not the one coming into SK.org and telling everyone they're wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Naelyan</div><div class="date">09-07-2004, 07:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Somehow I don't think so.  I can (and do) kill Emp Ssra, AHR, and Lord Seru with less than two groups.  I can kill AoW with 6 people, including only 2 clerics.  While I'm sure any of these older content mobs would still be a guild raid for you, you limit your argument to the simple fact that I came here asking for more information regarding one narrow issue.  Look at the bigger picture, son.  You have progressed to your current level of competence in EQ after spending the last few years reading this board for information on how to play an SK.  My lack of information regarding one narrow issue of one class in EQ pales in comparison to your overall lack of progress in this game.  It is you that sucks at EQ and as an SK my friend, not me, and there is no doubt I could beat your gimp ass into the ground on on either my cleric or SK.<br />
<br />
And simply stringing together a bunch of angry words to try and insult someone does not produce an effective flame, it merely shows you lack creativity and style, much like the EQ character shown in your Magelo.<br />
<br />
Congratulations, you can kill raid mobs that are multiple expansions old with a group of cutting edge (or close) players! Want a cookie? What you fail to realize, is that killing AoW with six people when you're geared like that isn't a challenge. Before you say it is, shut your mouth, because I've done it too. I didn't spend years of my EQ life on this board. I never knew there was a class board for shadowknights until I was level 65... I haven't even been here for a year. Damn near everything I know about my class has come from EXPERIENCE. If I wasn't sure how something worked, I tried it. On that note, don't you ever fucking say anything about my lack of progress in this game. While I may not be as far as you are, doesn't mean that I haven't experienced the majority of this game. I have grouped in and raided every zone up to Uqua as I write this. I don't have the gear to show for it; but I've been there, so don't try to belittle me because of my magelo.<br />
<br />
Then you try to say that I suck at EQ, after coming here to ask a fucking moronic question about THE MAIN FUNCTION OF THE GODDAM CLASS. You have better gear (by far) than I do, I can admit and accept that. That makes you able to do things that I can't do because of simple limitations. On the other hand, if you had a character as well geared as mine, I KNOW you could not do the things I can do. At level 62 I soloed Lodizal, in much shittier gear than I'm in right now. Two hours after I dinged level 60 (solo in PoI), I pulled the PoI Junk Beast to the zone in, single. You see my magelo, you'd think I'd be useless in a zone like Uqua, right? Just being dragged along in my guild? In Uqua, where it is very easy to die on 5-mob traps, somehow I can manage to pull one or two mobs off of healers, and keep them off healers, and stay alive long enough to get my job done. One or two mobs, when two rounds from either of them could kill me.<br />
<br />
Then you say that I shouldn't be pulling or tanking anything past Velks. Maybe I don't have the gear for it; yet somehow I can pull and tank in KT. I have pulled Ikkinz trials. I have tanked and pulled Vxed, and pulled Tipt. According to you, it's not possible, yet I've done it. So who is lacking in talent and skill, sir?<br />
<br />
I am not my magelo; my gear sucks, my AA count is horrible, yet I have done things and spent time doing things with my ShadowKnight you couldn't fathom, you PLed piece of shit. So why don't you stop wasting everyone's time here, and go find a rabid dog to play with. Maybe it will rip you open from scrotum to throat, and us here at SKO can have a little chuckle. You are a useless sack of shit, and a disgrace to this class. I hope you fucking burn in hell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Must have been great fun healing you as MT for Vexd.<br />
<br />
But congratulations Sir.  I have tanked both Tipt and Vxed several times, and can also single pull Tipt.  While two or three boxing.  And not once in my EQ career have I had a problem with agro except with Wiz's chaining White Fire and the type of thing I made this post to inquire about.  All you have demonstrated here is that you can chain together insults and profanity in run on sentences.<br />
<br />
And Ash, I think its great how you can click on the link for my guild name and get those posts to come up about me making a KEI bot.<br />
<br />
Why not stop the drama.  Stop posting responses and accusing me of &quot;just reacting to everything&quot; when that's all you are doing, and I will do the same.<br />

Good day.</div></div><hr />

But to really earn the &quot;new Newtank&quot; title, this guy is going to have to assert something much more idiotic...it's hard to touch pearls of wisdom like &quot;Regen = Mitigation&quot; or &quot;Spears are our best aggro&quot;...and of course the ultimate classic: &quot;AAs give more power than levels, so I'll stay L53 and just farm AA in Karnors&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Am I a NewHeal'r since I've been known to box a 56 cleric that isn't mine to flag, but not really know what I was doing other than knowing how to count to two and not dying when everyone else did on a 65ish raid (we can bring non-65 boxes if they are useful).<br />

I'd bet I could out-SK the original poster in comparable gear.  I'm just glad he told us that he can single pull when 3 boxing an SK, cleric and Chanter - that takes talent.<br />
