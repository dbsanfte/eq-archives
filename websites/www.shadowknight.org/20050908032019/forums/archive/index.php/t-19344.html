<br />
Just curious.  If it does (even a small amount) I will key it and add it into my button rotation.  When I am tanking sometimes I will rotate skill keys like, bash -&gt; disarm -&gt; etc. because I know they generate hate.  I know that they don't generate huge aggro or anything and doesn't have really any impact on the fight, but it makes me feel like I am doing something during some boring grinds.  So does Beg generate a small amount of hate like Disarm does, or is it truly useless?</div></div><hr />

Could use it when attack isn't on, like when mez breaking but if you're not having any problems in that dept then it's up to you if you want to use a hotkey up for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stugein</div><div class="date">01-08-2004, 01:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Can't be used while attacking?  There goes that idea.  Ok.  Thanks for the heads up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Groff Gorespiller</div><div class="date">01-08-2004, 02:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We've talked about this before here, a while back.  If you want to add /beg to your taunt macro lineup, simply do the following:<br />
<br />
/attack off<br />
/doability (beg)<br />
/doability (disarm)<br />
/attack on<br />
/doability (taunt)<br />
<br />
<br />
That should give you enough time after attack off to get the beg out while keeping attack on for the most part...<br />
<br />
Just replace the parenthesied functions with their corresponding ability keys, or use the /alt activate commands if there is one for those abilities (never looked).</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is, without a doubt, the worst ability I have ever seen for gains.<br />
<br />
Spammed for hrs, doing it in combat, same bloody difference.<br />
<br />
Sheesh.<br />
<br />
If I weren't doing it for symmetry, I'd have given up ages ago:P<br />

Interestingly, its the same code as the rogue's pickpocket skill, course it does jack for us. I only got it to 200 so I could beg weapons back from my pet, too bad I've never had a success at that either:(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oberyn</div><div class="date">02-05-2004, 08:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">...maxed finally.  about 48 hrs time begging (only) to go from 129 to 200.  I didn't keep track prior to that, and a bunch of the gains were from when I had it hotkeyed.  <br />
<br />
Really nasty skill to raise.   Stinking tailoring is the only one I hated worse.<br />

Tailoring is the devil.<br />

That said, I haven't gotten 1 cp via begging yet; although way back in 1999 with earlier characters I did manage to beg some coin off of npc's (along with aggro'ing em).<br />
<br />
One thing to consider regarding the use of macros to turn attack off and on, is that if you parse your logs it can really skew dps numbers (you might get insanely high dps or rediculously low dps) because every time you turn attack on and off, many parsers consider it to be a 'different fight/mob'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Uwildi</div><div class="date">02-20-2004, 07:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Originally posted by Groff Gorespiller <br />
...<br />
/attack off<br />
/doability (beg)<br />
/doability (disarm)<br />
/attack on<br />
/doability (taunt)<br />
... <br />
<br />
I would however put taunt first followed by the rest for that added boost after a successful taunt. With that setup, on success you would wipe any gains you got from begging and disarming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Groff Gorespiller</div><div class="date">02-20-2004, 09:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, yes, you're right.<br />
<br />
Probably the best line up would be<br />
<br />
/taunt<br />
/attack off<br />
/disarm<br />
/beg<br />
/attack on<br />
<br />
That way, when you turn attack off, you have the extra second it takes to use the disarm skill before you try to beg, to prevent any screwups with timing (since you don't have enough macro lines for a pause in between attack off and beg).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Luxem</div><div class="date">02-23-2004, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">close, just change the order a little bit, and you wont have to wait on timing on anything... this is my post on similar subject from last week (not sure how to quote across threads yet... sorry -shrug-)<br />
&quot;I use the taunt, but made a macro, which works nice to make it a one button taunt &quot;fail defeat&quot; button (hate failed taunts)... goes like this<br />
<br />
/taunt<br />
/attack off<br />
/beg<br />
/attack on<br />
/disarm<br />
<br />
make a hotkey, name it taunt or mob PO'ed or whatever, works better than taunt and I like it.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Groff Gorespiller</div><div class="date">02-23-2004, 01:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And you don't get ability failure messages (&quot;You cannot perform this ability at this time...&quot;) when that particular line up goes off?  Admittedly, I've not experimented with macro lineups different than what I posted, but I've noticed in the past that occasionally the script processes before the abilities do, in which case you sometimes have to add a pause in order to let the specific &quot;doability XX&quot; command process in full before the macro moves on to the next line.  Because of the way that in game macros work, there isn't always sufficient time between the execution of one line and the next to fully execute the specific command, which will get you a failed message.<br />
<br />
Most notably, if I use my taunt macro, then cast CD, I have to wait a few seconds after the taunt goes off (possibly because of clientside lag) in order to not have the spell cast interupt the disarm.  Because of the way the taunt ability processes, there's a  built in pause while the taunt check is performed which delays the actual execution of the disarm ability, even though the macro cycles through the commands almost immediately.<br />
<br />
/shrug<br />
<br />
I suppose it's really just habit, but I've always put the most restricted ability the deepest into a macro so that I don't have anything stepping on that process.  Which is why there's a significant pause between acquiring PC target and acquiring assist target off of PC target when I run my Non-Tanking Assist macro.  I was finding that /tar Player_01 wouldn't actually process fast enough to pick up the designated player before /assist tried to assist off of him.  Add in a pause (mine is around 3) and I get a clean assist every time.  Pause another 5 seconds before giving the /pet attack command for insurance that the pet won't go to the wrong mob and it works great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Luxem</div><div class="date">02-23-2004, 04:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Im no macro expert Groff, I get no time issues with my setup, possibly there could be a time delay in the attack on and attack off commands... maybe??? Hell, i dunno, I know it works because I get my failed begging attempt and disarm failed spam.<br />
     I definately see what you mean though about actions interrupting spells, but as of yet I havent had any interrupted with my macro, I really didnt even think about that when i made my macro, but maybe I just got lucky (actually, I probably did get lucky LOL).<br />
    I dont have an assist player 01 macro, although that is a damn good idea. (sick of having to change my /assist whoeverthehellitis 's name every time I change a group). Also like that pet assist thrown in there...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Groff Gorespiller</div><div class="date">02-23-2004, 04:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your &quot;/assist whateverthehellhisnameis&quot; macro is exactly the same as my &quot;/assist player_01&quot; macro.  I have to change the /tar name each time I work with someone new.  I just chose to say player_01 instead of &quot;whateverthehellhisnameis&quot; because I'm lazy.<br />
<br />
:)<br />
<br />
And pet attack can get you in trouble if you aren't used to it.  Just a warning.</div></div><hr />
