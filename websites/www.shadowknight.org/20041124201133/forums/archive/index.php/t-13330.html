<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kalendrox Grimblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm sure there are 100 threads about fear in this forum, but cause im too lazy to search and bump one, heres a fresh start.<br />
<br />
I can understand Invoke fear not working on mobs over level 55.  I'm not complaining about it.  But where is the class balance that SoE preaches?  Chanters, Druids, Mages, Rangers, Shamen, Necromancers, Wizards, all making 1 AA point in 20 minutes, compared to the Melee/hybrid classes who sit /lfg for an hour, get a group, and get 1 AA point in about 1.5-2 hours in a decent group.  Wheres the balance in that?  Are melee AA skills so overpowering that it warrents us gaining AA points at 1/6 the rate of other classes?<br />
<br />
How to fix it:<br />
<br />
Find a way to give other classes soloing options in PoP (Tier 2+), for when they dont want to or can't group.  For example: Give shadowknights and paladins undead fear spells that can affect mobs up to level 60.<br />
Nerf solo exp in pop, or nerf exp overall, but give a larger bonus to groups in pop.<br />
Make all Tier 2+ PoP mobs summon.<br />
<br />
Maybe this thread isn't as constructive as it could be, but this is something that, in my honest opnion, really needs to be fixed.  Besides, I had to do something to kill the time while im sitting here /lfg~</div></div><hr />

<br />
and yes, we can solo in pop.. it isn't as fast as dr00ds and wizards, etc. but if your LFG and feel like getting some xp, it's efficient if you know what your doing<br />
<br />
<br />
HOH - POS = perfectly viable solo options</div></div><hr />

Just in case you didn't noticed, they allready nerfed soloing. <br />
<br />
Chanters hardly make 1point of AA in 20 due to the CoD pet doing the most damage and sucking up xp.<br />
<br />
All those kiting classes in HoH are nerfed like hell due to the random summoning. And trust me, you can NOT tell when they are gonna summon.<br />
<br />
I would suggest waking up before you get everybody, including SK's, nerfed in soloing.<br />
<br />
Not only you want to nerf kiting cause your to lazy for it, you want to make grouping less enjoyable and xp suckier just so other ppl cant earn more xp then you ?<br />
<br />
I am sorry, but i do not like your idea's at all, i am happy as it is.</div></div><hr />
