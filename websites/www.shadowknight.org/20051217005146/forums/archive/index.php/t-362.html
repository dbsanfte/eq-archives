<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cakasiz</div><div class="date">04-02-2002, 04:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, my first questions, here goes.<br />
<br />
Situation:<br />
I'm lvl 16 and have both Despair and Scream of Hate.  Despair is an atk debuff (5), and scream of hate is an atk tap (8).  <br />
<br />
Questions:<br />
1) Do these spells stack for a total atk debuff on the mob of 13?   I don't get a message saying that 'that spell will not take hold' when casting, so I'm assuming that they do stack, but I'm not sure.<br />
<br />
2) I usually use both of these spells, as well as my str tap and it seems to make a difference.  Is it just my imagination?  I'm just not sure what the total dps change is from an atk debuff of 13, and a str debuff of 10.<br />
<br />
3) Ideally, I'd like a way to figure out a way to summarize the total effect of my increase in dps, and the mobs decrease in dps that result from these spells.<br />
<br />
My limited empirical results seem to show that I die less when using these spells :)  but it's hard to tell sometimes how much of an effect a spell actually has, and whether the mana is worth it. :confused: <br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
Btw, I love it when sk's my level (usually very twinked) ask me &quot;what spell wuz that dude? how did u get it man?&quot; <br />
<br />
It was a mad dash, naked and sowed through LIO, FM, DL to wizard spires.  Buy spells, beam back, and make the run again.  I'm proud to say I made it there and back without dying :cool:</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd suggest just casting them on some low level mobs to test. If you get the &quot;spell would not have taken hold&quot; message, they don't stack. If you do run into stacking problems, try casting them in reverse order, some of those spells are funny that way.</div></div><hr />
