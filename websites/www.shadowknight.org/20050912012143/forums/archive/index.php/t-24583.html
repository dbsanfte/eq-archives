<br />
On some attempts, but not all, we are having issues with the Named on the 2nd wave ending up in camp, and disrupting our rhythum in the event...and as anyone who has done the event knows....timing and rhythum very important...<br />
<br />
We had thought it might have been just poor pulling on some trys....or social aggro from one of the 1st wave mobs being pulled to camp....but last night we were comlpetely done with 1st wave for like 20 secs before 2nd wave and named spawned....with no one other than puller inside compound...2nd wave spawned and Named went straight for camp ignoring puller....<br />
<br />
wondering if it might actually be a camp placement issue?<br />
<br />
We are setting up in the SE corner of the zone, where the compound wall to the norht and the zone wall to east and south make a good ae kill spot....and is also convenient for puller to grab trash and pull over wall to raid camp...<br />
<br />
I have seen a link to the Veneration x strategy...which has camp on the middle of the north wall, directly north of compound gates ( i presume bewteen the rock and the column, which make a bit of a cul-de-sac)...<br />
<br />
Is our position in the SE corner causing us extra difficulty with pulling out the named in the first 3 waves of trash? are we better off moving to a spot like the Ven-x Camp?<br />
<br />
Anyone had similar issues? Anyone have a suggestion and rationale for a different camp site?<br />
<br />
thanks in advance...<br />

We tried south and north of gate (on south and north wall respectively of course), north somehow worked better for some reason.<br />
<br />
We just took him out a few weeks ago and got him once again since, handling the nameds is key and root is your friend. They corpsecamp too, if you can manage to pull them with noone aggroing them but the puller, but root is at least easier to pull off with the limited amount of time available. I should hope you know this already, just making sure.<br />
<br />
To answer your question: I'd advice moving the raidcamp so you minimize risks of named aggro off the bat. Have your contingency plans ready.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ranger ranger pally pally shammy druid<br />
<br />
<br />
1 good group can handle all three named, but two groups reccomended.<br />
<br />
will usually have a bard snagging named at spawn of each wave and bring it to the CC group.</div></div><hr />

My last guild did at least.  Current guild far past those days.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We had used root also on mobs when pulled...but as explained had named charging the camp on spawn...before we could target and either pull or get root in...<br />
<br />
as this didn't happen on every attempt....was asking about camp placement...<br />
<br />
in the end we got a run where the named got pulled and fd corpsecamped or rootparked...none charged camp and we downed the big lobster...pretty smooth and straightforward....<br />
<br />
however...if i were advising another guild on attempt though would probably push them towards a more traditional camp location just in case....back towards the middle, north or south of the entrance to the compound...<br />

Knight 'catches' the named's aggro as its coming to the raid, giving time for a bard to throw its ass back to spawn. Our guild insisted on trying to root at first and that led to many, many deaths. Controling the situation ( ie who has aggro on the named ) is safer and easier to maintain IMO.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Roots a viable solution - but you gotta use wizards primarly and rangers as backup.  DON ranger snare is also good in an emergency.  Knight root does NOT work well.</div></div><hr />
