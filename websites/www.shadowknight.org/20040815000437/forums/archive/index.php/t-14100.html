<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Warspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Three days</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shurlock</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks for the response.      <br />
<br />
But, luckily I happened to be in Great Divide tonight, 24 hours after another guild had despawned the sentry, and he was up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Elkar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Two facts I know:<br />
<br />
7th Server crashed 10am Saturday, he popped around 7pm Sunday.<br />
<br />
Ring war was done Thursday night, he was not up Friday night, was up Saturday morning before crash.<br />
<br />
Thinking he is &gt;24hrs but &lt;3 days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Paradox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That sig is freaking huge, please check the guidelines on sig sizes.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />

Yea, that was weird.  I never heard of Badain respawning that quickly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jorx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've seen a few times where after a Ring War (one that is won) that the zone needs to be reset.  <br />
<br />
After the war, when the mobs (Tizmaks etc) all respawn, they would suicide themselves.. all running to Thurg.  Was funny as hell.<br />
<br />
GM would have to come reset the zone to correct it, had it happen a few times after we have won ring wars.  By resetting the zone it puts Badain back to the 24 hours or less after server up.<br />
