<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Saveaux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm at work so don't remember what exactly it [The Disc Menu]says but I know it says something about cost, duration, and a few other things. What is the cost that they are speaking of? I obviously know what the duration indicates but what about the other ones? Is there any way to find out how much time untill its reuse? <br />
<br />
thx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>belize</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">cost = amount of stamina burned when initiating the /disc<br />
upkeep=cost per tick of disc running.<br />
<br />
<br />
for example let make up a disc. lets say  is is a cost of 25 and upkeep of 5, runs 5 ticks long(30 seconds)<br />
<br />
this would be 25+(5x5)=50 total stamina spent on the disc.<br />
rangers trueshot works like this, i know, and i think our leechcurse works this way.<br />
<br />
for SK's its not an issue. i've burned leechcurse followed by unholyaura and had no sta bar issues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Actually, I've burned Unholy Aura, Leechcurse and Resistant all in the same fight and not drained my total Endurance bar.  At one point, when I had Resistant up and nothing else, the bar seemed to actually be regening faster than the upkeep cost, but that could have just been an illusion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Atrocity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">How are you guys using more than one /disc per fight?  When I use /disc unholy and harm touch, then later I'll try to use /disc leechcurse and I get a message that I am already using a discipline.  I haven't been able to figure out how to use more than one disc at a time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Saveaux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for the info, do you also know how to find out the reuse time? With the old disc I could type in /disc and it would tell me how much longer until I could use the disc again. Is there an command to do this still?</div></div><hr />

If you bring up your combat skills UI, you will see a &quot;Buff&quot; for unholy, you can simply click it off once you use your HT, and then use Leech.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Thakalas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The only thing I've found so far is trying to use the discipline will give the re-use time.  Which makes sense, since it's not just the /disc timer anymore.  If you worry (like I did) about having the bad timing to click it just as it refreshes and waste one, remember discs are now partially spells.  So if you sit, it won't cast.  <br />
<br />
Workarounds are fun :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>cames</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I am clueless by what is meant by a Combat UI.  I have not figured out how to cancel an active discipline.  If by Combat UI you mean Alt-C, I am still not clear on how to clear an active discipline.<br />
<br />
Generally this means I Leechcurse, then Unholy Aura.<br />
<br />
Flame at will guys, but could somebody explain what is meant.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Click the icon in the Alt+C box and poof.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>cames</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have moved these discs out of the ALT-C box.  Anybody know if it works there?  If not, I will try it during my next HT.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Thunderbumm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I suspect they can only be cancelled from the combat discs/abilities window.<br />
<br />
The display has a particular &quot;EQ Type&quot; in the XML code, and that particular window (XML file) is expected to have that piece.<br />
<br />
Buttons cannot be moved to other windows (inventory boxes are not buttons).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>cames</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Okay I figured it out and I am a moron.  I should flame me. :)<br />
<br />
Anyway for those others that are afraid to say how clueless they are...<br />
<br />
When you activate a discipline, it starts a timer and brings up a &quot;buff&quot; symbol on your Alt-C screen.  This symbol shows up nowhere else that I am aware of.  If you click the &quot;buff&quot; symbol while the timer is active, the discipline is turned off.<br />
<br />
So, why is this important?  For those who do not yet have disciplines, they have made Unholy Aura a 5 minute discipline.  This means from the time you click it, for the next 5 minutes an HT is impacted by Unholy Aura.  Now, in many fights that are going badly not only will you HT, but you will Leechcurse as well.  Well, most fights like that will not last 5 minutes so one would really like to &quot;clear&quot; Unholy Aura so that one can click Leechcurse (you can't have 2 disciplines active at the same time).<br />
<br />
Thanks to those who answered me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I think warrriors are the only class that can run their endurance into the ground (and rather easily at that). Of course that involves using incite as a MT at least once a mob (figure once a minute). Toss in any disaplines after that and you are likely to be at 8-10% for a goodly amount of time.</div></div><hr />

Tried this out a few nights ago and it worked like a charm, thanks!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Saveaux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Go to the library in pok. Go in on the sk spell vendor side. As soon as u enter the library on that side there are some NPC selling class specific tomes. Buy these. they are like 2pp total each. There are 4 for sk. After u buy these take them to your sk GM. Theres one on the south side of pok. Give the GM the tomes. You now have disciplines. Press alt-c to activate the disc menu. <br />
lvl51 -- Resistant = 10min(?) 10 to all resists<br />
lvl55 -- Unholy Aura = Use search.<br />
lvl5_(?) -- Fearless = 10sec(?) Invulnerabilty to fear spells. I've never used so I don't even know what lvl its at.<br />
lvl60 -- Leechcurse = use search</div></div><hr />

<br />
Could someone explain me how to macro our disc now ? I mean how do i create a macro like I had :<br />
/disc unholy<br />
/Flex<br />
/Alt activate 86<br />
<br />
What does it looks like now ? Having to click on ALT C + Super HT plain sux. Same if I make a button for the disc and another for SHT...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">As far as I know, you don't have to change your macros. /disc defensive still works for me (as a warrior).<br />
<br />
Heck I need to get some macro's made to call that stuff out.</div></div><hr />
