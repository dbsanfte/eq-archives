<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>artyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well I made my gnome SK as a joke at first, a friend mentioned making a gnome sk and dying her armor all pink, but ive come to really like the class. The int is great, but the lack of str is quite upsetting. Im not thinking about high end uber buffs, this would be a pk twink mainly, so id want to rely on my own gear/taps/etc for stats. her magelo is here:<br />
gumdraup (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=709559) <br />
<br />
now if im actually going to be levelling this char to pvp with, and i wont be in raid buffs all the time, stats WILL matter in pvp. as you can see even with twink gear her str is really hurting. against an ogre/sk with 200ish str ill be getting outhit quite a bit.<br />
<br />
i redid my gear on a troll/ogre, was was plesantly surprised:<br />
<br />
Ogre (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=714892) <br />
Troll (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=714883)<br />
<br />
edit: and yes i know the ogres agi is below 75, i didnt take the time to fix starting stats/gear to get it to at least 75. <br />
<br />
the ogre has its slam ability and no front stun, which would rock on a pvp server, whereas the extra troll regen with the fungi would be great. Plus they both have amazing str/sta, and still OK iint.<br />
<br />
My main question is, obviously the gnome's str is lacking, should i stop now and just go to ogre/sk, or stick with the gnome? shes fun, sure, but its not real practical pvp-wise without being buffed all the time i think. I read the class discussion and im not convinced. im leaning towards ogre/troll, good str/sta, and 80ish int, makes for some deadly pvp imo.<br />
<br />
any opinions?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you really think STR is that important of a stat?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>artyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i made the thread on tz after the sk's decided if they dont talk to me maybe ill reroll :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>kassdax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">On a couple other message boards I visit several people over the past have posted their views on what strength does for damage output.<br />
<br />
Pretty much the general consesus is that strength doesn't really do that much. Yes it does make a difference but a few parses have shown that a difference in strength of 100 points made about a 2% difference in damage output on mobs such as Vindi when two similarly equipped melee's were beating the stuffings out of him.<br />
<br />
Personally I haven't tested stuff like this myself but do tend to listen to certain people that have fed me verifiable information in the past. Hope this helps but as always, take what you read on the net with a grain of salt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>artyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">/nod, thanks. i decided to go with gnome a while ago anyways, because more int = more betterness. i mean heck run out of mana and we are just deathtouching warriors =/</div></div><hr />

Haven't had any troubles really being a gnome, I solo just fine and nobody has given me any crap about being inferior.  Then again I prefer not to socialize with idiots ;)</div></div><hr />
