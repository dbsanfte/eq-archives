<br />
It could be complete coincidence, but the other day while exping in the Tower of Sol Ro I was having some trouble performing a successful TAUNT on the Soldiers there when breaking a mezz.  This wasn't a big problem, however, because I was able to obtain aggro by simply casting CD on them a few times (they are immune to the spell but the aggro is still generated, and it casting it on them didn't break the mezz).  I did discover something curious that I want to explore further.<br />
<br />
I found that if I sat down next to the mezzed mob first, THEN used my taunt skill, I seemed to have a 100% success rate.<br />
<br />
Is it possible that since I was next to them sitting, my proximity aggro jumped me so high up on their aggro list that landing a successful taunt was easier?<br />
<br />
Was I just lucky?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Same appears to work when taunting mobs off people who've been offtanking for a while.  Taunt-and-hit on its own often doesn't help, but successful taunt followed by a good aggro spell works every time.<br />
<br />
Not sure why this is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not sure why this is.  <br />
Because of the way taunt works.   A successful taunt is (current_highest_aggro)+1.<br />
<br />
If you taunt successfully and attack, your aggro would be (former_highest_aggro)+1+(melee_round).<br />
<br />
If you were to replace melee_round with a high aggro spell, like fear or CD, your total aggro would be substantially higher than if you just taunted and attacked.<br />
<br />
Example 1:<br />
Paladin offtanks mob, builds 3000 hate<br />
SK taunts successfully, now has 3001 hate<br />
Paladin swings a round of melee, has 3100 hate<br />
SK swings a round of melee, has 3101 hate<br />
Result:  aggro ping-pong<br />
<br />
Example 2:<br />
Paladin offtanks mob, builds 3000 hate<br />
SK taunts successfully, now has 3001 hate<br />
Paladin swings a round of melee, has 3100 hate<br />
SK casts fear, has 3500 hate<br />
Result:  solid aggro lead<br />
<br />
Numbers are of course hypothetical, but do you see the point?</div></div><hr />
