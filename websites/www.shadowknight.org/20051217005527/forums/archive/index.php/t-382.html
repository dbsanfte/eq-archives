<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">trun</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 09:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Go down the middle hall from entrace, when you hit the wall, turn left, take first right. You should be in a hall with 8 snakes. There's a hidden wall on the left. That's rhag 1 spawn spot. He's probably the easiest source of good sol 60 spells.<br />
<br />
Pretty sure rhag 1 is zhezum. All of rhag 2's and arch lich's guards are rhags as well, so don't rely on just knowing that rhags are up, look for zhezum specifically.</div></div><hr />

He's reasonably easy which is why everyone goes after him. And he's also the only source for remove greater curse scrolls which is a must have for anyone doing sol encounters.</div></div><hr />
