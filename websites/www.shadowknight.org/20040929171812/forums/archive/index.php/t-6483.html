<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>chumley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Based on what I have read on this forum I have narrowed down the races I wanna be to Gnome or DE I would enjoy any input you have.<br />
<br />
Thanks in Advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lizarde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Which would you prefer to play?  Which do you think would be more fun?<br />
<br />
Answer that, and you'll know which race to choose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Maniacles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">And the answer is.....<br />
<br />
be a gnome...if you are going to pick a class as rare as sk, might as well pick a race thats rare in an sk, rather than the most common.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Razaduuul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">maybe gnomes are rare because they're so damn ugly, but since that doesn't make fear last longer, I say go DE.<br />
<br />
Being small isn't fun, being large isn't either, I think human/elf sizes are the best, fit most places, but don't have to jump up stairs.</div></div><hr />
