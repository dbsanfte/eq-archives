<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Peztilence Forever</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Are lovely  :D <br />
<br />
 But does anyone have a list of what loot drops from chests on SK epic 1.5 please?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Darkenesis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Wow... gassy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Daywalka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Items are shared between chests. With that being said, look on Allakhazam.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Some of the chest items are rediculous for the effort.<br />
<br />
Elemental and beyond level gear dropping from MUCH easier mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Elhrairah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The chests only occur on flagged encounters (ie ones where u have to be at that step to trigger the event) when a flagged player loots that piece; they arent reproducable and our epic only has 2 such fights. Also your not guranteed a chest either. If you think they should lower the quality of gear dropping from chests, you dont really grasp how rare it is and how much it takes to get to each encounter. They are just a nice incentive so that others helping you with your epic may  benefit from it.<br />
<br />
For some it would be hard to amass the 4 groups needed to kill Falmont etc, without at least some chance of droppable loot, and with the mechanics of the chests themselves preventing any farming why not make the gear a little-overpowered for the difficulty of the mob. It represents more than just a fight; its the result of doing a long and drawn out quest.<br />
<br />
just my 2cp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well... I guess it peeves me a bit to see bazaarable elemental level gear.  True, it's not farmable, and that makes it easier to accept.  And chests are pretty damn common now that thye've tweaked things a bit.  First few weeks of oow we got 1 in dozens of epic fights, now they seem to drop almost every time.<br />
<br />
Just the other day I saw some 50 ac, 135 hp attuenable plate boots with FT3 on them.... basically equivalent to kngiht elemental boots, swap manapres for flowing thought.  This was off of a pretty easy druid fight in the ruined city, I believe.<br />
<br />
While some of hte fights are at least as difficult as many elemental fights, some are also incredibly easy, and I don't think the risk is high enough for the reward in some cases.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">WTB those boots in bazaar pls, damn.<br />
<br />
-Bolas</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If those are the boots I'm thinking of, they're actually 50 AC, 135 HP, 30 Attack, FT2, three 15+ resists and some other solid stats.  I got a pair off of the mage fight in Noble's Causeway with all the air elementals.  They're green when equipped, which is kind of lame, but quite bit better than the ornate boots I used to have, so I'll suffer.  Wish I could remember what they're called, but the name escapes me at the moment.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thanks, couldn't remember the name, but that's definitely them.  Now I can put them on my Magelo (thanks one working computer &gt;.&lt;).<br />
<br />
On another note, people seem to covet them highly despite the name.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">That's them.  10 less hp, FT instead of manapres.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Green?  Screw that, I'll hold out for EP boots.<br />
<br />
-Bolas</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I know not all mobs spawn chests while doing the epics. Do we know which of our encounters specifically spawn the chests?<br />
<br />
The Breeder for example has only been done twice on my server that I know of. And its a royal pain to get people to come down there to help.<br />
<br />
Does he spawn a chest, if so thats incentive to drag others along. If all he drops is the egg its kind of dissapointing for those other 12 people you convinced to come with you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sarrasis Darkmist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">No, you don't get a chest for killing the breeder.  Falmont is the only chest spawning mob for the sk epic.  Some classes have several chest spawning mobs, however.  Druids, for example, get a chest for the Natimbi, RCoD and Kithicor battles.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Breeder is just a normal mob, rare spawn, that happens to drop an SK epic piece.<br />
<br />
There's other nameds that are pullable from the breeder camp that can drop runes and other items however.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">What about the epic 2 mob in CoM?  It spawning chests now?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Temet Nosce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Kilidna does not spawn a chest.</div></div><hr />
