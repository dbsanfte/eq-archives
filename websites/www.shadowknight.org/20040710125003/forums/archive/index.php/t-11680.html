Just wanted to give a heads up that voice of death may be causing SKs to be #1 on the hate list after they cast on MT.  On Sunday night we were fighting Sontalak and I made sure the MT had Voice on before we engaged.  As soon as I got into Sonts agro raidius I was immeadiatly summoned and killed.  I did not have a chance to hit auto attack, cast a spell, or get low-hp agro.  At that point I wasnt sure what the deal was so I just patiently awaited my rez and went about my business.  Then last night we were fight TiV and once again I cast Voice on the MT to help keep agro.  He engaged and then a second later assist was called.  Once again the second I got within agro range I was summoned and killed by TiV.  And once again without attacking, casting, or having low HP...<br />
<br />
I've sent a bug report to Verant and am hoping they can fix it soon.  In the mean time I would suggest not using this spell on anyone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
(and yes the MT was targeted, not the mob)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Soulstar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">are you guys casting this before or after the mob has been engaged?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Flanders</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Before, on both times</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>PingGuy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Maybe it's only on boss type mobs, I've had no problems using it in Howling Stones.  I cast it on a 61 Warrior a lot and I can't steal aggro from her until I drop a Dooming Darkness and a debuff or two on the mob.  This is with me using a TTCP and her using both her epics and I still can't hold the aggro for very long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Flanders</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Voice of Death is a level 55 spell, your level 52.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>PingGuy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The Voice line is all based on the same code, the only difference is the percentage modifier for each level of the spell.  It's possible that there is a specific problem with VoD but generally it would affect the whole spell line.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Derith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Encvhanter friend cast agro buff on main tank pre Sont fight and got instant agro upon coming into range. Spells appear to be broken at this time<br />

Wyld 65 chanter<br />
Nokturn 56 Ogre SK</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Drynnious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Cool. Try casting it on yourself, or cast it one the SA before the fight, then you cant tank to your hearts content! Maybe it's the new way(not intended) to keep agro?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Venae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I used Voice of Shadows on the MT both when we did Vorash/Xenovorash and when we did the Dark Animyst guy for the beastlord epic just this past Saturday.  Didn't get summoned, and didn't even get aggro at all until Xeno killed her and I intentionally grabbed it.  <br />
<br />
Of course, both times I cast it just before the mob was spawned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Azaryl LVeldrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Havent noticed any problems with Voice of Terris.  We took out Brynju Thunderclap last night and I had no problems with agro on me at all.  Our MT did fine...<br />

In darkness,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jabbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I've cast the various voice spells through all of NToV, boss encounters in PoP, epic fights, etc and have never had this problem.  I've cast it as we engaged, during engagement, way before engagement, all of that... never had anything ever take a shot at me or summon me.<br />
<br />
I honestly couldn't tell ya what's going wrong with you. :(</div></div><hr />
