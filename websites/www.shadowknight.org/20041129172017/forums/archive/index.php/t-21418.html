<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>8full</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Little is known about the EQ 2 sk yet. But first little bits of info got posted on the new updated eq2 website.<br />
<br />
As you know EQ 2 class system is a class tree where to become a a shadowknight you'll have to start as a fighter, then become a crusaders and then a shadowknight.<br />
<br />
So here's what we know of the progression, skill and spells...<br />
<br />
Fighter Archtype:<br />
Fighters use brute strenght and sturdy weapons to deal physical damage to their ennemies. Always at the forefront of combat, fighters stand toe-to-toe with opponents while keeping their allies from harm. No matter the risk, fighters never back down from a challenge.<br />
<br />
Primary attribute: Strenght<br />
Armor: Light<br />
Weapons: All<br />
Key Knowledge: Martial, Weapon Knowledge<br />
<br />
Crusaders:<br />
Crusaders are armored juggernauts that call upon divine powers to aid them in battle. Capable of dealing impressive physical damage, crusaders can wield a variety of weapons and shields.<br />
<br />
Primary attribute: Strenght<br />
Armor: Medium<br />
Weapons: Axes, Swords, Polearms, Flail, Hammers, Mace, Staff and more.<br />
Key Knowledges: Faith, Zeal, Weapon Knowledge<br />
<br />
Crusader spells:<br />
Bastion of Allegience: Spell that grants protection versus physical attacks to a party member. Use: Buff<br />
<br />
Cry of Conviction: Spell that channels damage to all oponents in an area around the crusader. Use: Damage<br />
<br />
Manifestation of Faith: Spell that wards against damage for a short period of time on a pary member. This ward cost the Crusader Health in addition to Power. Use: Damage<br />
<br />
Shadowknight:<br />
Shadowknights are insidious dark crusaders who use the power of evil to advance their cause. They live to inflict fear, hate and despair upon all who cross their path.<br />
<br />
Primary Attribute: Strenght<br />
Armor: Heavym Vanguard<br />
Weapons: Axes, Swords, Polearms, Flails, Hammer, Mace, Staff and more<br />
Key Knowledges: Determined Zeal, Sphere of Influence, Weapon Knowledge<br />
<br />
Spells:<br />
Shadowy Illusion: Spell that instantly transport the party out of a dangerous situation into a safe area. Use: Utility<br />
<br />
Malevolent Soldier: Spell that summon forth a skeletal warrior that battles the shadownight's opponent. Use: Damage<br />
<br />
Paragon of Malevolence: Spell that grants a deathly form to the shadowknight. This form imbues the Shadowknight with enehanced destructive capabilities and additional protection. Use: Combat buff<br />
<br />
After reading that, it's becomming more apparent that EQ 2 isn't EQ Live as the SK seems to have little in common with the EQ Live version.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>spanky4458</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It sounds interesting.  The deadly form spell sounds cool, i hope the form changes as you gain levels.  Not sure what to think about a group evac spell, were supposed to be badasses, not good at running away, but on the other hand it wont hurt group desirablity.  Im definitly going to give it a shot though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Blackstone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">All you need to know is that you won't be able to wear plate.<br />
<br />
Warriors --&gt; Guardians.<br />
<br />
Guardians can wear heavy armor, including &quot;Vanguard&quot; and Plate.<br />
<br />
Crusaders --&gt; Pal/SK<br />
<br />
Pal/SK can wear heavy armor (medium to start), including &quot;Vanguard&quot;<br />
<br />
So erase from your minds being tanks at high lvls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Elkar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Did they really mis-spell Strength everwhere on the site?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Harok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I just hope that we have a defined role in the game this time.  I don't want SKs to be the red headed stepchildren of EQ2 like they have been for EQ1.  I'll wait for it to come out before passing judgement.  There is at least one potential pointer to SKs being catered to though.  One of the main sig characters that keeps appearing in the mags and such is a SK.  Yeah it doesn't sound like much but all I can have at this point is hope.</div></div><hr />

Wrong, actually. You're thinking in EQ1 terms, EQ2 is taking a completely different aproach.<br />
Quote from Moorgard regarding archtype roles:<br />
 Originally posted by Moorgard<br />
Our method is to base the game on five roles, each of which provides unique and necessary functions. As I've said, the differences within an archetype are about how that job is done, not how well it is done. <br />
<br />
Is this distinction enough for you? That's a matter of personal taste. Fighters take damage, deal damage, and hold a mob's attention. Every Fighter is charged with that responsibility, and must do it as well as any other. Some will use spells, some will use arts; some will use avoidance, some will use mitigation; some will wear heavy armor that makes them look like a walking tank, others will wear much lighter armor. <br />
<br />
Will the sub-classes within an archetype look different? Yes. Will they have different types of quests? Yes. Will they share some skills? Yes. Will they have unique skills? Yes. Will one sub-class be better at its main role than another? No.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>dracoviolet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">also this was posted by moorgard in regards to questions about vanguard.<br />
moorgard<br />
Vanguard is the fancy stuff, heavier than plate. We've shown a couple sets, but there's a lot more to come<br />
<br />
here is the link to the actual thread <br />
http://eqiiforums.station.sony.com/eq2/board/message?board.id=fighter&amp;message.id=2636&amp;view=by_date_ascending&amp;page=1<br />
<br />
they have repeatedly said all fighter will be able to tank</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Azudno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">fact: moorgard played a monk in eq1.<br />
<br />
fact: monks will be efficient tanks in eq2.<br />
<br />
Concidence? I think not !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zakton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">So basically I have to be a warrior then a pally before I become a SK?  No thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">No, you have to be a &quot;fighter&quot; and then a &quot;crusader&quot; before you can be a shadow knight.  Warrior is completely different, and paladin is parallel to shadow knight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kebsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">A 'crusader' isn't nessesarilly a good guy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>synnoira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">My impression is that they're aiming for everybody to have the same base ac, hp, and i assume aggro, so everybody is equal at the fundamental tanking job. Then after that they are tagging on different abilities to each class to produce different variety. So basically you have the different fighter classes relating to each other the way paladins and sk's did in EQ, at least that's my guess. The official EQ2 forum is full of people speculating about Guardian's being better at mitigation while monks have more avoidance, blahblah. Not that i'll believe one thing about EQ2 until i see it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tsumetai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Crusaders presently have the best ability to gain and hold aggro of any tank class, based on information available now (minding NDAs). <br />
<br />
Things will change before release, just an update as of now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jupke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Crusaders presently have the best ability to gain and hold aggro of any tank class, based on information available now (minding NDAs). <br />
<br />

<br />
*cough* bullshit<br />
<br />
warriors, crusaders, brawlers have the same aggro tools. I've seen em upclose =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tsumetai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">You didn't pay enough attention to certain runes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Culdahl1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Essentailly, the knights are the same in both versions.....can't go into game play or anything (NDA), but an EQ1 SK is just a fighter 'till level 9 anyway and we dont get any real usable spells 'till the mid-teens.  EQ2 just goes about it in a different way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jupke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">You didn't pay enough attention to certain runes.<br />
<br />
And you missed the aggro increasing skill the warriors get at that level ?</div></div><hr />
