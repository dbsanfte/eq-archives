<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>aress</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I always wondered how much dps a DS is while tanking.  Does anyone know?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
How high can we go?  Stacking is an issue.  Without potions I see it as follows:<br />
<br />
Shield of Torment  <br />
Slot 4: Increase Damage Shield by 15 <br />
<br />
Vengeful Guard  <br />
Slot 2: Increase Damage Shield by 20 <br />
<br />
Blessing of Vah Kerrath  <br />
slot 5:  Increase Damage Shield by 8 <br />
<br />
AA:  Increase Damage Shield by 15 <br />
<br />
Cloak of Luclin  <br />
slot 6:  Increase Damage Shield by 10 <br />
<br />
total innate DS = 68<br />
<br />
 <br />
Maelstrom of Ro  <br />
slot 1:  Increase Damage Shield by 45 <br />
 <br />
total DS = 113<br />
<br />
<br />
 <br />
CoR and Coldain DS do not stack with Vengeful Guard.<br />
SoB (druid) and Banshee do not stack with mage DS.<br />
<br />
I have no clue about bard DS, is it true that they do not stack with druid/mage DS?  I always thought they would to some degree...<br />
<br />
So, if one has a DS of 113, how much dps would it be against a non-slowed PoEarth exp mob?  This is going to be hard to parse, but I will try whenever I get a chance.<br />
<br />
<br />
edit:  looked up bard songs:  Warsong of Zek does not stack with shield of Torment, Psalm of Veeshan does not stack with mage/druid DS.  Correct?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>aress</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Preliminary parsing tonight:<br />
<br />
MT in a PoEarth exp group.  Usual range/mix of mobs.<br />
<br />
Damage shield was 103 per hit.<br />
<br />
No procs/spells used.<br />
<br />
non-melee dps:  average 65 (range 55 - 85)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lynxal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You are missing the shield of pain augments from LDoN.<br />
<br />
Shield of Pain II is type 3 aug slot and I know exists......I assume there is a type I somewhere.<br />
<br />
Shield of Pain II is also on the Earring of Sand Tides.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">DS DPS depends on how often you're being hit.<br />
bard DS go in short buff box (they're songs) so they stack with everything that doesn't go in short buff box i believe. i'm not sure about that but i think that's how it is.<br />
<br />
anyway, DS DPS = DS damage / hits/second.<br />
<br />
so, if you have a 50 point DS and are getting hit once every .5 seconds, the DS will do 100 dps.<br />
if the mobs are being shaman slowed, you'd be getting hit once every 2 seconds instead, and the DS would do 25 DPS.<br />
if the mobs hit once every second and you tank 5 at a time, a 50pt DS will do 250 DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>aress</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I looked up bard song stacking on Lucy.  However, the bard window is a very good point.  Do they stack now or not?<br />
<br />
Mob speed is important, we do not slow exp mobs anymore to get max benefit.  Any theoretical calculations are difficult to make, since they do not include any avoidance issues/mobs missing.<br />
<br />
Is there a slot 8 or 7 DS augment?</div></div><hr />

Any theoretical calculations are difficult to make, since they do not include any avoidance issues/mobs missing.<br />
<br />
in general, assuming you're facing the mob, it averages out to hitting around once every round with normal mobs that double and kick. you can check your logs for mob accuracy and attack delay and guess future results based on that<br />
<br />
i don't know if you do LDoN at all, but it's fun to complete missions by letting the mobs kill themselves on DS. set up a nice bard/sk/sk/dru/cle/other group, have bard pumping DS songs, have one SK pull a mob and tank it, and have the other tank all adds, and make sure 3-5 mobs are in camp at a time. everything dies pretty quick when eating a 120-180pt DS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Lynxal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Are you sure shield of pain does not stack with shield of torment?  Shield of pain augments are a worn effect.  <br />
<br />
There is a spell: shield of pain that adds 10DS and I can see not stacking, I am surprised the worn effect does not stack.  It does not block the spell though right?  The 15 on torment would just not allow the 1-10 of shield of pain to add is my asusmption.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>aress</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">not sure, Lynxal.  I found Shield of pain on Lucy as spell.  Can anyone clarify who has such shield and the DS clickies?  <br />
<br />
I am currently trying to accumulate all 42 AA points necessary for our innate DS, what a pain this is, literally :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Shield of Pain V just adds 5 to any DS that you have on. No issues there, it is a worn effect.<br />
<br />
Same is likely for a worn Fiery Might, which probably looks alot different after the patch changes. Worn effects and self buffed clicky spells don't behave the same way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>lorddaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">you forgot shaman potions.<br />
<br />
Maelstrom of Ro  (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3486&amp;source=Live) Slot 1, 45 DS<br />
<br />
Kilvas Skin of Flame (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=1331)  33DS, slot 2.<br />
<br />
Cloak of Luclin  (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3490&amp;source=Live) Slot 6: 10 DS (noticed stacking shows warriors get a 31 slot 6 DS tome. bastards)<br />
<br />
Bards can get up to an 80 DS easily (http://www.eqdiva.com/Forums/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=27358#27369) , and possibly go higher <br />
<br />
these three alone are 153 DS, not including that new AA or any items/gear.<br />
<br />
200+ DS should be easily attainable.<br />
<br />
Edit: got a post from the bard board on what they can do DS wise, worked it in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Calliopeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">LordDaeth, I updated my DS post with your SK information.  I know nothing about the class and both of the guild SKs are out of town this week, so I'd love feedback from you.  According to my calculations...<br />
<br />
SKs can have a maximum possible Damage Shield that does 313 damage.<br />
<br />
(Actually, depending on how the worn DS items stack, this could be higher.  Does anyone know the cap on worn DS?)<br />
<br />
Please check my math.  Most specifically, I'd like more information about the Intense Hatred AA.  How many levels are there?  How much does it increase the DS per level?  How many AA's does it cost?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">intense hatred is only 3 DS per level, up to 15 max.<br />
<br />
the costs are 3/6/9/12/15<br />
<br />
<br />
also, i'm pretty sure all worn DS stack with each other, so you can get worn DS pretty high.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Calliopeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The damage shield guide is updated with new Gates of Discord spells and items.  I'd love feedback from Shadow Knights to be sure I got it right for you guys.  AFAIK, the maximum possible SK DS is 372.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Not a bad link, but it'd be a lot better off in it's own thread than a 5month old bump... hell, in it's own thread, it might even get a sticky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Khat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">That is very nice, Calliopeia :)  Thank you.<br />
I had recently started compiling a list of my own and had gotten as far as the worn DS items for us SKs but looking at your list it appears I shouldn't bother.<br />
Very nicely put together.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>kassdax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">When Omens of War comes out the mage DS numbers will skyrocket. There's supposed to be a short term (like 15-30 seconds I think) 300 point damage shield.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Calliopeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Slein, good point but I wasn't sure where to put it so I just searched for my old post.  Feel free to start a new thread with a link in a more appropriate place.<br />
<br />
Khat, I started the guide for warriors so when I searched for worn DS items, I required them to be warrior-usable.  There may be some SK items that I'm missing.  Would you mind scanning the list to see if I've left any out?<br />
<br />
Kassdax, that sounds similiar to the Ranger disc Wrath of the Wild that I just learned about.  If I'm still playing when OOW is released, I'll certainly update the guide with the finalized spells, AAs, and items.  If we quit before then (we said we would after the disaster of GoD, but you know how that goes...) then I'll definitely hand the guide off to someone else to maintain if they'd like.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

I looked through and there isn't anything that I had that wasn't on your list.<br />
In actuality, you had a couple that I had overlooked.<br />
<br />
ADD: As an aside, you mention a worn DS cap of 15 and that's something I wasn't aware of.  It's too bad if it really is that low. :-/</div></div><hr />
