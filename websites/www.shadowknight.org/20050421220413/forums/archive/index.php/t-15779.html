<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ute</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay, I did a search on &quot;Repairing Faction&quot; not much to go on ... <br />
<br />
I would really like to do the Greenmist Khurki quest even as a DE. Problem is - in my youth the stupid alchemist outside the Outpost killed me so I returned the favor by farming his ass for almost 8 hours just cause I was pissed off he killed me. I got the message your faction can not possible get any worse with ... message eventually. Is it possible to repair this? Up to this point in 54 seasons I have never been concerned with faction, and now I see the alchemist is needed for this - lol my luck. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lurker99</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">correct me if Im wrong, but...... wouldn't you just do/kill things to raise your faction now?.<br />
<br />
It's pretty obvious, no?<br />
<br />
also, why did you look up &quot;Repairing Faction&quot;.. were you NOT KOS at some point?. if so, how did you get that way... if you can remember, then do it again.<br />
<br />
<br />
I, being a Human SK, would NEVER kill any iksar that gave me negative Cabilis faction after the mindless timesink of getting that faction to where it is now, but that's just me.. I'm one of the few left that use common sense...<br />

&quot;Your milage may vary&quot; &lt;-- I love that quote!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">no you can repair it, you just get the &quot;im an idiot&quot; penalty and it will take you twice as long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ute</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">While I appreciate the replies I think you all are assuming where you shouldn't;<br />
<br />
A.) Learned of greenmist from this board, always thought was iskar only.<br />
B.) Don't know that I was ever NOT KOS in the first place<br />
<br />
I suspect in B's case I was KOS to begin with - the alchemist aggro'd on me near the wall and killed me when i was lom and health one day. like I said - i returned the favour thus totally ruining my faction<br />
<br />
It's only common sense if you know you need the bugger for something otherwise he's exp like anything else, as I was not aware if you re-read the original post. The message &quot;your faction cannot possibly get any worse ...&quot; leads one to believe your hosed beyond repair - which is why I asked the question. lastly, I chose &quot;repairing faction&quot; because It seemed to me that if it where possible to fix the issue it might be listed there. <br />
<br />
That I can repair the faction is good, that it will take twice maybe three times as long well I can deal with that - <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hollenritter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Can't get any worse means just that.  It can't get any WORSE.  It can get better.  It'll just take half of forever.  To bottom out from just hitting scowling if I remember right is about 2000 faction hits.  And you DO need scaled mystic faction to complete greenmist.  Kill explorers, turn in knives.  Turn in bone chips in FoB.<br />
<br />
My roommate turned in something on the order of 5 stacks of knives to get to dubious to crusaders (sk faction).  I'd suspect you'll need on the order of 20-30 stacks to pull yourself off the shaman shitlist.  Maybe less, but it'll still be a lot.<br />
<br />
There's lots of posts on the forum regarding raising your faction if you have more questions.  Allakhazam's is a great resource for quest info as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grotar Von Smash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I killed the alchemist too cause it always aggroed on my friend the shammy, so in revenge I would fear kite it.  When I found out it was important for greenmist I smacked my head with a big resounding DOH!<br />
<br />
Just do your faction, it will take a few more to get your Brood of Kotiz faction, but you dont have to worry about repairing it, just get it period.</div></div><hr />
