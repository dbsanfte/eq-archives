George Bush did something today that I think hinted at what I'm getting at.  Here is a copy of the note that dear Condi handed to him in Turkey earlier today along with his cute little message for the press:<br />

Why don't you look at the long-term picture?  Yeah things aren't great today but do you honestly expect to rebuild a country that has been under the rule of an oppressive dictator for 30 years in 14 months?  How about looking at the things that have improved?  No you only want to talk about how bad things are now.<br />
<br />
Looking at something from different perspectives than your own ideology is a great thing though, might want to try it sometime.</div></div><hr />

I will admit that things are better than they could be.  No doubt that a country sitting in near anarchy is much better than an oppressive dictatorship.  You cannot assume that things are going to turn out for the best however.  Judging by the amount of hostility that seems to exist in the area, how do we know that this isn't going to turn into what Afghanistan became after we stole it back from the communists?  Or what Cuba became after we stole it from the Spanish?  We don't.  Idle speculation will always bow to the current state of things and I honestly have not seen enough evidence to point to the fact that stability will exist in the area any time soon.  Irregardless of whoever becomes our next president, the actions taken by this administration concerning Iraq are going to need to be dealt with for some time.  And I'm not being and idealist here.  I'm being a realist.<br />

Near anarchy?  Let's not be so dramatic.  There are a few of the larger cities that have significant problems, but most of the country is relatively subdued.  You can't base your opinions soley on the bad news you hear, especially when you only hear reports from cities like Fallujah, Baghdad, etc.  You have to remember that good news doesn't sell, so it will go largely unreported.  You also have to remember that Iraq is the size of California, and you are only hearing bad news out of a few cities.</div></div><hr />

Point taken.<br />
<br />
Give me some examples of the good things that are happening in places in Iraq and I will consider them.  And please don't hide behind the &quot;if it bleeds, it leads...&quot; philosophy either :)<br />
<br />
One thing to consider.  If the amount of bad news (i.e. 9k-13k civilian casualties thus far) that we get from Iraq was occuring on a relative level in the United States what would you think about the stability of our government?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well for one, electricity and water levels are higher than they were under Saddam.  Book stores are no longer regulated by the government.  There are now free Iraqi newspapers (yes I know Al Sadrs paper was removed, but that paper was encouraging violent resistance to the occupation, and the same thing would be done in the U.S. if a public newspaper was inciting violence).  Iraqis are allowed to speak out against the coalition unless it turns violent (try doing that with Saddam).  Levels of oil are flowing at levels higher than they did with Saddam and Iraqis only have to pay 5cents per gallon.  The U.N. has stopped mis-handling the oil-for-food program.  Businesses are reopening.  <br />
<br />
There are many other things going well but i'm not going to sit here all day listing them.  I'm not saying things are great or even good in Iraq, all I'm saying is that things are not nearly as bad as the media is making them seem.</div></div><hr />

Point taken, but I wasn't saying the government there is stable.  I don't think anyone is.  That's why the leader of the interim govt is asking the US troops to stay in Iraq until things can stabilize.</div></div><hr />

Sources...?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Krudler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Sources...?<br />
<br />
Well the newspapers over the last few months, buried deep in there.  Chicago Tribune to be exact.  If you want me to find current sources I can but it's going to take some time.  Most of that has been reported a decent amount so if you watch the news regularly you'd already know that stuff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bear in mind this is just 6 months after the war ended.<br />
Again my point isn't that everything is great, just that we're not just over there securing the oil fields and killing civilians.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes the BBC.  The now publicly embarrassed broadcast company.  You need to consider the source.  The company that fired one if its employees for not reporting enough bad news and for reporting a story favorable to the coalition.  The company that has been getting complaints from its employees about being pressured to put negative spin on stories.  The company that was banned from US aircraft carriers after spinning stories as unfavorably as possible.<br />
<br />
Whether or not electricity supplies only meet 50% of demand, the fact of the matter is that the level is still higher than with Saddam.  And I'd love to see how &quot;Most improvements that have been made are offset by sabotage.&quot;  The businesses are still open, the newspapers are still produced, the electricity is still higher.  That statement is an opinion.  <br />
<br />
Also, &quot;*UN estimates that it will take 4-5 years before 90% of the population has regular electricity at a cost of $13 Billion.&quot;  I really don't have much faith in UN estimates, their track record on humanitarian projects in Iraq is sketchy at best.  Also, 4-5 years to rebuild a country's infrastructure is average....remember how long it took to rebuild Germany?</div></div><hr />

<br />
If this is true, every politician in Washington and even our President is unqualified to make correct assumptions about the situation in that country.  <br />
<br />
<br />
We may not be doing a perfect and in any war there will be collaterial damage..ie...innocent civillians killed.

<br />
I'm not sure if that justify's what has occured unfortunately.  It certainly was not a good situation and the world is better without it but what about all of the other countries that have the same problems?  Should it be the prerogative of the United States to correct every one of these unfortunate occurences?  Last time I checked we were the United States of America, not the United States of Earth.  <br />
<br />
Many polls taken from the Iraqi public indicate that they oppose our occupation of their country.  I'm sure most polls would also indicate that they are glad they don't have to worry about Sadaam's regime anymore.  The fact of the matter is, do they want to have the right to vote freely?  How do we know that the person they vote in to power won't be someone we disagree with?  Politicians have a way of rallying behind what their constituents desire as that is what will draw them favor from the public and result in their successful election.  If the Iraqi public views the United States with some hostility it would make sense that their politicians will eventually do the same.  It seems possible to me then, that our intervention to rid the world of a great problem will result in another problem.  I can only hope that the next one is not as terrible as the original.</div></div><hr />
