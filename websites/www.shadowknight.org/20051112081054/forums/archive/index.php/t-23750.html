<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aylien</div><div class="date">12-08-2004, 11:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been trying to finish the quest for that twisted bastard sword and I've only seen the priests like 3 times in a week and I only got to kill them twice. Once, they didn't &quot;drop&quot; the item, and the second time I killed them, I got credit, but my quest journal didn't update. <br />
<br />
The knowledge base on EQ2.com says that customer service cannot assist with quest journal updates at this time, so what are they good for then? <br />
<br />
Is this quest broken, or am I just bugged and will never be able to finish it?  :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Berren</div><div class="date">12-09-2004, 05:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry to hear that Aylien.  I did the Twisted bastard sword quest.  Getting the priests was a pain, but after I killed them my quest updated.  Saying that I had to return to the nomad in Nektulos forest to finish.  Then he sent me back to Tundus.  <br />
<br />
If you're afraid you're bugged go back and talk to the nomad in Nektulos, I can never remember his name off the top of my head.  My Burpbelly quest was bugged. After getting my quest from Logan, when I went to Burpbelly, the examine button was greyed out.  I went and talked to Logan he gave me the quest over, even gave me the opition to start the quest.  Then when I returned to Burpbelly the exaimne button was nolonger greyed out.  Therefore, perhaps you should try talking to him again and see if that fixes it for you.  Its worth the effort.  At lvl 24 you can use the sword, and I am very happy with it.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps, let me know if you get the sword.</div></div><hr />

I think it starts with Tundis N'Oxyle in the Commonlands.  You need to go into Nektulos and back into Fallen Gate to complete it, but it sounds well worth it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xilith</div><div class="date">12-10-2004, 11:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks, I think I'll look into this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nymn</div><div class="date">12-10-2004, 12:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The prayer journal seems to be very rare, so is it possible you got a quest update on the kill for something else?  Since Kill'em All is repeatable, I get quest credit for every kill in FG, for example.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Berren</div><div class="date">12-10-2004, 05:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The quest does begin with Tundis.  You have to first complete a quest for him in FG, then he'll give you the quest to translate the journal.  That's what leads you to Nektulos.  The nomad he speaks of is on the path heading north, just beyond the destroyed Nexus Spire.  After talking to him he'll send you back to Fallen Gate to get the prayer book.  It only drops from the named ghosts in the room with the Fake Gon in Fallen Gate.  After getting it head back to the nomad he'll send you back to Tundis who will give you the reward.  There are a couple of one handers as well, one we can't use because its a staff, the other a mace with nice stats.  Ratio I believe on the Twisted Mace is 9-27 base with a delay of 1.7<br />
I got the Twisted Black Bastard Sword, don't quote me but I recall it having 20-54 base damage with a 1.8 delay Two hander.  Best two hander I've seen in the game for Knights in regards to DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xilith</div><div class="date">12-10-2004, 06:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ahh I think I already have that quest then, if it begins by finding a journal in FG... looks like I have something else to work on this weekend.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I pulled that room countless times helping ppl with their AQ quests and I don't remember ever seeing a named ghost.</div></div><hr />

Yes that is the room.  The troll ghosts spawn with the construct group around the table.  Took me about 4 hours to get them.</div></div><hr />

Interesting.  Thanks for the information.  Out of curiosity, do you need to loot the Prayer Journal, or does it give you quest credit automatically upon killing the ghosts?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Quest credit so you can get it for as many people as need it in 1 shot.</div></div><hr />

Took me about 5 hours of camping with a group (total). I soloed Terrathud, then I proceeded to slay the mighty griffin Gustfeather!...Needless to say I was delusional with my lust for power.. he still hit me for 350 and I had to feign it off...but I got him with a healer 1 min later  :p</div></div><hr />
