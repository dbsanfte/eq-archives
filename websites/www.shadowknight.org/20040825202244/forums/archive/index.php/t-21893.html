<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The spam you're recieving has nothing to do with who owns the board.  I made a post on the main board thats stickied that states how to fix the spam problems.  It has to do with the default settings on the version of vBulletin were using I believe since it happened to me on TSW as well.  If you follow the instructions there you'll fix it.</div></div><hr />

I'm going to tell a story. This story is a story about me reading an article in Maxim magazine. They had an article for the best and worst of things. One section in said article was about the worst way to die. It was described as being tied up, having your asshole placed on top of a blunted wooden spear that was 10 or so feet long (sticking straight out of the ground), so that you would slowly, over the course of weeks, have said blunted wooden spear move up through your body, as you were forced down by your own body weight. The spear would push into and through all your internal organs, slowly killing you. This was practised by some indiginous culture in South America or Africa, and people would be killed this way, over the course of weeks. This would suck.<br />
<br />
This is what I hope happens to you, you worthless pile of shit.</div></div><hr />

&lt;LI&gt;No, you aren't privilaged enough.<br />
<br />
<br />

&lt;LI&gt;Because guys find panties fun and exciting to talk about, I thought you were a guy, wouldn't you know this already?<br />
<br />
<br />
 IS SHE HOT OR SOMETHING!??!?!?!? <br />
&lt;LI&gt; Maybe<br />
<br />
<br />
or is she some ugly hoebag nerd-girl <br />
&lt;LI&gt; Maybe<br />
<br />
<br />
 or is she a hotty hoe-bag nerd girl? <br />
&lt;LI&gt;This is an oxymoron.<br />
<br />
<br />
does she weigh more than 140 pounds? <br />
&lt;LI&gt; No<br />
<br />
<br />

&lt;LI&gt; Thank god for small miracles.<br />

<br />
<br />
