<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This is not a game breaking issue, but it is something that has irritated many of us since the line's incarnation.<br />
<br />
Terrors.<br />
<br />
We can argue back and forth on semantics as to whether or not the line is 'broken', but the fact of the matter is that in every given situation for aggro, there are better alternatives. Specifically:<br />
<br />
1) Non-damage snap aggro (Fear)<br />
2) Non-damage sustained aggro (Fear and Invoke Fear)<br />
3) Very fast snap aggro (Clinging Darkness with Twinging Pain 1)<br />
4) Sustained aggro (Clinging Darkness and Fear)<br />
<br />
What that leaves us with is a useless line of spells. Useless in that we always have a better solution and cannot afford to waste an additional spell gem on Terror.<br />
<br />
My suggestion: Fix the entire Terror line to provide massive snap aggro at a distance, or replace it with another spell line entirely that is actually useful. As it is we have five spells that essentially are a waste, even after they were 'fixed'. It feels like we were sold a spell line that worked great in theory, but failed in application.<br />
<br />
Would appreciate your comments. (And let's not turn this into a &quot;well this one time Terror did fine for me...&quot;. It CAN work, especially at lower levels, but Fear and CD work better.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Krudler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I agree with siilvir....the terror line is pretty useless.  The only times I have them memmed are on the very few occasions I find myself in BoT (sands) where 90% of my damage spells are resisted and I don't really have anything else useful to mem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fyrechyld</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">this would be a much better addition than res to the list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">How about an SK version of incite.  Seems to work well maybe not at range but sure works nice up close.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Isn't Incite a Terror that uses endurance and has an extra little hate over time component tacked onto it?  I would imagine that's how the dev's see it, at any rate, so asking for our own version of Incite would probably confuse them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Skoggel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The way I figure, they can leave mana as is, up hate amount by a lot. If possible, add something to the spell to provide a little scalability in aggro too, but nothing that provides anything new to the SK class like stunning... that's asking for a lot.<br />
<br />
Cause Terrors only seem bad to me in terms of not doing enough aggro. If they want to add a terror spell each expansion there's not even a need to make them scalable - simple hard numbers should work, growing appropriately by each new Terror. Recast time kinda bugs me...I'm undecided on if that should get fixed or not. While I certainly wouldn't rely ONLY on a new superterror that actually gives more aggro than dark or fear to keep aggro on something, I'm not so sure we want to just totally overdo it with a 1.5 sec cast, instant recast biggest aggro spell in game. As an offtank I only use one aggro spell in my lineup anyway, it's only when MAing I currently (and also would if Terrors get made worthwhile and keep their recast time) use two.<br />
<br />
Overall I'd be happy to get Terrors fixed, but I'm not sure how much of an actual effect it would have. Aside from the psychological issues or whatever with given an inferior spell line by Sony, the only big meaningful issue it would mean, I think, is not risking clinging landing on a mob that ought to get mezzed.<br />
<br />
That said, it's not like we have 10 hugely important things listed, and I think terrors getting fixed would have more importance than trying to find out if more people want SCS fixed (not a SK problem) or a rez which would admittedly be rather powerful and only has a place in one group content.<br />
<br />
So I think I could be for it.<br />
<br />
ADDENDUM: the explanation of Terrors above is just explaining the bare minimum way I think Terrors would work. If we could get them to scale via aggro without hard numbers, or whatever, maybe make them have the same aggro as a fear and then tack on an extra 500 hate for good measure, that would even be better. Taking away all the recast time on what would be the best snap aggro spell in the game at that point just seems to overdo it, but I wouldn't hate the idea. Asking for it to stun, while providing good aggro purposes, would add in interrupts on demand which would be asking for more than just an aggro spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Noctix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'd rather see them get rid of terrors and give us an entirely new line of spells.  I don't need four lines of spells (terror, darkness, fear, voice) that I only mem for agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You guys do realise this is already on there right?  Number 8...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Krudler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You guys do realise this is already on there right?  Number 8...<br />
<br />
yes, but the SCS vs. Rez issue has been beaten to death and this issue hasn't gotten nearly as much attention</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Noctix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You guys do realise this is already on there right?  Number 8...<br />
Actually, number 6 &quot;6. Our spell based aggro needs fixed and designed to scale.&quot;<br />
<br />
On a related note, a question for Brael.  Do you actually get to talk to the devs or some SOE rep to make sure they know what we're talking about with each of these issues?  Since number 6 doesn't give any specific spell names, I'd hate to think they're spending weeks of effort trying to figure out what we're talking about only to go and fix the wrong thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Brenlo passes the lists on to the developers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">You guys do realise this is already on there right?  Number 8...<br />
<br />
Part of the issue may be that the list isn't specific across all subjects.  this may be the way Sony wanted it and may be effective in getting change, it may also not always be clear to everyone on the board.<br />
<br />
poor example:<br />
I might be frustrated if they upped Melee DPS to conform to #7 on the list, but I still see alot of resists on my spells.  <br />
Do they understand that if we are told that we sacrifice things for our spells that we'd like to see the spells be effective?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tukka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The sad thing is, even if they fix the Terror line, I'm not sure I would stop using Fear and Clinging Darkness, unless those spells are also &quot;fixed&quot; (Disease Cloud style).  At my level of progression, Fear and Clinging Darkness are still more than adequate for keeping aggro and doing so rather efficiently.  I purchased SCE1 so my aggro spells would never fizzle, and now that I've been spoiled by that, reverting to a line of spells that costs more mana with more fizzles could feel like a bit of a downgrade, even if they have a slightly shorter cast time with slightly better aggro.<br />
<br />
Still, I suppose we can't count on Fear being broken forever.  In the event that they do some day fix it, it would be nice to have a reliable non-damage aggro spell at our disposal.<br />
<br />
It's pretty sad that two of the things that I am most valuable for in many of the groups I'm in are due to my spells being broken or at very least being used in unintended ways (Fear/CD for aggro, pet for pulling).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Synapticus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I would use terror if it actually did something besides taunt.  I still use clinging darkness as a real snare.  If a mob hits 20%, started bolting, and wasn't snare for some odd reason, I would usually throw down CD over Festering - why waste another 150 mana just to stop the mob from running another 5 feet?<br />
Like wise, Terror has to do something besides taunt, especially if its no longer a level 15 spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ghismonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">OOW version should be something like:<br />
<br />
Paralyzing Terror of Discord:<br />
1:      Stun 0.00<br />
2: 	Increase Hate by 1200<br />
Mana: 	60<br />
<br />
I'd mem that.  It's not too late to change it and make it useful.</div></div><hr />

That is the best idea I've heard for fixing terrors.  Just make sure it can stun mobs up to a useful level (level 70 mobs would probably be reasonable).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Rueeliar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">You're missing the point.  Doesn't matter if it actually stuns.  Let it be limited to level 55 mobs on the stun portion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Utaldain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Then you are adding Stuns to Sk spell line up, and that will start a lot of whineplay about taking effects from Paladins.<br />
<br />
Now if it were coded like this<br />
<br />
1: Fear (1)<br />
2: Increase Hate by 1200<br />
<br />
With a .5 sec cast time and Instant Duration....Then you are looking at something worth meming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">How about a 0.0 second stun with a Hate Over Time component added to it, ala the warrior Incite ability?

<br />
If you have 300 things that are broken, and 1 issue that part of the community thinks is not broken, Why would you ever spend time fixing it. Resources are much better spent fixing something that is broken.<br />
<br />
SoE does not need help figuring out how to fix it. There are litterally 100's of ways to do it.<br />
<br />
If they need help, its in understanding how broken this spell line is. Until its considered broken, nothing is going to change.<br />
<br />
If an automaker sell you a car and you later find out that it only goes 10 miles an hour. Is the car broken? Are you going to demand it be fixed? What if you find out that it was only meant to go 10 miles an hour but you were never told. Does that make it any less broken?<br />
<br />
I know Siilvr is going to say I'm derailing the topic, but there is no reason for us to worry about this. Until it's considered broken, let the issue rest, and use another spell to get aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Noctix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Until it's considered broken, let the issue rest, and use another spell to get aggro.<br />
I have to disagree with this.  Each class is only going to get so many new spells in OOW, especially a class like SKs who SOE doesn't really care about.  Like it or not, SOE devs are going to say something like &quot;SKs already have their 20 spells for this expansion, no need to look at them anymore, let's work on beastlords&quot;.  I don't want any of our new spells to be useless agro spells that 90% of the SK player base never ever mems because darkness and fear work better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Tumple</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Is that to say we should accept being third tank tanks and hope for better dps spells / abilities?</div></div><hr />

I don't quite understand how this question relates to whether terrors should be fixed or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Chania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">All I know is that my aggro as an SK has been repeatedly inadvertantly nerfed (Shadow Vortex, Disease Cloud) and been &quot;replaced&quot; by a sad sack spell that doesn't come anywhere near the effectiveness, especially at range, to our old tools. And to add insult, Warrior aggro has been upgraded in so many ways it's ridiculous now (AE taunt, Anger proccing weapons, Anger as an Augment, Incite)<br />
<br />
Our Terror spells should be among the highest aggro in the game. Numbers wise it may look like it is, but in practical terms, this spell line does not function as an aggro tool. For me it's broken.</div></div><hr />

You miss my point entirely. I agree, terrors are worthless and should be addressed. What I am saying, is that there is a certain segment of the SK community that does not think there are problems with terrors, and does not think they are broken. Looking at it from SOE's perspective. Why would they want to look at this issue, if not all SK's think they are broken? There are plenty of issues that are entirely broken to address.</div></div><hr />

You are right about this.  However, SOE is getting read to give us at least one new terror spell in the OOW expansion.  If we let them know that terrors are generally useless, maybe they will either fix terrors or give us something else instead, since they already have someone looking at our new spells.<br />
<br />
Getting them to go look at some entirely new that we think is broken may not fit with their schedule of cranking out the expansion on time.<br />
<br />
Personally, I would rather see a fix to our tanking issues than a terror fix.  That seems like a much larger can of worms though.</div></div><hr />

Your logic is flawed, Rhumba.  There's nothing on our Top 10 list that 100% of the population agrees with it being broken.  There are even some SKs who come here and claim that they are 'tanking just fine' and they do 'insane amounts of DPS' and that 'SCS isn't a problem cause I didn't buy it' and 'Necro rez is useless'... starting to sound familiar?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Rueeliar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Insane amounts of dps.  Haha.  Compared maybe to a ranger meleeing with their epics, maybe.  Ironically, even the rangers are complaining about warrior dps.<br />
<br />
Put a 5 percent snare on the new Terror, np.  No reason not to.  Anger has a 0.0s stun on it which originally was only up to level 55 mobs, so it served no purpose other than increased aggro generation.</div></div><hr />

Take away both fears and all thier darkness for a week, then ask them to attempt to function to the same level using their terrors.  Relying on spells that use &quot;bugs&quot; to generate their aggro is fine until you step into zones where they are basically ignored (aka Uqua and beyond) and then you really start to get pissed at how unrelyable and underpowered the terror line is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Rueeliar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Fear and Clinging both function fine in Qvic and most of Txevu.  Nothing functions reliably for aggro in the first half of Inktuta except straight DD's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Shredderr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">It's broken, it sucks, give me something else. I hate to see it taking up a new spell slot we're getting when you could give me damn near anything else and I'll be happier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Akronis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Terror of Thule has a 1.5 second cast time, 6 second recast and only gives 600 raw hate. How many times can a dual wielding flurrying weapon affinity 5 warrior proc anger (650 hate + stun) and anger 3 (600 hate) in that time? All they need is once to outdo our terror spell. Even the OoW one is only 1200, that's still only equivalent to at most 2 procs. They definitely have to be tuned up or something to be at all useful. I thought our tradeoff for not having defensive or being able to mitigate as well as a warrior was that we could either 1. have better aggro or 2. do better DPS, both of which are untrue.<br />
<br />
I was upset when I first got to Uqua and found I couldn't use fear anymore, but I felt better once I found that everything is snare immune. Am I to understand I'm going to lose more aggro tools down the road?</div></div><hr />
