<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vindie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a Question... I Play on Cazic-Thule, but I like proving that Gnome SK's are the stuff... SO I was wondering... In Duel Situation VS Rooting Classes/Snaring Classes... Is it the MAG resist that determines about actually BEING rooted/snared or is that unresistible... im only level 44 but Im working Primarly on the MAG resist stuff as well as AC so that I become a lil harder to kil in battle.... <br />
<br />
Am I right about this?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Meriboh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Root and snares are checked against magic. Buffed and when I put my MR gear on is 220. I resist roots and snares about 95% of the time, with the exception of the AA roots.<br />
<br />
Just keep shadow step and cancel magic up or carry pumice.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Meriboh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Some of the better MR gear that is available are player made jewelry.<br />
Velium Jacinth Wedding Ring (14 MR) X2<br />
Velium Wolf’s eye items…<br />
<br />
Other items you may want to look into would be relatively easy to get or purchasable:<br />
<br />
Shaman Potions (they stack with spell MR) They add 20 – 40 MR<br />
Mistmoore Shield (10 MR)<br />
Eye of the Sandstorm (15 to all resists)<br />
Acrylia BP (10 MR)<br />
Tribal Warboots (10 MR)<br />
Grobb Hide Mask (10 MR)<br />
Earring of essence (10 MR)<br />
Vengeful Diamond Blade (10 MR)<br />
Forlorn Hero’s Blade (10 MR)<br />
Nightmarewood Compound Bow (10 MR)<br />
Ceremonial Smudging Stick (10 MR)<br />
Skull Shaped Barbute (10 MR)<br />
Horned Beetle Mask (5 MR)<br />
Silver Chitin Handwraps (3 MR)<br />
Shinny Pantaloons (5 MR)<br />
<br />
Well, the list could go on and on…<br />
Of course you will have to make sacrifices to other stats to achieve a good affordable MR setup. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vindie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks... I guess its up to me on deciding to make the AC sacrifice to get MR... but il have to look at that when Im not at work! lol <br />
<br />
Thanks bunches for the info!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Meriboh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Its always bothered me as well; the sacrifices I have to make so that I don’t get snared or rooted. Just remember, the higher the person’s level, the harder it will be for you to land your spells as well as resisting theirs.<br />
