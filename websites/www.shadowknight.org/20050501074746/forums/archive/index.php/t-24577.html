<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mikazu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This zone just sparked in my mind for some reason as a possible duo spot. :) Anybody have general info for the revamped zone, such as how hard mobs hit, if there are some decent camp spots, how xp is, etc.<br />
<br />
Regardless, I think I'm gonna give it a try when I get home and will probably update this thread with my experiences. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>uuuarius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would highly recommend the Chessboard as a place to set up camp.<br />
This is definitely the coolest zone in the game.<br />
I can't share too much info on the xp, but it was noticable AA xp at 70. <br />
It's probably better xp than WOS :)<br />
check out the quests for the clickie resist flowers before you go, I hear they still drop.<br />
this is just a spectacular place to go and have fun, Chicks dig the jesters :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Wide range of MObs<br />
<br />
CY stats in the 40s and you get up to 65 in the AIW wing Mobs in CY will hit 100+, Bunny Behemoth - big guy at end of AiW wing hits for about 800 don't remember triples or anything<br />
<br />
Named see invis - nothin else does<br />
<br />
Named are partially slowable and summon</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mikazu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I gave it a try last night. Had the zone to myself, so I set up in the forest. XP was substandard (1% aa per) at level 59, although the fights were faster then in PoN, as way of example. Also, the mobs there only hit for 300ish and weren't very resistant. It had a slooooooooooooooooow respawn rate, however. Still there was lots of stuff to pull in the first area, although I wouldn't rate it very high on the sustained xp scale.<br />
<br />
At that point I decided to check out the castle. Invised up and ran in. Everything was DB at level 59, but they would be between levels 55 (bodies lasted 30 minutes) and 58. There didn't seem to be a really good 'camp' spot, persay, because there didn't seem to be a great deal of mobs in general. Plus it was very linear in design, which might be fun for grouping, maybe, but definitely isn't condusive to duo'ing.<br />
<br />
Anyhoo, explored most of the main castle, but was never able to find out how to get to the chessboard area.<br />
<br />
At that point I decided to head back, happy with my little experiment. Of course, that meant zoning out. As I don't have the OT hammer (and the only set of puppet strings are 90k!!! right now on Prexus), I zoned out on the tree and popped in the middle of CS. I figured what the hell, and decided to try out Siren's Grotto. Neat place, and I was able to solo it without much of a problem while I ran my shaman over on my second computer. Killed the first 2 mobs, but then when I tried to pull some walrus man, he just kept pathing back and forth and not actually coming after me.<br />
<br />
Being relatively impatient and growing bored with SG, I decided to give WW a try. Ran both character through SG and popped out in the Wastes. GOD does that zone have some bad pathing. I just stayed near the entrance for a few kills, and decided to take on a yellow con Ice Burrower. Of course, my shaman starts getting attacked through the ceiling by some wolf, and I didn't have root up for some reason, and I was tired, so I just let the shadowknight die and zoned my shaman. Ah, the beauties of that new guild hall. (even though I find the idea of the corpse summoning zone to be pretty lame in the grand scheme of things).<br />
<br />
Anyway, don't think I'll head back to PoM any time soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You're missing out.<br />
<br />
I see several definate flaws in your approach<br />
1) You're in the wrong area<br />
2) You think you explored the catle (unless you wound up falling into a rat maze half a dozen times, found a theatre, were turned upside down, were in rooms that were getting slowly bigger or wound up on a chess board or in a garden you never left what is considered the entryway.)<br />
3) PoM, while awesome, is not for solo exp...MObs just have too much HP (in relation to the ammount of exp they give) to be efficient .<br />
4) PoM is all about fun, it's an oddly designed, hard to get around, super strange zone<br />
5) Named mobs give double exp (odd but true)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Envoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">hunt the revamped MM and revamped Paw.  <br />
<br />
in paw there is an easy quest for a 60 / 60 / 60 aug, and in MM there is a easy to get 40hp aug that drops where the HBC used to.<br />
<br />
exp is descent there too, pretty easy to duo, even with some pre-EP gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>larlagar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Envoy,  Can you give me info or a link to the Aug Quest in the new Paw and info on the mob that drops the Aug in MM please?  I would check Allah's but can't on the network in on in the Army.  Since I am deployed a spent a lot of time dou'ing with my Shammy since I don't have a lot of time to play anymore..<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

Find Gillamina Garstobidokis near the zone-in in Splitpaw. <br />
<br />
You say, 'Hail, Gillamina Garstobidokis' <br />
<br />
Gillamina Garstobidokis says 'Greetings to you, fellow adventurer. Gillamina Garstobidokis, master mage at your service!' Gillamina bows. 'Beware, should you wish to venture here. In case you didn't know, the lair of Splitpaw has been overrun by fierce elemental creatures.' Gillamina looks down at the dead gnoll near her feet. 'Poor creatures. I am not a fan of the gnolls by any means, but it is still sad to see them all [slaughtered] in this manner.' <br />
<br />
you say, 'Slaughtered?' <br />
<br />
Gillamina Garstobidokis says 'Yes, the gnolls that once laired here have been destroyed by the elementals it seems. I am not quite sure what happened. These elementals intrigue me so. But I suppose you would like to know what I am [doing here]?' <br />
<br />
You say, 'What are you doing here?' <br />
<br />
Gillamina Garstobidokis says 'Good question! I have come here looking for a set of unique orbs that contain the essence of the various elementals that have invaded the lair. If you can find four of these orbs, one from a fire elemental, one from an air elemental, one from an earth elemental, and one from a water elemental, I will gladly repay you for your time. I wish to study these orbs and have not had much luck finding any unfortunately.' <br />
<br />
You need to find four elemental orbs -- one of: Air, Water, Earth, and Fire.<br />
Turning in these four globes results in an Elemental Stone.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
be VERY careful in Paw, as pulls can get pretty nasty... you WILL get 4-5 per pull if you arent careful.</div></div><hr />
