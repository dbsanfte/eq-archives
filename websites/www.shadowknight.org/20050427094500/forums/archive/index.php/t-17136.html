<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>DarkenRahl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ok my first char that i played above 35 is my DE SK, he just reached 50 as of today, only thing i regret about this char is that i cant tank very well. But i do see quite a bit of high lvl DE SK's, so I dont know if i should keep going or not, is it ok that i cant tank that well? :/ i really like the class, and i dont wanna start over and make an Ogre just so i can tank...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Satist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">okies, first of all, if possible, link your magelo, so we can give you ideas as to what the problem is.  At 50, you should be able to tank quite well, depending upon what zone you are xping in.  It also depends upon whether you are soloing, or grouping.  Not having made it to 50 with an SK, I'm not sure I can help much, but, with an idea of your equipment, and zones you are working, I should be able to give you some suggestions.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>cames</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Basically every non weapon slot you have can use upgrading.  It the magelo of a person for whom a level 50 is a main, so don't get upset about it.  This was common a couple of years ago, but most level 50 characters today are twinks.<br />
<br />
So, where are you trying to tank that you are having issues?  Do you have slowers and crowd control?<br />
<br />
I don't know your situation but would suggest you look for quests to do to upgrade your stuff (LOY has many quests that would help).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jodgrim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Serpentine bracers - Darkforge bracers<br />
Adamantite Band - Vellium Fire Wedding ring<br />
Sapphire Electrum Earring - Orc fang or Cougar Claw earring<br />
Velium Ruby Veil  - Crystal Spider eyes<br />
<br />
Except for the spider eyes you could solo all the mobs that drop these or their components. If you want to buy them, they are also very cheap. Basically anything that doesn't have AC on it hurts your ability to tank, no matter what the stats are.<br />
<br />
If the amount of plat in your bank is correct just do a search in the bazaar by slot and look for items that would be upgrades. With 7k you can get some pretty good upgrades.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>DarkenRahl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">ok thanks all for the input, very helpfull :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Drynnious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">try farming the stuff for cultural and have someone combine it for you. You can't tank because you don't have very good ac not because you are a dark elf. Race has nothing to do with how well you tank, unless you think not getting stunned means you tank better, which it doesn't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Rhoades Tonowhere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">im 55 tank Ldon quite well, but any tank will tell ya that a slower makes all the diffrence!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>far_monkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hi,<br />
<br />
You should look towards items that have a direct hp bonus and nice ac for armor, of course having other bonuses on it would br great as well...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>cmdrbean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yes yes, it's all about the hp/ac bro. Check out my magelo for some ideas on mid-high end droppable stuff.  I can't think of anything other than my Haste belt and Fungi that cost me more than 6k, and most is sub 4k, yet I can tank fine.<br />
<br />
It can be hard to get good up to date gear with your main in the 50s or lower, don't worry too much, just upgrade as much as you can. Like was said above, if it seems like everyone else has better gear it's because most of them have at least 1 (often several) other characters that are post 50 if not post 60.<br />
<br />
Also, I'd like to reiterate the need for slows. Even with my gear (which I consider to be good, though not cutting edge by any means) I have trouble tanking some mobs when they're not slowed.<br />
<br />
In short, just look around at some of the gear that's available and set some goals. Since about 45 I've been wanting to hit 3k hp unbuffed (almost there) and 1200 ac unbuffed (could be a bit closer &gt;:P), so I just keep upgrading towards that end when I can afford it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ciric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I`ve got a lvl 55 SK Inky on Venril Sathir server and would suggest that you dump the Crusty BP as soon as possible and go for an Architect`s Bejeweled Breastplate . They cost about 8k here and are well worth the cash . Nice armour rating , good stats and will grow with you till lvl 60 iirc . Nice little BP thanks to the LDoN expansion :) . <br />
<br />
Also if you have the LDoN expansion yourself check out the armour you can buy from the Butcherblock Wayfarers camp for points of the Adventurer Merchants . Costs about 150 points a piece but its also very nice (and has 2 or 3 slots for further expansion with aug gems) .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>vex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Gear, it's all in the gear.<br />
<br />
My 65 de sk is approaching 9k hp now.<br />
<br />
<br />

Don't change your race. I mean, what will you be? A human sk? A troll? disgusting.</div></div><hr />
