<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>scaledge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just finished reading the lower post about HT being resisted(no this isn't a post about bluebies vs redbies, or about how idiotic that guy was for saying non disc non AA ht is unresistable).<br />
<br />
This reminded me about something I have been wanting to bring up for a while.<br />
<br />
Who the hell though up that SZ shouldn't HAVE a lv restriction on PVPing anyhow?<br />
<br />
I played pvp for a while, decided &quot; bah, this is stupid, I don't want to spend my pvp time fighting dumbasses who twink their chars to oblivion then think they are the coolest because they kill some untwinked leather n rusty wearing lv 6 at lv 9&quot;.   So I head over to SZ, thinking that it would be fair due to the old &quot;1 char only&quot; restriction(this was a while back, don't think the restriction on char count exists anymore).  WRONGO!<br />
<br />
I choose to try an iksar shaman(let's face it, I just like iksar).  I reach lv 8 solo, do the first 2 cudgels, get a decent amount of newbie gear(some furbie hide stuff) and go out to pvp.  I end up fighting someone's best friend who is attempting to RP PVP as a HE wizard, twinked with such ludicrous gear as the bio orb(clicky blind) and nother such things.  However, he is being RP about it, he is being fair(not ambushing people at 10% hp, or ksing, or what-have-you), and pretty damn civil if I do say so myself.  we duel each other 1v1, tossing blinds back and forth, nuking each other, meleeing, and we actually came out even, but it was damn fun I must say.  I began to like the server, and start playing the erudite necro I made a while back on this server.<br />
<br />
Solo to lv 7, then the bad stuff starts happening.  First thing?  A lv 65(WHAT THE HELL!?) druid, with his oh-so-fair ES vambs, runs in and starts dot-kiting the newbies in TOXX! I eventually get sick of it, write it off as a fluke, then camp out.  The next day I show up, and log on at bind point(the fork that overlooks the hole in paineel, and leads to toxx, the newbie area, and paineel proper), only to get ambushed by a pair of unknown level barbarians(warrior and shaman).  Since the shaman was chain rooting me, I could only assume they were at least level 30.  So, they start BIND POINT CAMPING ME! (cheap ass bastards).<br />
<br />
Now, I know this is pvp, and bind point camping is allowed, but a lv 7 necro being bind point camped by people at LEAST three times his level, 2v1, is just ridiculous.  I cant camp out, I cant run, I can't mem spells, and I am the only other one in the zone.  So, I spend half an hour alternating between getting sliced to pieces, suiciding by jumping into the hole in the hopes they acidentally fall in chasing me, attempting to feebly melee them to death with a rusty dagger, and simply getting 1-shotted my ice nukes from the barbarian shaman, while they laugh teir heads off at me.<br />
<br />
Now, I have nothing against pvp players, hell I think those of you with some civility are noticably cooler people than most people I have met on blue servers, but isn't this just a bit dumb?<br />
<br />
<br />
Moral of this story?  PUT A DAMN LV PVP CAP ON SZ, SOE!<br />
<br />
<br />
discuss.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>morbbidd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Why gimp that server anymore with a gay level restriction? I just think your bitter because you met some &quot;greifers&quot; and had a bad time. I just got bored with the killing and getting killed. Simple solution to this tho...DONT FUCKING PLAY ON THAT SERVER.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Treznor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">hehe just quit out</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>scaledge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Actually I quit almost a year ago.<br />
<br />
I was posting this for the benefit of those who haven't done so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>ZilshasisEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Lol Well scaledge, Time for a history lesson.<br />
<br />
You see, when Sullon Zek was opened and people realized the teams were grossly uneven (Evil had a good 50-60%, neutrals a 30-40% and the rest were good) alot of us started to worry. <br />
And sure enough, not a week after release were the hordes of iksar from Kunark over us. The thing was, there was so many of them that the good team could not really move anywhere but the few newbie zones they had, and even then we were loosing the fight. Because while we were able to fend off the few that attacked us already hundreds of others were exping away safely from any harm or interupts. I remember when Ruin first came to Mistmoore, I was about level 20 at the time. I put in a good number of hours and were amongst the top of the good when they came. How they managed to get to level 37-42 was beond me :) But it was clear of the advantage they had by then already.<br />
<br />
Then of course you had Kronar, an at the time level 50something necromancer who wanted to prove the point system was wrong. He took out the Crushbone zone and held it there for about ten days stright I believe. Good thing I was higher than what Crushbone had to offer, and that I was european. Because if he were on, chances were not good of you exping in there, and since you really had no other place to go you might as well just log. The good team lost many players those days out of sheer frustration over not being able to go anywhere and do something about it. Which in turn further disrupted the playing field since many of them just jumped to the evil team where they could still do a little PKing and just have fun the rest of the time.<br />
<br />
So Excuse me if I'm not here to support your claim of removing the level limit, because people like you made SZ what it is today. <br />
<br />
It could have been so much more, Just a shame SoE didn't touch it with a pole. Ah well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">zil how did he contribute to make SZ what it is today? He wasn' that high lvl necro or whatever i mean im kinda confused by that statement...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">How about if you don't like the rule set on SZ... don't play on SZ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kyfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You seem pretty charged up for someone who quit a year ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Naubi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Sullon Zek is good... it keeps the closet psychopaths in front of their PC where they can't really hurt anyone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kompleet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Theres a reason why SZ has the lowest population of any server besides Stormhammer. The worst of the worst griefers from Vallon Zek went there. I played there the first coupld weeks it was out but didnt enjoy it. I prefer a PvE with PvP, not PvP with some PvE. It may have been a good concept on paper but it didjt translate well.<br />
<br />
If you dont like it there dont play there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>sunholder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">SZ is more a Griefing Server than a PvP, especially at pre-50s level. <br />
<br />
SZ allows 3 characters per account, so if someone is Bind-camping you, log an alt. (I have a lvl.6 alt I use just to taunt and annoy the Griefers. Here is a trick, level an alt to 6th, Bind him in SH, hang around guards on way to PC. As high level guy goes by, smack him, guard will kill you both, high level guy looses XPs but you don't. I do this to annoying Griefers that target peeps heading to PC).<br />
Also, I use my lvl.6 guy to scout a zone. If new peeps in zone, log scout, walk to new guys, if they kill your scout then they are Griefers.<br />
<br />
Think of SZ as a very dangerous Server, where High Level peeps are your main worry. This makes it a much more challenging server, where you have to learn new tricks. Also, I find that I will go to far-off places in Zones that I never bothered with on Blue-Server.<br />
<br />
And like Naubi said earlier, this Server keeps a lot of psychopaths off the street. Many peeps here just love killing those that are less weak than them, guess it makes them feel powerful?? Probably same guys that like to pull the wings off of flies, and throw rocks at cats.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Medzgaleer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Are the teams still unbalanced?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ghismonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">My friends and I started some neutrals over there, and run as a pack.  Being untwinked and sharing all of our xp 6 ways, we're only level 5 so far, so I'm no expert on the matter.  But if you want a real change or distraction, SZ is like a different planet compared to blue servers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>ETHY</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Originally posted by Medzgaleer <br />
Are the teams still unbalanced?  <br />
<br />
At the high end, yep. HATE, the servers top guild just killed quarm the other night. no body else is even EP flagged yet.<br />
<br />
HATE only comes out to pvp when there is nothing else going on really. The rest of the teams seem pretty even IMHO. Evenso, the goods and nuets complain that the evils have three instadeath classes, and that its not fair, maybe so.<br />
<br />
Griefing seems to be done more by goods and nuets because they cant progress any further in content. They  also seem to be better at it because of all the trackers they have.  <br />
<br />
all in all, I have a good time and usually good conversation, no matter what team there on. Just have to ignore the 12 year olds sending the &quot;pwned joo&quot;  and &quot;owned tells heh.<br />
<br />
sorry for spelling :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>ZilshasisEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Aye, Few could boast having changed the server in such a way as fansy.<br />
<br />
I'll always consider Hate the second rated guild they were back then. Holding on to their precious Skyshine faction while farming Gozz for tears. Ah such memories.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>scaledge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Actually fansy probably caused more changes than any single classes complaints overall.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Best PvP game out there was UO (Ultima Online), nothing beats UO's tradeskill, PvP and shits, SOE really has to learn<br />
<br />
UO was best PvP BEFORE the reputation system updates btw</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>brian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Guys...  Fansy and Blart are teh same person.  and yes he's a golden god IRL.<br />
<br />
PVP on SZ is deity based and hard-coded, so no x-teaming...  no play-nice rules, and no GMS ever come to help you at all, even if you are the victim of racism...<br />
<br />
there is FoH on Rallos too, and they are a very good (scary good) team indeed.<br />
<br />
nezzka you might want to pk on Rallos instead if you only play occasionally you can pk effectively with a lvl 9 or lvl 15 or lvl 22 and be a gnome or whatever you think is cool.<br />
<br />
yes i am FoH 4 life</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>morbbidd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I was in FoH on RZ,Idoubt i still am since my toon was inactive for a long time.Best damn guild I ever joined tho,Loyalty,friendship and a fucking fun time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Plenty of x-teaming going on. sure, no healing or &quot;grouping&quot; between the different teams, but that is pretty much the only limits. kei, HoV and other buffs can be givin across teams by simply dueling each other.<br />
<br />
Currently TOW (the top nuet guild) and Black Profecy (the top good guild) are fighting side by side against the evil team.</div></div><hr />
