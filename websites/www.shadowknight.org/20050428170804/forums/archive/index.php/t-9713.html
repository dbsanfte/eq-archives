<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tarniq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok. First, i know i am going to get a lot of people mad or wondering what i am thinking. But i have a character in mind kinda, just not sure what is best for gnome sk. Couple of questions. 1) What is better for a gnome sk to use, 1 Handed Slash or 2 Handed Slash. 2)Where should creation points go? I thank those that help me out.</div></div><hr />

1) You want (all) both 1hs and 2hs, use 1hs(b/p)/shield combo while being the MT of your group and 2hs(b/p) while being puller/SA/dps in a group.  Generally speaking you'll want to be using 2hs(b/p) while you are soloing (fear kiting) so you can get casts in between swings, it's also a rule of thumb that using a 2hander provides more DPS than a 1hander.<br />
<br />
2) Make sure agi is above 75 (I don't know if it starts that way or not) then put the rest into STAmina.  I'm a believer that HP &gt; all, so this is just my opinion, I'm sure there are arguements in a few ways here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tarniq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I thank you for replying. I went 15 into sta to bring it up to 90 and the rest into str giving a 75. agi started at 85. going to try for a Darkedged Two Hander for 2hs (23/40, str 6, int 6, mana 20) and have a Centi SS for 1hs. Thanks again for the reply.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gnax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">if ya wanna think about 2hb, pickup a deathbringer rod or soulbinder cheap in bazaar ... Tae Ew War Maul is a great 2hb for the price once you get 51.<br />
<br />
and who can pass up a 1hb MOSS for ~120p?  19/29 +10int ... jeezums.  i used that from 1st lvl to 40ish when i started really working hard on 2hb.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Carter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I really DO try hard not to flame people, it's their choice on a computer GAME.  <br />
<br />
Sure, I enjoy making fun of gnomes/rangers/druids/bards..but /shrug who cares, it is a game, and when people have an actual question, it's nice to show at least a bit of respect and give them an actual answer.</div></div><hr />

Heh.  I'm shocked as well ... normally by this point, all the Trolls &amp; Ogres have deficated all over the thread and painted catchy slogans like &quot;guhnomerz sukk&quot; on the walls.<br />
<br />
SKs with restraint ... whats next?  HT for pallies??</div></div><hr />

That's a pretty good breakdown, since you have 108 INT and 85 AGI/DEX.  Gnomes have a pretty good stat layout if you spend your points right, plus they taste great on toast ( &lt;-- obligatory gnome-as-food remark ).<br />
<br />
I'd get every skill increased, if possible.  I find that it is possible to keep two skills maxed until around level 25-27, then you will find it pretty easy to keep three skills maxed, and one or two others increasing, until around level 36-37, when the skill increases begin to really slow down.  At level 39, your weapon skills cap at 200, and the caps don't increase again until level 51.  So you have all of those levels in which to max them all if you wish.<br />
<br />
My 52 SK has 1HS/2HS at 206, 1HB at 200, piercing at 199, and 2HB at 139.  My 30 SK has maxed his 1HS/1HB/2HS (155) and has 2Hb at 52 and piercing at 70.  Trying keeping them all at some level that isn't too far behind, because it is aggravating to use a 2HB weapon at level 40 with a skill of 5. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gwenix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Good luck with that 75str. I know there's alot of str stuff but it's still a pain if it starts too low imo. I'd get some velium weapons the cheap and magic using those higher damage weapons at lower levels will hurt you as you'll be killing things too fast and you're skills will lag.<br />

 Either choose one because you want a greater challenge (a true SK) or you just relate more to that particular one.<br />
 I play a Erudite SK and she is currently level 61. I love the class and refuse to think that a few more points in STR or STA, or the ability to regen or bash. Will make or break the enjoyment of the game for me.<br />
<br />
The different races seem to just change the way you play the class in one of two ways, Either your more of a Caster (more efficient Soloer and group member IMO) Or you are more of a MT,<br />
But really either way you go, The class is the best out there.<br />
I retired a level 52 Paladin a year ago because I found that the SK I started was just so much more fun.<br />
 A friend of mine made a Gnome Sk and she seems to really like playing him over her 61 Cleric, And make sure you check out the Gnome Specific Tinkered Armor,, some of that stuff is very amayzing and will easily make up for any concerns you have on stats<br />

<br />
That's the best advice that anyone has posted.  Nothing else matters.<br />
<br />
Stats are easily obtainable at higher levels.  I don't have any problems with my strength or stamina.  I have 168 strength and 219 stamina unbuffed as a gnome.  I could have more, but it's kind of a moot point, because buffs are just ganna cap ya anyway.<br />
<br />
Clockwork armor is a nice addition for soloing or grouping.  I use the 30str buff on the gloves when soloing or in a group without a shammy.  Also, the 30dex from the boots stacks with all other buffs.<br />
<br />
Play what's fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Polite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Stamina stamina stamina!!!<br />
<br />
Put all 20 points into this stat on the character select screen or you will find  it somewhat difficult to raise it or keep it above 100 in the early goings.<br />
<br />
Strength can easily be overcome by str items (extremely common) or you can always buy a woven frostgiant beard (5 charges 40str buff) in the bazaar for 5-15 plat.<br />
<br />
I personally almost always use my 2 hander (real men swing 2 handers!) but i wouldnt neglect the sword and shield approach especially with some of the nice shields and 1 handers that have become available in recent expansions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kronicblu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">would have to agree on my gnome sk i put everypoint into stam with my gear my str is now a big 105! wooo but that is a +30 on items..  Also make sure you get ever WT reduction bag you can get your hands on this has helped me out alot<br />
<br />
as far as weapons I have allways carried 1hander and shield with 2hander depends on situation..  If you ac cap is not yet reached 1hander and clay shild is great if you are MT for a group.</div></div><hr />
