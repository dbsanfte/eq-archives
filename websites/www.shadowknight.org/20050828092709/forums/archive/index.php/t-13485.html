<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aelali</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 03:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was curious if there was anyone on the E-mar server that had the mirror and would be willing to MQ it for me. As I understand Dusella is pretty much an instant kill, at least on my server (so I'm told), since the MQ of the urn is so valueable (Someone told me about 120k, though he could be wrong) <br />
<br />
So, to avoid dragging my guild there time and time again hoping to get there with Dusella up, I wanted to try and find a MQ of it. So, if you have it to MQ and are on the E-mar server send me a /tell Aelali in game or post here and let me know and how much you would charge so I can figure out if I can afford it.</div></div><hr />
