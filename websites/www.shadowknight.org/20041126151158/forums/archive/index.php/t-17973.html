<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>TelimTor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Levels 51-53: Lower Guk, Cobalt Scars, Sol B, *Tower of Frozen Shadow, Dreadlands, Burning Woods, Trakanons Teeth, City of Mist, *Sebilis, Chardok, *Howling Stones, Maidens Eye, Skyshrine, Dawnshroud, Wakening Lands, Twilight Sea, Scarlet Desert, *The Hole, Highkeep <br />

I'm 50, we've done the spectrals in TT, that was way slow.  We were thinking of heading to BW.  <br />
<br />
Would really like to find a steady stream of undead so the NEC can work the slows.  Would also like some room to fear kite if/when my health gets low.  Is there a spot that covers it all?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Putrid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Since you are duoing, you might try the initiates in Gunthak or the back of the armory in Dulak.  The initiates are extremely easy to fear kite, there are 6 of them and easy to single pull to the side.  None are undead but being able to fear kite them makes them very easy.  The armory is doable but has more risk.<br />
<br />
At 54 I did some duoing with a necro in Maiden's eye.  There are undead in areas of the zone.  Again fear kiting is doable. <br />
<br />
In early 50's I also did some duoing with a necro in the City of mist.  There are groups of undead there, stable etc. <br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>TelimTor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ah, LoY zones, I haven't set foot in one yet... guess it's time to change that.  It's just a long CR and on pvp server, there will always be CR... <br />
<br />
CoM sounds good too, will have to check that out.  <br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

Remeber royal guards cant be feared nor the King of above (cant be snared either if i remeber correctly).  Can bind in Shadowheaven (not sure if thats good or bad on pvp thought), really close to nexus and pok for kei.</div></div><hr />
