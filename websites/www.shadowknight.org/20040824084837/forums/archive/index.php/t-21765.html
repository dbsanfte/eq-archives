<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Moonslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There was about one week where the FOH trolls all made accounts there and were spamming the crap out of the Olg-Anon boards, the picture was actually posted about 3 times but like I said the longest it was up was about 25 minutes, and what ended up happening was pretty much everyone who registed an accounts on OGA forums within like one week had their IP's banned, if memory serves.<br />
