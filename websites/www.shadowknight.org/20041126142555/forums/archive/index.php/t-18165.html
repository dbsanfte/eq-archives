<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mnemenoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just hit lvl 15, got my darkness and fear spells, and wanna go fear somewhere where I can raise my weapons skills.  Any suggestions?  Also, I have 1hs maxxed.  I want to max 2hs.  Should I worry about 2hb and/or 1hb?  Is it worth to raise those two?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Any wide open outdoor zone should be good.  Old world zones are preferred, as the mobs don't hit as hard compared to the equipment now available.  I'd suggest maybe SRo, in the green area around the orcs, or Oasis on the south side of the Spectre tower.  Hell, if you're not an evil race, you could probably go do something in or around the Karanas too.<br />
<br />
Keep your skills all maxed.  There are plenty of good weapons out there of all skill types, and you never know what might fall into your lap.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ziglug D</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, you could do the normal thing and tank, thats what im doing, u can tank and have a shitty weapon...I got my 1hb to 150 in like 4 adventures and I was tanking, the group wont mind as long as ur holding aggro bro...Maybe at you'r lvl...But not once u hit HHK prolly, they wont mind...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Pardon me if I'm wrong, Zig, but don't LDoN Adventures usually depend on high dps and pulling large groups at a time?  So you're saying that if you're not doing any dps, as long as you've got solid aggro, your group won't mind?<br />
<br />
/shrug<br />
<br />
I'd say he's better off staying out of LDoN Adventures and doing what he said he though he should do (fear kiting in open outdoor zones) until he gets a bit higher and gets some utility, and he's much better off keeping his skills up while he's still young than waiting until his 50's and then working them up.  I made that mistake, apparently you did too, and now we're a drain on the dps of any group we join if we are trying to skill up on their time.  Luckily I have a RL friend that I often duo with, and he doesn't care, but I'd be hesitant to try and skill up on any random group's time.  It's just inpolite at the best, and can get you black listed at the worst.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Malaclypse</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah but. Ya didnt answer one of his questions, and Im interested to know as well. Should we work on maxxing 1hb and 2hb, or is that really just a waste of time?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dharkenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">unless u got one laying around dont worry about it till u get at least 50+<br />
<br />
when u r 50+, its always a good time to work on skills, while u r lfg waiting forever for a grp just go to where another grp is and wack on thier mobs...make sure u assist thier tank..<br />
<br />
i usually do this when bored and want to play with my bow....ask them for haste and u will normally get it...be nice and u never know u might get int he grp haha</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kuamak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Take a look at the prices of 1hb and 2hp weapons in the bazaar and compare them to the prices of 1hs, 2hs weapons.<br />
There are some good weapons out there in lesser used skills.<br />
I got my takish hiz sandworkers mallet for 1k. An equivalent 1hs weapon would probably be 10k or more. Got my heart set on a heavy windriders lance next.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">1)  If he's only lvl 15 there are no LDoN adventures for him yet.<br />
<br />
2) Keep all skills maxed.  yes later on you'll wind up using 2 handers most.  Don't forget about pircing either.  Not the best weapon selection but if something drops that would be better than anything you have you don't want to not use it because your skill sucks.    Or maybe I just love my heave Iron spike too much....<br />
<br />
3) Places to go:  Warrens, Kurns Tower</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Anash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If I wasnt MT in a group and we had a haster I would switch to my lower skills, If we had a bad pull id switch back to my maxed weapon, this usually worked out fine for me, I have most of my skills up but one handers, good luck and have fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Just as an FYI, I remember when I hit lvl 15, I'd imagined that I would be Mr. Super Necro Melee; fear kiting with the pet while whacking on it's back.  Rinse Repeat, rake in that xp!<br />
<br />
Well... from what I recall, it didn't quite work out that way.  I'd start off with Clinging Darkness and try to land a snare, then switch over to casting Fear.  By the time I landed a Fear, CD would be wearing off (duration is pretty short), so I'd have to recast that, plus the snare component is very low at this level... so Jabober and the mob are generally out of melee range while you are casting (well, unless you are getting stunned and interrupted), especially if you hadn't had a chance to refresh CD yet.  Combine that with Jabober's low level and the pathing changes for Fear, you may suddenly have an add(s).<br />
<br />
So at the end of the fight, you are OOM, low health (unless you lifetapped for a whopping 18 hp per cast), pet usually dead (so there goes some more mana) and realize you could probably have melee'd a couple mobs in the time it took you to fear kite.<br />
<br />
Heheh, don't get me wrong, fear kiting is great -- later on.  It just didn't seem worthwhile at lvl 15 from what I remember.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Satist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Soloing to raise weapon skills means...  stay away from Kurn's and PC..  the xp bonus in here means that even soloing, you're outleveling your skills, unless you have an insane dex...  EK, WK, SK, and Lake Rathe are all very viable options.  The hermit in Lake rathe is excellent...  constant level 15 spawn.  6 minute spawn timer.  Drops water, sp, cp...  only thing is, you can't fearkite him, there just isn't enough room.  But, he'll patiently sit there in his little tent, waiting for you to pull him.... so, just darkness, and tank, tapping as you can.  keep him darknessed, as he will run at around 20%.  You can easily work him to 20, working the various skills in the progress.  EK, WK, various animals for  trying out fearkiting.  odds are, you'll be tanking em more than fearkiting, unless you spend several manabars casting fear on bonehead, to bring your skill up high enough that it doesn't fizzle.  Stay away from the Karana zone bandits at this level, as they will add...  <br />

edit:  just before dinging 28, i maxxed 1hs, by going the FoB, Kurn's, PC route to 26...  and I have to agree with what was said, you have plenty of time if you are soloing, to raise your skills...   start with one skill, get it maxxed, ( which will be in yourr mid to late 20s) then as you level keep it maxxed, and slowly branch out.  As SKs, we are part warrior, so eventually, you will prolly want all your skills maxxed, but it doesn't have to be right away.  I can almost guarantee they'll be maxxed by time you hit  the mid 40's</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Squigle D'Muerte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">At 15 forget about your weapon skills.  They aren't a concern.  Just level.  Go to Padual Caverns and get to 25 in a couple days.  At 15 come in from shadeweavers thicket side lots to kill there avoid fiends unless you have someone with you to cure disease or have natural regen.  At 17/18 get in a bandit group from the Shadow Haven side and you will level to 25 in no time at all.<br />
<br />
Up to 25/30 you can level quite fast and keeping all weapon skills up it hard.  40+ you level so much slower that maintaining (and gaining skills from 0) is so easy there really isn't a point to doing it earlier.  I play a troll so skills go up about the slowest of any race and tanking 40+ the skill increases come fast.<br />
<br />
So pick your best weapon go out there and level.  Once you hit mid levels you can worry about swapping weapons out but honestly I never worked on a weapon skill till I got a new weapon I wanted to use.  At higher levels especially when fear kiting, it may reduce damage a bit for a while but you  skill up pretty fast.  I recently skilled up from 200 to 235 in about 2 hours solo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Rhumba_Kween</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">There really is no reason to raise a weapon skill, simply to raise it. IF you get a great weapon for that skill, then work on it.<br />
<br />
At 65, my 2hb was in the 30s. I got a great 2hb weapon and started working on my skills. The higher level you are, the easier it will be to have high dex. As a result, I went from the 30's to max in about 7 hours of play time in normal groups.<br />
<br />
It's simply not worth it at lower levels. Wait till you get that weapon that beats everything you have, then you will want to raise that skill. Otherwise, its not worth the hassle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Yes, I say keep all skills up.<br />
<br />
No, don't just keep them up to keep them up.<br />
<br />
Keep all your skills out to find different weapons, and combinations you like for different situations.  <br />
<br />
It's great to read here and find out what sort of weapons you need for different roles, it's better to go out there and try for yourself and see what you think.<br />
<br />
Try all sorts of items so you develop a uniqueness to your character, you may have more fun than you would if you used what everyone else uses, or you may not,  but you should find out.<br />
<br />
I found out I really dig Keevel with his 2HP Heavy Iron Spike (I get alot of milage on him about being the black SK with the big stick), never thought I would, and yes I plan to take advantage of cheaper prices for lesser used skills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Androsulach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Well, in the 20's up to about 35ish you can use bards for weapons practice.  I started killing Travis Two Tones in Nek at 23 and used him as a practice dummy when I was hom.  Before Grobb was overrun in frogs, I used to pop between Innothule and Feerrott to kill the bards there.  They were good exp and great practice until 35ish.  At 25th, which Travis and the others were, they didn't dual wield their fists.  So they didn't put up too much of a fight.  From there, I bounced around until 37 when I discovered cave basilisks in Jaggedpine.  They hit a bit harder, but will give you plenty of practice pulling, tapping, as well as keeping your skills up.  I moved on to Underbulks in the Deep side of Echo Caverns at 44th and was there until 50th or so. Again, they hit hard, but it helps maintain the skills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Atlis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Keep all the skills up.  In the future, you may come across:<br />
<br />
piercing - Heavy Windrider's Lance<br />
2hb - Greatstaff of Four Winds<br />
2hs - War Marshall's Bladed Staff<br />
1hs - Soul Defiler / Greenmist<br />
1hb - Hoarfrost hammer.<br />
<br />
That stuff is pre-elemental difficulty and/or bazaar material.<br />
<br />
To go along with your 1h weapons, you may come across a Glowing Orb of the Stormwatcher, or some other very nice shield.<br />
<br />
You can get the undead fear spell and fear kite with that.  It will save a ton of mana, which you will need since your weapon skills will not let you do much damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Maicom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">skills are overrated... took me 2~3 exp groups at 65 to get my 2hb from 3~225. just level and when you get a good weapon in a skill you don't have use it till it maxes... seriously isn't that big a deal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>StPatrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Seriously.. I'm level 26 DEF SK, have no idea why everyone is saying &quot;max your skills, max your skills&quot;.. What, is it a new mantra? Maicom (and few others) is right - when you get the weapon, work on it. Don't waste your time maxing all the weapon skills, doh. An example:<br />
<br />
I had a 1hs sword (9 DMG +stats), used it since level 1, at level ~20 got the skill around 100 (can't remember how much for sure). At 21-22 got a new weapon - 1hb mace, which does 19 damage.. As you can understand I have 0 (zero!) in 1hb. So what? I did MORE damage than I did with sword. And the skill now near 80 in 2 days in PC. So what it is all about?</div></div><hr />
