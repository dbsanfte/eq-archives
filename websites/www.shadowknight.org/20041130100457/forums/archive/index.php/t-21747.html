<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kritr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey, have not been in this board for a bit. <br />
<br />
Since my last post I finally killed RZ and Sol ro and I can say I finally have  fully EP access and heading to TIME. <br />
<br />
Last nite the guild was doing some back flagging and doing RZ and I noticed for the first time my HP was 8353. I said to myself what the heck is this? <br />
<br />
So far fully raid buffed I was 8071. I thought this must be a bug or something. Then I notice that I had BSS and COL at the same time. That would be the difference in my HP. In the past COL and BSS could not be used at the same time, meaning if I used COL had to forget to use BSS, or if I decided to use BSS as it would give me a bit more HP could not use my own COL. <br />
Then last night surprise, both COL and BSS at the same time.<br />
<br />
So the  question is: is this a bug? I hope not.<br />
<br />
Or is this a new fix to the way spells can be used?<br />

Changes in the patch now allow the stacking of the 2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kritr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Oh, that is great! I was scared it was a bug and they were going to take it back. This is a good move.<br />
<br />
Now they need to make the sk / pet weapon drop more often in POW. So far after two months of hunting there I can not get it. <br />
