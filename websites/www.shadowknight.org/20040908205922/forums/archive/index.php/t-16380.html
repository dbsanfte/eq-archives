<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>xorrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Im just wondering, can a single group say like 50+ take out most of the mobs? i mean its old world stuff and tier 1 mobs hit the same if not harder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Duke Xerro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think so, maybe its different now after patch?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Apokx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Probably not.<br />
A single group of well equipped 65's could<br />
<br />
A group of 50+(I assume anything from 50-59ish) would die horribly as Lhranc ate their souls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Goregan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">after completeing my IC, everything can be done with 1 group EXCEPT Lhranc, this dude is still the meanest mother fucker in Kunark and do not underestimate him!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">No.  A single group of 50s, with gear such that they're working on epics, could not break into fear and kill the golems.  Nor would you have the damage to keep ahead of repops when moving through the Hole to the undead tower.  If you can get help with those parts, as well as Lhranc, its possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Oopsies</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i call Lhranc a sissy and spit on his shoes, that dude was over rated, we engaged, my heart pounding so damn fast, then i Manaburned him with a Friends bot Wiz, a Super HT and i dont even know if the Necro got Lifeburn off, and poof, i got exp...what a joke :P</div></div><hr />

Yeah, sure he's easy these days cause he has low HPs... try taking him out without such things at hand and he's much harder.  When I did my epic I spent most of the evening and night till about 3am trying to beat him until eventually another raid heading for shammy epic mobs came in and kindly lent a hand (we'd got him to 40% on the last try anyway so it was certain to work with them helping... still got several deaths however).<br />
<br />
Lhranc isn't hard cause of his HPs, he's hard cause he has higher damage output than a NToV dragon, which in Kunark was very high indeed.</div></div><hr />
