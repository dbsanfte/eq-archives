<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Felmid Skyesong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been messing around with my baby Erudite SK.  Created the character long ago around Velious launch.  I also have an Erudite necro that spent alot of time in Dalnir.  Necro has his Visceral dagger from back when that item was nice.<br />
<br />
Bottom line, I'm wondering if my Erudite necro(with non-kos faction) can mq visceral dagger part of the quest for my Erudite SK?  So far, I'm not seeing any reason why I can't.  <br />
<br />
Suggestions are welcome.  Currently my lil erudite sk has just out leveled Dalnir and I'd rather not spend more time than absolutely necessary in the 'church' area since I remember this camp with my necro.  And it was horrible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Trezzt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">As long as the SK has the Crusader’s Khukri, I don't see why not.  You're lucky, not too many folks have a Visceral Dagger sitting around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Felmid Skyesong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks.  That's about what I figured.  And yes, I am lucky to have one still sitting around.  Must have been a dozen times I almost deleted that thing on necro.  But each time, I thought back to how much time I spent on it and couldn't bring myself to hit 'destroy'  ;)</div></div><hr />
