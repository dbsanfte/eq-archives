<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Potato</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all,<br />
<br />
I just recently visited TSW website and found an interesting post, so I would like to share it with you all (even though many of you already read this)<br />
<br />
Quote<br />
________________________________________________<br />
<br />
Warriors have been crying for groups have chosen knights over them. Well, I think it is perfectly logical for many this reason:<br />
<br />
According to history, knights are always superior than warriors in all ways (remember that &quot;Every knight is a warrior, but not all warrior can be knighted&quot;). Therefore, it is perfectly fine that knights should be picked over warriors since they are always superior.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think that all knights SHOULD have the same amount of hps and AC as warriors, plus their combat skills -duel wield, doulbe attack, etc- should also be at least the same as wars (or even higher since knights are supposed to be a superior warrior). Also, they should receive all of the war's disciplines.<br />
<br />
Now, I know that all of you warriors will yell up &quot;Hey, that isn't fair. You throw the balance off the hook&quot; Blah blah blah. But hey, there is a hierachy in very where you go, and if you want to be as powerful as a knight, then delete your war and start a knight!<br />
<br />
Now, I know some body will yell up from the background &quot;Then why on earth make a warrior class? You may as well remove the warrior class from the game&quot;. No offense to you wars, but I think a well played knight takes much much more effort to achieve than a well played warrior since knights are more diverse and more complex in design than warriors. So, if you just want to log on to do some slashing and take some beating, and have an easy time, then go ahead and play a war. However, if you want to do more than just tanking. You want to be able to help the chanter in ground control, to assist the cleric in healing, etc, then play a knight since it is more versatile.<br />
<br />
To be honest, I think that Veran should, at the beginning of the game creation, makes all paladin/shadow knight start out as regular warriors. Then, after they level up for awhile, and if they want to achieve their knightly status, they have to pass some kinda tests (like have to go through the leveling with twice as slow as a regular war, do some very hard quests, etc) before they can receive their spells and become a knight. I think Veran realize that, but what is done can't be undone, so they make EQ2 to make up for that (we all know that in EQ2, after level 20 or so i can't remember atm, the char has a choice to pick which class to specilize in).<br />
<br />
Nerfing a knight? Heck, it doesn't sound right. Instead, knights should all receive warrior's combat skills and defensive skills.<br />
<br />
Let me repeat:<br />
<br />
&quot;ALL KNIGHTS ARE WARRIOR, BUT NOT ALL WARRIOR CAN BE KNIGHTED&quot;.<br />
<br />
Dito -- <br />
<br />
Take it easy, folks. This is just a game after all  :D<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Belyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There is a fix for warriors being able to get groups and it already exists.  Simply keep your health at more than one bub of life and less than 2.  While bezerk you will take substantially less damage and your dps will go up with crazy crippling blows.  Far as aggro goes, when your life bar is that low you could hold aggro with a cracked staff.  Once people see this being done warriors will be proclaimed as Gods and there will be a cry across the land for the need of a nerf.  <br />
Grant it there is no room for any suck factor in doing this, however, stop asking for more when you dont even use what ya have.  A warrior with high end luclin and velious gear (7500+hps)could do this easily on easy ldon missions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
According to history, knights are always superior than warriors <br />
<br />
This guy uses history to support his claim that EQ knights &gt; EQ warriors. Well, I'd like to see a single example of a knight who'd cast spells(!) in combat in any historical battle or campaign. He can't exactly say that EQ is a fantasy game once he started using history as his justification.<br />
<br />
a well played knight takes much much more effort to achieve than a well played warrior <br />
<br />
Try holding agro without casting any spells, then come back and preach about skills. The fact that the skillsets are different don't raise one over the other.<br />
<br />
ALL KNIGHTS ARE WARRIOR<br />
<br />
There are dozens of people running around Europe right now who have been knighted by some country or another, usually Britain. It's usually a reward for an achievement of some sort, be it scientific, political, or cultural. Usually NOT martial. So the claim he's built his argument on flies out the window...<br />
<br />
This guy's a troll, I'm pretty sure the people at TSW realized that pretty soon after he posted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hehe, and once we go bezerk we can be healed upto 40% without loosing bezerk.<br />
<br />
Good warrior UIs show both the &quot;kick off&quot; and loose beserk lines in there HP bars.<br />
<br />
Besides I would happily stack Roman legioners, Alexander's catahpacts, muslim warriors and janissaries, cossaks, tartars, samuri and viking raiders against any knights you care to come up with.<br />
<br />
Of course to have knights in EQ would require Christianity and the not rampant paganism we have now...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kirhouk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">wow,<br />
what a retarded post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lejina Bloodbath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Sir Elton John is indeed a fearsome warrior.<br />
<br />
:rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Sir Elton John is indeed a fearsome warrior.<br />
<br />
No no no! <br />
<br />
He's Sir, meaning he's been knighted. He's not one of our fearsome warriors, he is a fearsome knight.<br />
<br />
I will leave you to decide if SK or Pally. :p.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Lejina Bloodbath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well, i was going with the idea :<br />
ALL KNIGHTS ARE WARRIOR<br />
<br />
If Elton John is a knight, then he is a warrior?<br />
Right?<br />
<br />
Or did i get fooled somewhere?! :confused:</div></div><hr />

 <br />
<br />
Music by Elton John<br />
Lyrics by Bernie Taupin<br />
Available on the album Goodbye Yellow Brick Road<br />
   <br />
 <br />
<br />
It's getting late have you seen my mates<br />
Ma tell me when the boys get here<br />
It's seven o'clock and I want to rock<br />
Want to get a belly full of beer<br />
<br />
My old man's drunker than a barrel full of monkeys<br />
And my old lady she don't care<br />
My sister looks cute in her braces and boots<br />
A handful of grease in her hair<br />
<br />
Don't give us none of your aggravation<br />
We had it with your discipline<br />
Saturday night's alright for fighting<br />
Get a little action in<br />
<br />
Get about as oiled as a diesel train<br />
Gonna set this dance alight<br />
`Cause Saturday night's the night I like<br />
Saturday night's alright alright alright<br />
<br />
Well they're packed pretty tight in here tonight<br />
I'm looking for a dolly who'll see me right<br />
I may use a little muscle to get what I need<br />
I may sink a little drink and shout out &quot;She's with me!&quot;<br />
<br />
A couple of the sound that I really like<br />
Are the sounds of a switchblade and a motorbike<br />
I'm a juvenile product of the working class<br />
Whose best friend floats in the bottom of a glass</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Maboodi Itzabigg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Patato is stuck half way between EQ and D&amp;D. No doubt he prolly plays D&amp;D on the side. What he is chewing on is called multi-classing but Pallies in D&amp;D aren't mult-classed characters.  Its called thinking creatively, taking influences for outside sources to improve the game.<br />
<br />
Also in the spirit in which it was intended, all knights are warriors that recieved a calling from god to achieve a higher/darker purpose. Of course this is EQ we are taking about and far be it for Verant to roleplay in their game development.<br />
<br />
Lastly the &quot;multi-class&quot; idea doesn't work in EQ because the level cap is too easy to attain. The point of multi-classing in D&amp;D is that you will be slightly behind your friends but they will still be far shy of the max level.<br />
<br />
Now crush me Shadowknights for I am actually a warrior!!:rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
He is not talking about the D&amp;D multi-class system, he is talking about the actual historical difference between, warriors i.e. trained fighters, and Knights i.e. Wealthy, better trained and equipped, fighters.<br />
<br />
The problem is that EQ classes have nothing in common with the same named &quot;classes&quot; of yore, except that they both wear armor and swing weapons.<br />
<br />
RL knight =! EQ knight<br />
RL warrior =! EQ warrior<br />
<br />
So no effective comparison can be made between them.<br />
<br />
Now crush me Shadowknights for I am actually a warrior!!:rolleyes:<br />
<br />
Get over yourself, we don't give a shit what class you are. As long as you aren't a moron you wont get flamed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Maboodi Itzabigg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Are you Patato also because you claim to know what he is thinking.<br />
<br />
He has yet to reply to this thread and so we really don't know do we?<br />
<br />
I thought that it sounded like that kind of system that he was thinking about because yes in RL NOW knights aren't neccesarily martial. Now 1000 years ago knights were more or less martial.<br />
<br />
And finally I just said I'm a warrior to piss you off because SKs are getting the bum deal around LDoN. I'm actually a cleric and I don't really care what class my tank is... as long as he can taunt off me when I complete heal him at a bad time ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jodgrim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">According to history, knights are always superior than warriors in all ways  <br />
<br />
I don't know what he is thinking, I know what he wrote.<br />
<br />
I'm actually a cleric<br />
<br />
You must play on test then, because trolls can't roll clerics on live servers.<br />
<br />
<br />
edit: After the reception his post got, do you blame him for not coming back?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Maboodi Itzabigg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">First I'd like to say that the lines between reality and fantasy ARE a little blurred in Patato's head.<br />
<br />
Second, when did I say I was a troll? I'm a froglok I eat trolls for breakfast on Vallon.:D <br />
<br />
Last, I think there is no reply because this thread is 2 months old and he stopped reading it /shrug:rolleyes:</div></div><hr />
