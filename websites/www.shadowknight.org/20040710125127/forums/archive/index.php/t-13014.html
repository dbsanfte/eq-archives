<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Amphitryon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ive been noticing small amouts of exp disappearing every now and then<br />
<br />
I use the SARS UI and pay especially clkose attention to the percentage reading of the exp bar. Often, the meter will report me at say 56% at the end of a hunting session (and I have gotten the 'save' message multiple times)<br />
<br />
When I log out and come back later (like next day) the meter will be down by 3% and reporting 53%..I have witnessesed this 4 times now<br />
<br />
Im not sure yet if this a problem with the UI mod properly mapping percentages ot if I actually have exp dissapearing into a hole.<br />
<br />
anyone else seen similar discrepancies in their exp percentage reporting?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>cigarskunk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This is an old bug which they won't even acknowledge exists - what happens is that even if you get the save message, sometimes they lose the info anyway - I've caught this happening with my characters while doing tradeskills - there are three occassions which I've actually noticed/caught when I would log back in after I'd done some skilling only to find that the game lost my last few points.<br />
<br />
Really sucks when you've done several hundred combines and dropped a few hundred to few thousand plat, only to find that the game remembers that you shouldn't have that plat/farmed materials anymore, but has forgotten that you should have a few points higher tradeskill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My theories:<br />
<br />
Similar to the health/hp/mana updates, there seems to be a latency for xp and aaxp for server vs. what you see on the client.  In an effort to speed up aspects of the game, I think SoE has been tweaking/tinkering with the frequency at which these updates and synchronizations occur.<br />
<br />
For example, in a very recent patch, they announced that spending AA points in STA/AdvSTA would now update your hp immediately.  Before this patch, spending a point in STA/AdvSTA would take several minutes before an increase in current and max hp would show up on your display.<br />
<br />
There also seems to be some anomalies when playing with the slider bar for XP and AAXP.  On two of my characters, I decided I would max out my 65 xp bar instead of hanging at 20% like most people do (don't ask, I hate staring at a non-full xp bar I guess).  When I maxed my xp bar at 100%, I wanted to see if I could &quot;fill out that 100%&quot; (i.e. it took x kills to go from 98% to 99% to 100% so I wanted to fill the 100% so that the first time I die, I'm not at 99% again).  Obviously, since I didn't ding lvl 66 nor was there any indication that the xp bar was &quot;moving beyond 100%, I slid the bar to split between xp and aaxp.  I had to med up a bit for a couple minutes, and then when I was fm and ready to pull, I glanced up and my xp bar was at 99% and my aaxp bar had jumped 10%+.  While I acknowledge that this one is explainable (similar to pre-Kunark and pre-Luclin), it was still somewhat evident that the server had made some recalcs and transmitted them to the client with some sort of delay.<br />
<br />
I have no answer, just thought I would pass on a few observations and theorize at what might be happening.</div></div><hr />
