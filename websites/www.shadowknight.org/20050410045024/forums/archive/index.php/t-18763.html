<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Koldariah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey Guys,<br />
<br />
I tried using the search, but couldn't find what I was looking for. I've seen alot of posts mention  'mez-tanking' but I haven't seen one with a really good description of exactly what it is and how you do it.<br />
<br />
I'm going to assume that its likely something that an SK would want to learn how to do, so I'm hoping for a little walk through....Someone wanna enlighten the newb :p<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vezax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Mez tanking is basically tanking adds.<br />
<br />
Sometime it doesnt matter if you kill them.<br />
<br />
Some times it does.  And example is the EMp/HP fighst in ssra.<br />
<br />
Knights are generall chosen for our quick agro ability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Mez tanking basically means you dont want something dead yet, but it isnt mezzable....scripted stuff can sometimes require this.<br />
<br />
Knights can turn attack off and hold aggro with spells, which saves riposte damage on the mez-tank-- depending on amount time that you will be mez tanking and given BoV buff, we have an advantage over warriors (who need to keep swinging).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Koldariah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Coolness :p<br />
<br />
Whats BoV? what level? - Sk is only 49 atm so I don't know all the names for the buffs yet. What spells do you normally use to do this - or does it really matter as long as your keeping aggro? I'm assuming you'd have a healer? or are you tapping?<br />
<br />
Sorry for the 20 questions, I'm in an inquisitive mood :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thakalas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">BoV is Bulwark of Vie, last in the cleric LDoN line of semi-rune spells.  Shaves 10% off of each hit until it absorbs 1600 damage then poofs.  Lower Vie spells take the same percent, just poof after less damage.<br />
<br />
[edit]<br />
Woops, forgot to say it's a level 62 spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Atraleto</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Read my thread a few threads down for an example of mez tankin. Its the offtank for Emperor thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>DConquest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well, there's OT'ing which is described... but there's also another type of &quot; mez tanking &quot; that is very important.  Load Fear, Terror, or any other aggro spell that doesn't involve a DoT and when a sizeable force of mobs are inc or about to pop on your raid, you keep aggro until the mob is mezzed.  This gives time for the chanters to debuff / mez the mobs, and prevents possible Healer deaths.  <br />
<br />
Also, when there are a number of mez'd mobs in camp.  It's a good idea to aggro the hell out of them, so they rush you on break rather than the more fragile caster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Androsulach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">How much aggro can we pile on before breaking mez?  I'm assuming I'd Terror the mob a bit, but beyond that, I'm not sure what I have in my arsenal at 51 that I'd use to insure that it would rush me, rather than our fragile mezzer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Taunt and Terror line work wonders on Mezz'd mobs, but I wouldn't suggest fear at your level.  It also helps to know the mobs you're looking at, as some may be immune to changes in run speed or magic and so dropping a couple of darknesses on them could be ok (think Mummy mobs in MMC adventures).  You could also use some of the non-damaging debuffs for a little extra aggro, though our debuffs don't seem to do a whole hell of a lot, and you might not have the extra spell slots.<br />
<br />
Typically, before breaking Mez, if I'm MA, I'll toss my two biggest terrors simultaneously with a taunt in between, then repeat and drop a CD.  I have yet to let a mob get to the chanter after mez is broken.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Androsulach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Okay, I debuff tap with Siphon Strength, Shroud of Pain, and Shroud of Hate.  I then add Siphon Life for tapping.  Dooming Darkness and Heart Flutter for DPS. For self-buffing I have Scream of Death and Grim Aura.  Granted, the Grim Aura doesn't add much to ATK, but every little bit helps.  For MA work I replace the Heart Flutter with Terror of Shadows.  I've also been known to replace one of the Shrouds with a Spear.  In fact, I may want to use the Spear of Pain with Terror.  At least, I've gotten the impression that disease based DD builds a good amount of hate.  But being on top of a mob hitting it with Terror and weapons will get a mob's attention.</div></div><hr />

I find that sit aggro helps a lot too.  I usually, taunt, sit, stand, terror and use CD to break aggro.  I figure sit aggro works because a lot of times group members get a little too jumpy and break after I terror, but I still have the aggro.  Also, if the mobs have been mezzed and the enchanter attempted to slow a couple times, I'll usually follow up the CD right away with a spear.</div></div><hr />
