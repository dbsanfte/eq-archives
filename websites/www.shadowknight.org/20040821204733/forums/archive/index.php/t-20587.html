<br />
<br />
-edit-<br />
<br />
Wait, you're lvl 60? This means you're prolly using the regular HT.<br />
<br />
This HT is easily resistable, its done on a -200MR check (-200DR check if you use /disc unholy).<br />
<br />
Against a Time equiped character its normal to have the non aa HT resisted.</div></div><hr />

<br />
wow, you're so tough.. guess what. no one cares.<br />
<br />
was he AFK or did you camp the Qinimi / Barindu zoneline, waiting for someone to zone in on low HP?<br />
<br />
Non disc non AA HT is just regular -200 MR. with decent time gear he probably had 350 MR, or probably more, given how Zek players value resists. So its -200 vs 350+5levels difference, and youre surprised it got resisted?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Lejina Bloodbath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">who is HTing in phase3 anyways<br />

The folks with HT up at the begining of Phase3.<br />
<br />
Its called clearing a multiple pull quickly.<br />
<br />
Its not like HT could be better used in the next hour, uh.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Wyrdlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Allow me to explain a few basic things to you Kompleet.<br />
<br />
<br />
Subject Line: Quick HT question in PVP<br />
<br />
I was surprised someone resisted my HT even though they were completely debuffed.  I thought HT was unresistable!<br />
<br />
<br />
This type of question would lead to the polite response explaining how HT resists work, like Lejina gave you.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Subject Line: OMG my HT was resisted in PvP<br />
<br />
WTF thats just so wrong. Im lvl 60, he was a Time equipped 65 Ranger. He was debuffed but yet my HT was resisted. He died anyways, but yeeesh...<br />
<br />
<br />
Response: No Shit.<br />
<br />
<br />
See the difference?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Vincente</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Yeah? Well welcome to the SK boards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Vezax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">They answered your question already, but heres a simple recap.<br />
<br />
at 60 regular ht has a neg 200 magic resist mod, with unholy aura is neg 200 disease resist.  A time level ranger will probably have 300+ resists.  So said ranger will have a resist check of over a 100 over your ht's neg 200 resist mod.  Add in the fact he is 5 levels higher, and he'll resist it more often then not.<br />
<br />
If you dont want it resisted get improved ht =P</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>BrikBludgaard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Just one last thing...<br />
<br />
PvP on a red server and PvP on a blue server are two different things...<br />
<br />
<br />
Red servers its one or more powerful characters attacking a lonely or lower level character.  Red PvP consists of finding some advantage over someone else and exploiting it.  (examples include attacking when they are in the middle of something, or 14 on 1 surprise attacks.)<br />
<br />
Blue servers its one on one with both characters expecting the best and absolute attention from the opponent.<br />
<br />
<br />
PvP'rs on blue servers tend to be better at the latter type of PvP due to their practice and dedication to their own skill.<br />
<br />
I guess redbies would be better at the first method if I could say that it required skill...<br />
<br />
(exception: a single player who defeats TWO equally matched opponents presents some skill...  their knowledge of l33t spl01ts i this case must be recognized.  Also of note, are the rare redbies who practice honorable combat - one on one with equal footing.)<br />
<br />
Due to the above, red servers have never won the final prize for serverwide PvP confrontations... it ALWAYS goes to &quot;bluebies&quot;.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Interesting insight. But you'd have to agree that being clueless about HT resists on a PVP server at L 60 is pretty pathetic, wouldn't you?</div></div><hr />

Just one last thing...<br />
<br />

Yes it is.<br />
<br />
<br />
Red servers its one or more powerful characters attacking a lonely or lower level character.  Red PvP consists of finding some advantage over someone else and exploiting it.  (examples include attacking when they are in the middle of something, or 14 on 1 surprise attacks.)<br />
You are way over-generlizing. I don't run around looking for lower or weaker toons to kill. I rarely start a fight. To assume that everyone on red servers use exploits is just dumb. I don't, I don't even know any and I've been there for four years. Thats not to say that the l33t RPKers (and l33t anti's, too) aren't cowardly, zerg you, etc. But not everyone does. Your incorrect assumption of everyones habits on the zeks makes your other conclusions suspect as well.<br />
<br />
Blue servers its one on one with both characters expecting the best and absolute attention from the opponent.<br />
<br />
<br />
PvP'rs on blue servers tend to be better at the latter type of PvP due to their practice and dedication to their own skill.<br />
<br />
They are better at that kind of PvP, possibly. Because thats the only kind of PvP they ever have to worry about. I zone in somewhere and am expecting to be tashed, slowed, dispelled, nuked and backstabbed all at the same time. Thats what I build my PvP skills around. Not &quot;All buffed up? Got your potions and shit ready? ok good, when Trogabog says go, go, ok?&quot;<br />
<br />
I guess redbies would be better at the first method if I could say that it required skill...<br />
And what about the person who has to fight against these tactics all the time?<br />
<br />
(exception: a single player who defeats TWO equally matched opponents presents some skill...  their knowledge of l33t spl01ts i this case must be recognized.  Also of note, are the rare redbies who practice honorable combat - one on one with equal footing.)<br />
Again, you are assuming eveyone there uses exploits to pull something off. Plain wrong. Not saying it doesn't happen, but it's not a foregone conclusion that someone will.<br />
<br />
Due to the above, red servers have never won the final prize for serverwide PvP confrontations... it ALWAYS goes to &quot;bluebies&quot;.<br />
Two reasons: Yes, the PvP practiced on blue servers is NOT the same as PvP on red servers.<br />
The other reason, You've got about a 20 to 1 or higher population difference between blue servers and red servers. &quot;l33t&quot; PvPer is more likely to be among the group of 20 than the group of 1.<br />

<br />
Which is exacly why it should be used whenever it will make even a minimal difference. Unless Gorenaire is tough for you, HT will not make any kind of noticiable difference in an encounter that could be qualified of tough.<br />
<br />
An HT that is used on a multiple pull in Phase3 can, &quot;maybe&quot;, save the skin of a debuffer or healer, but certainly allow said SK to dish out something like 3 more dps in Phase3.<br />
<br />
An HT that isnt used trought all of Phase3 does jack and shit.<br />
<br />
<br />
HT takes 36min to refresh, you dont have to wait for that one mythical moment where it will save the raid to use it.</div></div><hr />

Some of us are gluttons for punishment. I like knowing I could be jumped at any time, it adds a lot to the game, for me, anyway. You think it's stupid? I think blue servers are fucking boring as hell. Whack that casio-calculator brained AI again, w00t.<br />
Whatever, we all have our preferences. Yours is happy-utopia-everyone gets along-EQ, mine isn't.<br />
Stupid, no, different, sure. It's fun enough for you on a blue server, but don't project your own feelings on it on everyone else. Obviously, it's not fun enough for some.<br />
And just think, I'm giving those angry thirteen year olds the attention they so sorely are in need of, so I can feel good about doing my civic duty, as well. It's a win-win situation.</div></div><hr />

5 lvls, you played your sk last when 60 was the highest lvl, so 4 exp worth of gear missed out on, and prolly like 300 AA's difference, correct if I'm wrong, but isn't that a huge gap to fill?</div></div><hr />

<br />
And guys if you read his first statement he said the 65 ranger was debuffed meaning it probably happened in mass pvp 6-12 on 2 or so im guessing heh, not to hard to do a few nights ago i got ganked by a group of 6 i didn't think were kos, MALO+TASH+chain root + getting chain nuked and attacked heh im not time geared but a time geared sk would of gone down to.<br />
<br />
PVP in EQ keyan isn't the best work of balance but it can be alot of fun. To be honest though horses are ridiculously over powered in pvp along with the difference in gear from time guild members to your average 65.<br />
<br />
Makkon reread his statement it was a mass pvp experience im sure but to be honest look at my gear. Compare that a time guild member and yet i can hold my own one on one against a time guild sk/pally/ranger whatever you want. Majority of the time they call in buddies to attack me. Gear isn't everything, skill and knowing what to do and when to do it are. Majority of the time i fight 2 to 6 people at the same time i dont go down in .5 seconds. And a time guild rouge/warrior will be  running away from me heh. <br />
<br />
Anyways mardrack i believe you were talking about griefing/laming right? Well it goes on, on ever mutliplayer player versus player there is out there been playing jediknightacademy when im bored i hear laming this laming that. Wolfenstien full of laming and bullshit trash talk just like on the red servers. You learn to ignore it or deal with it. Someone talks trash to you well you show them whats up. Kinda starts getting lame when people use there guilds to enforce there bullshit though but thats another story.</div></div><hr />

well its fun if you like , if not dondt play there.<br />
<br />
its totaly unbalanced is no argument , maybe on blue server with many duels yes <br />
<br />
but on pvp server 1 versus 1 is rare and if its happen are you going to whine like &quot;hey i cant win ,your class is better in pvp&quot;<br />
if yes move quickly to blue server or die =).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Makkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Makkon reread his statement it was a mass pvp experience  /shrug he said nothing about the type of encounter it was, just that the &quot;ranger&quot; went down. indirectly implying somehow he caused it to happen.<br />
<br />
im sure but to be honest look at my gear. Compare that a time guild member and yet i can hold my own one on one against a time guild sk/pally/ranger whatever you want. Majority of the time they call in buddies to attack me. take 2 sk; one has 8k unbuffed hp, 300+ resist across the boards, 1800ac wielding say, sews. another sk has 4800 sk, probably low-mid 100s resist, 1200ish ac wielding a dmg=dly weapon. who's gonna win, ignoring HT? thought so.<br />
<br />
Gear isn't everything, skill and knowing what to do and when to do it are.  tell that to casters who can land exactly 0 spells on time geared folk. on non-blue servers necros could probably land lifeburn, sk could land ToI with it's -500 check and aa HT's<br />
<br />
Majority of the time i fight 2 to 6 people at the same time i dont go down in .5 seconds.  you fight 2-6 people by yourself regularly? :-)<br />
<br />
And a time guild rouge/warrior will be running away from me heh.  yeah, until harmtouch is down anyway<br />
<br />
<br />
i agree that gear doesn't substitute for skill, but there are limits to that, plain and simple. when none of your spells land, and you are a caster, what do you do? expect your 3250hp pet who's hitting for 10s to do shit against a melee with 8khp/1800ac unbuffed?<br />
<br />
the thing is not everyone is 300-350 resist across the board, so every encounter varies, even within guilds you can find people with weaker resists and concentrate on them<br />
<br />
my interest in playing on pvp server is up there with EQ itself, which is 0, haven't logged on in weeks</div></div><hr />

Dhantes, it was Kynson the Fire caller from AD. Send him a tell and ask if he got killed in PoV last week and post here to confirm plz :) I was grouped with some people from Aerist when he, Ryunzun, and some other AD ranger attacked.<br />
<br />
I started up my SK again cause my cleric is gimp in pvp and I want to kill people. Yes, I'm way behind on lvls and AA. When I restarted I was lvl 58 with 1AA. After 2 weeks Im 60 with 2AA. Not too bad cause its damned hard to find a group.<br />
<br />
And, Blue server PvP is NOT Red Server PvP. If you never played on VZ you really cant comment. But I tell you, you cant imagine the pleasure of mass pvp. Picture 72 on 72 PvP in PoE or PoFire. Gets laggy but damn its fun. I tried playing on a blue server before, but the lack of danger from other people attacking you at any moment made it kind of boring for me.</div></div><hr />

There's no way in hell you killed an AD ranger while you're lvl 60 one on one.  You may have gotten the &quot;Kill Shot&quot; on him but that's as far as i'd be willing to go.  If nothing else all he'd have to do is stand still and nuke you to death.<br />
Lvl 60 sk with full velious and maybe a little luclin thrown in, max you've got is 4-4.5k hp and around 2.5-3k mana, vs a 6.5-7k unbuffed hp Ranger with 5-5.5k mana, not to mention prolly around 30+ points of regen.  Heh, I know newbies that'd tear you a new ass with an advantage like that.<br />

I think I'm glad that's the case, then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">yah kompleet kynson aint all that does he even have a bah whats the name the dagger that procs unresistable ensnare? When you get 65 you will be able to land Ignite on him, and then tap inbetween jousts never turning your back on him. If he does proc the ensnare just get on horse till it drops. Kinda does suck indoors though got killed by a gimp rouge when it proc'd on me in tov.<br />
<br />
And to makkon, <br />
/shrug he said nothing about the type of encounter it was, just that the &quot;ranger&quot; went down. indirectly implying somehow he caused it to happen. <br />
<br />
Im sure he did melee isn't exactly resistable. But what he did say was that the ranger resisted his HT after being DEBUFFED. Do sk's get serious debuffs?<br />
<br />
take 2 sk; one has 8k unbuffed hp, 300+ resist across the boards, 1800ac wielding say, sews. another sk has 4800 sk, probably low-mid 100s resist, 1200ish ac wielding a dmg=dly weapon. who's gonna win, ignoring HT? thought so. <br />
<br />
I have a perfect example of that when they opened the 75dolllar server transfers with gear i saw a 65 troll sk with full grimors unguilded and attacked him in poi. He went down fast, denied he was a server transfer and proceeded to train the zone out. Also why do you ignore HT both sk's have it and the uber time/ele sk's on my server have used there's on me plenty of times. When fighting a fellow sk if he is the highest priority to kill i dont think twice about blowing my ht on him and when fighting him i keep my health above 75% and he tries to also its a game of who can stay above 75% last.<br />
<br />
tell that to casters who can land exactly 0 spells on time geared folk. on non-blue servers necros could probably land lifeburn, sk could land ToI with it's -500 check and aa HT's <br />
<br />
Agree it gets pretty ridiculous i myself actually lose a good portion of my healing/dps when time geared folk start resist tov. But only like 30% of the time population does everytime.<br />
<br />
you fight 2-6 people by yourself regularly? :-) <br />
<br />
The 2 yes i can say about every time i log on for more then 2 hours i fight a 2 on 1. bah am i saying that right or is it 1 on 2? Let me give you an example, a time guild druid came and attacked my cleric he was human made my cleric gate, pissed me off i dueled him killed him. Next thing i know 4 of his guild are in the zone. 2 wiz a druid and not sure on last. i get strongrooted and chain nuked to death heh, well thats not true actually strong root broke at like 5% and a mob got me while i was trying to get away.<br />
<br />
And a time guild rouge/warrior will be running away from me heh. <br />
<br />
Well i have used ht on rouges and war's when they were either the only ones kos in zone and running at low life or for some reason i was about to die and wanted to help my team win. But not normally i can just dot kite (if ignite lands/ if boh lands *doesn't have to*) with the occasional jousts and toi/tov to keep me 100% hp and kill them. Rouges and warriors even in the best gear aren't scary at all. A rouge with a bard on the other hand hehe. Well killed an ele rouge with a human bard singing for him a few weeks ago heh if that helps.<br />
<br />
Yeah, I'm sure you know all about PvP in PoFire. <br />
<br />
Im not ele flagged but i've experienced 72 on 100 followed by abuot 60 on 80..the first guild we beats ally guild came(bindrushed some had died in first battle)  and attacked us right after. Was a fun night was our first aow kill and our first tormax kill. If your hanging out with aerist dhuvar i used to be there best sk, they experience alot of mass pvp. Hate them now but good luck with that heh.<br />
<br />
Red servers are just stupid,i played on VZ and RZ, got bored and left. You want real problems, play on Xegony, man talk about cock blocking, training, smack talk,drama, and such much more, your pussy ass red server cant compete with xegonys l33t bullshit. <br />

<br />
Lifetaps arent irresistable by any stretch; however Touch of Innoruuk is -500 check so its very hard to resist period, it's the best player lifetap in game. Sure ToM is 850 base (nec lifetap) but it's consistently resisted with 270+ MR. If you're on a pvp server it'd be your best friend as an SK.<br />
<br />
I was lucky enuff to get it for 10k, someone was selling like 5 copies, even my shitty SK needs little healing in ldon type situations(easy) between toi/tov/zbite, usually do them with a druid friend and it frees him up to mostly nuke</div></div><hr />

Karana went from an all rotation server 3 years ago to a pure FFA server (only a few rotations on early velious stuff remain, as a sort of legacy from the past :p ).

Your story sounds too stupid to be true<br />
<br />
First, resist debuffs in PvP take off 1.5 times the amount of resist that they do in PvE.<br />
<br />
Second, I have landed darkness on players 8 levels above me when debuffed. Not often, but once or twice. Landing it on five levels above debuffed is even easier.<br />
<br />
Third, depending on the situation, stopping to remove darkness is not always the best strategy. Sometimes it's not possible, depending on the situation. You get interrupted twice trying to dispell and you've taken a lot of damage. In group PvP, it's even less likely that you can dispell. Especially since you have a chance of knocking off virtue and almost killing yourself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just found out about this post from a SK guildmate of mine.<br />
<br />
Now, let me say first that I do not mind dying in a fair and honorable battle. In fact it is fun not to say the least refreshing to have a challenging pvp encounter.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I would have no problem dying to a 60 lvl SK, shit can and statisticaly WILL happen from time to time.<br />
<br />
The thing is, I do not even know your name sir. And if you would have killed me and I had found out you are just lvl 60, trust me, I would remember it. Especially if i had resisted your HT too, because it is something that doesnt happen often (in fact, I have only resisted HTs twice so far...and hmm, now that I think of it, one was from a lowbie ikky SK in PoStorms once, was that you by any chance?).<br />
<br />
What I am trying to say is, that since you did it once and are so eager to support your claim of having killed me (no boasting here, but the last 6 months I have only died from instant kill skills like MB or HT and like you say yours got resisted) and since reputation is very important to us Zekkers, how bout next time you are online you send me a tell and we set up a little &quot;meeting&quot; ok?<br />
