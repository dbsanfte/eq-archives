<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brilom</div><div class="date">12-27-2003, 11:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Last night i Found Out a Guildie of Mine had Lost His Body in PoF an a Raid Gone bad, So Naturaly We Set up a Guild Raid Asap.. 4.5 Groups it Seemed Pretty Streamline.. First Attemtp was a Failur.. Most Died Well to the point.. Second Attempt Worked and We Got the Body and Most people Ported out, Leaving 10 of us. Being a SK i Dont have Gate (DOH) and Wizzy Wouldnt Port me Out untill we Got the piece For her Epic.. So i was Left at Lvl 50 to MT PoF we had a Monk Pulling, i Would Pull Aggro From the Mob And Snare it.. it Worked GREAT.. When They Were Slowed it was a Piece of Cake, Avg Lvl of the Raid was Only 56 too..  the Only Real hard thing here Was  the Golum For the Quest (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=6407)<br />
But With Clerics Chain healing..,no biggy Got Down to 36% health a Few Times... Thing Was Doubling for 260 - 400++   Wizzys Item Droped just intime For her to Show it to the other Guild that Showed Up to camp It. i Was Rather Happy With myself, and Would Like to thank Dakote (Cleric) For keeping my rear Alive</div></div><hr />

Fun times.</div></div><hr />

Grats on the tanking job, but this should also teach you to always have a gate option. Thurg Gate potion is easy and cheap. Overthere hammer is easy to get. The first gate talisman isn't that hard. And shammy gate potions aren't that expensive if you sell them to vendors with one charge left.</div></div><hr />
