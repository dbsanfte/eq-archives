<br />
I can't see a real good way to defeat Bert and Hedge, well, that's just a hastle.<br />
<br />
I've tried Hedge 2 times, the guy always dies/despawns, which really sucks...<br />
The other problem is that it's a maze, and it's hard to go around with, I forgot but do mobs see invis?<br />
<br />
If not, then you can take like 3 Sks to scout ahead for the right direction and not get lost,,,?<br />
<br />
Any help guys?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hedge, well... memblur is your friend. Why you would feel a need to &quot;scout ahead&quot; is beyond me, just follow Thelin.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for the hedge, possibly get a map which has Thelin's route on it (I don't have one but a guildie does).  You also have to ensure that one mob is always engaged when you have multi's mezz'd in camp.  That is, someone should break mez on the next mob BEFORE the current mob is finished, otherwise Thelin will start walking away (not good when you have say, 3 more mobs left to kill and Thelin wandered off to get himself killed).</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for Hedge I don't know where to get the map, we always get screwed with him wandering off getting himself killed  :mad:</div></div><hr />

Well, for the Bert event, having a lot of people is nice... once you get to him, I'm not sure, he just sort of died too fast for me to notice what our tactics were back when we did him. I think it's a range fight? Just toss rusty daggers and silk caps at him until he dies :D Sorry, can't really be more help than that at present, I'm sure there are nice guides to him if you google some tho.<br />
<br />
And since you didn't seem to catch the hint in my previous post: have someone aggro Thelin without damaging him and keep him away from the mobs until all mobs are dead, then memblur and let him continue on his merry way to the next waypoint. No problems with him getting himself killed then (unless whoever is &quot;offtanking&quot; him is stupid enough not to click off ds).</div></div><hr />

If you are struggling with Hedge, don't worry about Bert for the time being.  Realistically you need to master alot of raid concepts in Teir 1 before tackling bert.<br />
<br />
Hedge of course isn't a typical raid set-up, but I'm imagining that trouble with hedge means no where near ready for Bert.<br />
<br />
Have your melee in front of Thelin as he enters room, all casters outside of room.  Enchanters can mezz everthing that agros.  One enchanter is assigned to Thelin to agro him, pull him out, mez him until all adds are dead, and then memblur him.</div></div><hr />
