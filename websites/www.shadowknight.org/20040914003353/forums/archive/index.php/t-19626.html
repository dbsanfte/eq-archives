<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kilze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm nearly 65 and wondering what is the best spell lineup for an exp group(not raiding) and whether or not it's time to retire clinging darkness...Here is what I've thought of using...<br />
<br />
1)Z-bite<br />
2)Spear of Decay<br />
3)Terror of Thule<br />
4)Clinging darkness/festering? or some other high aggro dot...<br />
5)Touch of Inny<br />
6)Not sure...Aura of pain or hate? as well as rotating in the occasional self buff...<br />
7)Harmshield<br />
8)Death peace...<br />
<br />
Thanks for the input.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kruze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Here's my LDoN group lineup.  I almost never pull and almost always tank.<br />
<br />
1) ToI<br />
2) CD<br />
3) Zeefers<br />
4) Aura of Hate (melee DPS group type) / Blood of Hate<br />
5) Aura of Pain <br />
6) Spear of Decay<br />
7) rotating buffs<br />
8) Death Peace <br />
<br />
Here's my 2 box lineup when I'm just listening to tunes and doing an easy camp with pets up.<br />
<br />
1) ToI<br />
2) Festering Darkness<br />
3) Zeefers<br />
4) Aura of Hate<br />
5) Aura of Pain<br />
6) Asytole<br />
7) Augmentation of Death<br />
8) Death Peace</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>DConquest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I don't really see the benefit of using Terror and HS in an Exp group.  I only pull HS out for specialized pulls, and CD is pretty much all you need for aggro.  Which brings me to my next answer... No, CD shouldn't be retired.  It's a workable snare, cheap, fast, great aggro.  Festering is great for FD splits, snaring Raid mobs, solo'ing, snareable named pulls... for everything else CD should do the trick.  <br />
<br />
Both Aura of Hate and Pain should be up if you can stand the button mashing.  The 100+ AC it provides is roughly a 5 percent midigation increase... Whoops, there goes the Warrior bonus in exp groups.  Aura of Hate adds roughly 6 - 10 dps to each melee including you, pretty worthwhile especially with more than 1 melee in the group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>aress</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">depends on where you raid and what level your group is at.  I never use ZB anymore, our guild's casters have huge mana regen, and do not need it.  ATK buff is always welcome, AC tap is great.  Some raid mobs resist about everything we throw at them, and we are left with life taps and BoD.  So, my line up changes a lot, depending on the encounter.</div></div><hr />
