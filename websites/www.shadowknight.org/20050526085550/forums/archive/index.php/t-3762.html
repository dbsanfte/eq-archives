Crotendor/Brutredblade’s guide to mastering trade skills fast.<br />
Tinkering guide added by Marmara of Clan MacLear<br />
Updated 8 Aug 03<br />
<br />
This guide was how I mastered MY tradeskills the fastest. This is not a way to make money. Most of the time I destroyed the items I made because they were worth nothing to a vendor or I had no room to store them. I highly recommend that if you are evil, you hunt the Gnolls and Orcs in Highpass Hold to raise your faction. This is one of the best places to work on trade skills seeing there is a bank inside. I find it best if you have 2 opal encrusted steins for the added charisma boost. So that when you buy supplies from a vendor you get them at a good price or when you sell items back, you get full price. Make sure that you have maxed out your faction within the city you are doing the work in. For Thurgadin, turning in the toes and heads for the shawl quests will give you excellent faction increases. If Shadow Haven is about to become your new home, I would complete the Traders of the Haven quest to get the neck item that is a faction modifier and has some charisma on it also. For the best results, find a Shaman or Enchanter and have them buff you to the gills with Charisma, Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom and Agility so that the combines and skill increases happen faster. Remember one thing, the higher your Intelligence or Wisdom is, the faster your skill goes up!<br />
<br />
Pottery<br />
<br />
I was able to master pottery for around 20 platinum and it took around 1 hour to do so. I used the vendors in Shadow Haven but I had to do a lot of boring tasks so that the vendors would speak with me.  This can also be done in Thurgadin, in the bank area.<br />
<br />
<br />
Step One: <br />
<br />
Purchase around 50 flasks of water, 50 Blocks of Clay and 50 Medium jar sketches. <br />
<br />
Combine then on a pottery wheel until your skill reaches 36. I destroyed the unfired jars that I made because the firing sheets are too expensive. When I ran out of ingredients, my skill was 36 <br />
so I move on to a new design. <br />
<br />
Step Two: <br />
<br />
Purchase 100 flasks of water, 100 blocks of Clay and 100 Medium bowl sketches. I once again threw away the unfired bowls. I was able to reach a skill of 109 before running out of supplies. <br />
<br />
It cost less than 20 platinum to do this. So I decided to master baking next which cost around 25 platinum to do so. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Baking<br />
<br />
*Update – April 2003<br />
<br />
New Way<br />
<br />
I have discovered a faster way to master baking. I was able to do this in about 20 minutes with high Int. <br />
<br />
1 – 143 Fillets<br />
<br />
First buy a Filleting Knife (or make one) and a spit. Go to Shadow Haven. Across from the Soul Binder (and near the bank) is a vendor that sells stacks of Bear Meat. Buy a tons of them. Combine the bear meat and Filleting Knife in the spit. With Int at 215, I maxed these out at 143 in less than 20 minutes. This can also be done with Lion Meat.<br />
<br />
144 – 191 Patty melts<br />
<br />
This took a little longer to max out but still, just as easy. Only thing is that you to be ‘good aligned’ to do this or have someone buy you the supplies. <br />
<br />
Grab your spit, buy a Non-Stick Frying Pan (or make one), and grab as much bear meat as you can possibly hold, put some in the bank also for good measures. Then make you way to Jaggedpine Forest. Chef Brargus sells stacks of Cheese and Loafs of Bread right next to the banker in the Good Outpost. Combine 1 Cheese, 1 Bear Meat, 1 Loaf of Bread and the frying pan in the spit. <br />
<br />
Took me about 1 hour to hit 191. But was very inexpensive and easy.<br />
<br />
Old Way<br />
<br />
Step One: Evil<br />
<br />
Go to the Erudian vendor in EC (Katha Firespinner, by the Inn closest to WC). She sells has an unlimited supply of <br />
<br />
bat wings. I purchased about 80 wings and then ran back to Neriak. In Neriak down under, at the <br />
<br />
The Refined Palate, you can buy Frosting. Combine the two in the oven until you skill reaches 46. <br />
<br />
I gave my batwing crunchies to friends and young ones in the city. <br />
<br />
<br />
Step one: Good<br />
Go to the Erudian vendor in EC (Katha Firespinner, by the Inn closet to WC). She sells has an unlimited supply of <br />
bat wings. I purchased about 80 wings and then went to Inn 1 in EC and purchased the frosting from Parthar. I was using a spit to do the combine. But if you don’t have a spit, you can buy the Batwings from Lysa Truegreen (Academy of Arcane Sciences, W. Freeport) and the frosting from Pincia Brownloe (unlabeled building next to monk's guild, W. Freeport). And then use one of the ovens in Freeport - oven - in empty shop near Torligs Herbs &amp; Medicines (W. Freeport), inside Grub &amp; Grog Tavern (E. Freeport - if too tall to go over the counter, circle around the building for the backdoor), inside Traders Holiday (E. Freeport), inside Chops &amp; Hops (E. Freeport) inside unlabeled inn near bank (N. Freeport), outside empty building diagonal from Tassel's Tavern (N. Freeport). Keep making until they become trivial (46).<br />
<br />
Step Two: Evil<br />
<br />
Mariz Ixtaz near Toadstool in Neriak Commons sells fresh fish. I purchased around 80 and then <br />
<br />
went back to the Refined Palate and purchased 80 jugs of sauce. Combine those in the over to make <br />
<br />
2 Fish Fillets. I made those until my skill reached 82. <br />
<br />
Step Two: Good<br />
<br />
Find Tanlok Harson (Port authority) and buy stacks of Fresh fish. Combine those in an over or spit with Jugs of Sauces that can be purchased from Pincia Brownloe. Keep making until they become trivial (82).<br />
<br />
Step Three: Evil<br />
<br />
Go back to EC and buy batwings. Then return to Neriak and combine the batwings with fresh fish in <br />
<br />
the over. They produce 1 fish cake, which is a banquet-sized meal. Make these until you reach your <br />
<br />
mastery skill. <br />
<br />
Step Three: Good<br />
<br />
Buy Batwings from Lysa Truegreen and combine with one fresh fish from Tanlok Harson. They produce 1 fish cake, which is a banquet-sized meal. Make these until you reach your mastery skill.<br />
<br />
<br />
Brewing<br />
<br />
*Note – Update April 2004<br />
New Way<br />
Step One : Good or Evil<br />
Recently I was told that in order to make the spiritstone to Neriak, you have to brew Fetid essence’s. These are cake to make and are sold in the Plane of Knowledge by Caden Zharik (-344, 756)  Combine 1 fishing grub and 1 flask of water to make a Fetid Essence. These become trivial at 122.<br />
Continue to Step 3 in the old way and make Ol' Tujim's Fierce Brew til 135.<br />
<br />
Old Way<br />
Step One: Evil<br />
I was close to Ogguk so I purchased 4 stacks of snake scales, 4 stacks of bottles and 4 stacks <br />
of water. I kept making bog juice until my skill reached 21. (If you do not want to do this, you may do the same as Step One good in either Highpass Hold or in Neriak.<br />
Step One: Good<br />
At the Tiger’s Roar in Highpass Hold, when you first walk in the door, there is a vendor to your right, Lyn Tarburner, who sells barley, hops, rice, malt, yeast and wine yeast. Purchase stacks of Barley, Hops and Malt from her. Go to the other side of the building and buy Casks from the Bartender. Combine 1 Barley, 1 Hop, 1 Malt and a cask in the brew barrel.  If you fail, you get to reuse the Cask. This becomes trivial at 31.<br />
<br />
Step Two: Good and evil<br />
I was in Neriak now (this can also be done at the Tigers Roar in Highpass Hold buy all the supplies from Lyn Tarburner and the bartender), I purchased Barley and Malt from Wiska who is above the smugglers inn in Neriak. And Palais Derekor who is next to the soulbinder in Neriak sells the casks needed. If you walk up the ramp next to Palais, there is a brew barrel there. I continued to make Ale until my skill reached 68. <br />
<br />
Step Three: Good and Evil<br />
This took the longest time. Using the same vendors, I then began to make Ol' Tujim's Fierce Brew. <br />
Combining Barley, Hops, Yeast, Malt and a cask in the brew barrel makes two brews. But, they take <br />
longer to raise you skill. I took me one hour of brewing these to reach a master skill level. <br />
I hope this helps all who read it to achieve the good fortune I now have. These become trivial at 135.<br />
<br />
<br />
Tailoring <br />
<br />
 The easier place to do this is East Karana. Run around killing spiders, lions and wolves. Loot all the furs and silks you can, even the ruined ones. First, work on Silks. The Crag Spiders are the best. They can drop up to 8 spider silks! Combine two silks in tailoring kit to make a silk swatch. Purchase 10 stacks of Mask Patterns at the Serpents Supply in Highpass Hold before you start to hunt.<br />
<br />
Step One:<br />
I suggest combining silks until they become trivial (15). Continue to wipe out anything that moves. There is a bandit camp in the land also; it is good to kill them for faction while hunting. <br />
<br />
Step Two: <br />
Next combine a mask pattern with a ruined wolf/cat/bear pelt. I purchased my patterns at the Serpents Supply in Highpass Hold. Continue to make these until they become trivial (26). Trick: There are some vendors in the houses next to Crag Mountain; I often find they have ruined pelts on them.<br />
<br />
<br />
*Step Three (New Way)<br />
This is a faster way to get to 95 without having to live in East Karana for a few weeks. You can make Greyhopper armor, an easy combine (1 greyhopper hide, 1 mask pattern), you can go all the way to a skill of 95 on this and skip steps 4-6.<br />
<br />
Step Three (Old Way)<br />
Combine a mask pattern with a silk swatch to make raw silk armor. You can either destroy these or sell them to the vendors. Continue to make these until they become trivial (36).<br />
<br />
Step Four:<br />
Combine 1 metal stud (made from smithing, trivial at 41), 1 mask pattern and 1 MQ Bear/Cat/Wolf pelt. These become trivial at 56 or if you have no smithing skills and have brewing, you can just jump to the next step.<br />
<br />
Step Five:<br />
Combine 1 silk Swatch, 1 Mask Pattern and 1 Heady Kiola (made from Brewing, trivial at 46) to make Cured Silk Armor. These become trivial at 86.<br />
<br />
Step Six (Fastest way)<br />
While hunting in East Karana, kill the lions for their pelts. If you combine a High Quality Cat Pelt with a quiver pattern, you make a tailored quiver. Which become trivial at 115. <br />
<br />
Step Six (Slowest Way)<br />
I was working on the Thurgadin Shawl quest and I needed the Crystalline Silks for the quest. So, I gathered as many as possible and started to make Crystalline Silk Masks by combining 1 Swatch, 1 Mask Pattern and 1 Silver Thread (which can be purchased in Thurgadin). Continue to make these until they become trivial at 108.  Then I started making the Mantle, 1 Silver Thread + 1 Swatch + Mantle Pattern until they became trivial at 118.  If you need to go higher, you can make the Shirt, 3 swatches + Tunic Pattern + 1 Silver Thread. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Smithing<br />
<br />
This one is not as hard as some people think. It is not as easy as Pottery but you need to make sure you have tons of empty slots in your bags to work on this! I did most of my work in Thurgadin, but these supplies are easily found in Neriak and Highpass Hold.<br />
<br />
Step One:<br />
I first started with Metal Bits by combining 2 small pieces of Ore (Stackable) and 1 Water Flask inside of a forge. These become trivial at 18 but keep them, you will need them!<br />
<br />
Step Two:<br />
I made tools boxes next. They count as a container so you can’t stack them or place them inside of bags. These are made by combining Metal Bits and a Water flask inside of a forge. These become trivial at 51. <br />
<br />
Step Three:<br />
You’re now half way to becoming a master. Next, I made Lock picks. Combine 1 metal bits, 1 Water Flask and 1 Lock pick Mold in a forge. These are also inexpensive to make and become trivial at 88. <br />
<br />
Step Four:<br />
Before they changed the trivials, you could make skewers until 115 but now I find it’s best to make banded armor to 115. So I began to make Banded Boots, trivial at 95. I also found for convenience that you just purchase the sheets of metal instead of making them. I made all mine in Shadow Haven, mostly because the forge near the bank has all the vendors around it. Combine 1 sheet of metal, proper mold (i.e., &quot;boot mold&quot;, &quot;large boot mold&quot;, etc), flask water. Boots become trivial at 95. Next, combine 2 sheets of metal, proper mold (i.e., &quot;helm mold&quot;, &quot;large helm mold&quot;, etc), flask water until they become trivial at 106. If you plan on going higher, you can make the Mail by combining 3 sheets of metal, proper mold (i.e., &quot;mail mold&quot;, &quot;large mail mold&quot;, etc), flask water until these become trivial at 115.<br />
<br />
<br />
Fletching<br />
This trade skill was the first one that I mastered. Mostly because I use arrows but if you don’t need the arrows, find someone near who can use them, they will love the gift. I purchased all my supplies at the Bleak Fletcher in Neriak or the Fletching Shop in Shadow Haven. But there is a fletching supplier in every town.<br />
<br />
Step One:<br />
Type One Arrow – Combine the following in a fletching kit. 1 Field Point Arrowhead + 1 Wood Arrow Shaft + 1 Round Cut Fletch + 1 Large Nock. These become trivial at 16.<br />
<br />
Step Two:<br />
Type Two Arrow - 1 Field Point Arrowhead + 1 Wood Arrow Shaft + 1 Round Cut Fletch + 1 Medium Nock. These become trivial at 36.<br />
<br />
Step Three:<br />
Type Three Arrows - 1 Field Point Arrowhead + 1 Wood Arrow Shaft + 1 Parabolic Cut Fletch + 1 Large Nock. These become trivial at 46.<br />
<br />
Step Four:<br />
Type Four Arrows - 1 Field Point Arrowhead + 1 Wood Arrow Shaft + 1 Round Cut Fletch + 1 Small Nock. These become trivial at 56.<br />
<br />
Step Five:<br />
Type 5 Arrows - 1 Field Point Arrowhead + 1 Bone Arrow Shaft + 1 Round Cut Fletch + 1 Large Nock. These become trivial at 68.<br />
<br />
Step Six:<br />
Type 6 Arrows - 1 Field Point Arrowhead + 1 Wood Arrow Shaft + 1 Shield Fletch + 1 Large Nock. These become trivial at 82.<br />
<br />
Step Seven:<br />
Type 7 Arrows - 1 Hooked Arrowhead + 1 Wood Arrow Shaft + 1 Round Cut Fletch + 1 Large Nock. These become trivial at 102.<br />
<br />
Step Eight:<br />
Type 8 Arrows - 1 Field Point Arrowhead + 1 Wood Arrow Shaft + 1 Wood Vane Fletch + 1 Large Nock. These become trivial at 122.<br />
<br />
Step Nine:<br />
Type 9 Arrows - 1 Field Point Arrowhead + 1 Ceramic Arrow Shaft + 1 Round Cut Fletch + 1 Large Nock. These become trivial at 135.<br />
<br />
Step Ten:<br />
Type 10 arrows - 1 Field Point Arrowhead + 1 Wood Arrow Shaft + 1 Bone Vane Fletch + 1 Large Nock. These become trivial at 162.<br />
<br />
Step Eleven:<br />
Type 11 arrows - 1 Field Point Arrowhead + 1 Wood Arrow Shaft + 1 Ceramic Vane Fletch + 1 Large Nock. These become trivial at 202.<br />
<br />
Tinkering – By Marmara d’Beers (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=477440)<br />
As a Gnome, when you reach your 16th Season, you automatically have a skill of 50 in Tinkering by nature. <br />
<br />
Step One: Fire Water Burn<br />
You need firewater to make other recipes so I decided to make these first. In Ak’Anon, at the bar, you can buy Gnomish Spirits and then purchase a few stacks of Water Flasks. Combine in a tool box which you can either make with smithing or buy it from a vendor (Rylin Coil, Ak'Anon, Loc of: 1473, -184, -108, Notes: Stands near the three tiered waterfalls within Ak'Anon.) Make as many of these as possible and keep them. <br />
<br />
Step Two: This lantern is cold!<br />
This is where the firewater comes in handy. Combine the firewater, with a large lantern and metal twine. The metal twine is purchased, I bought most of it from Bom Knotwood in Steamfont, he’s in the windmill. The lanterns can be purchased from any of the food vendors. These become trivial at 68.<br />
<br />
Step Three: Cam Cam<br />
Getting trivial in these is quick. These are sold to fletchers or save them to do your own fletching. Combine 1 Gears, 1 Grease and 1 Gnomish Bolts. These become trivial at 75.<br />
<br />
Step Four: Alien Probe<br />
Next is to make the Stalking Probe. This is often a favorite of Necromancers because they can cast the Eye of Zomm and then lifetap it. These sell fairly well in the bazaar also. Combine a bottle, firewater, 2 gears and a metal rod. The bottle can be purchased from most vendors, the gears and metal rod can be purchased from Bom Knotwood. These become trivial at 102<br />
<br />
Step Four: Get yer drink on! <br />
If you do not have the time or money to make bows (or buy them) you can make Geerlock Fermentation Devices for under 5 platinum per combine. First you need to go to Netherbain Lair and kill the Netherbain creatures for Porous Mineral Block. Combine 1 Porous Mineral Block with a cork, a bottle, 1 Ceramic Lined Still and 1 Cured Leather Tubing. You will fail a lot but get some good enchanter brain buffs so you skill will raise every 2 or 3 combines. The Cured Still and Tubing can be purchased in Shadow Haven from a Gnome merchant that is in the same building as Trade Commissioner Henry. Walk in, take a left, then a right and you will see Krizle Geerlok, loc -370, pos400. This will get your skill to 215 but will take a lot of Porous Mineral Blocks and a lot of time but it is the cheapest way to skill up. With an intelligence of 215, I can gain a skill up every 10 combines. This does take a lot of farming of the Block but is the best way to reach 201+.<br />
<br />
Jewelcraft – aka the money pit<br />
<br />
<br />
First and foremost. Go to your trainer and put 21 training points in to this. Next, if you know you’re going to be working on jewelcraft, try and save all jewels found while hunting.  Also, make sure you have your Int or Wis as high as possible (KEI is a big help). The faster you skill up, the less money you’ll waste. Also, pay some plat for a Geerlok device. Failures cost get expensive. Buy selling the jewelry back to the vendors, you can recoup the money spent. If using the Geerlok, you’ll fail less and make your money back by selling to the vendors. You can do this for about 300p, with high Intelligence/Wisdom, Geerlok Device, and good charisma. I did this in Shadow Haven at the Jewelcraft store which is near the entrance to the Bazaar.  <br />
<br />
Step One: <br />
Combine 1 Cat’s Eye Agate and 1 Bar of Silver. Hopefully you will only have to do 3 or 4 combines to get to 24, when these become trivial.<br />
Step Two:<br />
Combine 1 Bloodstone and 1 Bar of Silver. Trivial at 26.<br />
Step Three:<br />
Combine 1 Onyx and 1 Bar of Silver. Trivial at 28.<br />
Step Four: <br />
Combine 1 Jasper and 1 Bar of Silver. Trivial at 30<br />
<br />
Step Five: <br />
Combine 1 Star Rose Quartz and 1 Bar of Silver. Trivial at 34.<br />
Step Six:<br />
Combine 1 Jade and 1 Bar of Silver. Trivial at 40.<br />
Next I switched to Electrum Bars. <br />
Step Seven:<br />
Combine 1 Malachite and 1 Bar of Electrum. Trivial at 74.<br />
Step Eight:<br />
Combine 1 Onyx and 1 Bar of Electrum. Trivial at 90.<br />
Step Nine: Almost there!<br />
Combine 1 jade and 1 Bar of Electrum. Trivial at 104! Welcome to the world of Master Jewelers!<br />
<br />

I used EQ Traders (www.eqtraders.com) and The Tinkering Compendium (www.tinkering.org) as a reference guide to find out most of this information. I suggest you visit the site if you are looking for more information. They have recipes for everything and locations of supplies for every city.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just wanted to add:<br />
<br />
Easier way to raise brewing is making &quot;skull ale&quot;<br />
<br />
You will need a skull from the Undead cyclops in SK.<br />
<br />
Put the cyclop skull in a brew barrel and add 1 each of the following: vinegar, spices, and a short beer.<br />
<br />
Can do this from 0 to 151, great thing about this is no bottles or casks needed and you get the cyclops skull back if you succeed or not. Those who have been working brewing should know how annoying this is. <br />
<br />
Each combine if successful yeilds 2 skull ales, nothing like drinking your beer from a skull!</div></div><hr />
