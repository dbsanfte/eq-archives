<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cykosis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Not a Very inportant Question, but one none the less, I have a troll SK, and love it...But he's only a 5th....ANd my question is this....What god is the best to go with?? I mean is there one that is the best way to go? Does it really effect anything??<br />
<br />
Would love to hear what my peoples think</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jobrill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It affects starting faction and in some cases which cultural you can wear. Other than that, It's hardly a factor in gameplay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cykosis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks...didnt think it had much to do, but its always worth asking....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Floppy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">They need looser restrictions on deities as far as I'm concerned. I want my Ogre SK of Erollisi Marr, dammit!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Drynnious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Go cazic for a troll. Way better cultrual armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tumy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Im a Cazic Ogre with nearly all the Cazic Cultural, check out my magelo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Deity selection can have an adverse effect on your faction (if you worry about such things).<br />
<br />
For instance trolls as a race can get into any city they want to if they do enough faction work. Troll shadowknights of Cazic-Thule will never be able to get into certain places.<br />
<br />
While I have yet to experience this problem with my Erudite shadowknight (Cazic-Thule) my Iksar monk (Cazic-Thule) is still unable to enter the outpost of Firiona Vie despite the fact that his faction is maxed out there. The only reason he is still kill on sight is because those elves will not accept a Cazicite.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Slagnath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">poop on factions who don't like you. you don't need them. worship your maker: Cazic thule.<br />
<br />
-slagnath<br />
<br />
ps i'm ashamed a cazite would care about those sissy elves at feriona vie=p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>LoganHex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well in my defense I wanted my monk to be agnostic as it fit my character concept. Unfortunately Iksar monks do not recieve a choice and are forced to go with Cazic-Thule.<br />
<br />
If it makes you feel any better though my shadowknight is a hateful sumbitch who will not even group with light races =)</div></div><hr />
