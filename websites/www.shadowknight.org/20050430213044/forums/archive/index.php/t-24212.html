<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KlaoofQuell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, when I get my comp fixed in the next two weeks or so, been thinking about getting a second account going and PLing a necro or beastlord on it so at some point I could duo some in the future. Have no interest in playing a shammy. I already have both on my main account, but since SOE will not transfer a character to a different account on the same server, I will have to restart them. Magelos included just for reference of what equipment I have for them.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>aniam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">uhh did something change cause couple months back i transfered my sk to another account on same server, was no hassle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>KlaoofQuell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hmm, would be cool if I did not have to restart. read the transfer stuff on eqlive, and I got the impression that you could not move to a different account on the same server. Ah well, lvl 31 and/or lvl 14 &lt; 80 bucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Silvershadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">SoE happily transfers characters between accounts on the same server... what are you smoking?<br />
<br />
Unless of course you are not the original owner of the second account, then they might say screw you I guess. I had no problems moving between my accounts (both started by me) at any point anyway, latest time I did so was less than a week ago /shrug.</div></div><hr />
