So I get a guild Shaman,Bard and Cleric and we go and gank em.  We head to Upper Sands and there is a Ranger and a Cleric sitting there and they tell us that US is camped. They wasnt pulling or killing any mob what so ever (just standing there) and said more were inc. So the Bard pulls Sandstorm and we kill him...Ranger and Cleric raise hell over this and cuss us in /ooc calling us KSers..........Was this dirty in all honesty? I kinda felt like I was doing something wrong but.....</div></div><hr />

Had the group been clearing the mobs around him in preparation, then I beleive that is considered a KS.<br />
<br />
Honorable?  No.  You knew their intentions and took what they wanted.<br />
<br />
I would have waited a reasonable amout of time for them to engage it (10 min?). And/or invited them for a roll on the loot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wouldn't worry about it too much, being in BoT alone should prepare someone for shit to happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ogrukk</div><div class="date">06-08-2004, 09:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They way I have always seen the rule enforced (by guides even, when they have bothered to show up) is that the first group/raid on target WITh the needed force to take out the target, gets the hit.  <br />
<br />
If one wants to get a contested spawn, one need to be either <br />
A) lucky (no one else notices the spawn)<br />
B) fast (get there WITH your group/raid before anyone else)<br />
<br />
If you are slow and unlucky, you loose the spawn.  They (and anyone else of a level to hunt valuable rare spawns) needs to focus on being fast, cause you can't control luck.  <br />
<br />
Sounds like the pair you beat to the spawn were relying on lady luck alone, and she is ever the fickle mistress...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oagan</div><div class="date">06-08-2004, 11:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Give them a reasonable chance to gather the forces to take the mob down (like 10 mins).  They don't get the people, then take the mob.  Extending the gesture of allowing them first crack is polite.  However, if they can't muster the forces, tough shit.  You can't just allow them to sit there forever, hoping that enough people show up.<br />
<br />
Other alternative would be to allow them to group with you, and roll on the drops.  But hey, if you had the people and they didn't, tough shit.  As long as you told them to get the people within a certain reasonable time frame (and for BoT, ten mins would be reasonable), then they can piss off.  Once their people are there, five min buff time, then engage.<br />
<br />
People can't just say they have the mob if they don't have the forces to take it down.  Saying, we're waiting for our people to finish an adventure in 30 mins is bullshit (or something to that effect).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Derok</div><div class="date">06-08-2004, 12:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If the rest of their group was en route (minutes away from camp), then yeah it wasn't a very good thing to do.  If they couldn't assemble the necessary forces to take down the Named within a reasonable amount of time, I don't see it being a problem with your group moving in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kyfe</div><div class="date">06-08-2004, 12:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The common theme with regard to raids is that the first person there with the force to take the mob gets the mob. They did not have the force. If they were clearing to the mob, I'd say leapfrogging them would be wrong. But given it is one of the camps you can just invis up to, it is clearly the case that they didn't even HAVE a &quot;rest of group&quot; but just were trying to get people to come make a group. So you were perfectly within your rights.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kassdax</div><div class="date">06-08-2004, 02:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had a somewhat similar thing happen a couple of years back.<br />
<br />
Before PoP came out and the Luclin spires was the fastest way to travel I decided to head to South Karana in hopes of obtaining one of my last few things for the mage epic (Quillimane's cloak). I check the zone, only myself and a level 15 (I think, somewhere in the mid teens) ranger. As usual I head due south from the bridge towards the Splitpaw spires.<br />
<br />
The ranger is kiting Quillimane around. I ask him if he would like to group up and roll for the cloak if it drops. He says no, he's waiting for friends to come help kill Quill. The ranger is doing nothing more than snaring Quill, running away and sitting to med back enough mana for another snare.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes of talking to this ranger I find out he has zero chance of killing Quill (no arrows, no throwing weapons, a level 15ish ranger can't melee a level 25 creature down). Another 15 minutes goes by and I ask where his friends are. He claims they're on their way but they just missed the last spire port to North Karana. Another 20 minutes goes by (remember, the Luclin spires are on a 15 minute timer) and it's still only the ranger and myself in the zone. So here it is, nearly 45 minutes since I zoned in and saw the ranger kiting Quillimane:<br />
<br />
/pet attack<br />
/cast Shock of Fiery Blades (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/spell.html?spell=2540)<br />
<br />
Check corpse, only to see the leggings. Since I didn't care about the leggings I offered them to the ranger. He's pissed and leaves - congrats rot monster on the leggings.<br />
<br />
Some time later a guide contacts me. We talk about the sequence of events, he verifies things, tells me to have a nice day and wishes me luck on getting the cloak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slein Jinn</div><div class="date">06-08-2004, 03:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As far as I'm concerned, them sitting there means dick.  Hell, one of them kiting him back and forth or something would have meant dick too (and a guide would concur with you on that, but we know that rules != etiquet).  <br />
<br />
If you've got the means to kill it and they don't, have at it.  <br />
<br />
If they're clearing to him or medding up after having done so or whatever, it's rude to leapfrog them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keevel</div><div class="date">06-08-2004, 03:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it's rude that they were adamant about not sharing and didn't have  a group ready to kill when you did and were there.<br />
<br />
People suck.<br />
<br />
Had a guy yell at me while I was on another character for taking the IG's in EF, because he could get exp out of them and I was &quot;there for the loot&quot;.  He went so far as to come to camp after I answered camp check and respectfully declined his request to give him my camp and he sat there and did the /sigh emote over and over.</div></div><hr />

That would be when you pull 5 of them (and anything else in the immediate area), stand on top of him, hit /sigh 5 or 6 times, then hit FD. Problem solved, YAY!<br />
<br />
When people are rude to you, they should expect nothing less in return.</div></div><hr />

If that was YOUR group waiting there with ppl inc, and another group just came and rolled over you, how would you feel? Legally, first group that engages and has the force to take it down rightly gets the kill. But morally, yes you were wrong. I would have given them 5 minutes to gather, but then again i'm a nice guy.<br />

Ah, yeah, that sucks. I had a sort of problem like that one day in OT with my lvl 30ish mage. Here is what I did:<br />
<br />
Mem Bind Affinity. Bind yourself somewhere close, that is safe. Pulll many a mob. Kill yourself on top of him! It's not FD, and you'll lose xp..... but DAMN was that a fun day, and then they can't petition you, because you say &quot;Oh, SHIT! I accidently got a few too many mobs, and couldn't handle it, damn! I can't believe that happened.....&quot;<br />
<br />
I call it my &quot;pretend to be a ranger&quot; plan.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dakkin</div><div class="date">06-15-2004, 05:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You didn't do anything wrong really.  They didn't have a capable force there and there was no evidence they weren't just lying to scare you away.<br />
<br />
If you wanted to be excruciatingly fair, you could tell them it's no problem if they genuinely have more inbound, and you'll leave if they get the other group members to send you a tell with /role off and confirm they're on the way.<br />
<br />
Then you're completely covered - they can either prove they have a capable force assembling, or they're lying.</div></div><hr />
