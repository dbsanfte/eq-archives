<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ganodoar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey there fellow sks. I was wondering if anyone else is experiencing this problem. Is it me or is there a bug with deleting certain spells out of the book? I want to delete Shroud of Death, Shroud of Pain, and Life Leech to make the book look neater but it won't let me for some reason. It gives me the delete message on other spells but those won't for some reason.<br />
<br />
I did try relogging and logging back in but that did nothing. Hopefully you guys have an answer otherwise I guess I will have to bug it online.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Arkis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">maybe because they're tag undeletable (deletable = 0)...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Deletable: No <br />
<br />
Most dropped/quested spells can't be deleted from your spell book.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ganodoar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for the replies you two. I had no idea some spells were flagged undeletable. Ah well I guess those spells will have to go to page 50 then to make the book look neater.</div></div><hr />
