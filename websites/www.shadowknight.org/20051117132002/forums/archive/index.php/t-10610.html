What is the name of the quest armor we can't wear?<br />
<br />
Are there any SK quest armors which we can wear which is almost as comprable?<br />

Does the AC bounus of the Iksar make up for not being able to wear the quest armor? If so, Is there a big difference from Iksars AC and fellow SK's who can don full suits of our quest armor?<br />

When do the Iksar's natual high AC really start to show? Is there a magic level where the bounus kicks in? I've read conflicting statements.<br />

<br />
Most quest armor in the higher levels are Iksar usable. Lower level quest armors like Darkforge the Iksars can not wear.<br />
<br />
Are there any SK quest armors which we can wear which is almost as comprable? <br />
<br />
Your low level quest armor equivalent is Dreadscale. It's also more time consuming than Darkforge. Iksars can wear most high level quest made armor pieces.<br />
<br />
Does the AC bounus of the Iksar make up for not being able to wear the quest armor? If so, Is there a big difference from Iksars AC and fellow SK's who can don full suits of our quest armor? <br />
<br />
<br />
From what I've read and seen, there's marginal difference. By the way, there's very little AC difference between plate, chain and leather in higher levels so don't worry about being unable to wear plate.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Darkforge is the quest armor that Iksar cannot use.<br />
<br />
Iksar cannot use Blood Ember armor either, that is the Kunark class-specific armor that drops in Karnor's Castle and Sebilis.<br />
<br />
Iksar cannot use the Umbral armor that drops in Plane of Fear, but there is an Iksar-only variant (Greenmist armor).<br />
<br />
Outside of those (and basic plate armor), Iksar can use most other SK-specific armor sets, like Noctivigant that drops in PoG, or the Velious quest armors.</div></div><hr />

Not sure on the stats, there are three different sets....<br />
And being a poor smith, have only reached the first of the set...<br />
The second and third sets require a Iksar Shaman above 29 to imbue amber, and since my skill ain't that high, haven't started looking..<br />
Just posting another option.. :)<br />

Your ac will be comparable to that of another of opposite race and equally equipped as well.  It doesn't become apparent until the latter half of your life that you will have a considerable edge in points over the rest, as you will be wearing the finest gear with the rest of the non-scaled.  Whether or not this matters a great deal, however, has yet to be proven.  When it's all said and done, the most important number is going to be your health I believe.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
<br />
I have no actual numbers to go by, but here is what i have noticed just from playing. the lack of &quot;plate&quot; armor is not a big deal. we get comparable armor (dreadscale) for our 30s. then around the 40s we can get into Rygor or Darkened Knights, then once we hit the 50s, we can go after Velious armor. there are some luclin armors for level 50-65 that we cannot wear, but again, we can get comparable armor elsewhere. the AC difference compared to the plate armor isnt really noticeable. so overall, i find the lack of plate makes our armor choices all the more interesting.<br />
<br />
our natural AC gradually gets better, just as regular armor does, and it seems to offset any lack of AC that the plate armor would have given us. fact is, in the high end, it doesnt matter if you are an Iksar SK or any other race SK. an SK is an SK and your role will depend on class, not race.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azraelwrath</div><div class="date">02-22-2003, 12:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dreadscale is too expensive to get.  Sebilite scale or Ry`gorr is your best bet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mazziker</div><div class="date">02-24-2003, 03:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a Iksar SK who has just reached 50, let me tell you my experience with the so called natural AC benifit. While it was useful at the beginning, it became more or less a pain when i hit the 30's and above. Had it increased to compinsate for higher levles, or had our natural regen increased more substantianlly (I'm not refering to the AA benifit), then I would say that the lack of plate would be fine. There is a very noticable gap between quest armor from the 20's and 30's (Dreadscale and Twilight sea) and the high end stuff you get (PoP and Tae Ew). Life is kind of hard for Iksar as our cultural armor (Don't get me started on how ticked off I am at Fearsome Skyiron) does contend with the other races culturals. <br />
  That being said I love playing my Iksar SK. I have tried other races, and always come back to Mazziker. Now that PoP is out, I have more to work for. Kael and SS armor is also in the works, but there is such a high demand from raid groups that it is hard for me to get. Also it cannot be neglected to say that if you are a Iksar SK on a Plane of Hate raid, there is a good chance you are going to be one of the only and such Greenmist Armor is always going to be yours.<br />
  Enjoy and prevail my fellow Iksar!</div></div><hr />

The Plate barrier for Iksars has always been only a barrier for the incredibly casual or the incredibly lazy, especially since Velious.</div></div><hr />

hehe dude thats like 30 (at lowest) up, getting there is the problem, i had to reroll my char recwently because i could not afford the STA armor ikky's could use, heh i would have on average about 200-300 hpts less than another SK equal my lev<br />
some thimes i think you high level peeps either forgot how it was non twinked starting class race combo for first time, you know, when your poor  and you dont have the high level money maker</div></div><hr />

actually our Greenmist armor drops in the Plane of Fear, off of Nitemares. Iksar Sk only.</div></div><hr />

Hell ever since I started playing again my guild hasn't done any plane except Justice. We seem to be stuck in UP. I apologize for the misinformation, i was only up there once =)<br />
<br />
P.S.<br />
<br />
I spend a great deal of my time XP grinding or on Guild events. In all that time I have gained 2 nice armor items, Greenmist Arms and a Helm of R(something?) in Umbral Planes. In all that time I have also helped my guild gain many many items for all the peeps. It has nothing to do with laziness. I never ninja and I always put need before greed. I have no time to waste in bazaar. So yes, the plate armor IS a problem especially since I am getting to the point where I do need AC protection from the high level beasties.<br />

Its not nearly as good as Thurg/PoG armor, to say nothing about SS/Kael armor.  Further, once you got a full set of Greenmist, you'd immediately be looking to upgrade it.<br />
<br />
If your guild can survive in PoF, then you surely can survive in the arena in Kael (for Thurg armor) or (most of) PoG (for Noct armor).  A complete set of those sets of armor will do far more for you then a complete set of Greenmist ever could.<br />
<br />
Once your guild is somewhat outfit in those sets of armor, then upgrading to SS/Kael armor is the next logical step  (well, at least used to be).  Granted, that is a little more challenging, as you need to hunt in ToV, but surely isnt ludicrously difficult to do, especially if peeps are geared relatively good.<br />
