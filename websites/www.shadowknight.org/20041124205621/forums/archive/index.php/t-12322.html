<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jobrill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">3 Suggestions for the board:<br />
<br />
1. Soulvoid, Teach ALL Mods how to use the IP Ban Function and tell them not to be afraid to use it.<br />
2. Use the Library section more often. If someone posts a good, intelligible, quest write up or faction guide, move it to the library. However any &quot;Sticky me&quot; or &quot;Archive me&quot; or &quot;Shadowknight X is a big stinky loser&quot; comments in said guide disqualify it. <br />
3. Remove the Flame on section. It's not worth the Trolls it attracts. Turn it into a &quot;lightly moderated&quot; Off-Topic section if you want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Krushum Gudended</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">&quot;balance&quot; is spelled wrong below the description of this forum<br />
<br />
so is &quot;Shadowknight&quot; below that</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Jobrill, only Soulvoid and I have the access to do nick ban's, only SV has access to do IP bans, thats why you dont see more of them (also when they are done, they arent announced).  The archive section is used some, when I see a good post where the discussion is over with, I will move the post there, sometimes I miss them though but when someone revives the post it is moved, also in most cases I do ignore a &quot;sticky me&quot; request, if it is worth stickying and in a forum I moderate it will be stickied.  I treat the flame on section exactly as you said already, as a lightly moderated forum, I dont know how the other mod's treat it however</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bick is Bad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">1 suggestion for jobrill: Lighten the fuck up<br />
<br />
-Bick</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mutton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The flame section is great...don't remove it...I find this board great due to the amount of shit it lets its readers gets away with in addition to the quality info that can sometimes be found here...taking away the flame section would be counter intuitive to this...if you dont like the flame section dont read it...but damn you know you fucking LOVE it...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>synnoira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Brael's recent spate of hairtrigger bannings was a useful exercise and ought to be repeated when appropriate, and i wouldn't have any problem with him IP banning folk off the bat either, but it's Soulvoid's board after all (and i assume names of the worst offenders just get passed along and banned anyhow).<br />
<br />
There are a couple of threads i can think of at the moment which might be worth stickied. The &quot;FD splitting&quot; thread in the combat and tactics sections is probably worth a sticky at the top and Nikumu's pet thread which is still ongoing is probably worth getting archived. For the most part though i think Nocifer's goal of making folk use subject forums has worked admirably and it's very easy just browsing them for folk to find answers to the more common questions.<br />
<br />
I think the problem with the &quot;Flame On&quot; section is that some posters confuse &quot;The Arena&quot; with it, but the solution to that goes back to Brael laying the smack down on folk who do that. For those who enjoy ill-informed historical and political discussion (plus writing about Bick) it seems to give a lot of enjoyment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lejina Bloodbath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Heh, get rid of the flameboard and ill randomly go on a rampage in the other forums once in a while instead.<br />
<br />
This sure would increase the &quot;wtf?!&quot; factor for the folks being bitch slapped.<br />
<br />
You're choice~<br />
<br />
<br />
What this board really need, its the use-the-search-button kids to shut the fuck up. If you dont have anything constructive or entertaining to say, then dont say anything. These &quot;use the search button!&quot; or &quot;post in the right section!&quot; posts are about the more boring thing short of flat water.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Krushum Gudended</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">/agree Lej, I think I already went apeshit on 2 of them</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zakton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I would much rather have a Flame On section that I can skip than have flame threads in the sections I don't skip.  Plus posts in the flame section don't count anyway so any board troll that likes posting there isn't bumping his post count.  <br />
<br />
Also its nice to have a section to vent in when you are trying not to look psycho in the game.  Its like having a punching bag that you can unload a few punches in when you are angry.</div></div><hr />

But then how am I going to pl my post count? :P<br />
<br />
I totally agree, I think mostly everyone gets the idea about search, and the flame forum MUST STAY. I laugh at it daily.</div></div><hr />
