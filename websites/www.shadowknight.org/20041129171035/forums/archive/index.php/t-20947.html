<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Something I had for a quick idea the other day, why not add heal recourses to spears?  Lifetaps can't stay at even 50% of the healing power of paladin heals in GoD because the dps increase we would recieve is nothing less than game breaking from such a change.  So to ease the problem of damage spikes and attempt to get our healing back up to what should be par for us (or atleast to something workable) why not throw some decently sized heals on spears?  They're fast casting already so would be ideal for damage spikes, and with the recast times on them larger amounts of healing could be given without actually increasing our heals by too much.  For comparison heres how healing power stacks up between us and Paladins using single target direct heals only aa/focus included (using Paladins simply because we've always had our lifetaps compared to their heals for balance):<br />
<br />
Light of Order: 1000 heal 430 mana 1 cast 5 recast<br />
Light of Nife: 850 heal 400 mana 1 cast 5 recast<br />
Touch of Nife: 1125 heal 425 mana 5 cast 2.25 recast<br />
<br />
Touch of Innoruuk: 470 damage 470 heal 330 mana 1.8 cast 12 recast<br />
Touch of Volatis: 350 damage 350 heal 280 mana 1.8 cast 12 recast<br />
<br />
With max focus/aa's included that changes to:<br />
Light of Order: 1612 heal 387 mana 1 cast 5 recast<br />
Light of Nife: 1371 heal 360 mana 1 cast 5 recast<br />
Touch of Nife: 1814 heal 383 mana 3 cast 2.25 recast<br />
<br />
Touch of Innoruuk: 597 damage 644 heal 297 mana 1.6 cast 12 recast<br />
Touch of Volatis: 445 damage 480 heal 252 mana 1.6 cast 12 recast<br />
<br />
Or, to simplify that:<br />
Light of Order: 268.67 heal/sec, 64.5 mana/sec<br />
Light of Nife: 228.5 heal/sec, 60 mana/sec<br />
Touch of Nife: 345.52 heal/sec, 72.95 mana/sec<br />
<br />
Touch of Innoruuk: 91.25 swing/sec, 21.84 mana/sec<br />
Touch of Volatis: 68.01 swing/sec, 18.53 mana/sec<br />
<br />
With standard mana regen buffs, FT15, aa mana (AotC, VoQ, SD Paladin MC/MH, PotN, VoQ, SD SK) we're at 51 for Pallys, 85 for SK's, 100 for GoD SK's.<br />
<br />
High end PoP Paladin: (LoN+ToN)<br />
Spike healing 228.5/sec 60 mana/sec<br />
Sustained healing 40.26/sec 8.5 mana/sec<br />
Maximum healing 374.71/sec 87.41 mana/sec<br />
<br />
High end PoP SK: (ToI+ToV)<br />
Spike healing 91.25/sec 21.84 mana/sec<br />
Sustained healing 59.23/sec 14.17 mana/sec<br />
Maximum healing 159.26/sec 40.37 mana/sec<br />
<br />
High end GoD Paladin: (LoO+ToN)<br />
Spike healing 268.67/sec 64.5 mana/sec<br />
Sustained healing 40.26/sec 8.5 mana/sec<br />
Maximum healing 403.06/sec 90.59/sec<br />
<br />
High end GoD SK: (ToI+ToV)<br />
Spike healing 91.25/sec 21.84 mana/sec<br />
Sustained healing 69.67/sec 16.67/sec<br />
Maximum healing 159.26/sec 40.37/sec<br />
<br />
Since damage spikes and to a lesser extent maximum healing power is what matters, we essentially recieved 0 meaningful upgrade to our ability, for this reason I'm thinking that heal recourses on spears would correct this problem somewhat even though it would most liekly require an increase in mana on them.<br />
<br />
Thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">That's a pretty good idea. So what are you thinking though? On our 600 spear, are you thinking the full 600 damage back as a lifetap? or just maybe 1/3 or 1/2 of it? something to that effect?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">More than that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ziglug D</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Actually, that sounds like a great idea...im nowhere near that end of the game, but I cannot find ANY issues with that, as long as its a recourse and not an instant 600dmg/600heal Lifetap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Oh, i see what you're saying, 600 Damage spear with a decent RECOURSE.... ah, that would make a bit more sense, i was thinking of it as just another straight lifetap. Now we just gotta see who we need to kill to get this shit implemented.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I hadn't really given any thoughts to the actual numbers yet, with 45 recycle and them being flat out resisted 30% of the time you can justify a pretty large heal but still you wouldn't want to go too large or else it would be able to increase our sustained healing by too large of an amount unless mana costs were upgraded considerably and that wouldn't be a good change.  Maybe 2.5x the spells base damage.  That would allow a high end SK to have access to a 1000, 1500, and 1650 heal every 45.5 sec.  That ends up as a 70.23 increase in maximum healing with about 1033 damage from them with resists, or 92.93 mana/sec increase in maximum hp swing, for 15.98 mana/sec increase (assuming a 30% increase in mana costs).  This might end up being too much if you consider that it is possible to still keep all 3 of these, both lifetaps, fd, aura of pain, and fd memmed which would cause a gigantic increase of our hp swings.  Bleh, maybe the ideas just not workable without raising recast times on spears as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>BrikBludgaard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Brael,<br />
<br />
There is one problem...  our spears are very typically resisted.<br />
Paladin heals are not.<br />
<br />
Unless you intend to make us more desireable in Normal LDoN runs, this isn't helping.  (Likely you are nearly invulnerable in such runs, so who the hell cares...)<br />
<br />
Seriously, our &quot;healing&quot; needs to start coming from the mob's hits and not from our own.<br />
<br />
You shot down lifetap damage shields, but we both know they would be MUCH more potent for healing than this idea due simply to resists and the fact that we need to be LESS damage-spike vulnerable.<br />
<br />
In GoD, our combat casting is not gonna save us unless it starts healing entire magitudes higher than anything we currently have.<br />
<br />
Brik</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I agree 100% Brik but unfortunatley we both know that won't happen, personally I would like to see Intense Hatred also reduce the mobs hit by whatever our dmg sheild value is at the time (or even just by the 3/level it provides) for some sort of tanking increase even though it wouldnt really provide much protection from spikes.  Another thought I had is if instead of healing a spear could place a reverse rune on the mob for whatever the spear hit for*1.x (scale up as spears improve), for Miasmic spear say damage*1.5.  The spear hits for 300 and blocks the next 450 damage the mob does from occuring, it hits for 1749 (current maximum) and it blocks the next 1749 damage from occuring.  Doubt that would do much either however if it's even able to be coded.  Theres multiple problems with us tanking now, it's no longer efficent to have Knights offtanking adds in raids, you're better off with Warriors even on boss mobs.  Our additional damage is meant to be a means of damage avoidence by killing mobs faster requiring less heals, but offtanking raid adds... thats pointless.  Tanking mobs our damage is piss poor and those lifetaps dont give us that &quot;avoidence&quot;.  Exp groups we get owned quite frequently.  One of the main problems with our GoD combat casting is the speed which mobs hit at, a typical unhasted unslowable named quads at 12 delay, at a 50% hit rate thats 4 hits we have to channel through for a mere 2 sec or less spell, spears are the only things we have that can cast at the speed required, why I was looking at them<br />
<br />
Unfortunatley as you said, spears are highly resistable so unless they got resist mods as well it's pointless and just another spell line to abandon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Belyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If dps increase is the only thing holding back better heals for sks, could just add another aa ability, theft of life mastery that pushes the chance for a healing crit to 100 percent.<br />
If the mana cost of taps balence is holding this back have tolm hotkeyed to increase the mana cost of tap spells when on.  Wizards have a similar hotkey that increases crit chanse on nukes, this code should be nothing new for devs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Lets see a lifetap spear for 1500 every 45 seconds.  Not sure how much good that will do on mobs that quad for 1200 to 2000 dmg.<br />
<br />
Only thing I can see helping us is some type of defensive or riposte disk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Was looking at it as a way to lessen spike damage Inferna, unfortunatley the solution isn't workable without major revisions to spears.  Maybe next expansion they'll start adding some efficency mods (for lack of a better term) to lifetaps so they return say 25%, 30%, 40% etc more than the damage they deal and can actually remain as viable spells because if GoD is any indication lifetaps are dead now and in the future (this affects necros to).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Another idea would be to delete our spears completely and replace them with long recast lifetaps, on the order of life leech.  At 65, would a 1k lifetap with a 1 min recast be so game breaking?<br />
<br />
Adding aa's for healing efficiency would be another very nice change.<br />
<br />
As far as I'm concerned, even our PoP taps have been a dps spell 95% of the time, and actually a useful healing spell maybe 5% of the time.  On raids I normally just use 'em as low resist DD's.<br />
<br />
And frankly we're behind the curve on dps atm anyways.  Giving us a significant dps boost through upgraded lifetaps wouldn't destroy the game, either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Darko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Its pretty sad how quick I drop to a named even in vxed, and thats with an almost a full set of time gear and a cleric+shammy spaming heals.  Considering i am with out a doubt in the top 3 sk on the server IMO i should be tanking vxed with a damn good survival rate.<br />
<br />
I think they should start by changing death's fury in to an aa that mimics Healing Adept, make 6 levels of it, and have it affect the healing part of all our taps.  Second they should change miasmic spear into a life tap along the lines of a ToI, maybe slightly more tap for more mana cost, I really dont think the damage increase is unjustified considering most classes i can think of got new nukes, and with the new weapons melee got better damage as well.  Finally either through a spell or a disc we need a way to boost our mitigation significanlty for a short period of time (1-3 mins)<br />
<br />
As far as spears, as many have mentioned their high resist rate makes em hard to work with.  However, a rune recourse could be added that only gets used against the mobs top hits, in other words when they di &gt; 15 or 17.  The rune can have a short duriation no more than 1 minute, and will take a slot in the song buff window, and will absorb 2-3X the damage of the spear.  This soution targets the root of the problem, damage spikes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>BrikBludgaard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Another interesting idea is fastcast runes....<br />
<br />
Inagine casting a rune that is fast-cast and short-duration, and that its primary function is a RUNE (beneficial) and its secondary function (recourse when hit?) is a higher end damage shield.<br />
<br />
This rune goes to the short duration box, and only lasts for 18 seconds or less. (It's designed for tanking.)<br />
<br />
This rune would be self-only and thus be quite effective...  MORE effective than a lifetap due to all the down-sides to it.<br />
<br />
Similar spells exist in game, but most are group, or even AoE...<br />
Ours a would be for just ourselves.<br />
<br />
This spell would be doubly useful as an aggro-creator as well...<br />
<br />
Allow our normal damage shields to stack along with intense hatred modifying by a PERCENTAGE as well as a +3/rank.<br />
<br />
<br />
Another possiblity is a rune that has three ticks...<br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Justjoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">so a damage shield type buff that restores say...20% of the damage taken per round via a lifetap/heal would be an unviable alternative to defensive?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">How about not modify spears, just replace our terror line with a decent spell to help battle damage spikes or introduce a new line of spells in the next expansion that help do this.<br />
<br />
and Darko I'd say you are in the top 5 on your server ;) not that it matters, but I think at least the top 50 SK's should be able to tank a named in vxed with decent healing support. I also see you are back in Valon where you belong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Radahsam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I don't know for sure what the answer to our problems are.  I just know that it's all screwed up atm.  When the only difference between Brael, Brik, or Darko tanking a GoD mini-boss or add and me tanking the same mob is about 2 seconds of extra life on their part....something is seriously wrong, given the gear differences between us.<br />
<br />
It used to be that the gap between cutting edge knights and lower level knights was huge, especially when it came to tanking.  This was as it should be.  Now, the difference between a knight tanking and an enchanter tanking is largely unnoticeable.  Hell, chain runes might even own my ass.<br />
<br />
Did SoE just not put any intelligent thought into GoD design?  They seem like they had tunnel vision, where the only things they could think about were a) fixing warriors and b) slowing down content trivialization by making the encounters an order of magnitude harder.<br />
<br />
WoW is looking better every day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">At FF I floated the idea of an Ancient Life Tap. Either a straight modification of ToI, or an idea Brael/SV had last year of a long recast time and a big tap and increased mana cost.<br />
<br />
They are not going to adjust our existiing spells. They are not going to adjust our existing AA's.<br />
<br />
I think that the best we can hope for is to get a 'wish list' for the next expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>aress</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Is no one else woried about a mass exodus?  At least the so-called end game SK who are currently in KodTaz or Uqua after having farmed time for months clearly do not see:<br />
<br />
A. a viable raid role<br />
B. support of suggested solutions by other classes such as warriors<br />
C. improvement of the situation via gear (mobs will just hit harder then in the next zone)<br />
D. positive feedback by SOE<br />
<br />
In contrary, SOE has made it very clear that the situation is basically &quot;as intended&quot;.  This as well as the proposed &quot;band-aid&quot; of the Inkinz change frustrates and annoys us very much.<br />
<br />
I am stubborn myself, but I have talked to other SK on my server and fear that many will leave very soon, since there is no hope on the horizon.  Couple this with summer coming and WoW on the way.  For many it is just not worth it anymore.<br />
<br />
Not that it matters much to SOE, since our numbers are still fairly small.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Squigle D'Muerte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">As far as healing goes what I would like to see (and I think is is called for) is an upgrade to Bond of Death.  80 hps/tick just doesn't cut it high end.  This is an easy way to give us more power/healing but not overpowering because since it is a DOT you got to wait for it to run out for a second cast to be useful.  Make a 200(?) hp/tick DoT with a high mana cost, so you can't afford to use it on every mob (at least while quick pulling).  Sort of a boss mob spell.  Not sure of the actual number but the intent is to make a boss mob/emergency spell.<br />
<br />
Spears are DDs, leave them as such.  They are expensive to cast as it is.  If you add more effects then the mana cost has to go up too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
200hp/tick is beyond pointless when the mob you fight can likely dish out 10000+ hp of damage in the same time frame.<br />
<br />
Generally heals overtime are horrible when tanking a boss mob. The heal can kick in when you are full health, between two rounds of the mob, they take a buff slot and at best they only heal an awful part of the damage taken between each ticks.<br />
<br />
Unless we talk of something along the lines of 1000hp/tick for 6 ticks for around 2500mana (hahah), this kind of spell wouldnt be useful against such mobs, even less being a fix to the issue at hand.</div></div><hr />
