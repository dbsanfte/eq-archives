<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Orthogonon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was looking through my vault after an extended period of not playing and found all the stuff for the spirit wracked cord quest, sans urn.   Sick of this crap clogging up my bank space, so decided to make urn a priority.<br />
<br />
Anyway, was looking through posts about getting into the east wing with out dealing with keys etc. and saw a couple posts that said you can float over the stair trap if you have SOW and lev on.  So, was just in HS and tried this about 15 times and could not do it.  Almost, but not quite.   I started out standing on the fire pot things on both the north and south platforms, but no go.<br />
<br />
So...<br />
<br />
1.  Is there some special trick or technique i am not aware of?<br />
<br />
2.  I used a SOW potion before zoning in.  I thought that SOW speed varied by the level of who is casting it.  I might be wrong, but is it possible to get a faster SOW by having a PC cast it on me?  Or, is SOE faster than SOW?<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Find a rogue friend and just go through the south wing.  Its a fun crawl, no reason to short cut it.  Actually, its the only fun part of the quest.<br />
<br />
But, yah, soe is faster than sow. FoE beats both.<br />
SoW: Increase Movement by 34% (L9) to 55% (L50)<br />
SoE: Increase Movement by 57% (L54) to 60% (L60)<br />
FoE: Increase Movement by 65%</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Orthogonon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah, looks like getting a rogue is the only solution.   Just tried the float over thing again, this time with SOE and, friend who was helping me had FOE.  Either we are both retarded (possible, but unlikely) or it doesn't work anymore for some reason.<br />
<br />
We also tried the duel/gflux method.  That definitely does not work anymore.<br />
<br />
Well, guess i will start looking for a bored rogue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vezax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">For some reason i feel like i fall faster, and have never made it w/ soe.  W/ bobbing corpse and sow i make it everytime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The trick is to go to a different wing and climb up on top of the firepots to get as high as possible before you run over there... look up.. run for it.. you'll make it about 1 time in 4.<br />
<br />
-Bolas</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Aye, I've made it with both SoE and Bobbing Corpse/SoW.<br />
<br />
You have to look up, and personally I had to keep the map up and navigate that way so that I didn't waste any steps wandering around looking for the landing.<br />
<br />
Moving from South wing through isn't a bad crawl though, and AAxp isn't horrible going that way either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Yaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Twice now I have gotten a rogue to open up the doors in the south wing for me as I flopped all the way back to Drusella's room.  I would invis and invis to undead when the time called for it to make it go by faster.  It takes me a half hour to get back there now.  Now since the memory wipe after 2 minutes of FD, you don't have to quit out anymore along the way if you do get seen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tantrissa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I used to 2-box there a lot, and I learned a couple extra bits of info that might be helpful.  First, it seems to help if you stare up at the ceiling while you make the run.  Also, I found that I could never make it on my &quot;slower&quot; PC.  I always had to run one char across, camp, and do the next char on the same PC.  Third, on my halfling cleric I found that if I drank a growth potion, he had a MUCH easier time getting across.   Besides that, everything else that people mentioned is totally right.  I always use the firepots on the west side to make the run and I use regular sow potions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Wyrdlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I had a hell of a time doing it.  Ogre potions were needed for it to even be POSSIBLE for me.<br />
<br />
After that, I found running straight across made me fall too fast, I did it easiest when I ran up the fire pot, then lev'ed over the steps, over the corner of the middle and then over the fake steps.  Cutting the corner I'd get close enough to get stuck but not make it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Makkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">for a while i was going for swc for the necro, 3x drusella kills with no urn turned me off to it..but i did pick up a nifty trick<br />
<br />
occasionally the skelly wanderer is one who summons. id just root him, slow him, then throw a dot on..p00f he summons me up<br />
<br />
you'd have to get some kind of root clicky for it though as an sk</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zvaras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I think its totally about your computer and how much lag you experience.  I can make the run each and every time starting from the top of the firepots.  My girlfriend playing on a slightly slower pc can't.  Log on to her account from my pc and she makes it every time.  Same story with a warrior friend, he can't make it but logged on from a different pc and bingo!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Vezax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">But youll definately wanna float over to east wing instead of trying to hot foot it through south to east.  Take about 15-20 min of sloping and invis swapping to make the run to drusilla from east wing door, while it took me at least an hour when ive made the run from south.<br />
<br />
FInally got her damn urn, yay me =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>XebarisTP</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I hate you all. Good god, I hate you for constantly rushing Drusella FOR THAT STUPID CHARDOK QUEST URN!<br />
<br />
And, good god, I hate server resets when I finally have a clue on the spawn time.<br />
<br />
And, good god, I hate GOLEM GUARDS who ruin my invis vs. undead, and slow-casting skelly necros/sk's who ruin my fd.<br />
<br />
I've done my best trying to fd my way to Drusella (with master key), but the fail rate is too high when there are golems and skel casters within each other's aggro range. I probably died 8 times this week, at the same spot, and succeeded 3-4 times. But the fail rate would be a lot higher if I hadn't stopped trying when the golems are up in bad spots.<br />
<br />
My charisma seems a bit low for BYOG'ing here, and I don't even want to try unless Drusella is up. I'm sick of dying now, though, so I guess I'll make a bloody lev 24 druid to track her. :/<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>XebarisTP</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Hm. Druids don't get tracking until lev 20, so I guess tracking won't be maxed until lev 44? :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Makkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">rangers get track earlier(lvl 1), not sure when you would be able to track drusella. i'd bet something like lvl 30 would work.<br />
<br />
just get him a lev of some kind, clear zonein with your sk, drop him over the side there are a few safe spots. seems easiest to me.<br />
<br />
i really didnt have any problems on my necro getting to her / killing her, but i can see where it'd be more problematic on an sk (innate ivu == undead version of prenerf CoS, SK should get it too imho)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>XebarisTP</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">There's a spot outside the left and right rooms in east wing that is very hard to pass if there's a static golem spawn.<br />
<br />
I tried to kill the corner mob before that room, and then fd pull golem with darkness, but the first mob gets me down really low on hp and I have to regen and risk repop. And last time I tried to pull golem, I got adds from the rooms because a skelly aggroed as I landed a second spell on the golem, at what I thought was out of aggro range.<br />
<br />
I could probably do it, but I don't feel it's worth messing around with anymore, after these 8 or so solo deaths. Died 2 more times yesterday, while playing with someone who boxed a cle and necro. He fell down the trap with both chars despite my warnings, grin/sigh.<br />
<br />
The best way to fd to Drusella is when there's<br />
1) no golem outside the left and right room in east wing.<br />
2) only undead in the left room<br />
<br />
If condition 1) is false, it is possible to pull the golem with skill, but you might need good regen and a decent HT so you manage before repops. If condition 2) is false, you can take the longer route through the right corridor/room, but you'll aggro golems and skels that way. I've been lucky a few times there, though.<br />
<br />
Another thing i rediscovered yesterday (ouch) was that there are two different goo types. One type doesn't see through ivu, but the bile golem goo should be treated as a golem, i.e. use invis (and do con it).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Viconia deVir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Get the master key.<br />
<br />
You need a hand (container) which is by drusilla on the ground and is nodrop, and 4 parts, get a rogue to get you the parts becaues they aren't nodrop, then crawl through once with that rogue to east and find the hand on the ground.<br />
<br />
Or do the whole dungeon and get all the parts yourself.<br />
<br />
I think I found a map once upon a time of where all the key parts are, but I forget where it was (pretty sure i used google/alla's to find it).  But there is one per wing, and are all groundspawns.<br />
<br />
Best part is once you get master key (works on *all* locks in there) it goes into keyring so you can destroy it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>spoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Best way to find out if Drusella is up is to use a class that can cast sense summoned.  She always has a pet up and you can sense it from the IZ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Amphitryon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I went thru the North ,West, and South wings, and have the permanent key parts for those areas.<br />
<br />
In short, just put a lil extra time in and get the master key, winds up being better time spent than practicing running while floating.</div></div><hr />
