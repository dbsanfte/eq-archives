<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Celedyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Read the board a fair bit since my alt is an sk, but this is my first post here.  Asking because I couldnt find it anywhere, if I missed it sorry.  I know how annoying those repeated noob questions can be from other boards I frequent more often.<br />
<br />
Basically, how many bone chips, or faction mods, does it take to go from either max kos or your starting faction, to max ally or whatever it caps at, for each sk combo?<br />
<br />
For me in particular, I am a DE/Inny sk, and have turned in ~3200 bone chips.  I have not capped out my faction yet, but did finally become non kos to the ikky sks.  This is by far the bulk of my faction work though I have whacked a few iksars here and there.<br />
<br />
I think I read it takes like 5k faciton hits from max kos to max ally?  If (for example, making these numbers up) bone chips are 5 faction for a hand in of 4, and dark elves start at 1000 on the scale, It would be 800 hand ins or 3200 bone chips to cap for that combo, and maybe it caps at amiable.  Numbers are off but highlights what I was wondering- the numbers and faction levels involved for each combo.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance, though its a pretty hard question to answer.  Im hoping someone already has a list or part of one somewhere that I just didnt find.<br />
<br />
Celedyr<br />
<br />
edit: also, think illusions raise you a faction level?  or 1000 points on the scale?  Might be something to include on this thread, its sorta relavent and I havent a clue hehe =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jobrill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Just turn in the bone chips until you're non-KOS. How frickin hard is that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Celedyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yea thanks, you an ogre sk?  Did you read my post?  I was wanting to know how many it took for my race/religion in total - and figured other combos might want to know too, so started a thread for data.<br />
<br />
Your response = worthless.<br />
<br />
Celedyr</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jobrill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Why do you need to know EXACTLY how many to do? And why should we bow down to your whim and will to tell you? And what makes you think any of us are anal-retentive enough to keep logs of EXACTLY How many to do?<br />
<br />
I reiterate, just turn in the bone chips til you're non-KOS.<br />
<br />
You = Worthless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Celedyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Because I know the information is out there.  There was a post at one time outlining how many hits it took from people who took logs, more than one in fact.  I did find in another post the values of the different hits.  All I need to know is the starting value for each combo and the level and which things start conning different (which I know exists and just couldnt find) and I can make the table myself.<br />
<br />
I posted a question for someone to help with a response.  Stop posting if you arent contributing... go work on your gear or something it needs help.  Yours is the worst response Ive gotten on a message board ever.  Blah.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kranug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've got an idea why he might want to have a ball park figure regarding how many bone chips he might need to get to dubious.  Its a wild one, so brace yourself.  Here goes: <br />
<br />
Gathering thousands of bone chips requires time and/or money. <br />
<br />
If an Innoruuk worshiping Dark Elf needs 7000 chips to top off faction then Celedyr may decide its not worth the time and effort to get Greenmist.  On the otherhand, if it is a scant 3500 he might go for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rubblethumper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm afraid I don't have any info on exact quantities, I'm getting ready to start factioning as well and am dreading how many chips an Ogre of Cazic will have to get.   Maby I can just explain that lizard on a stick was before I understood the beauty of their diverse culture?<br />
<br />
I know that the explorer knives from the explorer tower in LOIO are better hits.  The explorers themselves have a decent spawn rate too so it's not too bad.  You can't just go buy thousands of them like you can bone chips however.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>frotty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The long and the short of it is that people act like assholes on this board, attempting to judge if someone's request is valuable or not, based on some sort of asinine logic. It's become the &quot;hip and cool&quot; trend. <br />
<br />
It's pretty fucking obvious why someone would want to know how many bone chips it takes.<br />
<br />
It has been posted here, so the reasoning &quot;who would count?&quot; is a complete waste of time, because it's EQ and I'm sure someone is loser enough to count and proud enough to post it everywhere in an attempt to reveal it.<br />
<br />
It generally seems to be the mode of this message board to be an irascible prick in lieu of personality or intelligence. Great. Vent your spleen here because you can't do it &quot;IRL.&quot;<br />
<br />
Anyway, aside from all the fat which constitutes 99% of a shadowknight.org steak, here's that other 1%:<br />
<br />
I used the SEARCH BUTTON and I typed in &quot;HOW MANY BONECHIPS&quot; and, gasp, it found a ton of threads asking exatly what you wanted to know.<br />
<br />
Even though others are simple dicks for retorting that they shouldn't answer your question with an answer or with what you seek, out of some sort of prehistoric man principle, and back it up with utter garbage for reasoning doesn't mean that you should not ask for info. If you couldn't find it, well, this is the way some people try to &quot;teach&quot; you how to find it.<br />
<br />
The sad thing, they probably use the excuse &quot;I'm a dick because people don't use the search button!&quot; and might be justified, but there's always hope that they'll wake the fuck up and spend their time more constructively.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Celedyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thanks for the responses guys.  I did try search using some other things but didnt try such a long phrase.  It turned up a thread or two that were useful in working towards a total number.  There were lots of posts asking this but I couldnt find a definitive response.  There was a thread at the official EQ site boards that had a listing of the scale for faction (think it was like 5k may be off) which I was hoping to find to coordinate with this but I think it dropped off the pages.  Also, didnt there used to be a post of a dwarf paladin who maxxed cab faction with logs here?<br />
<br />
For anyone actually reading this, the various threads reported 5k or 6k bone chips as a common figure (a 4k here, a 7k there), in total, from max bottom to max top of faction.  The actual levels the different races capped at werent posted, mostly people said &quot;after x bonechips i have enough''.  This makes some sense, as Ive gone from kos to dubious/indiff/amaible (differs by faction, this is where starting levels come in) with about 3200 chips handed in; meaning that 5k-6k should top me out.  With the conversion rates people have posted for points by chips or knives, it would take about 1300 knives to go max bottom to max top faction.<br />
<br />
It also seems that iksar illusion ups the recipient by about 1 con level in most situations.  I say about because with illusion on some factions (like war) will go up, others didnt and now do that Ive handed in more chips.  Was hoping to pin down a number value... which could be compared to a chart to see when illusion will kick you that con level or not.<br />
<br />
More info than I started with anyways =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nazgaull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I read maybe 6000-7000 bonechips in general.<br />
<br />
But I did it with 250 Explorer Knives.  Much easier.<br />
<br />
Now just spend a few nights slaughtering Iksar Outcasts and my faction with the Necro's will be great as well.<br />
<br />
Edit: 150 Knives maxed me with the Warriors.  Another 100 maxed me with the SK's.  Still Dubious to the vendors and Threatening to the Necro's, knives do nothing for Necro faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dalmoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Knives are definitetly the way to go.<br />
<br />
Iksar Bandits in WW is the simple way to raise your necro faction.  Never needed vendor faction at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Celedyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Just an update, 4300 bone chips, still not capped.  Also did about 10 MM ring hand ins from time spend whacking outcasts.  Stuff is all starting to con high, pretty sure Im close to max.<br />
<br />
Btw, the thing you need necro faction for is to just be non kos, or to hand anything in?  Found mixed results when I looked.  If its just kos might be easier to use Illusion potion to solve then kill a lot of greens is what Im thinking; but if needed for hand in thats another story.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>AinilyeEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Err... how u do the knives turn ins if u KoS to the quest giver? Does hide trick work if u KoS, is that it?<br />
<br />
nm :D  just did it with hide trick</div></div><hr />

<br />
Who needs the Hide trick? It's night like it's hard to take a night and slaughter every living Goblin and Bandit in Warsliks Woods multiple times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jackkal Darknite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Just need to be dubious to the Necromancers.<br />
<br />
But when I did the deal with the librarian, I did the Hide trick just because.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Newark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Couple of things here, someone said you only need one faction... not so, Quest giver is in the Shaman/SK guild hall.  If you don't have faction with the Shamans, the Shaman guy will hunt you down and plant eggs in your liver.  I have eggs to prove it!<br />
<br />
I did bones only to raise my Iksar vendor faction.  Otherwise I did the knives and bandits.<br />
<br />
Check --&gt; HERE (http://forums.shadowknight.org/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=7694&amp;highlight=knives) for an excellent knife/bone chip/faction thread.  Pay attention to Norrynoirs counts...<br />
<br />
For me (Dark Elf, worshipper of Innoruuk) :<br />
Collecting 280 knives maxed my Legion of Cabilis.<br />
Turning in the 280 knives gave me faction for all but Brood of Kotiz.<br />
Killing 890 iksar bandit types gave me the Brood of Kotiz faction.<br />
160 bone chips to bring the Cabilis Residents up high enough to do business with.<br />
Killing the explorers in LoIO for the Knives prolly gave a positive Iksar faction hit (can't remember) but it does give a negative FV faction hit - But then who cares for FV faction?!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I maxed my legion of cabilis faction last night on 56 knifes and 5 stacks of bonechips.  Went back this morning and got 30 more knifes and got Non-kos to crusaders and i also turned in another stack of bone chips.<br />
<br />
Dark Elf Shadow Knight,  Deity Innoruuk.  <br />
<br />
Ive still got work to do for the brood faction obviously but thats as far as it goes on hand ins for me,  hope it helps at all.<br />
<br />
*note* i did clear the sarnak fort to get to the weaponsmith last night after i got bored waiting for explorers to repop, dunno how much that helped my faction cause i dont have a parser for it.  <br />
<br />
another thing heh, on my first bone chip hand in i was still KoS to crusaders but i stayed as far back to the wall as i could and that seemed to keep me away from those that path enough to do my hand ins to Mozo and invis up and get the hell outta there. GL and have fun with your quest =)</div></div><hr />
