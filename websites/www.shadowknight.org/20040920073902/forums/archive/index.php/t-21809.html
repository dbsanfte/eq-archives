<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Oogoog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was just curious if anyone knew why avoidance and mitigation AA's are not reflected in your Armor Class?  AC is supposed to be a mix of avoidance and mitigation, why don't these AA's factor into that number?  Do they do a separate calc somewhere?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You have the basic idea. The AC from your gear and stats does have those components, which at one point were broken out to view. There used to be a way to get Magelo to estimate these amounts and display them by adding a command to your magelo address...but I can't recall what it was.<br />
<br />
The AAs for mitigation and avoidance add another level of calculation, but are not a continuous addition. They add a % chance of mitigation or avoidance, rather than a permanent raw amount that can be reflected in raw AC. The calculation is seperate for the AA defensive skills, recause their activation is a random event with a certain probability of occurrence, not a fixed and constant figure.<br />
<br />
The important thing to realize is that getting 10% from AA mitigation and 10% from AA avoidance is a lot better than adding 10% to your AC. So although your AC # doesn't change with LR/ID 5, your tanking ability changes significantly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>signa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">you want to add &amp;debug=true to the end of your magelo address to the see the mitigation/avoidance AC</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thats awesome that you remembered that command, thanks...it's pretty interesting to be able to bring up that view. I'm not sure that those #s mean very much anymore, or vary at all with maxed agi or whatnot...do you know more about how they work Signa?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>signa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">no but im sure someone does and will wander over here</div></div><hr />
