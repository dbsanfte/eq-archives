I found him up this morning before work and had time for a quick shot at him to see what he did (never fought him before).  Very fast quad 350ish, some AEs and stuff (resisted everything) and hes a necro, who dosent like to cast much~<br />
Went in to straight up melee him and got my ass handed to me before 75% (no HT or LC used).  Couldnt land anything cept Touch of Inny, even mental horror was resisted every proc.<br />
If he's still up when I get off work (doubtful because a) servers are going down again, and b) because Scal sucks) i plan to try the good old dot and FD, but if i'm getting that many resists on standard spells, is it worth trying?  I've also thought about trying the DoT/FD with Trak, but haven't been able to because, as I said before, Scal sucks~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PokenHopen</div><div class="date">07-15-2004, 08:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">my understanding is scal uses potions during the fight, I am sure you know about the heal potions.<br />
<br />
Only once has he beaten Zlandicar without potions, which he was not expecting to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kalendrox Grimblade</div><div class="date">07-15-2004, 09:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The pots have a reuse timer now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PokenHopen</div><div class="date">07-15-2004, 10:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, but I believe he used them durring the fight and then FDed inbetween clicks of it.  Since its velious I don't think he has insane regen or anything special.<br />
<br />
Could be speaking out of my ass but that would be my guess</div></div><hr />

Hes not to bad when hes casting spells but he has alot of hps and once he goes oom he will start meleeing you non stop. lifetaps wouldnt keep you up long enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sazzabi</div><div class="date">07-27-2004, 01:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anyone have an estimate on Zlands total hps? I know Seneschal in Icewell has about the same dmg output as Zland, but only about 75K hps and I soloed him about 4 months ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">brokenlimit</div><div class="date">07-27-2004, 06:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i've done him solo on my shaman before i retired him.  he's really not that bad, quads 350ish and rampages for another 2 attacks so up to 6 hits per round.  he is fully slowable so once slowed he's super super gimp.  but his resistances are still pretty hardcore.  on a shaman i would have to kill him with pet damage + a combination of hammer of hours procs (time lapse) and velium strikes.  virtually all dots are useless, so on a shadowknight all you're going to be able to land is touch of innoruuk.  mental horror/black shroud will be largely ineffective as well.  his regen is normal, feigning between heal clicks might work tho i don't think it would work all that well.  honestly the easiest thing to do is bring a shaman with the GoD slow spell balance of the nihil, and he is 75% slowed very very easily, then all the challenge is gone.  not sure about hp to be honest, i just know the times i've done him solo with a shaman it takes a long, long ass time with just pet/proc damage and bad nukes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">runcade</div><div class="date">07-29-2004, 07:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">what potion is it that you would use.  I heard it was calilmony or something like that but that potion is a regen spell.  Also Scal said he soloed without using a potion or LC i want to know if that it possible for a 9.7k hp SK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kharan_zechts</div><div class="date">08-08-2004, 12:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've done him with Sk(11k/2k)/Clr(Elem geared)/Rog(Elem geared) combo. Without slow its a pretty fair fight. Rogue takes a good bit of ramp damage too. Hardest thing about Zlandi is finding him up. Perma farmed on nearly every server.</div></div><hr />

<br />
he does regen, so you cant floptap him<br />
<br />
need to straight tank him, regen and ft helps tons, because it's an invariably long fight</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenar</div><div class="date">08-30-2004, 12:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Can he be tracked from zone in?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krassus</div><div class="date">08-30-2004, 01:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">use MQ or SEQ and he can be tracked !  :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scal4u</div><div class="date">08-30-2004, 04:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is mostly luck with how much he casts, and how lucky your mitigation is.  A couple tips:<br />
1) Place your back to a wall and don't be levitated to help with channeling.<br />
2) Do not spend mana on anything but Touch of Innoruuk<br />
3) Use a 2hander with a Guard3 Aug (5% mitigation that stays up will heal a lot over the course of the fight)<br />
4) Bring Healing Items, Throughout the 6-8 months I've farmed this guy, I've done him once without having to resort to heal potions. <br />
5) Save some mana and/or HT for when Zlandicar runs or when hes low, having to chase him into Chetaris is never good.<br />
<br />
Stuff that Helps<br />
~ Vanazir - Many times when nightmares lands on Zlandicar, his next instinct is to dispell it<br />
~ Damage Shield - If you can buff your damage shield to the 60-70 range, the majority of Zlandicar's hits fall in the 96-130ish range.  He fits fairly often so the DS will sum up to a hefty amount.<br />
~ FT/HP regen - hes got about 70-80k HP, don't expect a short fight<br />
~ Black Shroud - use it over Mental Horror because well, ToI has a recast and BS is resisted less<br />
<br />
Theres prolly more shit that will come to me<br />
MR DD Focus and Crits will save your ass.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, the hardest part is finding him up, especially with the two new VP quests involving DN. I haven't found him up since some time in late June or early July.</div></div><hr />
