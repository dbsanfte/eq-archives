<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fleshrott</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Now, the problem is, using leech touch does far less damage then IHT and makes you unable to use IHT.<br />
<br />
Theres 2 obvious solutions, 1 would make the devs cringe, 1 would just cause the same problem. <br />
<br />
If they are on seperate timers, yer potential instant DPS just shot through the roof, people wont be happy when they get IHT and leech touch used on them right after the other, in a perfect world they would be dead and unable to tell no one, however in EQ we all know they just go to their bind and THEN start whining.<br />
<br />
If they scale leech touch to around the same damage as IHT, then IHT is for the MOST part useless and then yer still stuck with 1 HT vs the other.<br />
<br />
I dont know how much work this would be, but since they've been &quot;revamping AA&quot; it should be easier, what they need to do is put them on seperate timers, but also a timer in relation to each other, IE you IHT, then it wont let you leech touch for 20 minutes, once you leech touch you cant IHT for 20 minutes, but that doesnt matter cause its still 40 minutes till its back up anyways, solves the problem, ya can use both, but not at the same time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>The Zenogias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">solution = <br />
<br />
<br />
Put'em on seperate timers, boost LT to the 5000+ Lifetap range</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fleshrott</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Read my entire post, that solution you just said would piss off alot of people, so we HT some guy for 9k and then 2 seconds later lay hands our self for 5k? I still think the solution at the bottom of my post is optimal</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I dont know how much work this would be, but since they've been &quot;revamping AA&quot; it should be easier, what they need to do is put them on seperate timers, but also a timer in relation to each other, IE you IHT, then it wont let you leech touch for 20 minutes, once you leech touch you cant IHT for 20 minutes, but that doesnt matter cause its still 40 minutes till its back up anyways, solves the problem, ya can use both, but not at the same time.<br />
<br />
Except for the 20 minute timer part, that's how things are now.  We can IHT or LT every 34 minutes.  While it's true we can't IHT for the super duper amount every 34 mins because it requires /disc unholy to hit for the full amount, one can still do both IHT and then LT, 34 mins apart.<br />
<br />
I think I know what you mean though -- set a 'min' value for any form of ht (IHT, LT, HT) yet not allow 2 of the same type back to back until it exceeds a 'max' value.  But 2 ht's per hour vs. 3 ht's per hour doesn't seem to be that much of a change (well, maybe on PvP servers?).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dknight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think he did read your entire post, perhaps he didn't, and is simply saying that it doesn't matter.  With the way the game has evolved and how much damage other classes can do in a relatively short of time is a 8 to 10k HT followed by a roughly 2k lifetap, assuming it doesn't crit or crit heal, which it usually doesn't do for me, really that game breaking?  You state and I've heard it before, that it would &quot;piss people off&quot;, why should anyone be pissed off about it?  I mean really?  A logical real reasoning as to why we shouldn't just have them on separate timers I could understand, but the piss people off argument isn't valid.  Unless we get some super new IHT AA in OoW that makes us start doing 20k to 30k HTs and CH style Leech Touches I don't see them being on totally separate timers altogether as a problem or even something that would or should warrent people getting pissed off about.<br />
<br />
Honestly if they had originally from the start been on different timers as separate abilities and Leech Touch hadn't been given a name with &quot;Touch&quot; in the title would there have even been a problem with anyone and would have anyone connected it to our HT and state it as being overpowered?  Just because it is another &quot;touch&quot; ability doesn't make it sacred and special or anything.  Rename it Soul Leech, Leech Bite, Soul Sapper or something and I doubt anyone would care and that we'd even have this issue that currently exists.<br />
<br />
I'm talking about on non-PvP servers, which I'm not sure if that is what the origionally poster is talking about pissing people off or possibly being overpowered.  Not being a PvP player I can't speak too well about the matter but with all the recent changes I've read about to max dmg of abilities like HT, lifeburn and so forth and how spell damage is lessened in PvP in general I would imagine them being on separate timers wouldn't even be really that game breaking for PvP servers.  If it were to be I'm sure they could make an adjustment or fix to the abilities to put them more in line as they do with other abilities for PvP servers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fleshrott</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My SK was 58 2 years ago and is 56 now, so i've been out of the loop for a while, i didnt take into account the AA's to reduce HT reuse time.<br />
<br />
The HT's are on the same timer, to prevent the HT's from being used one right after the other, mostly for pvp reasons, and pvp reasons are a big reason for it, not because of the number of pvp players vs non pvp players, but because in pvp, is where the players compare their characters vs other characters, and if you HT'ed somebody for 9k and then LoH'ed yerself for 5k such as the suggestion right below my main post, the whines and calls for nerfage would be unrelenting.<br />
<br />
i was thinking of the 72 minute timer, however with a 34 minute HT timer then i believe the timer seperating uses of different HT's should be 10, 15 minutes, to prevent chain HT's that would warrent our abilities getting nerfed...or even worse, to prevent the devs from taking the problem seriously thinking was just want to become overpowered killing machines =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Solution: Make Leech Touch crit and crit heal all the time, or put them on separate timers, and either way, FUCK PVP.  For all I care, make Leech Touch not usable on players, it's PvP and has no place in the balancing of a game that is 99% PvE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Maujin Buu'jin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Could we have an IMPL Disc thats acts the same as Unlholy disc that way Leach Touch does more dmg but CANT be used back to back.  Kinda like when you use Unholy Aura + IHT you really can't use Leach Curse Before most fights are over and UA timer Duration is gone.<br />
<br />
Bah, Used search again, Vaugly remeber you can click off disc and confirmed with search.  But i guess they could make it so you couldnt click it off so that UA+IHT and New Disc for LT (on seperate timers) couldnt be stacked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fleshrott</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i used the reason of &quot;it would piss people off&quot; because, Sony is a business, and when people think somebody else is getting more powerful then them they get unhappy and when they get unhappy they whine, when they whine, sony nerfs things, and we all know how much fun that is</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Fleshrott</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I love both yer idea's, the no leechtouch in pvp and the disc for leechtouch would also work wonderful to make sure nothing got nerfed =)<br />
<br />
and for Dknight, my suggestion DOES put them on seperate timers, just with a buffer as to how close you can use them together, <br />
<br />
just for ease of understanding, gunna blow the true numbers out of the water<br />
<br />
my suggestion is, say each HT is on a 100 minute timer, and theres a 10 minute buffer between using different HT's<br />
<br />
so you start off, you use IHT, cant use it for 100 more minutes, 10 minutes later you use leech touch, now you cant use that for 100 more minutes, and its 90 minutes till ya can use IHT again at this point....they ARE on seperate timers, using 1 HT doesnt prevent you from using the other in any way, ya can still use IHT as much as ya used to, and leechtouch as well, just with a buffer time between them<br />
<br />
As for if leech touch hadnt been called touch is irrelivent, may as well just change the name to Self Lay of Hands</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Skrull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">How about just combining the two?<br />
<br />
Instead of being a seperate ability, when you buy Leechtouch it adds a heal recourse to regular HT for the same amount Leechtouch does now. Buying the improved Leechtouch aa's would increase the heal the recourse does. Once you buy Leech touch, any kind of Harmtouch would have this recourse. Regular HT, IHT, disc'd HT, UT, etc.<br />
<br />
So, HT for 7200+ and get healed for 1900, with max relavent aa's.<br />
<br />
This takes care of any timer problems, gives us a better HP swing, and doesn't make use do even MORE damage, which could be unbalancing in certain situations.<br />
<br />
They would have to make sure the heal recourse didn't prevent bluebie SK's  from using it in duels, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Chania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">In all this, we should also seek that Unholy Aura extend to focus all DD's, not just HT. This would allow us to go offensive for a short time, giving us a much needed boost, and returns a valid Disc to us. Having an entire disc tied to a one shot deal of an ability was always a mistake.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Xanathol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">That's what I've been saying Chania - make UA a damage focus disc, not just an HT focus. Adjust runtime accordingly, etc.<br />
<br />
No offense to PvP players, but face it, EQ is a PvE game in its foundation, so despite what whining other classes may do from this in PvP battles, I would like to see the HT timer go down. 10k / 30 minutes is 5.56 DPS...that's what HT adds to us overtime. Now, on the one mob it is used on ( assuming grouping / XPing ), its nice....but a wizzy crits for 6k how often? Exactly.<br />
<br />
A 10k blast every 12 minutes would put DPS over time at 14. Maybe I am overlooking some aspect of something, probably concerning nameds or something, but I think this may put a little more 'umph' into SKs and hey, if PvP is your bag, then put the fear in fighting an SK again ( HT fear that is )...sure it'll only do 40% max or whatever the change is, but basically knowing its up all more often makes it pretty dangerous.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Coming from a pvp server here is my 2 cents:<br />
<br />
Leech Touch and IHT(HT) should be on seperate timers to start. That being said the following should happen:<br />
<br />
Code Leech Touch to NPC ONLY, UNRESISTABLE, and Focus enabled (Using HT/IHT Focuses).<br />
<br />
As for allowing Leech Touch to Auto Crit that might be too much to ask for although I like the idea.<br />
<br />
If on seperate timers an on demand 1900+focus damage/self heal will get used regardless if it auto critted or not. I know I would use it.<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
Chania: Great Idea about Unholy Aura!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Chania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">In regards to HT and Leech to be on seperate timers but not be able to chain cast both, the solution is simple. All that needs to be done is HT or Leech both put an invisible buff on the mob being hit, and each one blocks the other. That way you can put a 1 min timer on that buff, and you can't back to back HT and Leech. That should quell most of the bitching, if there is any. That should also work well for PvP issues too.<br />
<br />
As for the Unholy Aura idea, it isn't mine. I read it and immediately agreed that having 1 disc solely tied to HT was wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Or just put both skills on 2 timers, make them share one which is a 2 minute timer, then the regular refresh timer in addition to that.  2 minutes is far better than 20.</div></div><hr />

Sounds similar to Manaburn... the invisible buff could block other HT's from other SK's...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Belyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The only consideration that needs to be made for seperate timers is PVP.  Nothing needs to be done to block multiple uses on mobs for dps considerations.  The list of things you can accomplish by being able to fire HT and LT back to back in pve that you couldnt do with LT is a pretty short one.  The game has progressed far beyond what it was when manaburn was overpowered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Honestly,<br />
<br />
Coding the invisible buff thing per mob or upon resolution sounds like more work then flagging Leech Touch Unresistable NPC ONLY. But hey im not a coder so.............. plus you would never here the end of the fucking BLEEDING that others would do regarding this pvp wise. Just make that a PVE ability imho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Tukka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">In all this, we should also seek that Unholy Aura extend to focus all DD's, not just HT.

I'm in love with this idea, it makes total sense.  Since Unholy Aura has this disease association with it with the way it changes HT to DR rather than MR (a double-edged sword), have it boost the base damage of all of our disease based nukes by 50%, along with a disease mod equal to the one on UAHT.  This gives us a more or less sure-fire 900 point nuke along with our HT at level 64+ (except against disease immune stuff), or up to 2220 more points of burst damage against undead if we've got both scythe and spear memorized.  Or up to 4440 more points of damage in the unlikely event that SCF3 goes off for both nukes, or even more with an Improved Damage focus.  That, combined with a /disc'd, AA HT would be a respectable boost in damage, and would add value to our somewhat ill-favored disease nukes without having to directly upgrade them.<br />
<br />
If PvP is what's preventing us from getting LT and HT/IHT on separate timers, that's pretty absurd.  Brael's suggestion of a 2 minute shared timer along remedies the issue should be implemented if at all possible.<br />
<br />
If they aren't going to split the timers or can't figure out how to code it without going insane, what the hell, make us work and give us a unifying LT/IHT AA.  Touch of Malevolence/Evil/Darkness/Whatever, 20 AA point cost, with all HT AAs as a prerequisite except TotW, which combines all of the damage modifiers from CotS, UT and ICoTS as a crit-guaranteed unresistable leach touch.  Sure, it's pretty much an instant self complete heal and a serious chunk of damage, but it'd be a long road to earning that skill to make our Harm Touch the frighteningly formidable skill it should be.  They nerfed manaburn though, didn't they?  So I guess something like this might not make it either, but really, it's an assload of AA and it would return one of our supposed class defining abilities to prominance, at least for those willing to commit to acquiring the ability.<br />
<br />
Maybe if we keep throwing stuff up against the wall, something will finally stick.</div></div><hr />
