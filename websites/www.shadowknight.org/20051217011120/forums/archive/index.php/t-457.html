<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Onahoo</div><div class="date">04-05-2002, 02:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A couple friends and I are planning on getting an extra account for, among other things, a corpse summoner for emergencies.  I've taken a necro to level twelve, and I'm beginning to wonder if it wouldn't be faster to start over with an sk.  I have either a 49 druid or a 55 enchanter to help me out.<br />
<br />
Anyone have any tips, advice, or thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taelnia</div><div class="date">04-05-2002, 05:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">depends on how you PL...<br />
<br />
method a) get the mob near dead and then zone leaving lower level character to kill, or method b) ds character and heal them while they kill, or method c) fear kite mobs and have them kill it.<br />
<br />
That said, it takes a lot less exp to get to level 39 than it does to get to 51, especially since hybrids take more exp to level than pure casters.<br />
<br />
Myself I'd probably use two comps and method a to get the necro to 39.</div></div><hr />

speed of Pling will depend on you not the class you've picked</div></div><hr />

I'm pretty sure they got rid of the hybrid xp penalty in the great  melee balancing.  If I recall the only xp penalties left are for race</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sk's = summon corpse.  Component is 1 large coffin.  Coffins are not stackable.  Coffins require 1 inventory slot.  Cost about 175 pp each.<br />
<br />
You do the math.</div></div><hr />

Necros can't use the cheaper stackable coffins until 57 when they get Conjure Corpse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alhazro</div><div class="date">04-05-2002, 11:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">On the other hand if you choose a necro you could get a thurgadin robe for your corpe summon mule with a little luck and support, that means as soon as you can quest it you have mana free stackable coffin summon...<br />
Dunno what level you need to quest thurg armor, but at 50 it should be possible</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">polydiol</div><div class="date">04-05-2002, 07:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Having played a necro to 55, I would definitely not recommend a necromancer post 50.  <br />
<br />
The class does have its strengths - for soloing but when the shift from 55+ tends towards grouping, Necros fall short.  Mobs are killed quicker than dots can have effect, pets are very, very underpowered and need serious tuning and it is many times more efficient to take another meleer over a necro in grouping.  Raids are even worse, pets do not hit named or raid mobs and if they do its for very small damage and they die quite quickly due to the aoes and many times, dots are resisted along with the few dds and lifetaps so unless you like giving your mana to a cleric, shaman or wizard, I dont recommend it.<br />
<br />
Thurgadin quest robes are even worse.  Since camping arena in Kael from Oct up until now, I have only seen 1 silk robe drop and it went to the guild chanter.  <br />
<br />
If you are want to save yourself some pain and anguish in the later game and want to have a much easier time getting a group and be productive on raids go with an SK.</div></div><hr />
