Can anyone confirm if this spell is still dropping or was removed from the game?<br />
<br />
If it is still dropping, I heard it is from the Battlemaster in Chardok. Is that true if anyone has it and how rare of a drop was it when you got your copy.. Any help is appreciated thank you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am curious if this has any effect on dealing with any faction issues the way that Wolf Form does for druids?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bludge</div><div class="date">03-27-2002, 09:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is still dropping. I purchased it for 5k from someone who had been hunting that part of Chardok the night before.  I know an SK who had done at least 10 camps trying to get it and it never dropped.  I decided I was not interested in punishing myself to that degree for a spell and if it didn't shrink me, there is no way in hell I would even think about this spell, I don't care if it had illusion:cazicthule.  Shroud of Death is a common drop and can be bought for like 100p in EC.</div></div><hr />

This was after aroud 20 trips to the Graveyard.  As long as you go there with the intention of XPing and not getting Shroud of Undeath it will be easy to handle.  Just have a good CC person with you and a cleric that knows how to play w/o DA memed and you will be fine.   I still hunt there just cause of the XP.</div></div><hr />
