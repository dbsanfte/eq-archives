<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Saenayil Shadowraith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, the following info will be mostly for untwinked, poorly geared SK's that wanna level up.<br />
<br />
I'm from Alk'Kabor server, the gear is not the greatest no matter where you go, and these zones will only be up to PoP.<br />
<br />
If your on a PC server, I would probably expect you to be unguilded to have similar gear to the 5 SK's on our server, anyways heres the path I followed.<br />
<br />
1-8 hometown (solo)<br />
8-15 Kurns tower (solo + group)<br />
15-23 Paludal caverns (group)<br />
23-35 Highkeep (group for goblins to 30, guards after that to 35 solo)<br />
35-40 Tae Ew lizards in the feerrott(sp?) (solo)<br />
40-46 Echo caverns (solo fear kiting bulks)<br />
46-48 PoJ for a bit, learn the planes (group)<br />
48-50 Echo again, taskmaster room (Solo, undead fear)<br />
50-55 HHK again, upstairs nobles (solo, fear kite, kill guards before pull)<br />
55-56 PoN, some PoV maybe (was toughest level for me)<br />
56-60 PoJ (solo, fearkite prisoners/undead) PoV, PoS (both group) other T2<br />
60-65 Tier2, and 3.. BoT, PoV, HoH, PoS (mostly duo's, and trio's)<br />
<br />
<br />
theres my list, hope it helps any of you, probably crammed zones for you guys, not sure though, but that was a pretty fast path for me, even though i have yet to complete the last bits lol.<br />
<br />
by the way, PoJ at 56+ is very nice AA xp, up to 5% a kill on some guys, fast kills to, and a GREAT fear path, you will see if you try it ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>TelimTor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Since when does Fear work in PoJ?  I've tried in the past month and every mob is immune.  Unless they've turned that on again...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Arikash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Perhaps it's becuase that server stopped recieving updates iirc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Slizarus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">We're receiving updates now, however if they've started to work on PoP I'm not sure other than the initial glitches.. as this is not a glitch, we're not complaining.<br />
HK in your 30's?<br />
DSP is just as good, though I understand you can earn a bit of money killing guards, funny.<br />
Saenayil, you're the highest Unguilded Sk right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Saenayil Shadowraith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">yeah, im also third highest on server</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Daeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Fear kiting in Poj works well all the way up to 63 i think which i did it till i did it with the gaolers well until they nerfed fear working in poj...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Saenayil Shadowraith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">All i know is it got me from level 55-56 on prisoners in 8 hours, and then sentry's and goalers along with Tier 2, i find it a GREAT plat camp, the BD's taht drop are awesome... anyways, tanking works well tehre to, you just cant do goalers, but then again with your equipment im almost positive most of you could... anyways, my 2cp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>BobTheIksar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Saenayil you don't have awful gear in comparison to me...  My highest AC item at lvl 51 is my Dreadscale BP for christ's sake!  It has a whole 18 AC.  It is good you are finally posting on sk.org though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fallgore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Good guide, but here is what I did:<br />
1-7 Home Town<br />
7-10 EC Orcs<br />
10-13 WC Dervs<br />
13-23 Pal C<br />
23-27 Netherb.<br />
27-37 EW<br />
37-40 CC (mainly loot purposes heh)<br />
40-46 Went around Echo Cav./Dsp<br />
46-49 PoJ<br />
49-55 PoI<br />
55-61 PoV<br />
<br />
And that is the end for me so far, but once at lvl 26 you can do Ldons/Advs.<br />
<br />
This guide is also grouping at All times if you wanted except on Home Town part, rest is grouping heh, occasionally solo'd though<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, and you can do this:<br />
40-46 KC<br />
ALthough it hurts your faction, I did that too lol</div></div><hr />
