<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Graznoth</div><div class="date">03-31-2002, 05:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Disease Cloud's all you should need, casting it once at the begin of the fight and then just using taunt is generally enough, recast if you lose agro, works like a charm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brael</div><div class="date">03-31-2002, 06:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">/sigh no one ever remembers to mention clinging darkness for aggro, low mana fast cast... also a nice emergency snare</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rikkar</div><div class="date">03-31-2002, 07:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">to me breal at 30 DC beats the hell out of darkness, it just always seemed to work better and for us big dumb ugly sk's can't beat the 5 mana or whatever it is dc takes hehe, darkness is a very viable option, it definatly tends to piss mobs off</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pajita</div><div class="date">03-31-2002, 10:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not sure if a level 30 can cast shadow vortex.  If they can, it's a great spell for taunting, even if it's a bit hard on the mana.  Good when the cleric heals just a little too fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nephtu</div><div class="date">03-31-2002, 12:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shadow Vortex is 39, as are Shroud of Hate and Heart flutter, another couple of nice aggro spells.  The nice thing about SV/SoH is that they give you a solid demezz spell lineup that doesn't involve a DoT.  However from level 9 on through 60, your prime aggro spell in so many situations will be Disease Cloud - the gift that keeps on giving :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">darkmelusine</div><div class="date">03-31-2002, 01:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">SoH in my experience isn't a lot of taunt, especially compared to say darkness, disease cloud, vortex.  Even SoP is higher taunt I think.   Flutter/Asystole cast times are too long to be effective for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Syfon</div><div class="date">03-31-2002, 01:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heart flutter is a very nice taunt spell. <br />
<br />
SV has to be our best spell due to it not being a dot and generating alot of hate before breaking mezz. DC is our number one overall spell for taunt, but once used that mob becomes unmezzable. SoP, HF, and ED all do a fair amount of hate increase individually. <br />
<br />
Use these say 3 out of these 5 and hit taunt a couple of times and Cazic Thule wont be able to pry a mob off of you =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Byttorr Ebonknight</div><div class="date">03-31-2002, 02:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The mez-breaking lineup I use is taunt/Shadow Vortex/taunt/Darkness/taunt and then bash or Disease Cloud to actually break the mez. (When time is of the essence, SV/taunt/DC usually does the trick, but it's not 100%) The reason you can throw a Darkness in along the way is that it takes about 5 seconds before the DOT component kicks in.</div></div><hr />

<br />
    I am a brand new member. After reading these boards, I am very glad to have found them. The content that you all provide is truly useful information unlike other boards I WAS using in the past. <br />
    Lemme start by saying that I agree with Brael on this one. I find that the mobs seem to dislike the Darkness spells. Maybe it has something to do with the dual effect, snare and DOT. That and throwing in the Taunt, Bash, and a Beg every now and then I can maintain aggro. I have had difficulties once with an uber twink monk, other than that.....no problems.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">yuggoth</div><div class="date">03-31-2002, 10:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Darness is ok... but so often as puller in my 30's I was running at very low mana for long periods of time... and that made DC totally invaluable for taunt.  I've always found it to work better in those - hard to taunt off situations, like crazed rogues....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brega</div><div class="date">03-31-2002, 10:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">An SK never needs more than Disease Cloud and Vortex Shadow to effectively taunt.  You have to be careful with these spells as a matter of fact, and never use them on big mobs that your Warriors are tanking.<br />
<br />
Shroud of Pain also works well, but no better than the above two.</div></div><hr />

<br />
/attack off<br />
/doability 1 (taunt)<br />
/doability 2 (beg)<br />
/attack on<br />
/cast 7 (DC)<br />
<br />
then i have another i use to buff my self / debuff the mob<br />
now i dont use this one all the time ... but some times when i solo or about every 3 or 4th pull i mainly use it to buff myself and debuff the larger pulls you sometimes get  you have to work on the pauses to get them down to when the gems light back up the next one is casting i think it is 30 thou <br />
<br />
/cast 4 (ac tap)<br />
/pause 30 (i think)<br />
/cast 5 (atk tap)<br />
/pause 30<br />
/cast 6 (str tap)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would imagine that it's a descent taunt, but if I remember correctly, the manacost is brutal.<br />
<br />
Any of our lower level members have exp with this spell?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ghumol Fleshcarver</div><div class="date">04-01-2002, 05:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">SoP ad SoH don't really taunt to me and the mana it takes isn't worth it   i have been using Heatblood/DC then snare for damage  or snare DC ad HB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baroyonx</div><div class="date">04-01-2002, 08:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ever since I've had the spell, I've been using DC like a second taunt button.  I do agree that the darkness line also has a great taunt value but DC is fast casting and uses so little mana, you might as well use both :D <br />
      Another thing I have noticed which seems to help with agro is bashing, if you have a high skill.  Mobs don't seem to enjoy being stunned and having their spells interrupted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">synnoira</div><div class="date">04-01-2002, 11:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">scream of pain doesn't have much of a taunt to it that i can see, i experimented a bit after i got it<br />
at level 30 anyways disease cloud followed by clinging darkness is your best combo<br />
at 39 I put shadow vortex in ahead of those two, as people have said it's a big taunt which won't make the mob unmezzable<br />
i find opening with SV followed by DC makes mobs stick to me most of the time<br />
 i throw on Shroud of Pain third now at 50 and then clinging darkness fourth, though that's only necessary if i'm dealing with casters who have some aggro management problems</div></div><hr />
