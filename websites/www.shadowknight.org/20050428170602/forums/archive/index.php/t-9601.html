<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jobrill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would suggest Wood Elf.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>ubvman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Iksar I would say.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Akeikyl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Iksar's Innate AC bonus, Forage and Regen will help alot for any new SK but especially a non twink one. Sure there is that exp penalty but there is a price to be paid for being the best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grimbad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Iksar or Troll.<br />
<br />
In addition to having the best racial abilities, they also have the best newbie zones in the game.  By level 10 you can be outfitted in a full suit of magical armor, and wielding decent weapons.<br />
<br />
I didn't twink my SK until 15, when I took him to Paludal Caverns, and I hardly ever died.  Course, both of those zones are notorious for having high level shamans strolling through buffing newbs, and I admit that had a lot to do with it.  8 )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aaoogaa Soulhunter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Trolls are the best race for sheer untwinked brute killing power with minimized down time.  They also have the highest exp penelty and level much slower than many other races.<br />
<br />
As an untwinked person you should also consider the hastle of being a large race.  This is going to sound bad but the best untwinked starting class avaliable now is probably the gnome and here is why.<br />
<br />
1.  They can travel to most places no other SK can.  This will make it much easier for you to move around at lower level.<br />
2.  The have better physical stats than a DE and a good starting int.  This will allow you to concentrate on the easier gear to find.  Str and stamina/hp gear is much easier to find than int gear.<br />
3.  Lowbie armor quests in starting city.  It is easy to hunt in the starting zone and collect the items needed for the lowbie gnome armor quests.<br />
4. No exp penelty like the Ogres, Iksar, and Trolls.<br />
5.  You can see at night unlike humans and erudites.<br />
6.  You can wear plate armor unlike the Iksar. ( Very important since your not a twink)<br />
The down side of being a Gnome SK.<br />
1.  You would be a gnome.<br />
2.  You would be short (good on PvP servers)<br />
3.  You would be told multiple times on this board to die.<br />
<br />
It pains me to say this but if I were going to start over I would choose a Gnome.  Anyway thats my 2 cents.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Manslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">At lower level the regenerating races tend to do quite well.  Once you start raiding, large races with more physical stats tend to do better.  At the highest levels of raiding, small high Int races tend to have an advantage since INT is the hardest pertinent stat to increase.  So all races shine at various stages of development.  But all this talk of advantages is relatively minor, so just play what you think looks cool/will be fun, it really doesn't matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>nnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">trolls eek out iksar in pure armor choice. they do most anything an Iksar can do (regen) plus they can wear plate armor. and Slam if i recall correctly. there stats are close to ogres too. <br />
<br />
only problem is... they're ugly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Attyla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Personally, I'd choose human (no race penalty, greater access to gear later and not too big to be unable to get around).  Iksar has nasty penalty and cannot use plate (no clicky armor at 45).  <br />
<br />
Newbie zones are moot point if you have PoP.  The best newbie zones all the way to mid 20s is going to be near Shar Vahl.  I would suggest a race that can get around well enough.<br />
<br />
Shadeweaver's thicket and Paludal caverns is going to produce alot of cash for you.  You will make enough shortly to head to the bazaar and be able to afford some very cheap and major upgrades in no time.   You should be able to port back to your hometown to train and get new skills.  PoK will have almost all the spells you will need in one place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>krikk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i guess I'm partial, but I'd say Iksar. Well-rounded melee-stats, regen, GREAT storyline, cool look, many armor quests for newbies, EXP penalty isn't that bad, and best newby zones. (Cept' Swamp). Also, you can get an okay array of weapons:<br />
If done correctly, the swords you quest for (Khukri's) are useful as you level. You get the first one which is better than your Shortsword*, then the 2nd one around level 4, then the third around level 10 (If you're careful and patent), then the 4th one right after that, and so on. <br />
After a certain point, you can quest for armor which is better than the other low-end quest armors from other cities, although they are harder, and require rare stones. <br />
I guess it doesn't matter though, because you've probably already made a Dark Elf :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ogan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I perfer an Ogre SK. You already start out with high str and stm. At higher level you might have lower int, but with KEI and self mana regen its not a big deal at all.<br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kronicblu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">bah you all left gnomes off the list.  They have great close n00b zones.  we the Best looking and have good int, sure u have no str but once you get WT reduction bags hardly notice it :)  yes i know im going to get flamed for this ;p</div></div><hr />

and best newby zones. (Cept' Swamp). <br />
The Swamp of No Hope has a small but useful newbie area, which is usually quite empty.  Not a bad place to level from 1-4 at all.<br />
<br />
But yeah, Iksar make a good non-twink SK race.  Regen makes getting through the early levels much more tolerable.  You have your choice of newbie hunting grounds, and they tend to be pretty good.<br />
<br />
You have the armor quest for Curscale armor, which is one of the few times SOE got newbie quest armor right-- you get the pieces from mobs that you can kill at level 1, the mobs and drops are plentiful, and thus you can level up while getting a set of newbie armor.<br />
<br />
You have the Khukri quests, and the first one is also very nicely done, you can start hunting the sarnak hatchlings around level 3 or 4, and should be able to get exp and the necessary components for your first weapon upgrade.<br />
<br />
There are plenty of skeletons in each of the newbie zones as well, so you can start building up that bonechip collection.  And the weapon drops aren't bad at all.  The rusty shan'tok is something like 8/40, they make really nice pet weapons too.<br />
<br />
By the time you're level 10 or 11 you can go to Kurn's Tower and get excellent exp and decent loot.  You can get to 30 or so without going very far at all.  Granted, PoP makes this a moot point, since you can get just about anywhere in a short time nowadays.<br />
<br />
So you get a good bag of tricks there.  Regen avoids a lot of early deaths, you get a shot at some decent newbie armor and weapons before you are even level 5, and you get a variation in hunting grounds right around your home city.  It is a nice combo for a non-twink.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>smellietroll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">i lvled a de sk to 52 and always felt it was missing something. then i tried a troll and omg i am a brute. i have less down time, i tank better. i live through most bad sistuations. with kei i never run out of mana. and i dont have to spend a point for 2h bash i got slam. i regenerate life faster. the down side i lvl slower and i scratch my ass a lot. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
ps.... i love my troll he is a god:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Valeer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Iksar is the easiest to level non-twink. <br />
<br />
Yeah, Trolls are stronger, but dang it's like driving a mac truck.<br />
<br />
Iksar have the best zones to go 1-40 in, and it makes that part of the leveling process easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>thuuran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I play an Ogre SK.  As stated above the hunting areas are really not an issue with PoP in place.  I am curently lvl 20 and have done most of that soloing all over Norrath.  Orcs outside Freeport, Kurn's Tower, Overthere are all areas that I have hunted.<br />
<br />
As for exp penalty - I don't really notice that much.  I just bash away at anything that moves and I level like anyone else.<br />
<br />
As for int - I have picked up some gear in the Bazaar and have no complaints about lack of mana.<br />
<br />
Str and sta ROCK! - I have spent days hunting without going back to a bank.  HP are around 650 or so unbuffed.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Personally, I'd say level a caster untwinked and twink an SK.  Beastlords do well untwinked if you really want to melee.<br />
<br />
BUT:<br />
<br />
My real purpose in posting is OT, and that's just to give props to the guy with the Blackadder quote in his sig.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Nozgoth D'Burzum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I would suggest Wood Elf. <br />
<br />
lol you asshole</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Deslegrate</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I am not sure which would be the best Untwinked, but I'd have to agree that you should lvl a solo caster first.  Necro or (hate to say it) druid, would probably be a good class to try first.  They do fairly well with &quot;average/ok&quot; equip.  And in mid/late 30's can solo Hill Giants pretty easily.  Few days or so there and you should have enough for Full Crusty and a good weapon at least.  Which would help your SK alot.<br />
<br />
But I guess untwinked just to add 2cp I'd say Troll or Ogre.  Just due to the high melee stats, which will help you, since your untwinked you wont have large bonus's from gear to compensate as other races.  Troll regen might be very nice too, if your in bad gear, since you'll be getting hit alot more at lower levels.  Preference i guess, but I'd really try the caster Idea out.  (My new SK got full crusty for around 1kp.  Another 1kp in jewelery/weapon and 2kp on FBSS - One can easily earn 1kp every couple or few hours with a solo caster at HGS.)  Havn't bought a weapon thats worth it yet, still deciding on what look I want Halbred/Pole or sword.  So waiting to spend the cash on it, got till 20 to decide anyway.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Azraelwrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Validus Custodius armor is really cheap these days.  I saw some for about 10-50 pp for different pieces.  A runic carver and axe of the ironback are good cheap 2hders to start off with early on.</div></div><hr />
