Is there any place we can hunt together without a slower/group we are both level 64.  Any help here is greatly appreciated.<br />

Maybe Siren's Grotto but I never exp'd in there much.  Deeper LoY zones might be a possibility but I've never been back there myself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Try Torgiran Mines, and Nadox.  Also, there might be a few places around the windscorn in Dulak that would accommodate you.</div></div><hr />

I spent a lot of time 2 boxing in Nadox with a high 50s SK and cleric.  The cleric had KEI but could do singles without it.  The Hatesfury side has higher level mobs, thus hopefully more xp.<br />
<br />
I would think you could 2 box in Veksar on some of the undead as well.<br />
<br />
Without a slower load up on the DSes.  Banshee Aura, Cloak of the Akehva and Mark of Retribution is 32/hit.  Add in a Coldain Ring and you are at 40.  Get Cloak of Luclin and its 45.<br />
<br />
If you can take them the mobs deep in the Hole would be good xp.  You can now HS/DA jump and land in a non-aggro spot.  If you had a gate potion, both could get out no problem.  Haven't really thought about this as an xp spot but maybe it would work.  It surely would be uncamped.<br />

Sounds like we may be able to do some of them we will give it a try and hope for the best.  Never thought of HS/DA jump in the hole for exp.  Thats how guild gets down to the Seal to kill him we will have to try this can make Thurg gate potions to get myself out.</div></div><hr />
