<br />
I got mugged repeatedly trying to pull from the ig/it area in perma last night. 3 ig at a time, while entertaining, isn't condusive to continued good health. I never once FD successfully when their was more than one mob, and as for the last pull...<br />
<br />
/shudder<br />
<br />
I pulled one IT near the entrance to vox's lair solo. I went to pull another TT down the hall west from there.... Nothing else around... Target the mob, aggro with shroud of hate, run around the corner so as not to get punted into the pit. I hear the ig priest casting (What is the spawn time on the ig's there anyway? I thought it was an hour) I think &quot;Ok, that's doable.... 'INC 2'&quot; I head back to the gob king area, open the door and turn around...<br />
<br />
At least Vox wasn't up :) But tell me, where did the priest of Nagefen come from? and the other IG, I thought I'd gotten them all? And the other IT? and god knows what else, Vox's whole host I suppose, I was sk mulch after that, as yes, FD failed again :o <br />
<br />
Anyway, what did I do wrong? What should I do differently? And how rare is that damn prickly pear, anyway?</div></div><hr />

would have been curtains if the drood, bless his heart, got all excited by the pounding i was taking and healed me as i was about to go under<br />
so i actually lived since i finally got FD off with ten hit pints left or something, rest of gang had to run screaming through permafrost to the zone<br />
there was a very good guide to getting the prickly pear on the old site (or a post as about such) <br />
as i recall it said invis past ice giants (i think you have to whack the diplomat first) and jump doan into pits where terrors are, pears are common drop, have druid/wizard port you out, all doable with a regular group...have to go try it out myself soon anyway since i've got the 3K plat and other bits<br />
any advice from wiser heads or posting of a prickly pear guide much appreciated by me too</div></div><hr />
