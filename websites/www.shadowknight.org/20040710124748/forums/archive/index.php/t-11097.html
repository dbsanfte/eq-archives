<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Amphitryon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">In PoN, ive been seeing werid things with Voice of Terror and not being able to cast it at all<br />
<br />
heres what ive seen...<br />
<br />
Spell doesnt go off..the cast bar comes up, I see the begins casting message, but the spell never finishes..get no further messages<br />
<br />
other times, the spell bar comes up, goes a spl bubbles the closes, no messages shown and spell not cast<br />
<br />
other times the spell gem doesnt refresh <br />
<br />
oddly enough the only zone ive seen this in is PoN,..i sat in PoK for an hour casting it on my pet w/o a problem and again in Chardok last night<br />
<br />
but in PoN..the spell barely works at all<br />
<br />
anyone else seen weirdeness with this spell? I even tried going back to the stock UI but that didnt seem to make a difference</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>PingGuy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I was having a similar problem with Shroud of Hate/Pain and Dooming Darkness in The Deep last night.  It had to do with having shrieker's targeted at their spawn point.  I could cast fine once they were pulled but it didn't work before that.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure how this is related but it worked just how you described, the casting window would pop up and would just disappear with no message.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nuwar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i had almost the same problem as you described on wednesday night in Seb, when we where doing juggs for spell drops for the guild. We did have a 63 SK with us so i had put it down to not being abole to cast cos the other SK had already put a higher version on the MA. Reading your post i guess that was wrong assumption.<br />
<br />
havent been on to play with Nuwar since wednesday, is it fixed yet ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>dzenith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">WTF is voice of terror?  Are you talking about a voice spell or a terror spell ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mnayar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've found a few spots in pod that were like that. Just would NOT cast the spell. Cast window would come up, decrease to like 2 percent then stop. No mana loss no message. All you acn do is /bug it and move to a different spot.  I happens on all spells i try to cast.  Another spot i found is next to the rock by hedge zone out in pon, half way up the wall next to tunnle going to forest giants in pos, the hill in front of desert giants ( tent camp ) it seems to be a small radius of like 'dead' space were you can't cast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jupke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Had it onces in velks. Had to camp out, couldn's cast any spell at all. After recamping it worked again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I only had this pointed out to me recently by others here, but apparently spell slot #1 is bugged and can SEEM to refresh prematurely (I believe possibly after casting other spells but definitely after a MC/SoD/SoC proc).  Maybe also insta-clicks too, I'm not sure.  Anyways, I used to load Zevfeer's in slot 1 and it would always seem 'uncastable' even though the gem was ungreyed and so I had the same symptoms as the original poster.<br />
<br />
Moving Voice of xxx to another spell slot other than #1 should fix this for you.  Amphitryon, when you were sitting in PoK casting this spell, you probably weren't casting much else, OR at least (if I am wrong on the casting of other spells) your MC/SoD/SoC wasn't proccing... so Voice would not have been ungreying early to make you think it was ready to be cast again.<br />
<br />
Edit: if the spell wasn't in slot #1, there goes that theory.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Amphitryon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">actually it was in the first slot..and i just heard about the bugs regarding the first spell slot.<br />
<br />
oops my bad on Voice of Terror..got my spell names crossed..meant to say Voice of Death<br />
<br />
I was casting stuff like Shroud of Pain and Spear of Plauge quit a bit..weapons and other spells werent proc'ing very much.<br />
<br />
When i was sitting in PoK..i wasnt casting anything else..just Voice of Death<br />
<br />
I switched VoD to the second spell slot and left a fast cast/recycle spell in the first slot..guess this is all tied to the overall problems behind &quot;spell recovery time not met&quot; messages</div></div><hr />

[B]I only had this pointed out to me recently by others here, but apparently spell slot #1 is bugged and can SEEM to refresh prematurely (I believe possibly after casting other spells but definitely after a MC/SoD/SoC proc). Ahhh, that ties in with some experiences I've been having. I always have ToV in slot 1 and when I'm trying to chaincast it, the spell gem looks refreshed and the spell bar will look like it's casting but quit about halfway thru. Just kept spamming it til the 10secs is up, so definitely looks like a refresh issue. Good spot sir.</div></div><hr />
