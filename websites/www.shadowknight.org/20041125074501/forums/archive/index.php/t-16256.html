<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>krikk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My appologies if anyone had a similar thread. I checked search, and found a few complaints but no real suggestions. I hope someone who has some control over the game can check this out:<br />
 It is my understanding that Everquest is based on cooperation between large groups of people, and should work to prompt people to want to group. In making increasments towards group XP bonuses, I think that was accomplished. However, nerfing solo EXP seems a little excesive. I had a hard enough time getting a group before the nerf, but now that EVERYONE needs group EXP, I can't get one for the life of me (which is why I've been 50-56 for so long). When, in the past, I couldn't get a good XP group and the guild wasn't doing anything, i'd go check out CoM by castle or Burning woods for solo XP and made a fair bit of progress in the level until I could get a group. This was also a good alternative if I couldn't play for longer than a few hours. (No one likes a tank who leaves after 30 kills) I know it's a little late now, but please reconsider the Solo XP nerf. I know it's anti social, but so is sitting LFG for hours. Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Darko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Dont blame the exp nerf for your inability to make a group or solo.  EXP at those levels is inflated beyond belif, with the removal of the hell levels, the inormous exp bonuses in the new zones and the additon of the new spells, and gear leveling is a total joke now, if you cant get lvl 65 u are just not puting in the time, or not doing somethign right.  <br />
<br />
EXP is easier now then it has EVER been, if anything all exp should be nerfed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Duke Xerro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I agree on this. Pop really made EXP fly. It used to be a challenges getting levels, but now in higher tier zones you can get AA points every 20-30 mins depending on your group. While before PoP, it would take hours to get 1 aa in velks, maybe a little less in CT....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zenobie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">They didnt nerf the solo exp, they nerfed the zone experience modifiers in PoP, while increasing the group bonus. So if you kill in group, you still get a little more exp, but if you solo in PoP you get less exp.<br />
<br />
In all other zones than PoP, solo exp is still the same and group exp is far better.<br />
<br />
Am I missing something ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>krikk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Youre right Darko, I don't put in as much time as most people do. But I did notice a pretty big change in how much EXP I would get in even non pop zones. Maybe it was a placebo affect? But even with my lower lvl characters in Sol B and such other zones get less EXP than they did before the change or than Krikk did solo back then. Was there another patch I missed? Or am I mistaken?<br />
Well, in any event, the bonus in Group EXP in PoP is nice when I can get a group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xanathol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ummm...after the 'group bonus' was put in, I receive 5% AA solo in HoHo, vs 6% before and 2% in group vs 2.5-3% from before. As for huge XP modifiers, the only zones with considerable XP are the planes. The opening of the planes is the reason there are folks rocketing through lvls. XP in non-PoP zones flat out sucks. Its 'nice' that one can actually get a lil AA in Veksar, etc, but I know of no one that XPs there. Don't hold grief that it took so much longer in the past to get XP than it does now - blame the game. XP grinding is boring. Quest rewards aren't worth the trouble, unless you just like questing. The game has moved to focus on raiding. Most folks have no interest in playing a game that would painstakingly put you through hours of hell with the only worthwhiled rewards coming once you have slowly lvl'd 65 times. Thus the PoP XP, to allow ppl to quickly obtain the XP, while neglecting to fix the problems with the game, like unrewarding quests. As for non-PoP zones, compare a LoY zone to Chardok B. Nicer loot, better XP ( even if only marginally ), and a fun to move around in zone. While LoY is clearly bested by CharB, LoY still has more ppl in it than most old world zones. Why? XP.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I am now rambling, point I am trying to make is its a good thing that some of the new zones are actually giving a bit more XP, as now some folks actually go there. The rest of the old world could use a boost too. The only other thing to do at this point in the game is nerf XP all around, and if so, delevel and strip the AAs from all the folks who gained their lvl 65 with 100+ AAs in PoP. If you don't like that idea, then don't get upset if they increase the XP in the old world zones. The PoP zones have been opened up...nothing we can do about it now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Darko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">How i  wish i could send ignorant ppl like Xanathol back into the kunark days when ebon maces where considered godly, you were stuck with ur hybrid exp penalty, no chance of getting a group, oh yeah and a lack of variety of zones available to you n00bs now.<br />
<br />
Back in luclin in my uber gear i made 1 yellow an hour solo, thats with kie and basicly taking dramp or disco camp from a lower lvl group of players (who woudl benefit from the camp much more than i) this was prime exp at the time.. before the exp change id make around 50-70% aa an hour, thats in a non elemental plane, and basicly with the same gear (was around the time pop opened) yep friends thats around 3x the exp in 1 expansion, now in a pof group i can easily make an aa in 20 mins, yep exp is very difficult.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Lejina Bloodbath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You really sucked if you would only get 1 yellow/hour on Luclin lol.<br />
<br />
Try 1 aa/2hour if you would solo in FG or The Grey.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>krikk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Alright, I've spoken to some people of different classes (Ranger, necro, and another SK) and I'm a little more confident that i'm not crazy. Regardless of weither or not SoE announced it, I think that solo EXP was changed throughout the whole game. I usually solo'd in Kunark, for lack of other options with my equipment I've been using; Or in Velk's. The experience change happened when I was 54 and I'm 56 now. I could get 1 or 2% every solo blue kill in regular EXP then and now it takes me more than 4 times as many of the same kills to achieve the same EXP gain; thus taking me 4 times as long. Hell, Burning wood was great EXP at 52, now I could kill the same Dark blues forever and my EXP would hardly budge. As for my ranger buddy, he and a monk used to duo Velk's lab, or sometimes would group with a cleric and take as much of the lower zone as they could. EXP would fly by at 60, as would AA. Now he plays on Stromm, and about a year after killing in Velk's on Quellious, has noticed a HUGE change in how much EXP he gets when he solos or duo's. I dunno what happened, if anything, but i don't think it's a placebo affect that all my EQ and RL friends seem to be experiencing, or just me wanting an excuse to complain about something :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Xanathol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">&quot;Darko&quot;...its not my fault you're a pompuous whiny lil bitch. I bet you cry every time someone wins a roll on a piece of gear that's better than yours you got 3 expansions ago too. Get over it - the game changed, and if you want to keep old zones populated, thus making all zones more playable with the server population spread out, you have to give ppl reasons to go there. But alas, I'm not gonna get into a flamewar with someone obviously not equipped for battle. Just next time you hear complaining that there are 108 ppl in BoT, just think, could it have anything to do with the loot and XP there? I know I requested that you &quot;think&quot; and this may be a foriegn concept to you, but please do try. Once that virginity is broken, then maybe you can understand why someone may suggest more XP in old world zones, and then provide meaningful feedback and counter answers to other opinions.</div></div><hr />

Xanathol, you just prooved my point, lower the ZEM in the planes and people would become evenly spread out accorss the old/new world areas, the loot gained from the PoP zones would offset the difficulty of the mobs/zone.  Thats a much better alternative than to artificially inflate exp and there by kill the game faster, i am sure SoE wants to milk this cow till the next expansion after ldon at least.  But then again, your shortsited n00b ass would never think of that, go back to LFGing in bot.<br />
<br />
And Lejina i dont see how you could posibly make 2.5 yellow an hour in the grey back in the luclin days , unless u 2boxed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>krikk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I didn't think his gear was that bad...<br />
But that's not the point. Despite how much you guys are arging :) I think that the old world zones should be revamped as well. i never wanted the planes to get reduced to being bad experience, I just wanted to be able to solo again and make considerably more EXP than I do now. Obviously, considering how the things I kill would be lower level and easily fear-kitable, I wouldn't expect as good of EXP as in a planes group. According to the recent patch, oldword zones were changed. i dunno what that means, but I hope it's not a change for the worse. Let's keep our fingers crossed and hope they didn't make all Iksars pink . . .</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is your problem. You no longer get a set amount of exp based on the con of a mob (lt vs dk blue) but rather the level range of the mob compared to you. If at 52 the mobs in burning woods were within 5 levels you would be getting nice exp, but now you are 56, the level range has likely increased beyond 5 levels and you are a) getting less exp per mob, and b) needing way more exp to level then you did at 52. These two things combine to make the exp gain appear to stop. If you want to counteract this you need to find soloable mobs closer to your actual level, not just blue conning ones.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Dragantis Xy`Rath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">What the hell does it matter? Does any one remember what it was like to grind in Sebilis? For fucks sake it could take an hour to get 1 full blue if you were in a moderate group, or hell it was worse before you get even get &quot;a blue&quot; and all you saw was the yellow bar slowly fill up. Now you can get 1 - 2 % per kill....thats half a blue per kill! STFU and be glad you don't have hell levels and everything is easy to kill for 1 - 2%. Even soloing back then wouldn't yield any where near that kind of EXP.<br />
<br />
Try this on for size, get a double penalty for being Iksar and SK, get a group in Sebilis at level 52, re-introduce hell levels, and then come tell us about slow EXP.</div></div><hr />

I just remember it taking forever to get there as well when I couldn't find a druid to port me. And this was in the Luclin Days :P<br />
<br />
I remember camping out in dungeons a lot though where as now I usually camp out in PoK.<br />
<br />
Travel really opened up the game for me. That makes XP go faster in itself. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ruuti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">A lot of good points have been made  here but the one that I find most pertinant is the relationship of xp to level,  it is true that it has never been easier to get experience,  SOE has geared it that those in a group fighting mobs as close to their level or above would get the best xp.  Sure I read a post on it, but the aim  was to get people in full groups fighting mobs that were all their level or one to two levels below them.  Then they made the xp drop off sharply for those who are fighting mobs significantly below them.  Taking into account the High Zem of the planes and the relatively high level of the mob most people fight per level  the experience will also remain high.  Raising the ZEM of the rest of EQ to match the planes would spread out the population some,  but then the creators of the game are faced with a population that grows out of control and will be harder to please (keep in mind we all seek an immersive environment).    The other option would be to lower the XP in PoP to match the rest of EQ then you would have people as we have seen in this thread crying Nerf.  SOE is up against a wall, and the question they have to answer is how do we keep the most people happy while providing an environment that they can control and an economy that is not any more out of control.<br />
