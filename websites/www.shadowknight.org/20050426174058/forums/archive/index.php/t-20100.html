Damn it, read your post wrong.<br />

Argest, ikky crusader in FM, not Golnox in FV. :rolleyes:  Jeebus, I'm tired.<br />
<br />
Argest will be all in a silver and red chain IIRC.  That's how you spot him, other than hailing.  As for his PH, you have to kill it, but it won't hurt your cab factions if you're killing the right one.<br />
<br />
There's also a prisoner in there that is part of the shaman cudgel quest and if you kill him, it will lower scaled mystics faction (don't remember if it lowered the others) by around one full level (again, IIRC, it's been quite a while since I've done either of these quests).<br />
<br />
Check in the stickied thread at the top of this forum for more information, there may be (probably are) some more detailed notes on Argest and the other Ikky prisoners.</div></div><hr />
