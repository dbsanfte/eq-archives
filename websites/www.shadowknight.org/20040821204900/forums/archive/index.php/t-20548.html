<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">On April 24, 2003, President Bush traveled to Timken Company’s Canton plant to promote his tax plan. In a speech to workers, he promised that the tax cut plan “means more money for investments, more money for growth and more money for jobs.”<br />
<br />
Numerous studies have refuted that claim, showing that while the President's tax cuts rewarded wealthy Americans with tens of thousands of dollars in tax windfalls, the rest of America actually received relatively little. The average Bush tax cut for the wealthiest one percent of Americans is $938,000, reports Citizens for Tax Justice.<br />
<br />
According to Reuters, the Chairman of Timken Company, W.R. Timken, made $2.62 million in 2003, clearly placing him in the wealthiest one percent of Americans.<br />
<br />
Two months later, W.R. Timken co-hosted a fundraiser for Bush’s campaign in Akron which raised $600,000, and earned Timken ‘Ranger’ status (for those who raise more than $200,000 for the campaign).<br />
<br />
Then, in September last year, Timken Company announced it was laying off 700 workers, adding more pain to one of the jobless recovery's most hardest-hit states. <br />
<br />
Still think tax cuts = jobs?</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's called trickle-down economics and were responsible for what is know in American Economic History as the &quot;7 fat years&quot;.  That being said I believe there are more responsible ways to help stimulate the economy.  I mean do you really want to trust the top 5% to be responsible for adding jobs?  It's not like they got that wealthy by being charitable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Grim, people who are rich get rich by playing the game of life right which includes owning your own businesses and employing people to work for you and make you money, if a tax cut allows them to expand their business to make more money they then have to hire people to work for it, not to mention that the money goes back into the economy by expanding their business when they hire contractors to build it.</div></div><hr />

You look at job cuts due to technology, cheaper labor in 3rd world countries,  and the ever increasing money that insurance companies take.  It takes less people to build stuff now than before, and you don't have to pay health insurance on a machine.<br />

yeah.. that didn't work. Sorry. <br />
<br />
<br />
And I call BS Brael. If you want the money to &quot;get out there&quot; and create jobs, why can't the government do it? I mean instead of HOPING that jobs get created by giving some rich guy more money, why not hire some people to refirbish inner city schools at 30K a year? Why not even put strings attached on the cuts - no extra money unless it's used to invest in job creation? Face it, the tax cuts were a hand out to the rich at the expense of poor and middle class.</div></div><hr />

at the expense of poor and middle class. <br />
The poor dont even pay taxes at the federal level. btw trickle down economics did work but its happens over a long period of time. Regan spent 8 years trying to make it work and by the time bush1 and clinton were in office you could see it working.<br />
 /sarcasm on Yeah GRIM great idea let the gov hire people to work for them it really worked in california /sarcasm off<br />
 But you probably think the moron Davis was a god or somthing. Govroment creating jobs = socialism. You know what socialism is right grim? <br />
     I for 1 enjoy the idea of working hard to achive somthing for myself and not every dip shit in the conrty. oh i also dont have a degree but i am smart enough to figure out the game of life and not bitch about people arnt giving me enough money, free housing, food, drugs, whatever.<br />
    The problem is that people have no personal responsablity. They want to blame their problems on &quot;evil corporations&quot; or &quot;the man is keeping me down&quot; or &quot; the govronment.&quot; Only problem with that is if you spent all your time pissing and moaning about how people are holding you back your wasting the time you could use to better yourself</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do we, as spoiled americans really care about the poor people or not?  Sometimes I do...  sometimes I don't.  most people don't really know which side they are on, which is why we have such sucky-ass middle of the road representatives on both parties.</div></div><hr />

That's why I don't trust the Democrats.  They're a bunch of rich people claiming that they want to help poor people by shifting more economic burden onto rich people.  But you know just as well as I do that they didn't get rich by writing a bunch of checks.  <br />

Taxes are not the government's money. When the government does tax cuts they aren't just handing out cash. They are giving money back to people, money that they took from them.

<br />
He made counter attacks they just weren't very effective.<br />
It remains to be seen in the long run if Bush's will be more effective or not...<br />
<br />
A case can be made for Clinton being cautious when it comes to foreign policy.  But Clinton played a major role in both the Ireland's peace and Middle east peace.  His foreign policy resume will stand the test of time.  Clinton has world wide respect.<br />
<br />
Bush on the other hand decided middle east peace wasn't important and refused to work at it till it bit him in the ass.  The Bush doctrine of pre-emptive attack will probably go down as the trigger that cost America world dominance.  Bush is ridiculed by intelligencia worldwide (even in the republican party).<br />
<br />
<br />
America is the single strongest country in the history of the world but it depends on the goodwill of foreign nations more so now than at any time previous in history both for military and for economic health.  Bush has increased our dependence (economic) while also reducing goodwill because he is an idiot.<br />
<br />
Example of how Bush being an idiot threatened America with nuclear destruction.  Bush states in his biography that he hates N. Koreas leader.  Then adds N. Korea to his list of axis of evil.  But he does so when he doesn't have the military muscle to do anything about it due to being in 2 seperate troop deployments at the same time...N. Korea a nuclear power with 1 million man army and widely regarded as one of the least rational governments in the world responds by announcing they have nuclear bombs and its up to the US to pay them or they will sell them to terrorists.  Had Bush just kept his mouth shut regarding the hating Kim this whole matter may have never flared up.  Do you think any American president in the last 50 years has not hated Kim?  But somehow they all had the sense to not mention it to their Biographers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Baroyonx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I don't honestly see how you can really equate the economy with a President anyway.  The most a Chief Executive can do is to appoint a Federal Reserve Chairman and try to set tax policy.  After all, the Reserve is what sets interest rates (incentive for loans) and Congress has to approve the President's budget.<br />
<br />
   While it seems like tax policy can be important, it is worth noting that prosperity can be reached through either government spending or private sector spending induced by tax cuts.  There is no real magic policy, in my opinion.  Tax cuts are not always good, but not always bad.  What is most important is how appropriate the policies are to the situation.<br />
<br />
     Clinton didn't do shit about the economy.  He was about as middle of the road as they come, he had moderate spending and a centrist tax policy.  The real hero of the 90s has to be Alan Greenspan, who steered us to the boom we experienced.  He's also doing a very good job right now, because this recession was inevitable, since economies are cyclic, and this down cycle could be muich worse.<br />
<br />
As to the whole 9-11 thing, I think that he (Clinton) is to an extent culpable.  Certainly our intelligence agencies should have been better prepared and more aware of al Qaeda as a potential threat.  However, I am concerned with Bush's hesitance to cooperate with the 9-11 commission.  Not to suggest any guilt without proof but outside of protecting national secrets, I am not sure why Bush is dragging his feet so much, it seems somewhat suspicious to me.<br />

<br />
he's dragging his feet because when being accused of something, it is always better to *not* speak on your own defense.  It is always better to provide your enemis with less ammunition than to speak out and create more things for them to attack.  Especially in an election year.  Same reason Clinton was tight-lipped about sperming on that lady's tits.  He looked better because he didnt talk about it.  If he had justified critics with a response he would have looked a lot worse than he already did.  If Bush risks testifying, he will likely say something ambiguous that opponents could use against him in a presidential campaign.  Any president would be advised to do the same in that situation.</div></div><hr />

Money is printed by the government.  It is a social contract between a large group of people.  If there were no laws to prevent theft your money would be worthless.  <br />
The value is in the social contract.  <br />
<br />
As one group gets rich and begins to dismantle the poor that contract begins to break down.  Bill Gates is only rich because we as a nation agree to enable him to continue to be rich.  Thus wether he realizes it or not he is dependant on the goodwill of America for his wealth.<br />
<br />
Bill Gates is worth 30 Billion or so and is currently trying to outsources as many microsoft jobs to India as possible.<br />
<br />
Cutting his taxes does not stop this from happening.<br />
His personal spending habits will be largely unaffected by an extra 1 billion dollars.  This also applies to anyone worth more than say 100 million dollars.  <br />
<br />
The only true argument for Capatilism is that it is more efficient to have distributed control than it is to have central control for most economic issues.  On some issues it is better to have central control because no single entity can handle the risk of going solo or the dynamics of the reward are hard to capture such as universal education of universal health care etc.  The space program under Kennedy shows this as it was an amazing economic success based on the computer chip technology that came from it.<br />
<br />
The government has the role of adjusting monetary wealth to secure the best total value for all involved.  Often this is at the expense of the rich in the short term.  But the economic health of the country is best served when the very rich are not a million times richer than the average person.  The average American has a net worth of less than $30,000 and Gates has a networth of ~30 Billion....</div></div><hr />

Either the Japanese or the Chinese by just refusing to buy American bonds with the trade surpluse they have.<br />

If Japan sold all its bonds tomorrow the US economy would tank.  You do realize the US loses money every year don't you?<br />

US world power has been based on us being the nicest world power in the history of the world.  That is why Europe never re-armed after WWII.  Our power depends on their non-resistance.<br />

The US depends on many other nations to supply the oil, etc.  We couldn't win a conventional war with the rest of the world, and surely would get nuked in any nuclear was as France and Israel have smuggled nukes as part of their national security plan.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The government has no means of generating its own income, therefore it has no capital of its own. Money is legal tender for all debts, public and private. It's a representation of one's own personal wealth. Just because the government is responsible for printing the money doesn't mean it has any kind of control over it. That's why they call it &quot;tax-payer's money.&quot; Money is considered personal property. <br />

Bill Gates made 30 billion dollars because of his own entrepreneurial ventures, not because of some mandate from the people. This isn't a socialist country.<br />

On a scale of 1 to 10 10 being socialist and 1 being capatilist US is in the 3-4 range.<br />

If you believe in real capatilism  you need to read up on the industrial revolution it is very ugly.  <br />

If you believe in real capatilism  you need to read up on the industrial revolution it is very ugly.  <br />

The industrial revolution was ugly because the government supported the industrialists at the expense of the worker's. That is, they banned unions, gave worker's no rights and always did what the industrialists wanted them to do.<br />
<br />
This is not true capitalism, as Adam Smith described it, as there was plenty of government interference.<br />
<br />
It is true that America is a mixed economy, but we are still considered capitalist. Although we have public works and public welfare programs, the economy is still very much capitalist.</div></div><hr />

Please tell we what the hell any of this has to do with taxes ? Obviously you think you cant do anything for yourself so you feel you need to whine until someone hands everything to you.  I have no desire to &quot;match the canadians and give everyone health care.&quot; I dont feel like paying for homeless junky's to goto the hospital cause they OD'ed. Mabey my morals tell me that if you do somthing to yourself you deserve it (like the old saying you made your bed now you have to lie in it). Believe it or not we actually do have free health care centers across the united states. They are called free clinics and some also offer free dental. I personally dont think thats a good way to spend tax payers money but the majority does so i go with it. <br />
<br />
As to the corruption in the school system thats the fault of people like GRIM who feel that if somthing is wrong money can fix it... your money, tax payers money. This is just wrong on many different levels. My mother has been an administrator for Los Angeles Unified School District for over 20 years and the corruption she tells me about is absurd ( like spending 20 million dollars to research and implement ebonics when 75% of the distric's population speaks spanish as their first language). This kind of shit is rediculous, but grim seems to think they need more of MY MONEY so they can do more stupid shit like this. I would think that an audit would do better that way we can see how much money actually goes into the schools for the children and how much goes into the buracratic red tape crap. In short Grim should move to china because they are a communist contry. Thats about the as close as your gonna get to your marksist ideals. Socialism, marksism, communism we all have seen from history where these govonments lead us so please learn from others mistakes.</div></div><hr />

This is partially my point. Free clinics are available to the public so you can get health care at the preventitive stage. Stupid people choose not to take advantage of this and therfore cost you and me more money. I personally dont like people being to lazy to drive, walk, take the bus to the free clinic to get checked out as a preventitive measure. Does this happen? No. Why does this not happen? People feel that they dont have to take care of themselves because Big brother, i.e. the govronment should. This is totally bogus. yes lets all give our money to the lazy people that dont have the personal drive to take care of themselves or their family. If you are in a job w/o healthcare go look for one thats offers it. You could work at a grocerie store w/o a HS diploma and make 20+ dollars an hr + full benefits.

I'd rather pay for awesome american health care than pay (through taxes) for half-assed Canadian health care that is only possible because of American private healthcare.  And of course you know, if America switched to socialized medicine, all those awesome medical advances that our country is famous for would slow to a trickle (no profit to be made anymore, right?  So why bother?) and all the tedious welfare states that vulch off of us (including Canada) would fall apart.<br />

Your CNN type response to my post makes me wonder what exactly you do for a living.  Spend some time in the field and talk to the factory workers and you will find the same thing being said over and over.<br />
<br />
If you believe that someday our cost of production will be less than that of other countries, so that OUR manufacturers stay in house is a sadly ignorant reply.  Because while our manual labor force, which this country was founded on and helped us through the Great Depression, slowly dwindles to competitve foreign markets, the U.S cost of living keeps rising.<br />
<br />
So I ask you, when we will have to pay (and we will) for this in the future, would you rather pay for the unemployment OR a solution to keeping blue collar work in house?</div></div><hr />

Global warming is only 0.06 degrees C<br />
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/1274252.stm<br />
<br />
But near complete sterilization of the planet occurs at 5 degrees raise.  As has happened in the past see link.<br />
<br />
http://currents.ucsc.edu/03-04/10-27/warming.html<br />
<br />
Thus we are  1% closer to complete elimination.  No one knows how gentle this function is.  There is indication from the pentagon that nuclear war will occur long before that (2%? 5%? who knows....  <br />
<br />
http://www.guardian.co.uk/climatechange/story/0,12374,1153530,00.html<br />
<br />
And the pace of heating is not linear so that the next 1% will occur much faster than the first 1% due to increased oil usage and the effects of modern chemicals that attack ozone.  Also the change in thermal properties that has already occured may not be at steady state meaning with no change the temperature may increase and increase even if no more oil is burned at all due to the enviorment having very poor ability to permanently reduce carbon from the enviorenment (trees give it back when they die).<br />
<br />
There is a very real but not immediate risk of total elimination of the human race due to global warming.<br />

<br />
And here is the rest of the post that that link came from:<br />
<br />
Here is the EPA Global Warming website. There is scant evidence that any significant climate change is occurring and great uncertainty as to how much of the about 1 degree in the last century is due to the Sun increasing in energy output. <br />
<br />
Stories about antarctic ice sheets breaking and thawing of permafrost are not rigorous evidence that humans are causing drastic climate change. Don't these phenomenon occur naturally? The NASA study you linked to in fact found a cooling of the Earth's temperature. <br />
<br />
The problem here is there is a huge gap between what Global Warming supporters think will happen and evidence that any of their disaster scenarious actually are happening. What you typically get is: <br />
<br />
1. CO2 is increasing. No problem there. <br />
2. CO2 is a greenhouse gas. No problem there. <br />
3. Computer models say this is what will happen. But these models are very unreliable as I noted above. <br />
4. <br />
5. Here's what we need to be doing to fix the problem. <br />
<br />
Notice that I wrote nothing for number 4. That is because number 4 is where the evidence that any of the disaster is actually happening is supposed to be presented. Its conspicuously absent in GW discussions. The computer models are substituted for evidence. And there is absolutely no discussion from these global warming advocates about the evidence for the Sun's influence. This has to be accounted for before you can estimate how much human influence there is. There is plenty in the links I provided on the other thread to give people a good idea where the evidence for the Sun's role stands. <br />
<br />
But we're being pressured to take steps that will flatten our economy to save the Earth from a threat for which there is scant evidence that it will happen and scant reliability of the computer models that try to predict what might happen if the Earth was to warm. To sign Kyoto under these circumstances would be reckless and foolish.</div></div><hr />

Dude go to college.<br />
<br />
The CO2 green house gas thing is a pretty simple concept.<br />
<br />
Same effect as the window in your car letting in more heat and making your car hotter than outside.  Sure you could have a soda bottle that melts and releases water that evaporates and lowers the temp from the expected temp which would make your model slightly wrong.  <br />
<br />
But the fact is CO2 causes heating.  It is an undisputed heating factor.  Their may be other heating factors but the fact is that humans are increasing the CO2 content of the planet by noticible levels.  The physics of CO2 as a green house gas acts as a heating effect.  There is no fast way to remove that carbon from the atmosphere.  That is the core issue.  Trees will turn it into tree but then they die and rot and its CO2 again.  Sea shells that get buried at the bottom of the ocean is the present model for getting rid of CO2 from the CO2 cycle and that isn't as fast as we are releasing CO2 with burning oil.<br />
<br />
Current theory regarding the near destruction of the earth involves heating the ocean by 5 degrees C and then releasing the frozen methane gas that is trapped in the ocean which raised the ocean temp another 5 degrees C when the earth was almost sterilized way back when.<br />
<br />
The gulfstream conveyor effect that stops England from freezing over shows noticible reduction in flow due to less salty water due to icebergs melting.  <br />
<br />
Sure it could be the sun that is heating up of course if this were true you would think someone would have published in a real science magazine like say science by now.  It could be the CO2 which is where most scientists seem to think it is.<br />
<br />
But the end effect is that when you act to oppose the heating you can't change the intensity of the sun very easily.  You can change the amount of oil you burn.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We aren't?<br />
<br />
btw, raising the earth's temp 5 degrees means more clouds in the atmosphere.  More clouds = more reflected sunlight = cooling.  It's a fairly well balanced system.  If 5 degrees is a doomsday scenario, perhaps some of these morons should look at the evidence that suggests we're currently about that much below the thousand-year average for surface temps.  Warming back up to thsoe temps isn't the end of the world.  More flooding in coastal areas?  Maybe.  Don't build so much right on the freaking water and it wouldn't be such a problem.<br />
<br />
Also FYI, that 5 degree estimate came from the same computer models that have historically been highly inaccurate in predicting temperature change- over the past couple decades they've been trying to predict with mathematical and computer models, they've ALWAYS predicted much higher temp changes than what actually happened.<br />

NOUN: 1. Any of various theories or systems of social organization in which the means of producing and distributing goods is owned collectively or by a centralized government that often plans and controls the economy. <br />

Tarsus, jobs goto cheaper countries, then their wages rise, then companies go elsewhere, wages rise again, repeat until the first country (in this case the US) has attractive wages for the job, and you have jobs back in your country, then you keep them there.  <br />
<br />
Yes, perhaps that's viable for someone who goes into a coma or can freeze themselves while waiting for someone in chindia to charge as much minimum wage here in the USA, but I can't and am not holding my breath. There are plenty of people in other countries waiting in line, getting degrees in the US on student visas and returning to their countries, and the wages aren't going anywhere.<br />
<br />
Someone in India can feed their family of 5, pay their rent, and afford lavish entertainment (a tv, or pirated computer/vid game) on $2/hr. USA. We're talking about waiting until their paychecks are tripled? Maybe in the year 2063.<br />
<br />
Go check out www.rentacoder.com, www.elance.com or any of those coding sites. People will do websites for $20. I just got done implementing a website for $50,000. What's the risk involved in paying a chindian, say, $2,000 for the exact same thing? There isn't any, you have to rely on a company's &quot;sense of patriotism&quot; due to lax big-business blowjobbing by the gov.<br />
<br />
The current pattern in the US is for mid-management to be outsourced or contracted. What that means is little or no viability to &quot;work your way up in the ranks&quot; any longer. <br />
<br />
The only fix to the current situation is tougher taxation of outsourced overseas labor. Bottom fucking line. If you order computer parts direct from the factories overseas, you're taxed out of your ass. Yet, you're not if you purchase labor.<br />
<br />
Only with this artificial balancing will we get any sense of order, and even that will be short term. Know why? Because the companies will treat the USA as a 3rd world nation, as we have all but lost our means of production in this country. Look at the stats of Forbes / Fortune 500 companies and see where their corp hqs are &quot;for tax purposes.&quot; Most of these companies could so very quickly become non-american if any policies were set it'd be an utter collapse.<br />
<br />
The sick joke of the matter is all the money that the companies are saving to produce products is DWARFED by the 10+ year impact on, y'know, laying off workers from their companies who can not afford the shit that they're selling? This is where the tax-relief for the ultra rich comes into play. Don't mistake wartime stockmarket inflation for growth... big, big companies are folding weekly, laying off in small batches, not rehiring and then padding their numbers with outsourced labor just to break even.<br />
<br />
The economy is not &quot;fluctuating as normal&quot; ... the internet's globalization prowess has flatlined our economy due to high quality cheap labor and production being a click or two away. This is unprecedented, except for all of those other cases throughout history where a new technology completely murdered a nation/tribe/race's economic self-sustainance.<br />
<br />
Any sense of growth people are having is strictly in sectors where the rich are getting oh so very much richer while investing overseas. Noone is investing in shit, here. Good luck going for a science or educational grant or any government assistance regarding innovation. Friends of mine in biochem get turned down for such important shit so frequently it's scary. No, we don't want cheap university medical solutions while big biz is around. We don't want you to be able to buy medicine from different countries. Then you see an episode of West Wing tooting the horn of how we spend so much money on science research. Zzz. <br />

We aren't?<br />
<br />
btw, raising the earth's temp 5 degrees means more clouds in the atmosphere.  More clouds = more reflected sunlight = cooling.  It's a fairly well balanced system.  If 5 degrees is a doomsday scenario, perhaps some of these morons should look at the evidence that suggests we're currently about that much below the thousand-year average for surface temps.  Warming back up to thsoe temps isn't the end of the world.  More flooding in coastal areas?  Maybe.  Don't build so much right on the freaking water and it wouldn't be such a problem.<br />
<br />
Also FYI, that 5 degree estimate came from the same computer models that have historically been highly inaccurate in predicting temperature change- over the past couple decades they've been trying to predict with mathematical and computer models, they've ALWAYS predicted much higher temp changes than what actually happened.<br />

Anyway, we are not a socialist country. As was posted previously socialism entails the workers owning the means of production. Corporations don't exist in socialist states: the government is the ultimate organizational structure, which is in place to serve the people and their advances in technologies.<br />

Socialism has never worked and never will work, any socialist countries around today (Sweden, etc..) are dependent on capitalist countries to keep them afloat. Under socialism there is not progress and the economy stagnates.<br />

Socialism doesn't have to be thrust on us all at once.  If it was, we'd reject it wholesale.  Bits and pieces at a time, though, we're gradually embracing it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>Azudno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">Newtank is pretty dead-on about the greenhouse effect, xept the part that it's very simple. <br />
<br />
There's a shitload of methane (which is a stronger greenhouse gas then CO2) stored in the deeper parts of the artic ocean. This is possible because the water there is very cold. Once the water starts to warm up (which it's doing atm) less methane can be stored, which is then released into the admosphere, adding to the greenhouse effect. This also fucks up the cold water flows at the bottom of the ocean. This cold water flow helps to cool down the admosphere and regulates the overall temperature of the oceans. With it gone the earth warms up even more causing more methane to be released.<br />
<br />
The amazon forest can exist due to the extraordenary ammount of rain in that region during the rain season. The ground has to be soaking wet 24/7 for such massive growth. Without it the amazon forest would be a savanne, sub-rainforest which stores a lot less CO2 then a rainforest.<br />
A slight increase in global temperature messes up the duration of the rain season which means the amazon rainforest can no longer support itself and becomes savanne. This means that all the rainforest plantlife dies and rots, resulting in huge ammounts of CO2 to be released into the admosphere. <br />
<br />
It's estimated (by computer models, which are obviously not flawless, but can give an estimate nontheless) that the amazon rainforest will be mostly gone in about 50 years from now. <br />
<br />
The above events are all theories, but they are founded on the facts about the storing of CO2/methane warm/cold waterflows etc.<br />
<br />
Hotter planet = more clouds with rain so it evens out is bullshit. <br />
This is not hippy BS. Underestimating global warming is a very foolish thing.</div></div><hr />

Why do people trust the Temperature measurements of the 11th century but view the computer models run on the worlds best computers to be &quot;unreliable&quot;. <br />
<br />
=)<br />
<br />
Even if your measurements of the 11th century were correct they didn't measure the ocean temp.  The thermal mass of the ocean make it the only important measure as it has a much much much larger thermal mass than the air.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u80"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p80">The world's 'best supercomputers' still aren't fast enough to model the level of granularity necessary to truly get a good picture.  They split the world up into 'cells', and faster computers means smaller cells, but splitting the entire atmosphere and oceans into oh, 1x1x1 mile cubes (just a guess, I'm sure it's better now) really doesn't give anything but a rough idea of climate changes.<br />
<br />
And even if you COULD model every single molecule, there are factors in the environment that simply aren't known, therefore aren't possible to model.<br />
<br />
Just because you've got a piece of software running on the fastest computer ever created DOES NOT mean it's right.  Actually, since I sorta work in the modelling and simulation business, there's an axiom I've had told to me several times.... 'no model is right, but some are useful.'<br />
<br />
Can a computer model tell you there's some sort of warming trend?  maybe.  Can a computer model tell you exactly what the average temperature increase will be every year for the next 100 years?  Not real likely.  That's the problem when you have dumbfucks interpreting the data... they try to get more out of it than it's really able to say.<br />
<br />
BTW we aren't trusting temperature measurements from the 11th century... there was no accurate way to tell what the temperature was then.  But there are ways you can see how temperature affected other things... such as plant life, chemical processes, etc, that can tell you with a pretty good degree of accuracy what the average temps were, or at least relatively speaking, if there was a warming or cooling trend from year to year.</div></div><hr />

Bush is bad and good.<br />
<br />
Bad because war is bad and he did not exhaust all political avenues before attacking Iraq.  Also, Iraq had no direct relation to Al-Qda.  Its like if Japan bombed pearl harbor and we instead attacked Mexico because we were at war with them before.  So, Saddam hated us, big deal - everybody hates americans.<br />
<br />
He is good because he has reduced CO2 and created jobs in the world by killing people who would normally be exhaling CO2, burning fuel, and working in a job an american could be doing (that part is sarcasm).  However, seriously - war is good for an economy which is on the winning side.<br />

My honest opinion on global warming is that Mother Earth will shake us off like a bad infestation of fleas.  She has shaken off the other species and she can damn well do it to us as well.<br />

We may or may not be speeding it along with greenhouse gases but we are too stupid to do anything about it because we as a race are extreemly shortsighted and self absorbed.<br />
