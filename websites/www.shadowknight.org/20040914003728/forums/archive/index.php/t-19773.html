<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">K question here about what i should buy in ldon, my magelo isn't quite updated though atm will try and do it later. Recently bought a ft2 aug for my miragul gloves an ID4 ring (friend lent me money so i didnt waste points on anger of druzzil) and then a day later i sold some LDON drops i had and bought some ornate boots. I now have ft6 total, 3boots 2gloves 1earring. I also have mental clarity 3 and i use Shroud of Chaos for proc if that helps.<br />
<br />
I saw a big increase from the ft2 and ft3 i recently attained i went from casting no spears much to chaining 2 spears throughout the whole adventure. K im doing GuK LDON's atm cuz i want to unlock the ft2 slot7 aug to put into my boots to make them ft5. Also doing it because i wanted to unlock 10 mr aug and on my cleric his bulwark of vie spell. I 3box ldons all the time so my dps is important, 65sk 64 cleric 65 bst. <br />
<br />
K now while im grinding pts in Guk the question i have is should i then spend the first 760 pts i get in guk on a ft1 slot7 aug in Miraguls? Or should i buy the 880 undead nuke from Takish? Guk has tons of undead but not sure which will help me more a bigger nuke or more ft atm, im leaning toward the ft1 aug cause its less situational but im always doing guk atm anyways so. thx in advance for advice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">oh i typically cast spear of decay and spear of plague so if i bought 880 dd i would replace spear of plague with it. I dont have the hurt to use BoH because in 6 man groups mobs die to fast for it to get full duration and because i feel like im wasting the ID4 ring i bought it i use it heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nzab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I am buying the LDoN armor from Nro...when auged they can be a heck of alot better than the ornate stuff...Each peice costs 1475 though..The stats on the Bp im workin on is 69ac 13sta 11cha 10wis 10int 100hps 100mana 12 MR 12CR 12PR and it has 2 type 2 slots and one type 3 slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">have a 21 mr vindi bp im happy with atm. Curious what would help better though ft1 slot 7 aug or the undead spears. The tak armor is okay but i put it at same lvl as ornate which is craptastic in my eyes except the boots.<br />
<br />
On a side note may buy tak bp+chest ft2 in the long run but thats a long way away, same as may buy a peice of tak or mira to house the ba4 aug that want to get but again a long way away from that also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>SweetMeef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I got the Tak bracer first, since I can still upgrade any piece of gear if one comes my way (I'm non-elem).<br />
Putting the FT2 type 3 on my tak bracer, and will look into the Guk FT2 aug for Ornate boots (thanks for the idea) once I get the boots. This way I get FT5 for 1450 instead of some boots w/ better base stats for 1450. I like mana...<br />
Once I get that I'll look into additional pieces of Tak equipment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>NorrynNoir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">if you are doing guk alot you should use deny undead instead of spears. spears are resisted ALOT in guk and the undead nukes are never resisted and are more mana efficient without resists (i think).<br />
<br />
i would try and improve your overall gear in terms of hp / ac rather than going for another undead nuke, deny undead really isn't bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Daikoku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">the 880 scythe really blows away deny, though, but you are limitiing yourself to really Guk, EF  and some MM, other areas do not have the undead,  even EF is flakey on the undead they have, seen some with 0.<br />
<br />
FT is useful just about anywhere.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">tried deny undead + spear of decay last night on a guk dungeon typical crew my 3box cleric sk bst. typical buffs only difference was last night got last lvl of Planar Power. Anyways did the dungeon went rather long gonna attribute that to poor drop rate though but barely won with like a min to spare... <br />
<br />
Parsed the whole dungeon with my cleric went and checked the log. Did 95 dps throughout dungeon that was exactly the same as my old parses showed me doing with spear of decay+Spear of plague.<br />
<br />
Things i noticed... chaining decay+deny i was going oom pretty fast with FT6+SD+kei+SoC. So about 20mins into dungeon at around 50% mana i started sticking to peppering undead mobs with deny as soon as would repop...and the occasional decay. Kinda similiar to what i would do with decay+plague. On live mobs if i wanted i would drop decay on them but most the time itook that as time too med back the mana i was losing.<br />
<br />
Things i like about Deny+Decay...more burst DPS for say clerics 600+650 &gt;400+600 hehe even if i cant sustain. Thing i noticed about decay+plague im able to sustain them better and they put out similiar dps as deny+decay. /shrug...think i will try another ldon with Deny+Decay setup and see how it works this one did go long so im kinda worried that i was losing dps even though parses didn't show that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Simu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Don't you think MC would help you a lot in this configuration ?<br />
<br />
It does for me in most cases.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">cant use...im 3boxing i dont have the time to switch out for MC every 20mins + i have sa3 tol3 scf3 i just feel its a waste to not use SoC...i may use Mental horror with its 1 hour duration but im not sure i like black shroud better atm.<br />
<br />
The benefits for me from using SoC...reduced buffing...reduced downtime...increased dps that i dont have to do anything for. Though i am contemplating using it now and then again. Last time i used it on a LDON where i wasn't tanking i was playing cleric+dps i wasn't too impressed with it. My mana wasn't skyrocketing like i remembered heh and i missed the tol crits galore.</div></div><hr />
