<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nazak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I see a stumbling block for me on this quest.  I'm level 65 with all of my training points spent, but have 0 skill in begging.  From what I've read, you need substantial begging skill to get one of the keys for the Riwi part of the quest.  Is this one of the skills that requires one training point to &quot;prime&quot; it?  So far, I've gotten zero skill ups from begging quite a bit.  Has anyone been able to get that key without any begging skill?  Any help would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You'll need begging skill.  When you get level 66, you'll get 5 more points with which to train, no doubt.  July 27 for new expansion.<br />
<br />
But you should be able to raise it without spending training points.  You'll only raise it on mobs other than green con.  So when you're in combat, practice turning off attack, hitting &quot;beg&quot;, turning attack back on.  Can't beg while attacking.  That will help it go up.  Pretty sure on some char I got begging &quot;1&quot; without spending any training points on it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I dont recall ever putting a starter point into begging.  Just make a hotkey to turn attack off, beg, attack on and use it on every mob you fight.  It will go up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nazak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I can now definitely say that you don't need to put a point into it.  After about 200ish straight begging attempts, I had a skill up to begging 1.  After that, the skill ups seemed to come more frequently.<br />
<br />
Hope this information helps anyone in a similar situation.</div></div><hr />
