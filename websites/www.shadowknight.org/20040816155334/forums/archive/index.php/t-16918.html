<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>LoganHex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Completed my Darkforge Armor quests today. Rather proud of myself.<br />
<br />
Began the quests at level thirty four and finished them at thirty six.<br />
<br />
Soloed all of the extraneous pieces (Damaged Militia Helms and the like) and some of the Decaying Armor drops.<br />
<br />
Had some help for the other Decaying Armor drops and would like to thank Kakura, Kandor, Aanam, Jindi and Vaeven for their assistance with those (all between levels twenty eight and thirty seven).<br />
<br />
I found these quests to be much easier than I had anticipated them being. I would also like to thank those who posted here about the quests for their insight and pay my respects to those who went before me and completed them back when the Tae Ew were still in Cazic-Thule (which made this much more difficult from what I have read).<br />
<br />
In summation...<br />
<br />
Woot.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Orthogonon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah, quest sucked back when the crusaders spawned inside cazic-thule, with no spiritualist as a consolation.  Anyway, grats...all young sks should do this quest even though you can buy better armor for almost nothing.  Status thing.  Plus the armor looks good.  And, as we all know looks&gt;everything else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Pheargore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Gratz.<br />
<br />
Sense the dead and Invis made it easy when they were in CT.<br />
But you were talking about before the Ritualist not the Spiritualist I believe. <br />
<br />
I did it with the Ritualist and Crusader method, but getting to the Crusader and timing the roamers to kill him and re-invis was a lot harder than just killing the Ritualist :)<br />
<br />
- Peace</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Boodadar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">GRATZ!!!!WOOT!!! and YAY!!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
but i would also like to use this post to ask all higher sk's if this quest is really worth it. i'm a 37th sk and i'm mostly in LDON groups now but i think i would really like to go after this armor. is the armor it's self worth it? should i be able to solo all or most of the peices? well thanks for any replys <br />
<br />
                                                           -BOOD</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Faulse</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">armor itself isnt worth it in my opinion, unless you want to get your epic, then by all means quest for the peices you will need.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Uwildi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Here are the stats for the different pieces, you need the helm, BP and greeves to start the epic if you don't do the shortcut, and the exp for completeing a piece is actually pretty good. As for wether or not it is worth it, that is dependant on you and your gear.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>LoganHex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You can solo the spiritualist camp at thirty seven easy. Just watch out for the clerics (judicators and justicars). Huge pain in the ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Chernabog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm starting to get the DF armor for the epic.  What is the spiritualist's camp?  I found 2 crusaders up at the same time on 2 of the pyramids &amp; got the helm, visor &amp; breastplate.  Are the crusaders that common, or did I get really lucky?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Aoninie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I think you got lucky, I got my pieces all from the spiritualist. Cross the bridge, turn right, walk along the water until you get to an obalisk. Should be 3 or 4 Tea Ew around it. The spiritualist spawns there. You should be able to single pull with a bow then take down them as they respawn. Spiritualist usually drops 2 pieces.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Karnij</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">man I remember df armor <br />
<br />
was bad ass stuff back in the day<br />
<br />
if I was gunna make a character I would take the cultural path this time around <br />
<br />
for the price the stats are very very good</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Greggthegrmreapr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">some of it is still pretty decent if you are poor and can't afford to bazaar shop to much.  the BP is pretty good too,  i was still using mine at 46 before i called it quits for now</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>DrayMay</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Congrats on completing the Darkforge quests.  I as well started them around the 34th and completed them around 37.  Even though there was much better armor available I proudly wore most of the darkforge up to the 49th level.  There is a satisfaction in knowing you earned what you had on you... and killing a couple Freeport militia in the process was just icing on the cake. :)<br />
<br />
Boodadar, the quests are soloable at 37.  I did most of them solo with having a friend join every once and a while when they were around.  Most of extras have faction hits on them like the clockwork gnomes in Sol A.  When you go after the Fp Militia be patient and use invis. Depending on where you setup shop there are militia with a wide range of levels to chose from.  <br />
<br />
As a side note there is the Soulfiend Lance quest that has a piece drop in the same spot you camp the decaying armor pieces.  If I remember correctly the spiritualist drops a lance (spear) that is needed for the quest.  The end item is SK only and procs the 72pt Lifetap DoT.  If anyone else remembers more on this please let me know if I have incorrect info there.<br />

<br />
Its the grimy lance that he drops for the soulfiend quest. I found that quest here awile back but have not done it myself. He drops it every time you kill the spirtualist, so i just handed it out to noobs who could use it.<br />
<br />
Also a lil tip, when you pull the spirtualist send in your pet to take his HT. I know when i did it at 30ish the HT hurt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Dang that's better than anything I have, guess I'll be questing.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Valkyria Grymreaper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I can recall doing this in my 30s cause I needed the armor to wear.<br />
<br />
If your doing DF armor JUST for the sake of your epic, dont.<br />
<br />
Two words:<br />
<br />
Run seals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tescin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Soulfiend lance is a fun quest to complete.  To do it, you need Paineel faction.  If you don't have good faction already, after you get your Darkforge Armor, head to the Warrens and proceed to decimate every kobold you see, over and over and over and over.  If you can kill the Cave Bat Lord, he sometimes drops Azzar's Dreadful Hat.<br />
<br />
Every now and then, peek out and /con the guards.  It will take you quite a few hours to get past KoS.  After that it goes fast.  Once you are indifferent, you can give Azzar his hat (In the room above the entrance area with the glass mirrors) for a generous faction boost with the Heretics and a serious hit to caster guilds of Erudin (Bah, who cares.)<br />
<br />
Once you are amiable you will have enough faction to get the key to Paineel.  (You'll need it for epic later)  Head through the Warrens to Stonebrunt then journey northward to a spot southwestish of the Kitty Village in a patch of trees.  You will find a red wisp &quot;a spirit.&quot;<br />
<br />
I reccommend shouting in zone that you are about to do a quest and ask nicely that people clear out of the kitty City to avoid aggro from your quest mob.  he WILL aggro anyone not on good terms with the Heretics.<br />
<br />
Hand the spirit the Grimy Lance.  (You did bring it, right?)  you will recieve an idol, and Riddosan the Unliving will spawn and begin to buff himself.  Give him a moment and he will begin running east to the beginning of the path that leads to the Kitty City.  He is KoS to the wildlife, so you might need to kill a few things for him.  As he approaches the Kitty City, he will shout across the zone.  it's a good idea to repeat your /shout warning so that some curious Ranger or DrOOd won't track him and kill him.<br />
<br />
This is where it can get tricky.  If you are high level and not kos to the kitties, you're fine.  if you are in your 30's and/or are KoS to the kitties, you might want to find a friend for this part.  Riddosan will path to Disciple Okarote's tent.  You must now kill Disciple Okarote.  Do not attempt to fight him in the tent as he is surrounded by healer.  Pull him (or have your high level friend do it) down the path from the city a bit and dispatch him there.  He will give negative kitty faction.  Ghost of Riddosan will spawn in the tent and will stay up for a short time.  Run to the tent (invis if you are KOS to kitties) and hand the ghost the idol to recieve:<br />
