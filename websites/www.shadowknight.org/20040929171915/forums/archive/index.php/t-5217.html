if they gave erudites normal heads they would look better =D<br />

Its just the look and feel of a dark knight that dose NOT fit a football, leezard or fatblob</div></div><hr />

PLZ help cant solo anymore, soloed to lvl 31 so far!</div></div><hr />

The only &quot;downside&quot; to being a human is being blind.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Um the downsides to being a human? What do you mean the only advantage a dark elf has over a human is natural ultra vision and that = nothing. Humans make better shadow knights than dark elves. Now if you switched to an ogre that would be a different story but a dark elf?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>fendor stonesmith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Human Sk here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Temereo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Well on mith marr, the human shadow knight population is considerably low. The SK population rank order goes like this on Mith Marr...<br />
<br />
1 dark elf <br />
2 ogre <br />
3 iksar <br />
4 troll <br />
5 gnome <br />
6 human <br />
7 erudite <br />
<br />
I don't know why anybody would play a SK if not an ogre, iksar, or maybe a human. Ogres have their incredibly high strength/HP, iksars' regen ability is ALOT more helpful than one might think, and I guess if you don't want to deal with as much bad faction hits, play a human.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kebsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Humans look cool too imo.  The closest thing to a classic 'knight' look in EQ.  Course, they can't function as their own luggage either.</div></div><hr />

I look awesome in Darkforge, I always keep it on me :D. Magelo proves this theory.<br />
<br />
/flex<br />
<br />
Interesting side note: my guild has 3 SKs, all of which are human. It just occured to me right now. What the hell? hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Faeeldora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Yeah different server and all but I like the way humans look!<br />
<br />
I've been in mostly Flayed skin and it looks ultra sexy(!) though I just got some crystal Chitin Boots and they look even sexier!<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway Humans ROCK mostly due to starting faction!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>kharan_zechts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I play a human sk and would never play a different race, our low population makes us unique</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Esmy Weatherwax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I think it was months before I ran into my first human SK other than myself. My hubby plays a DE. The first one that I saw I was actually doing a guildinvite to him and I was excited. Human sk's are rare, but I think female sk's are more rare. I have two other friends that are female sk's but otherwise don't see many around.<br />
Hehe, just thought I would throw my two cents in.<br />
