I figure that with that 300mana I will get one extra 500 or so hp from ToI (with improved damge ring) So basically I'm asking HP or Mana......?</div></div><hr />

Once your comfortable with resists best thing todo is get more hp and more mana but favor hp. HP mitigates spell damage sorta, the more hp you have the less that lure,lifetap, or dot is gonna hurt you. Try pvping with virtue/fos/sta on compared to without you stay alive longer and you can focus on dealing the damage rather then say having a huge mana pool and small hp pool where your being forced to transfer that hp to mana negating your ability to do melee damage. Kinda late sorry if that sounds confusing, on the plus side though manapool does play a much bigger role in pvp then it does in pve where mana regen is king.</div></div><hr />

Elemental players and time don;t have to worry about resists to much This is pretty much what i did if i was ever worried about a duel but once i was in elementals I rarely changed anything other then FT items in<br />

 If your fighting a warrior/rog/monk go with hp then mana this is of course if your going to mainly joust, otherwise if you know there resists suck enough to land dark you can just keep them spinin and pretty much stay untouched. no need for major resists on any of them. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
for casters like necro/wiz/mage/ench ect go resists, hp, mana. Pretty much you need to resist there spells cause there mana will last longer then your hp. Mana is pretty important if it is going to be a long duel like a shm <br />

For hybrids resist, mana then hp but don;t lose to much hp. Depending on class pallys stuns can be resisted at 150 resist i think<br />

bards well they just suck</div></div><hr />

Hmm not so sure of that. Large mana pool is pretty important in PvP I think, you can burn better. Usually fights don't last that much more then 10 minutes unless you are just 'kiting' people. Of course mana regen is nice as long as it is more significant then +mana during 10 minutes (FT1 equates to 100 mana during that period, so a 250 mana item is better then a FT1 item in that case). HP regen is not as important as mana pool because spells do so much damage you hardly notice it when fighting people like wizards. Your taps heal for much more then a bit of regen during the fight, with a larger mana pool you can tap for a lot more then you would have gained with regen items. Of course when fighting melees HP regen can be more important then mana pool since they will interrupt your casting (with bash/kick) and hit you often during casting if they pay attention, so it all depends who you are fighting.</div></div><hr />
