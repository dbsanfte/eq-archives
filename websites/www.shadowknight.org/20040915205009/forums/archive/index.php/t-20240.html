<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Morbent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Where is that mummy in the hole, im trying to find him but have no idea where this guy is hiding from me!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Use the special &quot;Mummy-Bane Search Button&quot; and you'll have no problems.<br />
<br />
Edit:  Oh, and that word in your sig... it's &quot;sammich&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rolukk Earbiter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i assume you're looking for glohnor...he's in the same spot he's always been as far as i know. I'll try and explain, but for further info do a search =)<br />
He's down in the undead castle...clear the front ramparts and the way in a little bit, then go in and to your right (or left...he can spawn on either side) to the little garden courtyard thing. That is where he spawns. One you hail him or turn things in or whatever (i forget...been a long time) he'll despawn there and rush at you in ghost form from inside the castle. Just wait for him near the courtyard, cuz he won't bring friends. Then kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Laymon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Rolukks right but got it the wrong way round. <br />
<br />
You're looking for 'Ghost of Glohnor' which spawns where Rolukk said. hand him the shroud and he'll de-pop and the mummy will spawn a little way away and run at you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kowl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I got him last night. Hewas in the right graveyard for our group. Put the stuff in the trade window and conned him and he was apprehensive to me so I did the hide trick. It didnt change anything, he stayed apprehensive so I just took a deep breath and did the turn in. He despawned and my group waited a few minutes for the mummy. He never showed up so one of the trackers looked and he was in the tower. We ran back to the courtyard and the puller brought him to us. We had a raid with four groups and he was no problem whatsoever. Got the wrappings and the head and now I am the proud owner of a new earring and breastplate.  All I need are the Soul Leech and Decrepit hide to be done with this bastard now.<br />
<br />
Oh I also got the Dusty Tome after we killed one of the guys for the Shaman epic. We were sitting and medding after the fight and all of the sudden I see battle spam that the Ratman Guard is beating on people. I had done the turn in to Kurron Ni but had skipped the Dusty Tome and ran seals because I could never find the Ratman Guard up. Went ahead and turned it in just for completist sake :D</div></div><hr />
