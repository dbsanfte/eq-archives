For example<br />
<br />
Greenmist is 18/22 has a BANE 6 for shisser.<br />
Another weapon is 18/22 has +6 Disease Damage.<br />
<br />
Attacking normal mobs<br />
Greenmist 18/22<br />
Weapon 2 18/22 PLUS 6 point of damage per hit?<br />
<br />
Attacking Shissar<br />
Greenmist 24/22<br />
Weapon 2 18/22 PLUS 6 points of damage per hit?<br />
<br />
Am I reading this correct? I get so confused with it. And yes... I made up the weapon 2.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The other types, such as disease, are added to base damage after a resist check. Partial resist are possible so anything from 0 to 6 is added to base in your case. I did some log analysis using a weapon with 6 cold damage. On normal mobs, about 2.5 damage was added to base on the average. With malosini in, it was very close to 6 added all the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Syfon</div><div class="date">04-02-2002, 09:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">so he is right by saying that in Ssra temple for example the Greenmist is a 24/22 weapon?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Svartrot</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 06:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, that is my understanding and how Verant has explained it. I am sure someone who has used a bane weapon and analyzed some logs can confirm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lilyth</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 08:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm, I guess I had it wrong then.  If a weapon was say Dam10, Delay 22 with +2 Disease then the following:<br />
<br />
Resist check vs disease, if not resisted then hits like a Dam12 Del 22 weapon.  <br />
<br />
The way you explain it Im wrong, it still hits like a Dam10 Del 22 weapon, I just get max +2 extra damage after resist check, so instead of hitting mob for say 50 I hit for 52?  Is that correct?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nocifer Deathblade</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 09:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye, Greenmist is always 24/22 against any kind of shissars without any resist. Racial bane is more stronger (unresistable) than resist type bane but more specific as trade off while resist type bane works against any mobs with non immune resists but at the weaker form cuz it can be partially resisted.<br />
<br />
Weapon 2 with 6 disease bane is always 18/22 against disease immune mobs. If your torrent didn't stick then your weapon will stuck at 18/22..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xilith</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 11:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My last thread kinda died after one reply, since this is on topic let me ask again here.<br />
<br />
Does AC Mitigation affect &quot;elemental&quot; damage as it would a normal weapon, or is the only chance to mitigate the extra damage via the resist.  I suspect the former, which would be dissapointing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krazaak</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 12:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, here's a little rudimentary testing I did with my Hoarfrost Hammer (15/20 COLD DMG+5) in Droga.<br />
<br />
The results are based off analysis of magic number hits. so will be slightly inaccurate because there is no way to distinguish between an actual MN hit and a non MN hit based on how much of the cold damage was resisted.  Example, the hammer could hit for 45 points [MN for 15+2 dmg] even when its damage was 15+1 [MN of 43].   <br />
<br />
First, MN hits for this weapon are 41, 43, 45, 47, 49 and 51.  The base MN being 41 for a 15 dmg weapon, then incremements of 2 up to a max of 51 for a 20 dmg weapon.<br />
<br />
Out of 1041 swings, here's the result.<br />
<br />
Hits for 41: 62 (26.7%)<br />
Hits for 43: 40 (17.2%)<br />
Hits for 45: 31 (13.4%)<br />
Hits for 47: 36 (15.5%)<br />
Hits for 49: 30 (12.9%)<br />
Hits for 51: 33 (14.2%)<br />
Total MN hits: 232 (22.3% of total hits)<br />
<br />
There were noticeable peaks at all of those numbers, indicating that the elemental damage is indeed added to the base dmg, not total damage.  It also shows that there's a fairly high resist rate, even with green con mobs.<br />
<br />
If the elemental damage were added to total damage and not base damage, then the MNs would be 41-46, which is clearly not the case, as demonstrated by these hits.<br />
<br />
Hits for 41: 62<br />
Hits for 42: 15<br />
Hits for 43: 40<br />
Hits for 44: 12<br />
Hits for 45: 31<br />
Hits for 46: 13<br />
<br />
As mentioned earlier, not all of the MN hits are true MN hits, but that shouldn't skew the results too much.<br />
<br />
My conclusion is that my Hoarfrost Hammer sucks, especially compared to Doomshade's other drops.  The only way elemental damage would be worthwhile, is if the weapon already had a good ratio or if mobs are being debuffed, since without debuffs the elemental damage will be resisted the majority of the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xilith</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 12:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, it's possible in the engine now I think to make a mob invulnerable unless your weapon has a certain form of elemental damage, so there's always that possibility.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Svartrot</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 04:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kraazak, that's exactly what my results looked like. Instead of one spike I got a bunch of them, indicating that anything from 0 to 6 had been added to base damage.<br />
<br />
Maybe this is the clearest statement:<br />
<br />
Elemental damage of X adds anything from 0 to X to weapon base damage each swing, based on a resist check.</div></div><hr />
