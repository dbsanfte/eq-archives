Does he have PH's or timed spawn? I remember someone posting a screenshot of the room he spawns in, any chance of that getting posted again or maybe a verbal description of his room? I was at the house the other night trying to clear it with a group, we took off for an hour and I noticed another guild had moved in and pulled him out. He was NOT up when I was there with my group though. <br />
<br />
Thanks for the info</div></div><hr />
