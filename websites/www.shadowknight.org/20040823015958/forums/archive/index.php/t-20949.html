<br />
I don't think people here think that the SK class is perfect, I know a lot of people here try to get things fixed. They petition, send emails, talk to GMs, talk to devs. What exactly have you done, that makes you so much better than the rest of this community?<br />

Here's a hint, asspirate:  CLOSE THE FUCKING BROWSER.<br />
<br />
It's not like the forum is some kind of pop-up ad.<br />
<br />
Or maybe you should eBay yourself the Internet Explorer User's Guide.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jobrill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Actually, most of us are concerned with our class. The answer, as we see it, is not to jump up and down and whine like a little bitch for CH and Defensive and Teleports and whatnot because we believe some class has it better than us. <br />
<br />
Some of us, instead, try to make a fair and balanced appraisal of the situation and discuss things level-headedly instead of whining about anyone with better gear than us being a stupid twink or something.<br />

Mantisrose go fuck off and die. You and newbtank should go have inbread fucktard kids. That way you can understand the community's frustrations when we tryed to help you and newbtank understand how moronic you two are / were / will be always. When one of your sub-human anomoly's (sp) ask you a simple question like how do I put my shoe on (since with a combined gene pool the total IQ is 50~) you can try to help and understand why your baby fucktard dosnt get how to put his/her shoe on. Damn you could spend a month trying to help your baby fucktard understand and still not quite comprehend how frustrated the Sk community is with FUCKING ASSHATS like you and your secret lover newbtank. <br />

You Mantisrose are a hinderence to our community so GO FUCK OFF AND DIE AND DONT EVER FUCKING COME BACK</div></div><hr />
