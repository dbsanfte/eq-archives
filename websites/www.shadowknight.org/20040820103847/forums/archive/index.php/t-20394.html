<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fattyvolump</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am new to this board and this is the first time i have posted. I  want to know what all the other SK's think of my gear and if they see anything that needs improvement. I am a level 30 Shadowknight on Brell Serilis. I think for the most part its good but im one of the people that wont stop upgrading there stuff untill i have the best equipment. I have friends that are said they would help me quest or loot any items if need be, They are a 61 Shaman, 65 Enchanter, and a 52 Druid. So if u guys know of any upgrades i could loot/quest/buy it would be much appreciated. Thx<br />

I'm not an expert on the subject by any stretch of the imagination, but your gear looks good for L30 imo.  Hell, I had similar or worse until almost 50.</div></div><hr />
