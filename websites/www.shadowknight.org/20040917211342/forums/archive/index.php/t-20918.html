<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kelefane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I thought ToI was damn near unresistable? Helped a friend out w/ Rogue epic in Kith...I was MT and tanked the General (Epic Mob, that DE Shadowknight in Kith) Anyway, he resisted ToI X3 and thats the first time ive EVER had that spell resisted.........Ugghh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Isn't he magic immune?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kelefane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Im not sure, but he resisted alot my spells. Festering stuck I think...But Zbite/AoH/SPear/ToI ALL didnt stick =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kelv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">most final epic quest mobs are immune to magic, ToI is magic based, so there you go.</div></div><hr />

Shaman tells you, Would have been nice if we knew it was immortal beforehand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Torahdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">no way you landed festering on him and didnt land every ToI. Only way you could have is if you had to land spells on him in melee range only.<br />
