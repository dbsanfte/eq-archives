<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Callipygia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is it just me or does it seem like the fizzle rate on all spells has increased recently?  I first noticed an increase in fizzling when Luclin came out.  I assumed this was done to encourage people to get the fizzle reduction AA's so I thought it was no big deal.  Now since the last patch the fizzle rate has just been ludicrous.  I'm lvl 64 and have been fizzling spells four and five times in a row with maxed skills.  It so annoying that I considered getting the AA fizzle reducers, but from what I've read the lvl cap on those is 58!  This is really starting to piss me off.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>only1erbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">AYE I fizzle ALL the time on my pet now and skill is maxed .. i have fizzled more in my current lvl (56) then i did all previous combined! This really sucks cause my mana pool is to small for the fizzles.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dakkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Fizzle rates went through the roof a little while back yes.<br />
<br />
During the average fight I'll usually get at least one or two occasions where CD or spear will fizzle 2 or 3 times in a row when I'm trying to get snap aggro on a pull.<br />
<br />
I'm learning to work around it by routinely spamming the spell gem with clicks for a second or so to force a successful cast asap after a fizzle.<br />
<br />
Doubtless there's a reason for it; I'm sure Sony wouldn't patch in a pointless and irritating nerf just to make us all grind a few more AAs and put points into that anti-fizzling skill.<br />

/sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">fizzling death peace is a bitch, and it happens a lot now wtf...all my spell skills are maxed also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Liabach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i got annoyed by it, but fixed CD and fear so they wont ever fizzle for 2 aa (wont buy any more fizzle aa, dont really use any of the spells between level 20 and 59 anyway).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Savoline</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm just 56 now, but I fizzle ALOT on DDarkness and BBlood, with both skills maxed... Coma is a different story, its uncastable with 160 abjuration :(<br />
But maybe I am just too used to purecaster fizzlerates with +9 spell levels</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>shadowblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Stopping fizzles on CD and fear were one of the first aa's I got. The rest are a waste of time IMO. as I practically use no spells from 20 59 enough to be worth it also (except mental corruption) it should scale right up to 65 ... at least from 60 to 65 should give you a much less chance to fizzle at the 3rd lv...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>PeteBull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It's nice to know I'm not the only one, it's bad that its happening to all of us.</div></div><hr />
