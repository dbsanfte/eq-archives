<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dracul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Yeah i searched, yeah i got my answer. But that post is 7 months old....... Can you still MQ the mirror more than one time?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
Dracul</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zenobie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yup. In fact the quest was done to receive the reward after the second turn-in. So doing the quest after the first turn-in is the cheat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Neithan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Can you still do the hand in after the first turn in ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dracul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">yep :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Agoni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Anyone can turn in the Mirror of Self-Loathing to spawn the Haggle Baron Dalnir.  The person doing the hand in of the mirror then gets a Cracked Mirror of Self-Loathing which can be used again at a later time to spawn the Haggle Baron Dalnir from the Undead Tradesman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Neithan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks, did the hand in without waiting for the response when I saw all I would lose was the KC drop if it went wrong.<br />
<br />
So I am now the proud owner of a Cracked mirror and Greenmist</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Meulard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">When the mirror is turned in the first time, can 2 SK's do the turn in at the same time? We have 2 SKs with just the mirror to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ophidius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i believe he despawned after turn in</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Agoni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Only one turn in may be done at a time as he despawns and his respawn time is annoyingly long at least an hour if i recall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Caziel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hour long respawn aside. Would it be feasible for a SK to turn in his mirror, turn in his items, then use the mirror (once the tradesmen repops) to spawn the haggle baron again for another SK's turn in ?<br />
<br />
I ask because I and another SK in my guild are doing the quest at the same time and I'd prefer to only have to get one mirror from Drusella.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ophidius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">you cant &quot;hour long respawn aside&quot; it, because thats a crucial part of it. you can do shadowknight A's turn in, sit for an hour and jack off, then do shadowknight B's turn in using the cracked mirror, though. absolutely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jabbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Once it's already said you can use the mirror twice, why would you need to ask if two SK's can do it back to back if they're willing to wait an hour?  Obviously, they can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ophidius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">also, I would like to know why there is a lance floating in front of Zenobie's hand in her sig. it obviously isnt being held...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Meulard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Well Jabbuk, if two of us could do the turn-in on the first mirror exchange, it would leave a cracked mirror for our guilds use for the next SK that might need to do the turn-in. That is one reason. I need to know why you would have even asked? Was it just to show that you didn't think before you typed? (Only being sarcastic, no hard feelings intended!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Agoni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">It is simple the quest is designed to use the mirror to spawn the haggle baron dalnir find out what is needed to complete your blade and come back and use the cracked mirror to spawn him to complete your quest.  Thanks to the information readily available on this site you no longer have to do that and can use the mirror to spawn him and do your turn ins and have the cracked mirror for someone elses use at a later time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
said the person who ignored the posts saying that the Haggle Baron despawns after one turn in</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Meulard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I don't know but, the message about the despawn occured after the origional question about two turn-ins at the same time.<br />

:rolleyes:</div></div><hr />
