Start at &quot;outter&quot; and move North along the riverbank until you're equidistant from all three undead ruins.  This is near the 2nd pair of frogs at the water.  Summon a pet and get sow and some hp buffs on him.  Cast Sense Undead for the nearest skellie.  Send the pet in to tag one, then /pet back off to reel it in.<br />
<br />
These are never camped.<br />
Singles every time.<br />
They don't hit hard enough to one-round a buffed sk pet.<br />
Bring an undead-friendly class (necro, pallie w/SU3, nuking cleric).<br />
<br />
We were only 3 people and were unable to clear the camps due to repops; I estimate this spot would support constant pulls with 5ish people, depending on gear and aa's.  Maybe 6.</div></div><hr />

No competition. Pet Hold aa makes it much easier. At 65 moved over to the live sentries by the tents, they are 63. There are higher level soldiers. You can pull these easily, they don't mitigate slow and you can go all the way to 70 in this zone. Loot sucks but what the hell.</div></div><hr />
