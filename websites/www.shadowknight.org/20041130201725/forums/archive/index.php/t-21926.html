<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all.<br />
<br />
One SK in my guild named Shapiro bought up nice idea for our SK pet. My guildies were brainstorming ideas for SK pet other than gay, boring necro pet..<br />
<br />
I really liked Shapiro's idea that we get SQUIRE as pet.. How fitting is that for a knight as a pet?? :) Squire supports us. We teach them the knightly way and they serve us as &quot;pet&quot; or apprentice. :) <br />
<br />
If you don't like the idea,  give us any other ideas for our SK pets so readers (hopefully) developers can look at that and give us non-necro high level SK pet for a change.. I still think squire pet is best one and very knightly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Maicom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">an archer pet</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Parasite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">With AM3 plz kthxla~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Maicom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">would solve some of the issue's with our pet diein to ae's(setup pet outside ae range) and allow us to pet pull melee GoD mob's when needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Synapticus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">This brings up the point that pets in general are &quot;dumb&quot;;  they need more fine controls</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Although the squire might be more suited to our pally brethren (if they had pets that is) by definition, I like that.  Of course it'd have to be watered down and green to be consistent with our pets...<br />
<br />
I'd settle for a zombie or kiraikuei too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Xanathol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">ok, call me dumb ( not literally aholes! :P ) but what do you 'mean' by us having a squire pet exactly - what is the importance, benefit, etc, other than a name?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kuvak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I thought that pets used whatever weapons you gave them. I've never given my pet a bow and arrow set, however. Anyone done this? I would be interested to see if they actually may already be able to use it... hmmm.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I love the idea of an archer pet, but even better, I would love the ability to hit a button and switch from controlling your own char, to controlling your pet, then hit it again to switch back. This would come in particularly handy with an archer pet, but would be sweet all around, and would add great things to pet classes. What do you all think?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Howlitoezis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Id like a goblin for a pet. <br />
One that has about 30 different dance moves. And can possibly juggle.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wouldn't that be a jester pet?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Howlitoezis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Wouldn't that be a jester pet?<br />
Sure. Why not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Archer pet is a neat idea but it might piss off some Sks for pet pulling UNLESS archer pet could shoot to single out mobs then that would be even better heh. I sure like archer pet. Fitting for SK as well for dmg support. Our pets ARE not tanks. Necro pet IS a tank. So we don't need warrior pet. We NEED pet for GOOD DPS so archer with MOB ranged dmg would be fun. ;)<br />
<br />
Squire is basically an apprentice of a knight who wants to become knight someday.  Idea for graphic look. Squire is of a same race as master SK. For example, I am human then my squire would be human as well. No further need of add'tl global graphic. If you give squire armor then graphic of armor can show up on squire just like it would be on you. ;) But basically, squire is unarmored npc and it can be further enchanted by summoned armor/weapon whatever. Squire would get stronger as SK gets stronger in levels. Oh yes, Squire should be able to see invisible cuz we get SHADOW SIGHT at lvl 49 and squire would be more than lvl 50 when we are lvl 70 anyway. Squire get to be able to cast some selected lowbie SK spells.<br />
<br />
Just some ideas. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Fun idea would never happen though :) like the archery pet but also probably would never happen or it would be crappily made and pet would only use ranged till it got to melee range heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">lets give our pet diamondskin.  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
...with a short bow of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ganaith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">A gnome boot polisher would suffice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>neferaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I would name my dwarven squire Baldrick then and change my last name to some kind of dark serpent  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I thought the necro archer pets are junk?  I have not seen a necro using one since they came out?  Didnt they have a lot of problems?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">i've only losely read the necro board and dont post there but from waht i gathered the archery pet was over powered at release and give them ALOT of burst dps for boss fights had to do with the archer pet doing like ranged damage and melee damage when in melee range or something. Then they nerfed the damage and made it so the archery pets do crap damage if the mob is in melee range of the archerr or something along those lines.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Tukka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Yeah, I don't want something they are going to decide is overpowered, or something that may be very buggy, because if it's only an SK issue, you know it's not going to be high on the &quot;fix it&quot; priority list.<br />
<br />
I'll be happy with a rogue pet.<br />
<br />
As for appearance, I'd like it if they updated the skeleton models yet again, so that the skeleton model shows visible armor as being equipped.  That would rock, not only because it means we could have cool lookig pets, but because we could look better when liching, and necromancers too.  Of course it would have to be an option, considering how much it would likely add to the global file.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have not seen a single necro using it since the nerf.  And I think they might be even getting an aa refund for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>scaledge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">How about this:<br />
<br />
Shadowknight AA:Scion of the Black Knight<br />
Creates a duplicate of you, but with 3/4 all stats(damage, ATK, AC, HP, everything).  Does not gain AA points or your current buffs, but does benefit from any gear you are wearing when you summon it.<br />
<br />
Sort of like wake the dead, only self targeted, and the person dont have to be dead.  And not as powerful as the original.<br />
<br />
There, ye got your squire.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I think the best idea is to just make the pet higher level so that it can hit the higher level mobs we are fighting and so the procs will work.  Give it a bit more dps maybe around 25 to 30 dps.<br />
<br />
Make the shield work better so we can use this to shield us when we tank right now it seems to be very unreliable whether or not the pet will even shield.  Seems like sometimes it forgets even if its in the right position.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">If it keeps with the past (pet always green to us), I think the best we'll see level-wise is a lvl 49/50-ish pet?  I know our current best pet is light blue to lvl 61's, so if at lvl 69 it remains green, I think 49/50 is all we can hope for.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I'd love a more robust pet (although not really rogue, they have low hp) but just don't think we'll get anything decently high.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I would think it would need to be level 60 and I don't think this is out of line considering we will be level 70 and the mobs will be level 62 to 75.<br />
<br />
The pet will just have a small increase in dps.  I don't see the unbalance if its green or not if the dps is around the same and its HP perhaps just a bit more.<br />
<br />
But at least being closer to the mobs in level it could land its procs and be able to hit the mob more effectivly.   It still won't be able to tank anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Tukka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I can see no reason for Sony to not give us a higher level pet.  It improves upon an advantage we're legitimately supposed to have available to us, but is currently underpowered (gearing our pet with proccing weapons) while reducing the effectiveness of pet pulling, something I doubt they like as a tactic, but up till now have decided not to nerf for whatever reason.<br />
<br />
Giving us a higher level pet kills (or at least wounds) two birds with one stone from Sony's perspective.  It slightly enhances the effectiveness of SK pets as they are used in their &quot;proper&quot; role, while forcing us to at least choose between the pet that has better DPS and the green pet that's useful for pulling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">3200 hp warrior pet, quad 65, procs minor unresistable dot tap (to combat damage shields and healing it up from shielding), 5-10% of melee damage dealt goes back to the owner as hp, componentless.  Thats what I want to see from our pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Belyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Dot procing pet is scarey.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Yeah forget the dots</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">dd+heal over time recourse then like 35dd+50 hp/tick 3 ticks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Just let it proc an unresistable DD lifetap - don't really see the advantage of it having a recourse or anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">The advantage is that lifetaps scale different npc dps wise and heal wise.  They don't scale appropriatley for that reason its better to have something that provides adequete healing without giving overpowering dps.  To do that the damage and heal have to be different amounts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">So code it the way our PoP lifetaps originally were (the way ZBite is coded now actually).  You don't need to make it heal over time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Blackmerlin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Call Shadow - Gives unholy life to your shadow, making him your pet.<br />
The Shadow has 50-60% of all your unbuffed stats/skills and his level is always 10 below you. He uses the shadowman model and gains all buffs you have on yourself when you summon him. He sees invisible. He has access to all sk lifetaps up to his level. All life that he taps back goes 50% to him and 50% to his master. If his master casts FD , he will FD too since he still is his masters 'shadow'. But he can stand up from feign as soon as his master gives him a new order. He cant dual wield since he is an shadowknight, but should be able to double attack and 2hbash(when 59/60). Lastly he should autocast Harmshield when dropping below 10% health - but maybe that would be a bit overpowered.<br />
<br />
Rest Shadow - Kills the shadow pet and leaves an shadowman corpse on the ground if the pet had some items given to him. The corpse will only be lootable from the pets master and will decay after 1 minute lootet or not.</div></div><hr />

We prolly aren't gonna get a nice pet either, but at least it hasn't [yet] been rejected by Sony bologna.  <br />
