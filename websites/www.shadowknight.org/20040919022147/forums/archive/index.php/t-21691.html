MGB a self only spell ? .......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Eclipsia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I know what CoL is. My point was to allow some raid functionally to the class by allowing it to be targettable on others.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Not to mention they would have to code it so that it doesn't stack with AotC or we are right back where we started vs paladins.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">No way for changing COL into groupable/MGBable spell. Self-buff spells were supposed to be more powerful than groupable/MGB versons. What I want to see is to make self-buff spells more powerful like we had during pre-ROK that we had more powerful self-buff spells over groupable spells versions that other classes had and we got them at earlier levels as trade-off. SOE sure needs to make all self-buff spells slightly more powerful. That is what I'm willing to trade for no MGB'able/groupable spells. I like SK being a selfish class. :) Of course with *SOME* groupable spells such as zev bite (it sure owns).. <br />
<br />
If you wanna to make class much much more friendlier then go play paladin. :) It doesn't really make sense for EVIL knight to be very group friendly and think of others.. that is rather very paladin-like trait...</div></div><hr />

It was bad enough when I was being pestered for VoT.  If I wanted to be a buff bitch, I would have played a chanter or shaman.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>NorrynNoir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">so which spell was changed CoL or BSS? the stacking info on lucy on the test server doesn't seem to have changed. what i'm wondering is if CoL will now stack with any slot 4 buff or not? things like SoT , SV , etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>StruzorGnome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Yah... no</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Madrone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">COL HP was changed to slot 10, which is the same slot that AOC has HP in, so basically it stacks like AOTC, except it stacks w/ nines, and not w/ CoR</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Envoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">really wont help our grouping HP a whole lot ( who needs pallies for xp ?? ) but on raids that extra 400 hp will be nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>signa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">now can we cross our fingers for this to go live with the patch on the 16th?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Elkar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Stacking hurts my head...so let's get this straight, we can have:<br />
<br />
CoL<br />
BSS<br />
Kaz<br />
Bo9<br />
<br />
Is this right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Yup.<br />
<br />
CoL + BSS, CoL + SoT, CoL + SoV should all be possible.</div></div><hr />

Looks like they made some NICE changes to cloak spells.  They'll now stack with stuff.  The AC buff was increased from 18 to 34.  This should help out on knight's tanking, IMHO.  I'm looking forward to being FULLY buffed and seeing some record new hp's.  Was sick to see pallys with equivalent gear to mine having 200-300 more hp due to their superior self-buffs, will be nice to put that to rest.  This should put us all at new highs for both hp and ac soon as we log on today. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">So CoL doesn't stack with Virtue anymore? I'm confused.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>DConquest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">CoL stacks with all except Call of Rathe.   Pretty much means that we can now choose to have BSS or Str of Tunare as extra buffs that we couldn't have before.  <br />
<br />
And why did they reduce Mage nukes by 5 mana just so they &quot; nuke &quot; more efficiently than Druids?  lol.  Thought we had it bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">A nice tweak change. It is too bad that our cloak is self-only, it would be nice to be able return the favor to knights and rangers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>DConquest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">If CoL was castable might as well take CoR out the game since it's better in every way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Cryptia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I just crapped myself!<br />
<br />
Can't wait to get home tonight and see 10.1k.<br />
<br />
Maybe then we'll be allowed to plow tank some instead of the pallies......... naaaa, prolly not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">If we could cast CoL on others.. I don't think they would have made this change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Askeer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Is sword of pain instaclicky useable from inventory?   <br />
<br />
<br />
No, Sword of Pain (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=25319) is a &quot;must equip&quot; item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>XebarisTP</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Ahahaha, that will put me so ahead of the &lt; 8k pallies in guild (all?). ;P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Utanlain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Why would I want to use the &quot;Search&quot; function when I have the opportunity to trigger such a delightful discussion thread ? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Perhaps I misunderstand, but I was expecting to see my AC higher with the CoL changes (if CoL's AC component really increased from 18 to 34) but when I logged in last night with the same 'ol buffs I usually have, I noticed no difference in AC...?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">It doesn't stack with Rathe, it gives the same AC as Rathe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">I'm not sure if you are answering me or Darkc on that, but I'm taking it to mean we didn't actually get an AC increase on CoL.<br />
<br />
I guess I should try to understand how to read Lucy and interpret stacking...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>DConquest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Does the &quot; same ole buffs &quot; include CoR and BSS?  Then having CoL and BSS would yield the same AC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Sorry, I guess &quot;same 'ol buffs&quot; wasn't terribly descriptive.  I usually have neither BSS, SoT or SV on at any given time, since I use CoL at all times and Pal/Rng/Bst can't land any of those on me ninja-style.<br />
<br />
Usually the only AC bearing buffs I have on are: Virtue and CoL.  Oh, and I guess VQ has an AGI component... although I do click off Wrulan.  Oh, and sometimes I have Major Shielding from the BE bp... oh dang, wonder if that'd be it since I had Fo7 on instead?<br />
<br />
Conclusion: I guess my memory isn't as good as I thought.<br />
<br />
Edit: I have an older spell data file thingie at work here and I just looked at it, and it shows the AC was 18... and as posted on the previous page, AC changed by 16, to 34 as shown now by Lucy on Live.  It must have been that I usually look at my AC with Major Shielding on (18 AC) and didn't notice any difference because I lost 18 ac by having Fo7 instead of MS and gained 16 ac from the CoL change.</div></div><hr />
