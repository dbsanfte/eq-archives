<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Venomcron ShadowSlayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Evening all.  Got a question.  I'm stuck at Level 43 as an Iksar ShadowKnight on the Innoruuk server.  Can anyone tell me where I can hunt?  I've been trying to hunt the Troll SK and Shammy and it seems to be alot more trouble than it's worth.  Where can I hunt and what specifically should I hunt?<br />

<br />
Solo:<br />
<br />
Levels 39-41: Kaesora, Lower Guk, Dawnshroud, Overthere, Dreadlands, Droga, Sol B, *Tower of Frozen Shadow, Stonebrunt, Scarlet Desert, Crystal Caverns, Nurga, Jaggedpine Forest<br />
<br />
Levels 42-44: Dawnshroud, Overthere, Dreadlands, Droga, Lower Guk, Sol B, *Tower of Frozen Shadow, Eastern Wastes, *The Hole, Wakening Lands, Scarlet Desert, Nurga, Echo Caverns<br />
<br />
Since their revamp, Droga needs to be removed fron that list, and Nurga would be pushing it.<br />
<br />
Your fine for grouping in Dreadlands too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dkhar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Actually, your best bet is to get LDoN adventures. Get great xp and augments, cash and loot to sell. Not to mention aquiring points for armor you will need later. Really it's the complete package for your level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nikl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I agree with spending the rest of your natural life in LDoN, there are just too many positive things about it not to. However, while I am sitting waiting for members to arrive to join adventures I often see lower level groups taking forever to get formed. I got bored one day and thought I would give a try in LDoN with my 43 rogue. I sat in BB for about 3 hours with LFG on, and had no luck. Could be just my server, or my luck. As you level up though, you will find it easier to acquire groups for adventures.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>TaurusL</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">LDON's were piss horrible xp in the mid 50's steer clear of them at those levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kromglon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ya if your highest leve lor higher than the average level in the group you will get shit exp. Be the noob in the group you get fairly decent exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">In order of ease<br />
SolB - Sweet exp poor loot, low hp/atk mobs<br />
Nurga -not too deep but you can still get named to spawn for loot and 12% exp bonus there<br />
Gunthak - city or fort, well even beach for 2-3 levels, named for loot and descent exp, but tough mobs <br />
Dulak - would have to find a camp and stick there, roaming around too dangerous, but nice drops and stuff for Shammies LoY spell quest<br />
<br />
My opinion on LDoN - poor exp 46-60, poor money, good chance at loot and good rewards for points, but it just gets too repetative if you do it ALL the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Stattic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I know at lvl 42 I stopped playing my SK for the reason that XP was far to slow. I was so pissed too because I love playing my SK.<br />
Well after  LDON came out I just I dusted off my gear and went for it. I played all LDON till lvl 50 before I went off to other zones for XP Like Nurga and AC. The XP like they say in LDON is great  till lvl 50 ish.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Werb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I think at 43 I started in Echo TM room.  You can slow/fear these guys with ease.  I stayed there till 51.  I found it very easy to single pull the room.  Just get the first skellie close to ramp on right, then the first on the left.  Then TM if up.  I would pull with darkness and when mob was halfway down the ramp, fear and sick pet.   The picks are lore so you can only carry one, but yer pet can use 2..)  Exp rocks here and hardly camped. shhhhh<br />

Werb</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Solusek B is a great option at your level. The exp is fine and you make quite a bit of plat. Most mobs drop FS weapons, 2-5pp and occasionally a peice of bronze all sellable just outside of zone. <br />
<br />
I am pretty sure the beetles in Echo are good for your level and are also Fear Kitable. Fear kiting in the DL just outside of Karnors should be doable as well. Plenty of options for your level. Just pick one and grind to 51'sh and hit PoJ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>velourea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">dont do too many ldon's. at your level, the points suck and its really easy to get burnt out. it used to be that i would be lfg for a while and accept any ldon offer that came my way. lately tho, unless its nro or ef with high level people, i politely decline.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Gunthak, Dulak will be easy with healer/slower<br />
Same with SolB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Hemlocc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">a good solo spot for the 50's is the undead pyramids through the mountain in dreadlands...used to be where you could fear the skelly's and they'd walk right into a wall and stand there...but now you gotta chase them :(</div></div><hr />
