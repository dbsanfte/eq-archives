<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>vex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Yesterday on our server, after Kalendrox camped that murk breeder for about 20 hours, a sk from Elementals of Tomanari ninja'd his egg.<br />
<br />
Now, Kal and I haven't always seen eye to eye on stuff, but to you, EoT sk, if you read this, you need to fucking die.<br />
<br />
That is just so beyond wrong to do. We have enough problems with sk's that I thought at least we all stuck together.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Manslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">What a ridiculus thing to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kyfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Did he petition him? I would think this would be bannable, plus maybe the GM can get him the piece.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shadoh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Did he ninja the drop or did he bring a force and kill the spawn after the first SK spent all the time to pop him?  The second SK is total slime either way but maybe he saw him up, grabbed a force and killed him without knowing someone had camped the spawn for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kelv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Get the text with the &quot;You gain experience&quot; for the kill on screen, and /report yourself.<br />
<br />
The petition for a GM, and laugh as you get the item back and the idiot gets banned.<br />
<br />
As far as I know EoT are not the type of people who do this, so maybe you should seek their guildleader and have him look into it, maybe he can talk the slimey basterd into petitioning to return it to you... :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Krushum Gudended</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">basically, EoT are slime, not just this SK</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>PokenHopen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Don't tell me it was pyrthin, cause that would be too freakin funny, but yeah EoT sucks...  Hopefully Kalendrox gets his piece back and proceeds to train them for shits and giggles.<br />
<br />
Ofcourse I was in EoT, before leadership basically changed(leader started taking orders)  But that was 2 years ago, before they started mass recruiting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Booze the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">should I respond to this? Nah. I like flame wars. 'Sides, I wasn't there. I heard there was a random, but who knows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Space</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ass needs to be killed a lot for that shit, all i needs the damn egg and i can finish the rest in a few hours, but we started raiding again so all i got are sat and sun heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kendril D</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">same here i just need egg heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Scal4u</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Apperantly the spawn rate has been upped (I have not seen him not up today)  Been up 4-5 times in the past 3 hours.</div></div><hr />
