<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Darko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First of this is more of end game solution so it mostly focuses on pop encounters.<br />
<br />
The idea that verant had was, 2h for damage and 1h plus shield for tanking, however there is big problem with that.  <br />
<br />
Problem:<br />
When using a 2h u do quite a bit more damage, but ALSO u get riposted less due to lower delay on your weapon.  So even with the extra stats gained from using a shield you may still take more damage when tanking using the 1h+shield combo.<br />
<br />
In fact many warriors have started using 2h when tanking for that same exact reson, mobs that hit pretty hard, like most mobs in pop, are just not fun to get riposted on.<br />
<br />
Solution:<br />
This idea can be most easily implemneted through aa skill.<br />
<br />
The AA skill would give an increased % chance to parry a riposted attack (meaning when a mob riposts you and gets that extra hit, this skill would kick in and add better %to parry that 1 hit).  The skill will be obviosly passive, and will only work when having a weapon or shield in the offhand, this skil will be availbale to war, sk and pal.  The skill could have something like 3 levels, at the increasing cost of 2 4 6, each train raising the change to parry a riposte by 25% 50% 100% respectivly, so when the skillis maxed the war/sk/pal will be immune to riposte damage when using 1h+ shield or dual wiedling.<br />
<br />
IMO this is not overly over powering, mobs in pop do very high damage and its not cause of the riposte, however this will make it quite worth it for tanks to switch out their 2h when tanking.  Also this is seems like a much more reasonable fix for the 1hander problem compared to the more popular &quot;block skill with shields&quot; approach which imo would seriosly trivalize the game.<br />
<br />
So what ya think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Pharr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Your idea is a sound one IMO, but I whould revise it just a little.  <br />
<br />
For one, I think the AA skill should only work when using 1h+shield.  Reasoning - Having a shield in your secondary slot is there for the added AC (+stats), while using a secondary weapon is for damage / taunt purposes.  As I see it, it whould be a passive defensive AA, not an offensive one.<br />
Second - I think it whould be better for the perentages to be more like 23%, 50%, 75%.  To make the 3rd level 100%, as you say whould make the tank immune to riposte attacks from a mob, there by defeating the fact that they have a riposte skill.  <br />
<br />
Correct me if I am wrong, but the way I understand it is thus - <br />
A slowed mob does most of it's damage aginst a duel wielding tank due to riposte damage+low weapon delay.  By making that tank immune to riposte damage, I think whould trivilize a good many encounters for that reason alone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Darko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The % can be tweaked, by my calculations 75% with additon of ur current dodge parry and ac woudl make you immunto parry as well anyways.<br />
<br />
As far as shields, in the end game imo its pretty laughable to make a warrior use a shield, in most cases warriors use 2h for more damage than DW so, imo its enough of a peanalty, but its just my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Maniacles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I would adjust it the other way....<br />
<br />
&quot;riposte immunity&quot; 2/4/6<br />
25,50,100, but require 1 handed and shield for it to activate.<br />
<br />
Better yet, add riposte immunity as a possible stat on shields.</div></div><hr />
