<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I did this at level 62 and got some very nice info and responses...<br />
<br />
I am about to hit 63 and was checking on the new spells that will be available and would like peoples comments on them<br />
<br />
Aura of Pain - how many use this vs how many still use the torrent line...the 200 damage is nice, but the short lifespan of the recourse along with the reducing AC makes this spell seem not so impressive...is this correct.<br />
<br />
Blood of Hate - 160 a tick for 6 ticks...this seems like it will be my new favorite dot.<br />
<br />
Shroud of Chaos - Nice, an upgrade to my lifetap proc. no complaints <br />
<br />
Terror of Thule - Unless tanking this will not be out...even when tanking I am wondering how many people use this spell vs who uses the voices....For aggro it seems just as valuable to use clinging darkness or fear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Neithan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Aura of Pain: Nice but I do not use that much to be honest.<br />
<br />
Blood of Hate: In my line up 60-80% of the time<br />
<br />
Shroud of Chaos: I use a lot. Others not so much. Think it depends on the SK and how much they prefer MC. However nice spell.<br />
<br />
Terror of Thule: Do not use that much, however when I need agro 100% I have this and fear memmed. (When I need agro I may not be allowed to dot :) )<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope that helps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Aura of Pain: Yes, I agree it is nice but also don't use it much myself, except for a big fight where I am MT.  There was a brief period (like just after I got the spell) where I had it up and used it all the time but hardly do any more.  It's resisted a bit more than I'd like.  I generally don't use Torrents either, buff slots are too precious.<br />
<br />
Blood of Hate: I don't use it much any more unless I am in a big fight where I am not MT.  I agree it's a very nice spell but at the time I got it, it seemed too mana costly; however, I'm going to look at it again now that my int/mana pool is up.<br />
<br />
Shroud of Chaos: I started using this the moment I got it, but went back to Mental Corruption for a long time.  Duration is nice compared to MC, meaning I could free up a spell slot, and I just started using this again more recently as my FT increased.<br />
<br />
Terror of Thule: I only use Terrors as a mez breaker when there is an ENC in group [with bard mez, I find I don't have to break it], I never use it any other time.  That said, most times there *is* an enchanter in group, and a few points of guaranteed hate doesn't hurt when you fail pre-break taunt 3 times in a row.<br />
<br />
I realize how dumb I sound saying &quot;these spells are all great but I never use 'em&quot;.   I generally don't use dot's in xp groups (lately mostly LDoN adv's) but use both Ignite Blood and Blood of Hate when duo'ing for xp, since I have to do a bit more than hold aggro and swing-miss, otherwise the fight will drag out.  As for SoC, I am finally at the point where I think I have enough FT to forego MC in favor of a bit more dps/healing from the proc... but at the time I got the spell I had FT1 and MC1 so went with using MC.  And Terrors, as I stated above, I generally only use for mez breaking... IMO it's not good for much else, at least for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>NorrynNoir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">1. aura of pain - most of my grouping these days is in ldon and i'm tanking so i use this all the time. 120 points or what not of ac definately helps and the mana cost is next to nothing.<br />
<br />
2. shroud of chaos - didn't start using this much until i got my FT up to 4 and now i don't suffer quite as much without mental corruption up, though depending on the mana regen buffs i have i still sometimes go with MC. if you have a high FT total though , i'd imagine you'd be using this all the time. i have no data on this but it seems like it procs more than MC too.<br />
<br />
3. blood of pain - the best of them in my opinion. run out and get this first, it's a nice dps boost. and the mobs only need to stand for 30 seconds for it to be effective. lots of things that resist disease don't resist poison so that's real nice.<br />
<br />
4. terror of thule - i think it's useless. if i need a non mez break aggro spell i'll use fear. i think at lvl 62 the majority of what you're fighting is 55+ so i'd say only buy this is you are a completist.</div></div><hr />
