When this was going on, the Fabled mobs were up for the first time and were up only for a relatively short while.<br />
<br />
Starting today, the little skelly invasion is on again.  Not really expecting it since today's full moon/eclipse and Halloween coming up might just be the reason and pales in comparison to the initial reason they had Fableds up, but...<br />
<br />
Was wondering if anyone knew if Fableds are back or if the skelly incident is just that...some skellys for mid-levels to kill for semi-decent loot and nothing more.</div></div><hr />

Fuck you, I was at that camp for 18 straight hours, 3 days in a row before I got loot rights. At that point, it was late at night, I was a level 63 SK, and the only plate class (besides clerics and possibly a 40-something tank) so I had to tank it. The clerics sucked, I died at about 20%... and when I was rezzed back in, I couldn't loot the corpse. It just wasn't there. I hit locate corpse, it would point me to the very edge of the zone, way the hell away from where we were, and where I couldn't get to. People would target it, I would /assist to get it targetted and then /loot (when they told me I was standing right on top of it), and I would get the 'The corpse is too far away to loot' message. I logged, came back, nothing. I zoned out, came back, nothing. At that point, there was about 40 seconds left on the corpse, so the next person in line looted it. I had to leave before another one dropped, and when I got ahold of a GM, they said &quot;Yeah, graphical bugs can suck sometimes, I feel for you.&quot; I replied, &quot;So can you get me an FFBSS?&quot; to which I got, &quot;Ha, no, you're screwed.&quot; (literal quote). So fuck you.</div></div><hr />

would probably have been easier to get a belt of virility from GE. he's like two groupable and 1% more haste + better tanking stats. didnt feel like linking a pic, but there's one in my sig if you wanna compare</div></div><hr />

At level 63, being the highest member of my guild by about 20 levels, and having all of two friends who were 65 (and at the time not geared very well either).... it's actually kinda hard to take out GE. Really. So an open, free-for-all mob where there are already people there to help, and I don't have to worry about getting two groups together of random people that I don't know to go kill a mob for me for no reward for themselves is much easier. But thanks, I'd never thought of going after a belt I've known about since forever. Just never occurred to me. Hmm.</div></div><hr />

They were also this years halloween surprise, I remember in years past the Halloween surprise was werewolves in the Commons (like 3 years in a row)</div></div><hr />
