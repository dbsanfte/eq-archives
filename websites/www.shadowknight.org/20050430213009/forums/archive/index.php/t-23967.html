<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KlowdKill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Did this zone as my mage with a shaman partner years ago, liked it than, fairly enjoyable now.<br />
<br />
Target's Legionnaire's, spot I like is by bank.  If you zone in from twilight sea's, hang a right jump off first bridge, in the Water is a emblem on the wall- click it ports you in center of town- At the bank.  How nifty can you get.<br />
<br />
At the wall that overlooks the water is where you pull.  Mobs are single pullable at 58, I think 55 is what you need to be to guarantee singles.  No trick, otherwise you get to split with FD ect.<br />
<br />
Darkness, use lowest lvl fear, few pathing errors if you can find them.  Invoke lasts too long, can get you adds.  Fear lasts long enough where 2 and they're dead.<br />
<br />
minor points-<br />
*-*I used Mental Corruption at all times, no downtime what-so-ever buffless.<br />
*-*No loot, what-so-ever also.  1-3plat maybe, drops armor that's sellable but if you're already kos to the town you can't sell it back to them.<br />
*-*58 pet helped quite a bit, waitin on mob to reset when fear wears off to back him up he did quite a bit of overall dmg<br />
*-*1% normal exp every 3 DB kills, 1% aa each kill<br />
*-*Out of the way to get to, I personally spent 150p for Potion of Twilight Mists to be basicly outside of the town.  Than use my OT hammer to gate back to outside of PoK book-OT hammer for the win.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KlowdKill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ding 60!  No groups, still had a charge of my potion to twilight so ran over.  14% from level, so went to same camp at bank.<br />
<br />
No figures this time for kill per %, sorry.  Majority are now light blue, and I had a really had run, maybe 5 were DB rest were LB.<br />
<br />
Was there for 30min and gained 8%, few pathing errors slowed the process down.  Overall- 60's easy, this would not be a camp for 61+ except to AA grind.<br />
<br />
Notes to make- <br />
*-*lvl 60 haste is a big improvement (55% vs. our 20% haste)<br />
*-*Started without kei, was at 12% mana (3,600mana pool) was fine for a new pull instantly after a fight.  No horse FYI<br />
*-* 49 darkness for the win, 59's is too costly, fizzle for the win<br />
*-* 2-3 darknessess per kill, HT a mob for 2,000 with unholy aura, droped him to near 40% health from full.  About 3400hp when I checked it out.<br />
*-* Go figure, day later still no loot~ (The armor they occasionaly drop does sell for plat, nothing fantastic.  1 blue diamond from a group in GE would get you more than hulkin a full inventory of this junk.<br />
*-* Side note, druids and wizards can infact port you to twilight also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Silvershadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Question for you: do you have the recipe for the Twilight Sea gate potion? It doesn't seem to be in the EQTraders database and this was the first time I ever heard of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>KlowdKill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">5 Dose Potion of Twilight Mist<br />
Effect: Twilight passage<br />
Spell Effect: A small Ethereal passage appears, sending you to a location in Twilight Seas.<br />
<br />
Couldn't find the recipe, allakahzam didn't know it but did have it in their data.  Don't see a reason for shamans to make this unless special request, isn't convenient in the least bit but just as costly.<br />
<br />
Personally forgot about the potion, was looking up &quot;potion&quot; just to see if anything neat came from them, saw it, that's why I tried katta to begin with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">this is awesome exp right now.<br />
<br />
Got half an AA quick (don't post about waiting to do aa)<br />
<br />
Couldn't find the emblem that brings one to the bank, but it's a short run.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I hit katta frequently in my mid 50's... actually I dinged 60 soloing there.  My favorite spot was behind the building perpendicular to the bank.  If you do it right, you can pull mobs back there, and they'll path straight along the back of the building while feared.  Can use invoke, it'll wear off before they get to any other mobs, then just kit back to the other side, refresh snare, fear, repeat until dead.  MC has got to make mid 50's soloing a breeze.... wish it was avail in its present form back then lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Forgot to mention that I tried some guy in the gaveyard (Guard Lennon) who was an even con.  I was only self buffed except for left over KEI.  Dooming was resisted and he one rounded me for 3300 even.</div></div><hr />
