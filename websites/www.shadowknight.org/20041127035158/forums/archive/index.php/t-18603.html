<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rigur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am level 34 and seem to be inbetween most LDoN groups.  Last pick up group i was in had 1 too many dumbasses who could not control their pets.  I am wondering where a good solo spot would be.  Magelo is in my profile.  I think i have upgraded som pices.  I have earring of the solstice, barbed dragonscale boots and pauldrons.  I have 1363 hp/854 ac/685 atk; unbuffed.  Any help would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />

You'll need to watch out of the cave basilisk genitors, since they will most likely be white at 34.  I did 37 to 44 killing basilisks there.  You will want to con the basilisks before you pull one, but you should be able to kill them.  Depending on your AC, HPs, and DPS you shouldn't have too much trouble with them at 34.  You can probably add genitors starting at about 36 or so.  The genitors drop eggs, that you can bake with or sell in the bazaar for 5pp a piece.</div></div><hr />
