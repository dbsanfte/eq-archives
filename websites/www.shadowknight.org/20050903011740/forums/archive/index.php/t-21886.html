<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maicom</div><div class="date">06-27-2004, 08:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know your dropped to the bottom of the agro list when you pop HS, but...<br />
<br />
Would say, a pet, turn a mob from you while you were HS'ed? Assumin of course noone else did anything to the mob?<br />
<br />
somethin like, sk pull's mob, mob runs to sk... sk pops HS, /pet attack mob?<br />
<br />
Was wonderin if this would work since, as far as I know, a mob will always hit a PC over a pet, even if that PC only has 1 agro on the mob(which is where HS puts you I think, least until it drops).<br />
<br />
 :D<br />
<br />
edit: plan to test this myself when I get home later today, was wonderin if anyone knew how this would work so I don't have to wait 10 hours.</div></div><hr />

I too thought this would be useful for vxed/tipt and the like, but no go. Harmshield, enchanter /pet attack. Mob runs to enchanter. Sending in a pet to attack actually has a small amount of aggro attached, more than the flat 1 on harmshield though.</div></div><hr />
