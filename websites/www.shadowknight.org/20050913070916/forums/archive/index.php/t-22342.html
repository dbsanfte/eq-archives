I have half EP equip with almost 6khp selfbuffed. I have 217AAs (all defensive AAs up). I tried to do an LDoN Hard with a Baroness Cleric, Baroness Necro and the second title for a Bard. ALL of them are 90% Bazaar geard....<br />
<br />
 When I went in, I almost got my ass kicked even with single pulls. Cleric having hard time healing me. I felt gimped.<br />
<br />
 Necro start bragging about her DPS being great, Bard start bragging about her single pulling ability and how she's doing a good job. Cleric was doing  a great job.... the only one who's BARELY doing his job is ME and I am MUCH BETTER equipped and my char has ALOT MORE AAs than any of them may dream of..... Yet, I am BARELY doing my job.<br />
<br />
 I've noticed that the life is an SK (and pal probably) is HARD. We have to spend ALOT of time and EFfort on AAs and Equipment to BARELY do our job... while the bard/necro/dps/whatever class may just use their spell regardless of AAs (prolly cleric/bard need alittle bit of AAs to be effective) and they should be gtg.<br />
<br />
 Why is it so hard to do our job and being called behind our backs as, the gimp player.. lets call a warrior and start another one that SK barely wiped us.. when they're Bazaar geard and am not. Am I missing something here?!<br />

<br />
I'd blame the cleric in this case. :P<br />
<br />
In GoD however.. I'm getting my ass handed to me in mountain expeditions and in southern Ferubi. I don't feel urged to go back there, soon. 2 healers don't seem able to cover my ass there, for an extended period of time.</div></div><hr />

Were the mobs being slowed? If not, then that might be a problem healing wise, but otherwise I would look to the rest of your group as being a problem. Don't be afraid to speak up if your healer is not doing their job and then somehow makes you out to be a bad tank because you are an sk. <br />
The overall quality of a group is much more important than the individual tank in LDoNs. I have been in pickup normal ldons with cleric,druid,shaman and enchanter and had them all die on me when I pulled 3 mobs. On the other hand I have been in a Hard Ldon where the cleric accidently pulled 7 mobs and we had no bard or chanter and we lived even after the cleric died. <br />
A group of skilled players &gt;&gt;&gt; a group of ordinary players, no matter the level of gear for LDoN. If these players don't want to have you as a tank anymore, then it's probably good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Inferna</div><div class="date">08-08-2004, 09:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If the bard was slowing that could be your problem.  Bard slow is only like 55 percent slow and its often resisted.<br />
<br />
If the mobs were not slowed it would be hard to tank at your level of HP making you feel gimped.<br />
<br />
Not that your complaint is wrong however it does bear some merit.<br />
<br />
But this is how things are for the SK (less so for paladins cause they can stun)</div></div><hr />

In short, for you to be effecient to group in GoD/Hard LDoNs or most high level encounters, as a tank, you must work 4x times harder than other classes.<br />
<br />
 You can always group as a wizard, rogue, necro, or even cleric with Bazaar gear but as a tank, you'll have lots of trouble doing so with same quality of gear. So an average tank with bazaar gear and 4.5kish hp is gimped compared to a bazaar geard necro(as an example).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cames</div><div class="date">08-09-2004, 08:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I disagree that its 4x harder for an SK to tank a hard LDoN than other tank classes.  Your group was seriously underpowered for a hard LDoN (I am making an assumption that this was all level 65s).  No dedicated slower and crowd control.  The bard was probably, pulling slowing, mezzing, fading.  That is an awful lot to put on one player.  Your cleric was probably very low on FT.<br />
<br />
If you have 4.5k unbuffed that is on the edge of tanking Hard LDoNs.  GoD trials are probably completely out.  From a casual player perspective, one is expected to gear up LDoN wise to be able to do GoD trials.<br />
<br />
One part you do have right is that tanks are very gear dependent.  More so than our caster counterparts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Some of the mobs mitigate slow and some don't.  However I have noticed I take a lot more damage with bard slow then shaman, enchanter or even BL slow.<br />
<br />
I think bard slow has a high resist rate from what I understand.  Also as someone pointed out your hp were already a bit on the low side.  While I do agree this is more difficult for an sk to tank because of our gear dependence and the fact that we have no way to mitigate ie stun, defensive, or avoid disc's.<br />
<br />
Often when I started doing Hard Ldon's I had to use the festering and back up method to give the heal time to land.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Groff Gorespiller</div><div class="date">08-09-2004, 09:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most are only partially slowable.  I group exclusively with a shaman friend and we're usually either in the same room or on teamspeak when we're in game.  Nearly every mob in every high risk adventure we've done has mitigated slow.<br />
<br />
As for his hp and ability to tank hards, I'm fairly certain that it doesn't enter into it.  I tank hards fine and I don't get near 6k with only CoL on.  Average group buffs put me at 7450 or so, yet I have no problems with singles.  I didn't bother to look at his magelo but AC might be an issue; hp shouldn't be.<br />
<br />
Look at your cleric.  I'm sure that's where the problem lies.  Is she HoTing?  She should be.  Does she have the Bulwark line?  That shit helps a ton.  Is she trying to throw CH's like she would on most lower tier mobs (IE: at around 40%)?  You can't do that shit in these adventures.  Clerics fail to understand incoming damage quite often.  They see mitigation disciplines or AA cutting down on damage spikes and don't realize that you can still get a heavy round or two that will put their rhythm off and kill you.  When mobs are hitting in the high 900's +,  there's a huge difference in the way they have to heal, and it becomes readily apparent when your cleric is sleepwalking.  I'd say that's probably where the issue lies, not with your ability to take damage or do your job.<br />
<br />
As someone else said, if you're holding aggro, you're doing your job.  Keeping you alive is someone else's issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Noctix</div><div class="date">08-09-2004, 09:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have just over 5khp unbuffed and I tank LDoN hards every night with few deaths.<br />
<br />
If you are getting single pulls, then I can only see two possible issues:<br />
<br />
1) As others mentioned, if mobs weren't getting slowed, that's a big problem.<br />
<br />
2) LDoN hards are the first place in casual progression where clerics actually need to know how to play their class.  Prior to LDoN hards, clerics can get by entirely on CH.  In LDoN hard however, the cleric NEEDS to know how to use fast cast heals and celestials appropriately.  Also, the Divine Arbitration AA can be a huge help in healing.  If your group was made up of bazaar geared people and the cleric hasn't done much healing in LDoN hards, I suspect that was the weak link.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eggborn</div><div class="date">08-09-2004, 10:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I find sk's are more powerful in numbers.  Dont be afraid to get a second sk or even a third for a hard ldon.  Even if you have an underequipped cleric, with two or three of you, they will not run out of mana.<br />
<br />
The only time I like a pally is if a shaman is the only healer.  Even then, I dont ask them unless it is a dungeon with lots of undead or cleric mobs.  If you have a necro, that takes care of undead damage(or more sk's), Chanters/bards can take care of the cleric mobs.<br />
<br />
Dont listen to anyone when they say,, get dps dps, blah, fill the group with sk's.  I like longer fights anyway, more mana.  We can do amazing things.<br />
<br />
while the other groups get warriors etc, you go get those sk's lfg.  You will finish faster in time to have a smoke, grab a beer and relax in between ldons.  They will still be moving slowly back to camp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Menon Lifeblight</div><div class="date">08-09-2004, 11:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The difference between a warrior and SK tanking in LDoN is negligible.  Warriors shine in short-duration fights where their discs (furious, defensive, stonewall) make a huge difference.  SKs have nothing to compete with on these fights.<br />
<br />
On a 60-minute LDoN grind though, SKs tank just as well as warriors.  We are not gimped compared to other tanks when it's nothing but trash mobs being killed.  SK/warrior imbalance comes into play on hard-hitting mobs that die in under three minutes.  SK/ranger imbalance is apparent on hard-hitting melee mobs that die in less than 30 seconds.  These conditions aren't present in LDoN.<br />
<br />
Tanks in general have always been more gear-dependent than casters, so if that is your complaint, it's odd that you've just realized it now.<br />
<br />
Off-topic smartass question...if you are half EP-geared, how are you under 6k?  What is the other half of your gear, crusty?  (Didn't see a magelo link.)  I only have a couple pieces from the EPs and I'm at 6.2k unbuffed.</div></div><hr />

 In other words, Those Bazaar geard classes can always go hunt in GoD or wherever, but SKs as tanks cant tank those hard GoD mobs even with 4x better gear. So, I've been thinking if I didnt have those Defensive AAs and this gear.. heck I would die easily many times in hard LDoNs.. but those guys that were in my group avereges 30ish AA only with sucky gear and they enjoyed the hard LDoN content.. if I was in their shoes being an SK I couldnt be in that group, I'll just stick to Normal LDoN....<br />

I see what you're saying, and I agree. As someone else said, it comes down to gear dependency. A Bazaar geared wizzie for instance can &quot;coast&quot; his way through a hard LDON because he's not front and center in the spotlight. I don't see many people asking a Wizzie (for example) what their mana pool is before allowing them in a group. I don't see many people asking a Rogue what their DPS parses at. Yet an SK (or a Pally, and sometimes the Warriors as well) is almost always going to be asked what their HPs/AC are and if they have their Defensive AA done when they are invited to a group for a Hard LDON that doesn't know them.</div></div><hr />

Dude, look at my fucking Magelo.  If you have ANY EP gear, you're better off than I am and I do just fine in GoD and LDoN hards.  What MOST of the people who've posted to this thread have said is correct, now let go of your whiney ass complaint and learn how to do it.  Fucking christ, it's nothing but dipshits and pussies as far as the eye can see.</div></div><hr />

Another thing to keep in mind is the huge difference between a 55% Bard slow and a 75% Shaman slow, in terms of the dps output of a mob. A mob doing 45% of its normal attack rate vs. a mob doing 25% of its normal attack rate is a big difference...even if the slows are mitigated etc., the concept is important to grasp.</div></div><hr />

Casters don't hit or get hit by mobs, and thus do not have the same gear dependence that tanks do.  This is not a SK problem at all, but just a reality of the way the game is designed.</div></div><hr />

Thats not how slow percentages work.  Its a multiplier to delay.  So, a 75% slow multiplies delay by 1.75.  A 100% slow would mean that its hitting half as often.  Point remains, hard ldon with a healer who has 6-12 AAs is generally a bad idea.</div></div><hr />

Slow changes delay by this formula~<br />

 [delay/(1-slow%)] = delayslowed<br />
<br />
So 75% slow is actually half as much incoming damage as 50% slow...unless Lejina had this wrong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But the fact that going from a 50% slow to a 75% slow cuts melee damage from a mob in half is worth keeping in mind, especially as a SK trying to tank more challenging group content. Shm&gt;Enc&gt;Bst&gt;Brd slowing...</div></div><hr />

 I thank you for reading my post clearly.<br />
<br />
 And no it snot Caster/Melee.. because Rogues, Monks, BSTs, Rangers..etc dont tank. Warriors have more HPs than we do so I dont know, they dont need more work/better gear to be a OK tank. It just comes to Paladins and SKs.<br />
<br />
 Again read my post clearly, am not complaining about whether I can get a group or not, or if SKs suck or not.. no.. am talking about a design problem for casual or semi-casual players.

WTF? How do you figure that? You have ALOT of EP gear and you are NOT underequipped in the slightest. You are way more decked out then the average SK so dont sit there and wave around a 7k+ unbuffed magelo while giving the &quot;Woh is me!&quot; speach.

I am not saying he is right here, I tanked hard LDON just fine and I have under 4500hps totally unbuffed.

<br />
What the fuck does this have to do with the topic at hand?  Either of you care to answer?  If we're comparing apples to apples, High risk LDoN are similar to GoD content that you can access WITHOUT flags.  The only fucking reason I mentioned EPs at all was because the original fucking poster said he was EP flagged and had some gear.  <br />
<br />
As for our &quot;blow up&quot; on the other board, Mariann, that didn't have anything to do with EPs either.  You made a presumption and I called you on it.  You're going to have to admit to yourself that you were carried through EP flagging and haven't really got the zones under your belt enough yet to know what it's like at appropriate levels.  You were complaining that you couldn't do Tier 1 GoD content at your gear level (which is admitedly higher than mine) and I called you on the fact that you also don't have defensive AA's completed yet and probably haven't really given it a fair shake.  Just like Yabyab here, you came in sulking because the content was &quot;too hard&quot; for &quot;us gimp knights&quot; and I slapped you in the fact to try and get you to take hold of yourself.<br />
<br />
I certainly am not the best geared or highest flagged toon on this board nor the other one.  I don't claim to be high-grand-poobah uber.  I know what I can do though, and I refuse to let some wet behind the ears whelp who hasn't even really tried to do something tell me what's what.<br />

When you've been around giving sage advice as long as Brael or Slein, you can say &quot;Because I said so&quot;.  Until then, prove it, fucker.<br />

Edit: Oh, and Tropics, Inferna was quoting me, he just doesn't know how to use the quote command.  I'm not EP flagged, have no EP gear.  Most of my shit is LDoN or lower.  I still tank hards better than many a warrior I know.  The real mitigation disparity problem between knights and warriors only shows up in higher EP through Time and high tier GoD.  If you're seeing a problem at the level I'm at, you're manufacturing it.</div></div><hr />

WTF? How do you figure that? You have ALOT of EP gear and you are NOT underequipped in the slightest. You are way more decked out then the average SK so dont sit there and wave around a 7k+ unbuffed magelo while giving the &quot;Woh is me!&quot; speach. That was retarded, what are you trying to bluff him into not clicking on your magelo?<br />
<br />
I am not saying he is right here, I tanked hard LDON just fine and I have under 4500hps totally unbuffed. I actually AM under EP equipped and have alot of Velious armor as well as some ghetto Greenmist from PoF. Your &quot;OMG look at my gimp magelo WTF, I tank hard LDoN with ease!&quot; post was dumb as hell. Did you buy your toon on Ebay? I am not sure how you could not relize you have EP gear....<br />
<br />
WTF back..read the page again...the only thing you can say is WTF!? Inferna, that postcount and still not quoting correct?</div></div><hr />

Secondly, to Ashram, there is a huge difference between normal level 65 LDoNs and hard level 65 LDoNs.  On normals, the enemies max hit for what, 300ish?  On hard LDoNs they max hit for just under 1000 (I seem to remember seeing 992 a lot).  Please do not compare normal level 65 LDoNs at level 58 to hard level 65 LDoNs at 65.</div></div><hr />

He's got a chip on his shoulder that he can't seem to brush off and I, like the fool I am, keep trying to help him with it... sometimes with a sledge hammer.</div></div><hr />

Unless you are a complete moron...<br />
<br />
You post about things having no freaking idea what you are talking about as you have not experienced them.<br />
<br />
You do this time and again and did it here.  <br />
<br />
Inferna called you on it and I pointed out this is not new behavior.</div></div><hr />

Meh, well I will take little blame on misreading that. The &quot;reply with quote&quot; button is your friend. Otherwise though WTG on destroying my whole post and the 2 minutes it took to type it.  :(</div></div><hr />

Yeah, ok, whatever.  Jeebus, some day I'll stop trying.<br />

Live in whatever fantasy world you like and just don't respond to my posts if I piss you off that much, but don't act like you're uber and brilliant and wise because you had someone carry you through some content.  Or do, shit I don't care.  You keep doing what you're doing, I'll keep calling you on being an idiot, and everyone else will keep ignoring this shit.</div></div><hr />

I don't act uber.  I posted already here are things I have experienced.  Here are things I have not experienced.  KT - not experienced.  Time - not experienced.  EPs - experienced.  Vxed/Tipt - experienced.<br />
<br />
You post about things that you have not experienced.  That is you talking uber fuckwit.  I simply say, my experience is thus.  You say, &quot;Since I have raided Emporer Crush then Quarm must be thus.&quot;  Shut up.  Die. Whatever.<br />
<br />
Its not a fantasy.  Go back to your other useless website.  Why you come here now is because your post count there is what 1/day?  Don't pollute the world anymore.</div></div><hr />

I have only done enough LDoNs to aug my sews, I say screw that shit go to GoD and get your augs/loot there. If you cant tank there get in a better guild lvl up your aas and get to the eps. If you cant welcome to the progression of EQ.<br />

As for SKs being gimped, you signed up for that on day one when you clicked the little tan button saying  &quot;Shadow Knight&quot; thinking .....&quot;Sweet I can dish dmg w/ melee, spells, and shit I can be evil to. I am the win.&quot;</div></div><hr />
