<br />
Look at this:<br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=24425<br />
<br />
yes thats a Erudite SK.....wow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Calamity_Daemon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARN!!!!!! That is nice Mr.Tumy ...er...I mean King Tumy....Uh I mean....Zues Tumy....wait no I got it...Ahh....my brain!<br />
<br />
Gotta say though you got some nice stuff HATS OFF EVERYONE<br />
<br />
*Bows*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dakkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you're twinking heavily and have a good chance of getting into a high level guild, then no, race doesn't matter much.<br />
<br />
This is because from day one, your gear stats will make your race stats and starting stat choices almost irrelevant.<br />
<br />
If you're an average player and can't afford to twink heavily, then making an erudite SK or a DE warrior (while fine by me, I don't care) is something to consider carefully since a noticeable amount of your stats will come from your race choice.<br />
<br />
Just something to think about.<br />
<br />
Nice magelo though :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jodgrim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Calamity I know you think it's clever, but seriously, you sig has got to go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Darknyss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">yah, I did that with an allakhazam character using an Iksar... which Everlore points out to be one of the worst race/class combos...<br />
<br />
didn't even use AAXP points to max out the stats and such...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tumy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I didnt make that Magelo.  That is the Magelo profile of Sharkon, of Arch Overseers.<br />
<br />
It just blew my mind to see every stat maxed at 305 besides wiz and chr, and on a Erudite.<br />
<br />
On a side note:<br />
<br />
Calamity, we all know that your fucking retarded from the length of your sig.  <br />
<br />
You proved it again by stating your favorit SK quote was &quot;Du hast&quot;.  (Fucktard)<br />
<br />
Yet again you prove it by not understanding that Im a Ogre, and that I'm talking about a Erudite the entire lenght of my post.  I even posted a Erudite Magelo, and yet you still thought that it was my magelo.<br />
<br />
Your one of those people that would be inordinantly improved by death.<br />
<br />
In the words of Bick, &quot;LoLRofLz! ~K,tHx bY&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Naubi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Click my sig for a more average raiding guild magelo for an erudite SK.<br />
<br />
You'll see that my stats that are suffering are dex and agi (not sta and str, which turned out to be easy to get).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>NamineftheFat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i bet he still gets stunned from the front :p <br />
<br />
ogres have that edge over others.  everyone else is the same basically.  regen is nice but in high end guilds the stuff hits hard enough that a few hps of regen aren't gonna save you.<br />

Calamity I know you think it's clever, but seriously, you sig has got to go.  <br />
<br />
You should read where that sig comes from.  It's pretty long but worth the read JUST for that paragraph.  (Apologies if you have read it, I hope it stays as I'll want to copy it at a futuren, non-lazy point).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Azraelwrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If you are a very high level, and in a super uber guild, then it doesn't matter.  If not, it does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Calamity_Daemon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Whatever bro</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Naubi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">For a while ogres and trolls seem to be at a disadvantage as you will max your str and sta on raids before you get close to maxing your int.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Chrissi SL</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Sharkon is the top sk serverwide as far i I can tell. I have grouped with him he is VERY impressive:cool:</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have read it, and it is very funny, however, bookmarking the link would serve you as well, if not better than seeing it in his sig all the time.<br />
<br />
edit: Thanks Calamity, seriously no hard feelings, it was just a little long for a sig.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Calamity_Daemon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">yeah yer right BUT I GOT A BETTER ONE /thank</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Jespar Bloodreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Having end-game gear and flags doesnt make a great player...all that means is you've been accepted..on several factors. <br />
<br />
I know plenty of non-guilded players(myself included) that would blow away any EQ player in any game of any choice.<br />
<br />
Having options in EQ is what will make or break your end-game experience, you either conform to the trends of the raiding guilds or you do without, that simple.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Do not ask which creature screams in the night,<br />
Do not question who waits for you in the shadow.<br />
It is my cry that wakes you in the night,<br />
And my body that crouches in the shadow.<br />
I am Calamity and you are the puppet<br />
That dances to my tune.&quot;<br />
 <br />
<br />
I liked it better in the Warhammer art that it originally came from.  :D<br />
<br />
IIRC, it went something like this;  Picture of some moderately mutated chaos warrior, wearing rather messed up platemail, carrying a huge battle standard (Basically a flag on a 9' long pole), on which is written the above, only instead of Calamity, it's &quot;Tzzench&quot;, the chaos god of magic and change, in barely ledgible scribbles.<br />
<br />
Another good one is from the Warhammer 40k Dark Eldar (Dark Elves in space) codex:<br />
<br />
&quot;We are not creatures of shadow / but it serves us well / as an ally in battle and a refuge for rest.&quot;</div></div><hr />
