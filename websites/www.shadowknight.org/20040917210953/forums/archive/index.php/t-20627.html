<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Laymon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Dont know if anyone can answer this but in one thread someone is getting 4 drops in 2 hours and in another someone has gone 22 hours in one session with no drop. <br />
<br />
(oh and theres the guy who got his on his first ever Drake kill but we wont mention him...ever...again).<br />
<br />
So is there any corrolation here? perhaps it drops 'only' from a particular spawn now? behind the zone in seems to be popular atm.<br />
I doubt that's it and I am of course guessing, but does anybody have any ideas whats going on?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Phester Ingwound</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It wasn't my first ever drake kill ... just the first of that day.  It was around my 70th Drake.<br />
<br />
I know I was lucky.  <br />
<br />
The group had set up in the alcove area to the left  if you head around the first two buildings on the same level as the entrance.<br />
<br />
It was pulled from the second building on the left from the entrance.<br />
<br />
I just got lucky</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>nightsadie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">We went to Hate last friday night and got hide off 2nd drake we killed. SInce the patch that increased the drop rate we had been to hate 2 times and killed maybe 20 drakes. My husband got his drop near where named drake spawns close to temple.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zolexa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Dragged my poor boyfriend to Hate quite a few times trying to get this damnable hide.  Stay killing everything we see until bored out of our minds (and then some).  Saturday comes, I'm camping the Fabled Priest in SolB for my shaman (now #3 on list up from #12), and I get a tell.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Decrepit Hide&quot; you want this? For a few seconds I just stared at the screen.  Luckily SK/shaman on 2 accounts.  So he runs me up and loots.<br />
<br />
Last night before guild raid I finally get around to asking what he was doing up in Hate.  His uncle that started playing EQ a short time ago, just made 46 on his beastlord, and was one of the few Planes he wanted to see.  They zoned in, killed a few things for good measure.  They see 1 drake and kill it on matter of principle...<br />
<br />
Of course the smart ass had to pay me back for all the time I dragged him to Hate, when I logged in Sunday morning, I was camped in West Karana...Damn pallies! (Later tells me he was going to TL me to Cazic Thule, but didnt want to get me killed...)<br />
<br />
Guess now I've got to convince him to go to the Hole.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Darknyss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">A ShadowKnight with a Pally boyfriend... what is this world coming too....?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Laymon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">if she's just using him, then it's ok<br />
<br />
:-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zolexa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">He's actually quite evil for a Pally.  More like an SK in denial.  Trying to show him the dark side is more fun. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Orthogonon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Was really bored the other night and was asked to tank for an xp group in hate.   We killed quite a few drakes and alas, no hide.   I don't really care since i got mine ages ago.   However, it doesn't seem that the change has resulted in hides dropping from the sky or something.</div></div><hr />
