<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>neferaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">LDoN has nice features with the augment idea. There is one thing in EQ playing a melee class that annoys me more then most other things and that is swapping in and out your primal for the proc.<br />
<br />
So why won't there be a quest where you can 'melt' your primal weapon and form an augment stone from it with the 'avatar' proc on that. This way you still have to get a primal in ST and it solves the annoying weapon swapping. Of course there is a drawback too, you have only 1 spot for an augment stone on a weapon so for example you can't put one of those lifetap things on it too and thus you lose some DPS/healing from not having those damage/tap procs.<br />
<br />
I don't see anything unbalancing in this, it solves an annoyance in EQ in a way that is very easy to add.<br />
<br />
Of course this quest could require some additional things and I don't have a problem with it being pretty expensive. Maybe this quest should be given by the guys who give you the adventurers stones - they seem to have some experience with magical stones. And maybe he gives it only if you completed a certain number of adventures in that setting.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Paynreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Why are they such a mistake?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Justjoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">sounds like some one never got thier ST key.  whaaa!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">he's only got 3 primals. primals... not prismatics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">They provide to large of a dps increase for the level you get them... theres a reason stats on primals were kept a huge secret when they first dropped, theyre incredibly overpowered.  And no whoever the fuck you are who thinks its just jealousy it isn't trust me... I have 6 primals, 4 2h (axe, lance, wifebeater, and sword) and 2 1h (knights and non knights swords), all 6 sit in the tinkerer bag in spot 4 in my bank, I used them for quite awhile and know exactly what they do... darko knows as well</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Paynreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">When i get Avatar cast on me, even Ferine Avatar, it doesn't seem like such a big deal. I feel like im missing something big...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>synnoira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have to laugh at Darko being accused of whining because he didn't get an ST key.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Naubi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I just clicked my silvery mask on my brawlstick and there's no item lore saying wifebeater</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Araden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Primal.  Would venture to say the difference at least old school before now, was about a 50% increase in guild capability, especially if you were a melee heavy guild.<br />
<br />
Dunno that I think it was wrong per se,  Opinions about progress are just opinions,  but it was designed it that way  /shrug.   Nowadays with the weapons available from pop guilds are able to skip that and still beat mobs that used to require it, and you can get elemental without being primal'd.   It's no longer a required step to beat the game... but if you want to remain a smaller guild it sure helps to have the best you can gear wise on your folks, and primal's will make a difference until you got a ton of worn attack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Krushum Gudended</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">hahah, thena maybe the ancient prismatic brawl sticks don't ID as wifebeaters... just checked mine as well</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gollgoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Regardless if it was a &quot;mistake&quot; to introduce Primal weapons into the game.  They exist.  They continue to exist as Prismatic weapons.  The Buff itself is now available, not only from Shamans, but also from Elemental BP's.<br />
<br />
I do not think adding a Primal Stone to insert the weapon proc is out of the realm of reasonable.  It would be a nice addition to what has come from LDoN IMO.<br />

Last i checked, Avatar was not available on an ele BP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gollgoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Yup, yer right.  Guess it has been a while since I looked at the effects.  Always thought it was a let down that they had all elemental plate BP's with a 10.0 second avatar click --- <br />
<br />
Anyway, Prismatic can be 1 grouped, I don't see why it would be overpowering at this point in the game, to add it in as an augment.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Drakonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Aye they removed Avatar from the Ele BPs after a lot of complaining about it being too lame an effect for a Time drop.  Instead they replaced it with a lame focus in our case...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Paynreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">It really used to be Avatar?<br />
<br />
Shit, that &gt; our current effect (not that i have the current BP)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Darko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I give this thread five stars, its almoast as good as the nerf knights in the flame on area, keep it up guys we may just have a winner here!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Vermadas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The current focus effect on our BP does leave much to be desired, however, Fury of Bertox &gt;&gt; clicky Avatar that counts toward worn ATK cap.  At the point in the game where you would loot that BP, max'ing your worn ATK is pretty easy.</div></div><hr />
