<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">If anyone else has the faction to find these it would be cool.  As some people know it's possible to get non kos to muramites through extensive killing of mobs such as in Riftseekers.  I managed to hit max Ally today, going through my logs since OoW was released it took approx 6 hours a night of 1 mob per minute for 32 days of exping in addition to raids (extra 800 hits+27 feratha/chailak hits and 5 king/queen hits) to reach this level of faction.  As a result I'm non kos to virtually all muramites in OoW (everything on Overlord Mata Muram faction).  So far I've only managed to get a chance to check a handful of mobs in Anguish for quests, actually I've only had a chance to speak to one of them and that was Jelvan.  Since it's in the middle of my log atm and I'll just say what he wanted, he asked me for a Seal: Mastery of All, Rayin's Cheastplate of Abhorrence, Frosted Gerlidian Ribcage, and Muramite Chestplate Lacquer.  The lacquer is apparently made by a flag restricted combine (can't make it until you've talked to the guy whos given the quest), it requires a gashed magnetized breastplate, a slitted ikaav eye, kyanite, and muramite residue combined in a forge.<br />
<br />
Anyways, sounds like a quest path to pick up armor for people who are Anguish keyed none of those items are particularily hard to get but you need good faction.  Spoke to me with max Ally, probally needs the same amount as the tier 1 armor stuff.  No idea if the same npc gives the quests for all classes or what.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Airemus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Why does this remind me of the time brael 'discovered' the epic 2.0 npc in plane of time..   :D good times (http://forums.shadowknight.org/showthread.php?t=14519&amp;highlight=Epic)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">No idea, however it's true you can gain faction with muramites... ask most people in my guild they've seen me be non kos to stuff for the last few days.  Not that hard to go hail the mob to verify it if you have faction and your keys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Airemus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah i've seen the faction hits, i never said you were bullshitting either, it just reminded me of your epic 'discovery'. Maybe the quest will result in an item with clicky mgb gnome illusion.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">kinda cool was actually thinking about this today and wish it was more velious like where you could side with mata muram or dranik loyalist though at the same time as wish there were atleast 2 cities in OoW (Dranik loyalist owned and matamuram owned).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm guessing this is like Velious where the content is designed for you to switch faction at some point.  Start out on Dranik Loyalist faction, then progress to the point where you switch to Overlord Mata Muram faction.<br />
<br />
A tradeskill combine that takes kyanite?  YOUCH.<br />
<br />
-Bolas</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">A few people in my guild are non-kos Anguish as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Arikash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">diety related?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ghismonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">None of them are particularly hard to get, and you included Rayin's BP.  Lolers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Rueeliar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Jesus, and I thought I spent alot of time in RSS...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well you cant hurt dranik loyalist faction from what i have observed? So eventually you should be ally to both if you spend enough time in oow. IMHO kinda takes the fun out of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Brael is now indifferent to Anguish! Using the CoS &quot;trick&quot;. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">...approx 6 hours a night of 1 mob per minute for 32 days of exping in addition to raids... <br />

Do you live off of your lottery winnings or something  ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you live off of your lottery winnings or something  ;)<br />
<br />
6 hrs a night isn't much play time if online gaming is your primary form of socializing - plenty easy to work or attend classes + play 6 hrs a day if thats how you have your priorities set.<br />
<br />
Hell, I for a long while was pulling 10-12 hr days of EQing on work days back when I was in an AA crunch - since my wife plays and I usually only sleep 3-4 hrs a night it was easy for me. (she sleeps alot longer than me, but she doesn't work, so she would sleep alot while I was working)<br />
<br />
Looking back, it was fucked up for us to do that to ourselves, but it was perfectly doable.... but man, running around doing mundane shit felt good after that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Thats in addition to raids Vaclav, about 10 hours/day total.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>BRUTALL</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I would expect this from your average greifer but not coming from a class correspondent.  Lets see brael lies ...only sometimes... so what do i believe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I would expect this from your average greifer but not coming from a class correspondent.  Lets see brael lies ...only sometimes... so what do i believe.<br />
<br />
Ya, you're right... I really should have put more effort into my hoax this time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Rueeliar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Especially considering that Jelvan isn't on Mata Muram faction.  =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Ya, that would be another good reason</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Arikash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Thank god I didn't care.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: Epic 2.0 was better</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Actually, anyone whos been in Anguish would know thats not real.  Besides the fact that I used a Rayins BP, 3 items in that list don't even exist, the mob in question isn't on the correct faction, and... the whole concept of those mobs giving you loot makes no sense.  The only thing that is true is the faction :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>kharan_zechts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">When I saw Rayin BP I figured it was either fake or really shitty quest design. Perhaps Overlord MM himself gives out quests?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>lorddaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I'm so confused.<br />
<br />
&lt;grin&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Kahntun Derstand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Yay!  I didn't fall for it this time. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Both of 'em I didn't &quot;fall for&quot; because both were beyond my means anyways.  However, if the next one involves fire beetle eyes and/or bone chips... ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Arikash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">And Sarnak whips!</div></div><hr />
