Do you think a 55 sk has a chance? Also might try 2 boxing with a 63 cleric any ideas/info about this zone?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darkhan</div><div class="date">03-27-2004, 06:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am a novice sk, so i dont know about fear kiting, but i hunt in Natimbi all the time with my Bst main. If you 2 box you should have no prob. Start out with the Turepta Cragwalkers and Stone Shoremites. There are lots of them around and they are pretty easy to kill. Make sure you pull to a safe area because the all will aggro on you and they run when under 20%. Safe pull spots include the adven camp when you port in and just across the channel at the shallow gully by the base of the hills. Do not mess with the Fierce Cragwalker unless you have lots of healing for he is bad ass. The restless souls and the Hynid Fleshrippers are very tough too, so be ready if you pull one. Xp in the zone is pretty good though, especially for a non Pop, realtively simple zone to hunt in. Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marruk</div><div class="date">04-01-2004, 10:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was solo fear kiting in Natimbi around 57-59, and the exp was excellent.  However, adds can be brutal, as the mobs hit hard for their level.  I stuck with the stonemites,  turepta cragwalkers, and the Hynids.  IIRC, the Fierce cragwalkers were either unfearable, or just resisted it so often as to make them impractical.<br />
<br />
One thing I did notice about the stonemites:  they proc an extremely long-lasting acid dot that drastically increased my down-time when soloing.  However, they seem to proc this regularly in the first round or two of melee, and then more or less randomly throughout the rest of the fight, so if you know they are going to get some melee in (i.e. fear or snare is resisted), through your pet on them to eat the first proc.  Better the walking dot eats it than you.<br />
<br />
*edit* I wasn't able to find anyone who could remove the proc... if your cleric is able to cure it, I would be interested to hear what spell removes it.</div></div><hr />
