It wasn't your gender nor your accomplishment we were mocking, but rather your choice to pose on the internet as a gender different than the one you were born as AND the gibberish in your sig.    I'm sorry we hurt your widdle feelings by not appropriately celebrating your imaginary accomplishment.  Congrats.  BTW I'm gonna post on here when I ding 60 just to see the flames I get...it's called a roast hun a mocking in celebration.  Don't like it?  I hear they still allow people to make druids.<br />

I once read a post stating the lack of females who gain the rank of Dread Lord, and thought by posting of another succeeding it might be encouraging, but as I said earlier, it was a mistake on my part.</div></div><hr />

Thank you for the grats, though I was really just trying to show support for our gender in the class.  I suppose there are a lot more since that post I read.<br />
<br />
Most are probably not interested, but Jae's history is written that she is half drow, half tier'dal.  I wanted to add a bit to the roleplay side of her, hence the drow signature. <br />
<br />
It says, &quot;death and dishonor go hand in hand&quot;. It has meaning for her, but it could be interpreted differently by anyone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Actually, it's pretty standard for any post saying &quot;Grats me on level xxxxx&quot; to get moved here because no one cares except for the author.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Brael- I don't believe it mentioned anything about expecting any kind of well wishes because of reaching the level I did. If anything it was expressing something that I believed was an achievement for my class and gender in general, but as I have been mentioning I guess that there are more female Dread Lords than I thought.<br />
<br />
Kilbor- I do know there is no drow in EQ, but why be limited..allow yourself to step outside of the box once in awhile, you might find something interesting to expand upon.<br />
<br />
Slein Jinn- First of all, I dont wear any to get in a bind :p....second if cyber is the only idea you have of roleplaying, you have issues.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>BRÆDOWN™</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Characters that can be considered drow in EQ by D&amp;D standards would be those spiders from kunark.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Jaellah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Actually those would be called Dryders and if I remember correctly(if anyone knows for certain , please correct me)..what they are is the result of either displeasing the deity Lloth by failing the trials or choosing a path (life) that they are not capable of handling or succeeding in.</div></div><hr />

Maybe if you PROVE that you're not a man playing a girl character then we would be more supportive.  However, we have learned the hard way not to trust anyone who says <br />
