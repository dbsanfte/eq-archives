<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Karash Dredklaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok i dont know if any of you will know about this but for all you Vets out there, me and my friend Xinsar Moribund of Luclin have just run across that integral yet oh so elusive item that kept us from advancing in the original greenmist quest, thats right, A Shattered Crusaders Khukri now drops from the Kly Overseer in Dalnir. when I.D'd the item says &quot;Lore: Property of Golin&quot; for you whippersnappers who dont remember the original greenmist quest i will recap what we knew at the time. <br />
        the farthest anyone could get for a long long time was lord of pains khukri. It seemed that hints about the next Khukri (presumably Greenmist) were revealed in the scattered journal entries that are ground spawns in Dalnir which recount the endeavors of two young crusaders one of whom was named Golin (the others name escapes me for the time being so we will refer to him as the author) who went in search of the fabled Visceral dagger in the crypt of Dalnir and never returned. The journal entries tell of their horrendous journey into the bowels of the crypt and lends hints about the visceral dagger. the entries also tell of the death of crusader Golin, the Author states in the entries, and i quote &quot;I have lost much here, including my friend Golin and along with him the shard which may be part of a bigger puzzle, Greenmist&quot; the Author then goes on to say &quot;i could resurrect him but i would need to speak with the brood about obtaining a crusader coffin&quot;. Back in cabilis there is a mortician near the necro guild who sells these coffins, if you say &quot;what crusaders coffin&quot; he will tell you that if you put three body parts of a fallen crusader in the coffin along with his weapon &quot;ye shall raise the dead&quot; back in Dalnir there used to drop off of the gyrating goos two lore bonechips which when I.D'd would say &quot;Golins remains:upper&quot; and &quot;Golins remains:Lower: or something to that effect, they also dropped a &quot;punctured Iksar skull&quot; which when I.D'd would reveal that it was in fact &quot;skull of Golin&quot;. so there we have the three body parts and for a long long while that was as far as anyone could get, Crusader Golins weapon was nowhere to be found, therefore he could not be resurrected therefore no further info could be obtained about Greenmist, it became another ruin of Kunark. until now. <br />
      the weapon has resurfaced and the fire rekindled. Sadly when combined in the coffin the only result is that oh so frustrating text &quot;Items cannot be combined in this container type&quot; i have tried the combine in several zones including Dalnir, West Cab, East Cab, and Warsliks Woods. according to the journal entries Golin was killed in or near the church area in Dalnir, but despite having tried the combine all over that urine soaked hell hole this new discovery has born no fruit. i wasted MANY an hour in Dalnir trying to solve this quest and as a result fell behind my friends in game and eventually gave up, this new discovery has me unbelievably excited so please excuse me if this post seems rushed or incoherent. so there you have it, i am here to call upon you, my fellow Shadowknights to pool our resources and see if we cant maybe dig up this fossil and return to the Iksar that ancient relic which was so unjustly taken from us when we were within but an armslength of feeling its power, and replaced with this Faux-Greenmist and a shakey-at-best storyline about sarnak and Dalnir. the original Greenmist would probably be UBER LAME by todays standards but i would so like to see its secrets uncovered, if only to know what ever became of our fallen comrade Crusader Golin /salute if anyone has any questions please post them and i will try to answer them as best i can, need sleep now tho, i hope i have piqued the interest of some however, i will most assuredly continue to pursue this thing, to whatever end.<br />

Old news.  It didnt lead anywhere =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Karash Dredklaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Aww dang, i was so excited too. sorry for wasting everyones time =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Karash Dredklaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">im still gonna try a couple of things, will get back to y'all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Karash Dredklaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Didnt pan out, that is all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kahel Everhate</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">an interesting idea you came up with... if they just put in the khurki recently on the kly's loot table then perhaps we should ontinue following this. I followed your link Cath and followed that up further. A monk did manage to make the combine there are in fact two khurki's one that id's as Golins is a wt 5.0 , there is another  that is wt 4.0 , the 4.0 is the one that successfully makes the combine.<br />
<br />
When the monk made the combine he came up with this item.. <br />
lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=12705 <br />
<br />
He did mention the fact that when he used the charge he only came up with a pet, which could mean many things.<br />
<br />
1) he was supposed to turn in the combined item and not use the charge<br />
<br />
2) he's an monk and the quest did not permit him to finish it<br />
<br />
3) quest is FUBAR<br />
<br />
all are equally valid ideas... I being a quester and loving my Mist, would love to see something come out of this. I will not be able to start following this up myself for another couple of weeks... heheh still in Kuwait playing with the other Marines (8mo now.. can we say time for a celebration Bow Chica Bow Bow :D )<br />
<br />
I would love to see follow ups on this, so don't give up the faith and keep at it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Karash Dredklaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I also managed to make the combine and got the resulting coffin with one charge of summon:golin. i went to Dalnir and used the charge and it summoned a Jabeker for me but he gave no text and did not react to different areas i brought him in Dalnir. the interesting thing however, is that the pet that was summoned for me used the iksar skeleton model rather than the human skeleton, also he was a shadowknight. a couple of interesting notes i thought, dont know if it was the same for the monk. im thinking maybe you need to give the pet the 4.0 khukri after he is spawned or take him to a certain location in Dalnir, maybe lead him out? sadly i got him killed before i could try and i cant be bothered to camp the pieces again, someone should try it tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kahel Everhate</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Interesting idea... the 4.0 is used to make the combine, perhaps the 5.0 that is lore id'd as his khurki is needed to be given to the ressurected form to trigger a conversation. I'll have to look into it when i get home in a couple of weeks<br />
