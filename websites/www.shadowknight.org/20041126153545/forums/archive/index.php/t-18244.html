<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The description of the AA is:<br />
This is a passive ability; it does not need to be activated.<br />
Requirements: Level: 55, Must spend 6 ability points in the General Abilities.<br />
After training in this ability, NPCs will notice your magical activities 5, 10, and 10 percent less.<br />
<br />
Unfortunatley it is doing more than this as I have recently proven while parsing melee aggro.  Originally I confirmed that it was not affecting my pure hate spells and altering the results.  If that were the case then Terror of Thule would be providing 480 hate per cast meaning Terror of Terris would be capable of outaggroing it with an equal number of castings.  This is not the case though so Terrors are not being affected (as it should be, Subtlety would mess all direct hate spells up if that was how it was meant to work).  This means that the only thing left to explain this is that melee aggro is being affected by it.  The following is my proof:<br />
<br />
I won't be going into deep explaniations of how this is proof, if you have been reading my thread about aggro generation you already know, if you haven't you can read up on it here (http://forums.shadowknight.org/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=18154).  This data is just copy/pasted from it, and condensed a bit, the method and such to arrive at these numbers is gone over in my other post.<br />

This needs fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sithanator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">/sigh yet another reason not to buy this AA.  This would be a great AA skill if it was something that could be toggled on and off. <br />

84-89 (no SCS) is less than 54-59 (with SCS).  SCS is reducing melee aggro, and not affecting direct hate spells.  Which makes sense on the spells, since the purpose of the AA is to let you do more spell damage without aggro yet those spells are specifically to give aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The more I think about it the more I like the idea of SCS becoming activated instead of passive and melee aggro reduction left in.  Would be the best fix I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sithanator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I been thinking that for a long time just never got around to posting it. Given what are primary roll is always seemed like it hurt us more then helped us being that it's passive.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ya, lots of people have thought of it for awhile.  I was thinking about it alot earlier today.  Every class that gets access to it wants to generate aggro at times, SK's want to more often than the other classes though.  I don't see what the problem would be if the skill was changed to be activated, it would take a skill which is borderline useless to 20% of the people who get it and make it extremly valuable to all 5 classes who recieve it.<br />
<br />
I'm sure its easier to implement this way than actually fixing the bug with it as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sithanator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Any idea if this has been posted on dev corner or any of class boards for other class's? Maybe it's somethign to throw around and see what the class who is applys to think of it. Knowing that applies to melee damage as also shows that it could useful as something you turn on and off for all class's, but they would probably have to change the name on it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kritr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hey there I am Kritr lvl 65 SK at this time with 390 AA... Okay here it goes... I have been getting mostly AA rather than going around doing other thinks, like epic... still do not have my epic...<br />
So my plan was to do all my AA... meaning all.. then go for epics and other quests, now with adventures. Not that is right or wrong.. just my way. When I was levelig never did aa till I hit 65. Some peeps thought of it as strange but it worked for me. I am a  very strong SK...<br />
<br />
Now on SCS the way it reads I thought was mostly to go unnoticed by mobs during FD, and to lose kos.. So it would be easier to hide and not get seen by mobs. Now it does not work all the time. I get hit while FD, get seen when invis, and kos everywhere.. So I thougth well this will get up my sneaky qualities... he he I like the sneaky thingy.. <br />
<br />
I never thought that I would lose aggro. Yesterday Nov 20, 2003 while discussing with another SK he asked me what I was working on and I told him SCS. He says to me, do not do that it will decrease your aggro.. then I lost it. WHAT?<br />
I did not think it was going to do that, I thought of the above. Why would I like to mess up my hard worked toon. To lose aggro would make me weaker at pulling and helping my gp. Maybe when someone else is being a tank it woulld make sense as I do not wish to take his aggro as happens at times, or when there is a big mob we are taking I do not want to be the one getting hit as he remembers me and get his rage on me... but otherwise away from this raid situation when I want to be sneaky and nuke and not be noticed, this AA does not make sense. Would make sense if it would need to be activated / turn it off and on and use it when the situation merits, most of the time I want the aggro on me to be effective. <br />
Rats I already put 2 AA on SCS. So I have been trying to petition to get it back the way it was. Not sure if it is a good move, and maybe it will be fixed to be turned off and on. AT this time until I get more info I will not buy any more of this AA. <br />
<br />
Really why would anyone make an AA that makes a character worse. The answer I have been given is.. well the parent pure classes have it.. Well we are not them, we are hybrids, a bit of other classes and do not want to weaken my toon that has taken me so long to make. Really looks like a untouch area for the developers as they did not really know what they were doing or some sort of trap, hey, we got you... I thought AA were for improvement not to make you worse.<br />
<br />
<br />
#@#%$... at this time I am trying to get my AA points back.. Was told may not happen :confused: <br />
<br />
<br />
Hey let me know more on this.. So far have my first two points, as I understand will cause a 5 pct less notice by NPC... crap... meaning I am losing 5 pct aggo????<br />
<br />
Voice of Thule, gives me like 12 pct aggo is this AA going to make it now... 7 pct aggro,, will my hate spells work less? <br />
<br />
No answer to this question at this point.. So will try to get my AA back or try to see if they can fix this situation and be able to use it off and on... then It would make sense... I use the AA at my discretion....<br />
<br />
Thanks for your reading my long post but at this time I am a bit mad... do not want to be taken for a fool.\<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tescin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I remember the first time I saw this AA available for SK's and said to myself (laughing) &quot;Why would I ever want to do that?&quot;  I see this working well for a pure caster, but for an SK, it's a BYONB Party.  (Bring Your Own Nerf Bat)<br />
<br />
Also, if I understand the post above, I believe he is saying that the AA is malfunctioning and is not affecting spells, but is instead lowering the hate generated by MELEE DAMAGE.  (Which is bad if you MT or add tank.)<br />
<br />
Goes to show you.  Make sure you read and understand the AA before you buy.  Just because you CAN get something doesn't mean it will fit your play style...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Kritr, im assuming English isn't your first language?  The AA is very descriptive in what it's supposed to do - Lower your aggro generation spells.<br />
<br />
Tescin, the main appeal of SCS is for the high end raiders.  We generate tons of hate already (more than we need), by taking subtlety we can spend less time/mana fd'ing during a fight allowing us to get in more damage.  It's not much more at all, maybe 4% more, but when you have 550+ AA there really isn't much else to buy.  It should be changed to be activated, thats all I can say on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kritr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well I read and read and read this AA it says that it lowers the NPC noticing your magical abilities by 5 , 10 and 20 pct less....<br />
<br />
Now I am not sure this is aggro... Where does English comes here...Now I spoke with several Sk and they had different ideas what it means... So maybe none of them speaks english... <br />
<br />
For me Aggro is Aggro... why not say it... buying this AA  will decrease Aggro..... why say this NPC will notice less your magical abilities... that leaves it to  interpretation.... not english...<br />
This is my only toon, I have not played casters. I think for casters, or for those SK's that have played them, the lowering aggro aspect of this message on buying the AA / lowering magical abilities  makes sense. They want less aggro when they cast... the poor chanters come to mind.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now...why will an AA be there that will decrease your productivity... I do understand that at times, when in a raid or certain group situation I may not want aggro, like when I am going to nuke for 7200 with my HT, I do not want to have the NPC raging on me, but most of the time what makes me different from lets say, a warrior, is that I can get aggro faster and quicker.. So why would I lower it, in normal circumstances. <br />
I have not been to the planes yet. Maybe there it would make more sense, maybe... as If I do not want just to be in the planes, but lets say be a tank in BOT I am not sure how having less aggro will  help  me.<br />
<br />
I thought that the AA was an advancement. In my opinion, not a step backwards/ nerfing.... Really intriging to me that I could mess myself up buying an AA... Is like a cleric buying an AA and finding that by doing so he will be the first one to be attacked and die... if this is the case for the cleric it should state it in the AA...Warning... this AA may cause your death more often than not....<br />
<br />
<br />
I think that if this AA was off and on, then this message, thread would not make any sense. I can use less aggro at times. <br />
Making it present all the time makes it a bad AA.<br />
I only placed 2 AA points and will not buy any more.<br />
Tried to give back the AA and the GM told me once you buy the AA we do not take it back. Ha.... interesting.. but I do not make the rules. So I am stuck. I did think a lot on this AA before I bought it. I have 394 AA at this time and this AA was one of last ones I got. I am glad I was discussing AA with another player, a rogue, who told me not to buy it as it will lower my aggro. He was not sure on this but told me to investigate some more. I did that and seems to me that this is the case. I talked to another GM who told me he was not going to reveal me game secrets, and left it to me to figure it out. I have actually been flamed for asking this very question. I was not aware that asking for more information is indicative of stupidity. For me asking is a way of  broadening  your knowledge and avoiding mistakes. Well at least of 12 possible AA points on SCS I got only 2 and 10 still to go.. In a way I am happy I will not have to work on this other ten.. So I am not too sad about it. <br />
<br />
Just the sneaky part of the AA makes me mad. <br />
I was told by another GM.. buying the AA is an opinion. Okay... so it is left to interpretation... not black and white.. Well maybe lawyers made this AA.. interpret what you want on lowering the NPC noticing your magical abilities. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">It's not really an improvement or nerf to exp playstyles just a change to it, it's a VERY slight improvement in raids... innate lung capacity&gt;it.  I just want it changed to not be affecting melee aggro also since it doesn't say it will lower all aggro just spell aggro, or want it changed to be activated (activated would be best, would change it from one of the worst to one of the best aa)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kritr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">So I hear there is a new patch coming on the 24 and that is today sometime. There are new melee features and I wonder if anyone heard of a improving this SCS, wonder if it will be set in a timer, like for a raid when you are not tanking or in a group, when you are not playing main tank. That would be great. <br />
<br />
I have sent feedback on this subject to the developers and nothing was said to me. I think feedback will not have a return answer. <br />
<br />
On the other hand I wonder if when I was talking to the GM on SCS when he said there were secrets of EQ he could not discuss with me, if he was maybe hinting that they are going to make this AA more palatable for peeps to buy. <br />
<br />
Still I think the description should mention, decrease your aggro. That would make it very clear for us who debated the meaning of the present description. As I said earlier, other people that I talked to were not certain what this description meant and actually the originator of this thread tested it to give a good answer to what this AA really does. It has helped me to understand why me, as an SK, will not buy more on this AA unless it is improved. <br />
<br />
<br />
I aggree... activating it would make it a very good AA to have and will not make me think I lost 2 AA on it which is what I did buy before this discussion.<br />
<br />
<br />
Take care <br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for all this good info<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The GM wasn't hinting at anything, GM's/Guides aren't allowed to talk about game mechanics</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Makkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">activated would be a good solution, in a lot of situations you want aggro, in some situations you don't<br />
<br />
and it doesn't even help much for what it was intended. broken dumb aa.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>shadowblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I can see why he could be confused at its purpose. When I first saw the aa I assumed by its description it meant that mobs would be less likely to turn on you and interrupt your casting, when in the process of casting on them. I thought why the hell do they even give us this AA if it lowers our aggro output completely?<br />
<br />
Then I thought about it further and realised of course they would, we are talking about a sony EQ development team that admitted they had no idea what too do with the shadowknight class a little while back and had no idea of the role we had layed out for ourselves, until they near broke it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kritr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I still wonder if this issue is going to be corrected. Have sent several feedbacks and have no idea if any of them means anything to SOE. <br />
I just stopped buying this AA and will not get unless something is done about it.<br />
With the new patch it will be interesting to see if anything will be done with this issue. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Naa, they won't do anything about it.  That would take time away from them making Warriors unkillable and giving them the majority of our useful abilities at the same time.</div></div><hr />
