<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mahsk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I two box a shaman frequently while LFG. My shaman just hit 61 and I was really looking forward to getting the new pet spell becuase its level 58 as opposed to the level 40 something 55 pet.<br />
<br />
So I decided to duel the pets and see who wins (64 sk pet always pwned the 55 SHM pet big time). I summoned Goner and buffed him with Augmentation of Death. I summoned True Spirit and buffed him with Focus and Celerity.<br />
<br />
In 5 our of 5 duels my pet won, with anywhere from 10% to 30% of his health remaining (I guess the lifetaps account for that). If the shaman pet didnt enrage when low I think my pet would have ended with 40% or better...<br />
<br />
This completely shocked me, people always talk about how SK pets are a waste of bone chips, I myself am guilty of hardly ever using my pet in groups. My pet parsed out almost identical DPS (20+) and beat a NPC 15 levels higher than him. I think its time for pet hold. Heres a link to the fight data of the last of the 5 duels. BTW KIBN is the shaman pet.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grarg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I had (untill recently) a 65 sk and a 65 sham, and i played with the pets a bit.<br />
<br />
There is a few important things to remember with shaman pets:<br />
1 They do not dual wield without weapons<br />
2 When summoned they have very crappy stats<br />
<br />
Whereas the sk pets &quot;a la natural&quot; have much better starting positions.<br />
<br />
I have extensively tested the various combinations etc, and I can say conclusively the sham pet will double the DPS of a sk pet when set up.<br />
<br />
In a dual when buffed etc, the sham pet will kill the sk pet with about a 30% loss in hit points.<br />
<br />
Importantly, when tanking mobs, the sham pet has about 3 - 4 times the tanking ability of a sk pet.<br />
<br />
Off the shelf sham pets have very low ac, but buff them a bit and they really do get a lot tougher.<br />
<br />
Rowf! rowf rowf!<br />

Retired and mouldering.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You mean, if you buff up one of them without buffing the other, the buffed will win?<br />
<br />
/gasp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lejina Bloodbath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The SK pet has more hp than the shaman pet.<br />
<br />
The shaman pet has roughly the same damage output when using no weapons than the SK pet. Being higher lvl, the shaman pet connect its hits more often and also hits slightly harder.<br />
<br />
So, if the shaman pet isnt using weapons, the SK pet will win in a duel.<br />
<br />
However, if you give 2 weapons to the shaman pet, thus enabling dual weild for this one, the shaman pet will destroy the SK pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Warmonster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I use my pet all the time just because it can keep a mob busy for a few seconds, while I do other stuff.<br />
<br />
I was recently LFA in Everfrost and decided to visit the ice giants while waiting on a LDoN.  <br />
<br />
I let pet solo all 3 mobs, one at a time.  No rest in between kills.  I did snare mob at 20% so pet didn't have to chase them to Halas.<br />
<br />
He owned them easily and fairly quickly.  <br />
<br />
I was surprised at how quickly he killed them. <br />
<br />
I know ice giants are green weenys, but I remeber them killing me at level 50, if I got sloppy.<br />
<br />
If you don't use a pet, you might wanna think about starting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Makkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">its the same as 49 nec pet..the one people were in awe of in lguk because it was SOLOING BOK GHOUL KNIGHTS hehe<br />
<br />
its not a bad pet at all really. though sk really need their own class pet, bumped up to level 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mahsk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I did not know that about needing to give shm pets weapons to dual wield.. Will try it out thanks :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mahsk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Added 2 rusty scimitars to the mix and shm pet came out on top by 50% Can't believe I have been gimping my shaman pet all this time :( Figured it was automatic like SK pets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Oagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I knew the SK pet would beat the shaman pet straight up.  I didn't know about the duel weld deal on shaman dog dog, though.  I usually give my first weapons to skinny.  I'm going to start giving them to the dog, instead.<br />
<br />
Inner Acrylia has some decent trash weapons that drop off regular mobs when mage weapons aren't available (crude filth or something) and I usually hang on to them, instead of selling to the vendor.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grarg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Summaries:<br />
<br />
The thing to remember bout the shaman pet is it does not dual wield, and has VERY LOW starting stats.<br />
<br />
Therefore weapons and stat buffs make a lot of difference, especially Agi, AC, Strength and haste.<br />
<br />
Even with equiivelent buffs the SK pet is no where near as empowered by sham buffs as the dogdog.<br />
<br />
The sham max level pet WILL kill a max level sk pet with only about a 30% loss in hit points if both pets are buffed the same and the sham pet has weapons.<br />
<br />
I have tested this extensively.<br />
<br />
With FA, without FA, hasted, with mage toys etc.<br />
<br />
Logged the pets extensively whilst in combat and can say conclusively that the sham pet has substanstially more hit points than the sk pet.<br />
<br />
I can send my dogdog against a slowed wurmy thing in POV and keep it alive with Quiescense.<br />
<br />
The SK pet lasts about 20 seconds.<br />
<br />
Anyway, i have retired my chars about a month ago, good luck to you all 8)<br />

Rowf! rowf rowf!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>nezzka is bad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It would be good if they bumped the level of the sk pet to 58 or 60, kept the damage the same and added a little more life. This way it would hit the mobs more and not get owned by ripostes, but keep it pretty balanced.</div></div><hr />

Oh my!  BTw a quick easy place to farm Shaman weapons is Splitpaw.  There are whips there that proc a stun or a snare (can't remember) and they make excellent pet weapons past the 55 shaman pet.  Also I hope with your shaman you are always casting haste AND pet haste.  The shaman pet haste seems to have more effects than just haste.  Usually I HoS, Primal, Regen, Haste, Pet haste and 2 weapons my shammy pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>nnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Whether the SK pet is better or worse than the Shaman pet, I think this does prove that it is well worth it to use our SK pets. They do make pulling a little harder without Pet Hold, but I've found them to be well worth it for pure DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Well, since this got bumped anyway....<br />

Can you tell me the name of the actual spell? I recently got a friend's 65 shammy to 2box (when he's not online), and was looking for this pet haste, and can't find it. Do you know the exact name and lvl of the spell? Thx.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">shaman pet haste = spirit quickening</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Oagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I grab whips off the gobs going into droga to give the doggie, if I didn't pick up some mage weps.  Bottom line, Shaman/SK pets with mage weps and buffed can handle some decent mobs.  I've been able to VP the Torment mobs and sic the pets on em, and they hold just fine(Virtue/STA/Focus/Daiku/Haste).</div></div><hr />
