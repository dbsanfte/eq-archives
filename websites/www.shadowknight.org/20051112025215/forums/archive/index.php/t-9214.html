I mean..beside the effect that mob can't hit me and others beating on it to get attention, because that changes aggrolist of course.<br />
<br />
I ask cause i think about to aggro AoW and keep him in corner by MT. Opening the aggroing in Arena with Darkness, Spear or Disease cloud and running to corner maybe cast 2nd aggrospell and then Harmshield.<br />
I know a Ranger would do better with Disc but his DPS is much higher then mine, so if i die it's no big loss.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dzenith</div><div class="date">12-12-2002, 06:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">HS gives you the lowest possible agro you can have on a mob and still have agro(probably an agro rating of 1) during the time it is up, then returns you right back to where you were on the hate list.  Proximity agro is larger than this.  So if you are HS'd,  AoW will agro on the nearest person he sees if someone is in his agro range.  If nobody is near the corner you want to move him to you could HS move him there, however this is very inefficient as you cannot position your guild first.  WSing gives the added advantage that you can try to slow the mob while the ranger is doing it.  Anyone that casts anything on the mob while you are HS'd will get automatic agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rozzor</div><div class="date">12-12-2002, 06:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">K, lets assume the MT is in corner waiting and starts the beating as soon as AoW is coming close. No one heals me, no one does anything at all then just start CH on MT. Would that work?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dzenith</div><div class="date">12-12-2002, 06:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Umm, what exactly do you want to do?<br />
<br />
Just pull with HS so you live through the pull?  Sure, pull with HS. Pull with a spell that doesn't have high agro(or even better an arrow) so that when the MT agroes with a range weapon he will have more agro than you do when HS fades.  <br />
<br />
Or are you trying to do something else here ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Graznoth</div><div class="date">12-12-2002, 06:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What we usually is do I pull with HS, WS ranger peels and positions while MT gets agro. I think Ive only seen the pre-tank ranger die once in the dozens of aow's we've killed, MT should be able to pull agro off before disc fades.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rozzor</div><div class="date">12-12-2002, 06:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No..the pull is without HS, i can run from him i think..he is not the fastest guy i met in EQ and with bobbing corpse i can skip the lower part of the ramp and gain some nanoseconds to cast another aggrospell when i am in corner, then i want to cast HS.<br />
<br />
The main problem is to make sure that clerics have that special moment to get the CH running and MT is maybe not the first one who gets the beating but me and he has that second to begin beating on AoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dzenith</div><div class="date">12-12-2002, 07:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As soon as the warrior attacks(or even gets in agro range), AoW will attack him.  There is no way to HS tank a mob for any amount of time now if other people are around you.  Use a ranger to WS )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rozzor</div><div class="date">12-12-2002, 07:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That is my question..Will AoW really attack the War instantly in sight or will he first try to stomp me into lovely Kael grounds cause i dare to casted some spells on him?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Graznoth</div><div class="date">12-12-2002, 07:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">With HS, he will instantly agro on anyone else thats within agro range, plain and simple.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wilambik</div><div class="date">12-12-2002, 04:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Harmshield drops you to the bottom of your groups aggro list, however you will still maintain aggro.<br />
<br />
Cleric Divine Aura and CH.  It's very easy for a cleric to take aggro using CH.  Cleric get aggro and then casts DIVA.  As long as DIVA is up, the mobs would rather go after anyone else in the group and the cleric is now dropped to the bottom of the aggro list.<br />
<br />
18 seconds later, DIVA fades...Cleric sits down to med...BAM!  Sitting aggro jams the cleric right back to the top of the list and the mobs go right after the cleric.<br />
<br />
So that's how HS works.  You get dropped to the bottom of the list, but your actual number of aggro points are NOT reset.  It's almost as though the mob temporarily forgot you even existed.  <br />
<br />
However IF you have far more aggro points than, say a warrior taunting and EBing, when HS fades and you attack the mob, you will have &quot;reminded&quot; the mob how much it hates you and the mob WILL turn on you. <br />
<br />
Normally speaking, a tank can over-ride the aggro difference in 18 seconds...</div></div><hr />

When HS goes on you dont lose aggro....its after the first time the mob tries to hit you and sees your invulnerable that he switches targets.  Works same way for ppl with invulnerable type discs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leafweir</div><div class="date">12-15-2002, 08:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually he won't charge the first person he sees unless they're sitting or something. Usually if you pull and are the only thing on the aggro list and then Harm Shield the mob will stay on you until someone does something to it. Just standing there generally isn't good enough, sitting is however.</div></div><hr />
