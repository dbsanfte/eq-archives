<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ourok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">when is there damage caps? im tired of hitting horrible... i use a BBS and im level 60... well i just hit 60 last night anyways, the supposed &quot;hell level&quot; bleh and at my level a pally did my max damage with a 1hs... and i have max str... and most of the time max dex with either a bst/shammy in grp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kelv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">BBS?<br />
<br />
As in the old time befallen 2h sword?<br />
<br />
If that is what you are using, the answer to you is, yes, you have a damage cap, because your weapon sucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>ourok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">black bastardsword-- hedge event in PoN... supposedly best droppable SK 2hs, dont change the subject to my sword, plz answer what i asked</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Francosis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">As far as I know the only damage cap that exists ends at level 20.  After that it is all based upon your STR, Attack, Dmg, Dly, etc...<br />
<br />
<br />
If the Pally was doing as much damage as you with a 1 Hander it may be that the individual has a similar weapon in 1 hand form...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>ourok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">longblade of vitality-- and im wondering if the skill caps affect it, because they go up after 60, but guess ill have to find it out for myself, but if anyone has any more info im all ears</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">yeah, what your skill at has a lot to do with it. If your 2HS skill is still low, you'll do crap damage until its up, if it's not low, you might have just had a bad run, been up against mobs that were a bit higher than you, or your ATK might be lower than it should be. Just work on getting your weapon skills up and don't worry about it too much, SK's aren't a DPS class, just make sure you do your job and do it well, no one will ever care how much damage you hit for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>ourok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">ah yes i do my job well, i was recently havin probs with keepin aggro... which is like erectile dysfunction for us SKs LOL... anyways, if i pull with 2 snares, i can keep aggro without a taunt<br />
<br />
now getting back to the thread, i know im not dps, but really the grp can use all the help it can get; my atk is around 1200; and i think ill be fine and the cap i had was just that my skills were capped /nod an im guessin when they go up ill hit for more considering it raises my atk the more the skill is, thx for the help<br />
<br />
and no, my BBS isnt crap &gt;:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Francosis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Your weapon skills (1HS and 2HS) post-level 50 will cap at 225.  Prior to level 50 the cap is 200.  I don't believe they go any higher than that (call me out if I'm wrong.)  <br />
<br />
<br />
Naelyan is right though.  We are just there to take a beating.  All of that &quot;who can hit for the highest&quot; BS is just eye-candy.  Nice to see but it doesn't really mean anything to an SK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>ourok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">yes i love high numbers... i dont know who doesnt.. im not sure if its 225 or 235... guess i gotta look at the skill caps thread again /nod</div></div><hr />
