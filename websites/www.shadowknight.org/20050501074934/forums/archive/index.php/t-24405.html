<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shizzel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering If anyone could post some good places to solo from 66-70?<br />
I haven't played since PoP and Don't know much about the new Expansions. Thx for any info</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>iggnatius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">PoFire, any mob in first castle or 2nd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yer pretty mean iggnatius!<br />
<br />
We need more information about your character as far as gear goes.  Some can solo a lot more then others :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Astrakan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think soloing from 66-70 would be far too painful to even contemplate.<br />
<br />
In other words, if you're extremely efficient, you may be level 70 sometime next year soloing.<br />
<br />
With that said, Murks in NC/WoS can be kited.  The Murks in WoS, in cave left from zone-in, are undead.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gobb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">PoFire really is the place to get XP as Iggy says.  Tables area is big and open.  Mobs don't summon.  Everything is a single pull. If you have the mana and mana regen for it, you can do better there than anywhere else solo.  Might give Stillmoon a shot as well if you are good at single pulling it.<br />
<br />
That said, soloing is a horrible and painful way to level.  If you can get a group, do so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shizzel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ya, sorry for lack of info. Im 65 8600 hp 2200 ac, havent updated my Magelo. 700 aas. How fast is exp in DoN? Just trying to figure out the best, fastest, easiest way to 70. All my friends quit when wow came out so It might be tough finding a group. thx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">DoN is hawt aa exp id assume is great reg exp.<br />
<br />
Fire is great grouped...much hate doing that solo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rhumba_Kween</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'd definitely reccomend DoN if you want to do it solo. Entrance to the non instanced StillMoon might be a great place to start. Amazes me how easy the mobs are for how good the xp is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Eggborn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Greig's End, 3% or so AA per kill. Personally I think this is the best for down time vs xp.  DoN (Stillmoon and I think, Tirran's Delve if you don't mind a few FD's here and there.. good xp) and Fire are great zones, but for me , they drain my mana faster and I have down time.  I don't seem to get down time in Griegs End so much.<br />

Go as deep as you can.  The named will keep you in tribute items, and the spell components will keep you in small cash in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
Harbringers Spire, less xp, but good stuff to farm if you are needing some things.  You can kite in the hallways, Two things spawn there, so watch for that second mob to get ya.  Don't mess with the doggy names, they cast a nasty dot that lasts an hour, but you wont with it.<br />
<br />
Otherwise see above posts, they are all good too.<br />
You can probably kite some in KT too.  The GoD tipt trial is very good xp.  If you have a group that takes the full 6 hours to do it, you end up with a good bit of xp... but well that is group.<br />
<br />
I never realy solo'd real xp, just AA's.  Fire is good for a smal group or solo for real xp.  I like the Ruined City of Dranik the best for group or less real xp.  Find the &quot;Bowlord&quot; Camp.  It's a bitch to get to, but simple camp, no trains, steady xp once you get started.  I level'd quite a few friends from 66 to 70 there.  It felt about a million times faster than WoS.  Don't let anyone leave once you get a group there haha.<br />
<br />
Muramite Proving Grounds.  If you aren't the most equipped person, pull the Blind/Task camp.. Extremely easy.  Someone should be able to show you how.</div></div><hr />
