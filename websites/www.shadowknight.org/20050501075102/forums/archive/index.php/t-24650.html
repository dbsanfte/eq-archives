<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kilkulan Darkwarrior</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">hey guys, was wondering if there was any SK soloable DoN missions after the indifferent mark (check magelo for referance)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shadowsoal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">tier 1 and tier 2 tasks are soloable for the most part, the progression tasks, but you can only do those 1x other then that... I can solo guards...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kroolhand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Are you asking about the faction quests that are given out at the wayfarer's camp? If that is the case, I believe there aren't any that you can do after reaching indifferent.  But thats ok, because at indif, you are eligible to begin your progression with the faction of your choice via solo'able tasks.<br />
<br />
I think your asking about the Way-camp ones like collect 10 frothing drake bloods etc. To my knowledge these are just ways to get extra faction hits of your choice while you work up to indif......those particular npc's quit offering quests after indif for me.</div></div><hr />
