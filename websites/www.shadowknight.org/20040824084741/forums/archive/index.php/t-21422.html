<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dkhar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Every Sunday is now a holiday. Please join me in the celebrations. How do I celebrate ? And what holiday is it you ask ? Well, here at SK.Org I have been pushed to the limits of foreign tolerance. I also play Utopia and the anti-american hate flows freely there as well. Pretty much, anywhere you go you are faced with having to defend your countries good name and standing against some asshat retard who watches the news and generalizes all Americans. And then they turn around and send their kids here or come here themselves to eat our food, drink our beer, go to our colleges and take our jobs. Well, frankly I am sick of these foreign bastards. So for now on, every Sunday, on your way to church, hunt down a foreign person and punch them in the face. This is great! I think within a matter of months the word will spread and they will start going home, or at least giving Americans a day of rest against their traitorous words since they will be cowering in fear in their houses.<br />
<br />
So please, join me in the festivities every Sunday and punch a foreign asshat in the face!<br />

Check out Stone Brewery sometime.  Or Anchor Brewery, or even Sierra Nevada.  All of those are fine breweries, right here in the US pacific coast.  Well...stone is mostly ales, the only beer they have is a smoked porter, but they are still one of the best breweries in the world (the brews speak for themselves).</div></div><hr />

You remembered wrong. Israel didn't take any land from the Palestinians. The Palestinians, along with many other Arab nations, made war with Israel. Israel acquired the land legally because they won the war. The Palestinians are lucky they have any land at all. And why did the Palestinians and Arabs go to war with Israel? Simply because they hate Jews.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, do your Israeli history over from 1947.  The Jews had to fight to get what portion of Palestine that they got to form Israel.  Israel grew with a couple of short wars provoked by their Arab neighbors.<br />
<br />
You're right, though, the Palestinians are lucky to have any kind of territory or autonomy.  And the extremists among them still would rather kill Israelis.  I'm old enough to remember the PLO and Yasser Arafat as it's leader.  The PLO and terrorism are linked in my mind.  Culminating in Munich at the 1972 Olympics.  I've never truly believed that Arafat was really all that interested in a peaceful compromise.  He always struck me as wanting it all and nothing else would suffice.</div></div><hr />

They may be, but more land is not an answer to &quot;just trying to survive&quot;..that requires an even larger and more powerful military to achieve.  If so, then they need their tactics worked on a bit.</div></div><hr />

Actually prior to WWII Isreal didn't exist. The country was created by the western alies at the end of the war to give the Jewish people their own homeland. While the reason for the location may have been passed off as historical, (the last time there was a Jewish nation in the region was in biblical times) it was far more likely to be a combination of 'not in my back yard' and wanting to have a stratigic ally in the area.<br />
<br />
The powers at the time either felt guilty, or wanted to appear that they did, for ignoring Hitler's crimes against the Jews until they were directly threatened themselves, but not enough to offer a slice of their own territory for it. Instead they carved out a chunk of the middle east, and the deposed people have been fighting against it since.<br />
<br />
The political fallout that admitting that Isreal was a mistake (in exicution, not principal) combined with the ever increasing importance of their stratigic position will only continue to escalate the tension in the middle east with no easy fix in sight.</div></div><hr />

There were Jews and Arabs living side by side in the area that is now Israel long before the state of Israel was created. And once that state was created, the Arabs were not &quot;deposed.&quot; The area of Palestine was under British control. After World War II, the British gave up the land and partitioned the area into Arab and Jewish states, a completely fair arrangement considering that both Arabs and Jews lived there. But the Arabs would not allow that since they have nothing but hatred for Jews and declared war on the new Jewish state.<br />
<br />
Israel is not a mistake and never was a mistake. And Israel has every right to establish buffer zones between themselves and those who wish to destroy them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Luxem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I say go even farther back than that... it was Israel LONG before it was ever Palestine (which was a Roman state BTW.) So if anyone took the land from anyone, its the Jewish peeps takin it back after a few thousand years. <br />
  Seriously though, the Jews fought for their land, and won, and let the arab peoples continue to live there after their victory.<br />
 They could have exiled all the arabs...</div></div><hr />

<br />
EDIT - More rambling:  The lang given to Israel was unwanted land.  Salt flats and places wherre nothing would grow.  They worked thier asses off, cultivated it cleared it cleaned it and made it work.  By the principles of capitalism and commerce used by the West, see the writings of John Locke, a thing belongs to whomsoever puts forth the effort equivalent to the value of a thing.  Israel has done that.  It's hypocritical to have them give up the land, if Palestine is to exist, they'll need a different parcel of land.  Also note that there are a number of cultures, in that area of the world alone, that used to have countries, Roman Provinces, etc. that no longer do (Assyrians (totally different than Syrians btw) Kurds, etc.)  <br />

Yes, I know that the thread was tongue in cheek.  Personally, I happen to agree a bit with Grulknar's point.  If they can't be bothered to nut up and assimilate into the culture, they shouldn't be here.  If they don't like it, then they need to be persuaded to make the choice, assimilate or get the hell out.</div></div><hr />

It means we will be economic friends, like we are with china.  I mean hey-- china's pretty evil...  but we trade with them and call them our favored nation-friend and stuff.  Do we take china to the waffle house?  the cineplex?  the drive-in movie for some heavy petting?  NOPE!  but we do get along with them in an economic sense.</div></div><hr />

Weak. How many times is this now that someone has retaliated with your momma or your wife shit ? I feel like I'm stuck in the 80's when that shit was cool. Anyway, it's not like I can really be insulted by a man who's cock don't drop past his balls anyway. And yes, your sister let the secret out.</div></div><hr />
