<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Drogalog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i luv my SK troll , there is just something about being a big ugly nasty mean , taking no crap from anyone , laying towns to waste troll. <br />
<br />
but as im getting to level 30 im starting to notice my deficancy in the int deparment. im breezing though mana really fast with only 71 int . Should i have gone with a DE ? ive heard that the max a Troll is going to get is 125 int without getting truly uber items. in all honesty he is a alt , my main alt , but a alt none the less. so if it comes down to a item for 10k then im probly going to buy something on my main. so i dont forsee droping 10k on anything anytime soon</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Bigger mana pool is no reason to be a lesser race.<br />
<br />
Sounds like you didn't put enough into INT starting out. It'll be most noticable right as you get your new spells. But you can always get decent INT items cheap (MoSS, sentient armor) and +mana items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Trysbrina67</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">at your current level its ok.  yeah spells drain you more than DEs, Humans or Erudites but you have damn nice stamina and strength.  later on if you play the SK that much you will notice everyones stats are pretty much the same.  just for the mean time try to get at least 90 to 100 int.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Drogalog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">right on , i mean so far the only real spell i almost always use is the snare line . the rest are just kinda nice to have . the lifetap is sweet ofcourse ;)<br />
<br />
well right on , is there any nice int items then ? perhaps no drop in ME  or something that my 54 shaman can camp for him ?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Pheargore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">With STR/STA &amp; regen you can Tank better than other races. Into your higher 40's chain casting Shield Skin as needed. (grab a RUNE Procing Sword as well for more XP per downtime).<br />
<br />
Tanked Dark Blues in KC the other day too just to see if I could. (Self buffed)  <br />
<br />
82 INT Nekkid is what Pheargore has. Been up to 123 INT and He is back down to 104 because INT doesn't matter to me as much as MANA Regen, AC and HP. 1486 MANA versus 1600-1700 Mana is about 2 Invoke Fears. So Get BE Gaunts and BE Boots for when you are LOW on Mana, or you think you will need more mana for the entire fight.<br />
<br />
Later on you will get KEI all the time and be tanking mobs in a group where you don't use as much mana (mainly to pull or kep aggro) so really if My INT never breaks 125 I feel no loss at this point. Maybe later I will change my view since I have 5 levels and 300 AA to go before PoP.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps Brudda!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shadow1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I do not think that you picked the wrong race my DE has no str/sta but my int is high. But now I wish I had regen and str so that i can hit harder hehe. all in all trolls are a very good race to have as an SK. Most troll SK i see now a days are all lvl 60 if that makes you feel better :D and you can always buy stuff to help out your low stats so dont worry</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Drakonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Someone once told me trolls are the best all round race to play warrior or SK.  Mostly cause of the regen and high str/sta.  Stats arent too hard to get up once you get higher up.  The ogre &quot;non stun from front&quot; bonus apparently dosent mean much since most high end mobs can still stun you with a bash from the front (I've never played an ogre at the high end, but i've been told this).<br />
<br />
I'm a Dark elf... we have very low starting stats apart from int, generally very bad melee stats.  But now fully geared I reach this unbuffed:<br />
<br />
162str<br />
182sta<br />
113agi<br />
151dex<br />
166int<br />
<br />
Dont have a primal yet but I do have a ST key so I'll get one at some point, that generally solves most melee stat problems.  Int, once you have KEI on you at the high end of the game it's not greatly important how much int you have since the mana regen makes up for it, and our spells are fairly low cost anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Manslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Raid buffed all physical stats 255 with avatar, but only 235 Int.  A larger mana pool would be nice so I don't have to ninja the pez from the clerics heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>nnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">at 30 your character is still growing so the mana drain is normal. spells are still highly unefficient at that level too. <br />
<br />
if anything, your race sort of dictates your role. trolls are a little more prone to being tanking SKs in a group than solo SKs. <br />
<br />
fact is you need mana to solo. you will get it, it just might take you a few more levels and items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Attyla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Nod, lvl 30 has a lot of spells that you will end up using alot for some time to come.  Initially they are pretty mana hungry.<br />
<br />
Some tips would be to pick up some int gear to increase your base mana pool.  In groups, you'll likely have some form of mana regen (which is far more important than base int).  If you are fear kiting I would suggest items that increase your pool alot (either int or raw mana).  I keep 3-4 items on hand to increase my mana pool when soloing, sacrificing AC in the process.  Usually on the jewelry/low AC slots.<br />
<br />
I would suggest you start saving soon for some BE gauntlets.  They are typically very cheap and for a troll are excellent.  I still use them when soloing, to keep my mana usage down when fear kiting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Countic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">As everyone else is stating, starting stats aren't all that important.  What matters is the extra abilities.  Large races get slam, certain races get non-frontal stun, regen, better vision, and the ability to hide.  These abilities are what matters because no other race can pick these up-they are very race specific.  Pick one that you like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Paynreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Whoever told you high-end mobs can stun ogres with bash was WRONG. I ***CANNOT*** be stunned from the front. I dont care if its a LoIO goblin, or the Avatar of War.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Lizarde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">There are player-made earrings that have no AC, but +65 HP and +65 mana, and earrings that have 2 AC, +35 HP and +25 HP.  Fill those slots and you've got an additional 115 mana, and some extra HP to boot.<br />
<br />
Not cheap though, since they can cost a bit for players to make.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Groobash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I did not put any points into INT at creation. <br />
<br />
It really doesn't matter much. The only difference is you med more often while soloing, but for shorter durations...until you start raiding long fights with AEing mobs and no hope of getting heals from clerics. Even then I rarely go OOM. Don't sweat it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Razaduuul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">yeah int doesn't make you regen mana any faster so it wont really make you more effective, I think at best it lowers fizzle rates by a small margin.<br />
<br />
I have about 90int, maybe less and I rarely run out of mana, because I tend to be very conservative with my mana. If you find yourself running out of mana try using clinging darkness instead of engulf, don't use heat blood or atk/ac taps, I rarely even use siphon str anymore, doesn't make much difference really, but overall you can cut down mana use to just clinging dark +  fear and still kill very well.<br />
<br />
you may not run out as fast as a DE but you also wait longer to regen to full.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Manslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Manapool does matter eventually but its not until much, much later in your characters life.  Against a raid level mob you use alot of lifetaps or undead nukes to increase your DPS.  Over the course of a long fight your manapool is going to matter, since you will be spending mana faster than you are regenerating it.  Unless you steal pez from your clerics/wizards;)  So against these raid mobs more mana = more damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Xanyia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">If you do big AE mobs you will eventually run very low on mana lifetapping here and there to keep up with AE and/or rampages/ripostes, even if you are wearing a fungi and like me reach 190+ int and have KEI.<br />
<br />
5-10 even 15 minute fights aren't that uncommon later on, and sometimes I have to make sure I slow down with the lifetap even if I love doing more damage so I can have enough mana at the end when shit is more likely to hit the fan. <br />
<br />
When the mob hits 20% I want to have still at least 40% mana (a couple of  death peace and a lifetap or two just in case the mob turns on me).<br />
<br />
My big Troll friend probably will have to rely more heavily on the healer in the group but since all clerics are in rotation for the MA/SA and the shamen are possibly dead by slowing while the druids manage to get themself killed by overnuking, sometimes there is no healer in your group....<br />
<br />
That is when I watch death slowly creeping on the monks/rogues/warriors/OOM SK their life gets lower and lower... the druid is dead.. come 40% WHACK!!!  the mob turns on them and quads them for ungodly amounts of damage.  Splat.<br />
<br />
Other than that a big mana pool means a lot of downtime. so I got as smart about conserving mana as any Ogre would be. No one likes to sit around and med. But if it's an emergency and I need it my mana is there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Countic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Aye, Ogres canNOT be stunned from the front by melee no matter what mob you fight.  They can be stunned from the back (dont know about the sides) and they can be stunned by spells, thats it.</div></div><hr />
