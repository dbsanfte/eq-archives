<br />
Questions I have are:  what is best place to pull the fake RZ...<br />
<br />
Also what to do with adds on real RZ and best corner to fight in?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>tanadil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ummm,<br />
<br />
No idea what is best, but I can tell you what worked for my guild.<br />
<br />
Fake RZ - left hand corner as you come through the door from fighting tallon and vallon in the corridor.<br />
Adds a plenty unless you got the pull timing down right. <br />
<br />
RZTW - Stick him in near left hand corner of the pit as you approach it from Zone In.<br />
<br />
As for adds on RZTW - combination of snares, and run for your life type kiting. We found Sk's, Monks and Necros the best. Can FD off the aggro then stand and get it back again. Ping ponging the adds back and forth down the pit. I would have a kite team of at least 6. more is better. If those adds get to the heal chain its game over.<br />
<br />
In truth through, it is a all hands to the pumps, everyone just do their bit type event. Unless you have lots of high geared folks who know the script well, the chances are the win will be messy. But fuck it, a win is a win and his flaming sword is worth the chaos just to see.<br />
<br />
Took my guild 6 attempts (although the script was bugged for 3 of those). Its not an easy encounter for those coming to it for the first time.<br />
<br />
Last point, it might help. If you have lots of people that have never been into Tactics before, then I suggest showing them the sights before you start the scrpit. Where the pit is, how to get down to it, where RZ will be pulled too, where the pig pen is to get some charmed pets for the main fight, where the zone out is in the pit etc.. etc...<br />
Max damage, a solid heal chain, a solid tank, MGB Heal over times, and max range. Kill him quick then adds will be less/ easier to deal with.<br />
<br />
Best way though is to try and if you fail then learn specifically which way is best for your guild. and if its a pick up raid....... then best of luck:P<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ravenar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for the useful replies....<br />

<br />
Here is an update on how we did:<br />
<br />
Fake RZ, I pulled down hallway that TZ spawns in after clearing adds.  This worked well as by the times his adds got to him us we were almost done with him.. He poofed at 55% and from there we all took are mass TL out to zone out, zoned in, summoned the dead bodies, and buffed.<br />
<br />
We got into pit with 6 mins to spare on real RZ.  chanter team was already down in pit with pets.  Our first issue I here was that we used SE corner and not SW corner.  We also did not have a lot of rangers and Druids so some of us SKS snare kited.  this worked fine until the mob decided it did not like being damaged and starting summoning.  It was over pretty soon after our snare team fell.  Also our DPS was a bit low.  But hey, getting him down to 23% on first atempt was not too bad I guess.  Only problem is we just cant get that final push over and was hoping womeone here had useful insight on adds or secrets to keep or DPS people safer.<br />
<br />
I know the CH chain is solid, but I wil hav eto check on the MGB HoTs.  Thanks for the suggestion. :)</div></div><hr />

Its all about kiting...  and yeah, the trick is to run faster then the mobs while maintaining aggro on them - WITHOUT DAMAGING THEM. This goes for kiting ANY summoning mob.  While your outside from TL, you might want to MGB an SOE.  That should get you over the hump.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Kite situations too often have 4 people aggroing the same 2 or 3 mobs and running them around unless you plan it out.<br />
<br />
Health of Target's Target is a huge help, letting kiters see which mobs are aggro on kiters already, and which are aggro towards the raid and healers...<br />
<br />
Another thing to do, which sounds remedial but can be really important...decide on a kite direction with the other kiters ahead of time...clockwise or counter...2 kiters on opposite routes can train each other fairly easily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Xanathol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you raid decently ( aka don't have mass dumbass deaths ), after TZ &amp; VZ are done, setup in corner just pass the door while a couple of teams clear out the mobs from just outside the other door. Pull Fake RZ, burn him. As long as you don't have to stop to tell everyone what to do or to res and you can keep moving, you don't have to worry bout many adds on Fake RZ.<br />
<br />
Once he's down, clear out whatever adds you did get and lev down to the pit's rim; fuck the TL. If you want to TL someone, only do your kite team, and have a bard with them. Get pets fast, pull RZ and tank in a corner away from pit zoneout; it doesn't matter which one. On pull, send in kiters in pairs with a fresh selos. They run in, aggro the crap, run it around away from raid. As selos starts to wear, send in next set of kiters and have previous ones zone out. RZ should be dead by now and kiters should zone the adds ( use HS / DA to let em bang on ya by zoneout a lil ).<br />
<br />
This way, no one should die, adds should be at zoneout ( they will start to spread eventually, of course ) and you can hurry and get your hails and loot done. Of course, don't do this method with a raid that has ppl dying or can't grasp the concept of following instructions. You need a fast moving raid to do this, but it makes for a very clean &amp; easy kill - should take ya ~30 minutes, end to end, once you start moving.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Croix VorAbaddon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Here's the strat my alliance used:<br />
<br />
After Tallon, move raid into RZ's room, and spread out a bit along the back wall, leaving the corner closest to that door open. Position Paladins and chanters/bards at the closest door and near the other in case of adds. Just stun and mez.<br />
<br />
When RZ hits 60ish%, have a wizzie AE TL, but don't take it unless<br />
A) About to die<br />
B) He depops.<br />
<br />
Take the TL, you SHOULD be bound outside the Drunder stone. Just pop in, Lev down to the Southeast corner. Summon and rez/rebuff.<br />
<br />
Pull RZ. Have two or three Sk's/paladins ready. Have them aggro the adds when they pop, and train them to the corner North of the RZ fight. In that corner should be a stone, that normally takes you to Tranq if clicked. It will look exactly like the ZO stone. During the script, it pops you to RZ ((If still floating, in his chest, which is a tad frightenign at first)).<br />
<br />
Rinse and repeat the training while the raid burns RZ down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>nytemyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">and have previous ones zone out.<br />
<br />
<br />
If i'm not mistaken you can't use the pit zone out. Rz will just summon you if you try to click out.</div></div><hr />
