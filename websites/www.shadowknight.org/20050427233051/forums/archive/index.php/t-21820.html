<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Enivel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Im starting over because I feel that the stun thing is really annoying... I started to notice it in PoJ at 51... But don't know if I want to start over.. Are Ogre's in a way not as great... I have a DE and im not fizzling much at all.. When a Ogre would fizzle out its yinger.. Oh well I think Ill stick with the DE but any info would be great.</div></div><hr />

Put a gun up your ass, and pull the trigger. Repeat until dead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">please DO NOT make an Ogre. We have enough issues already with our &quot;reputation&quot; as not being that intelligent. We don't need someone coming along and everyone going...&quot;See, I told you Ogres were stupid&quot;.<br />

In regards to what I think your original question was (if I read between the lines of garbled ramble), the value of having a non-stun from melee (only from the front) toon is invaluable if you intend on tanking or even soloing your SK. The lack of INT can be addressed with the initial bonus points and adding INT items/ augements as you grow. <br />
<br />
With just over 200 INT I have rarely been in a spot where I was LOM before the rest of my group, and feel that 200 INT works for me.</div></div><hr />
