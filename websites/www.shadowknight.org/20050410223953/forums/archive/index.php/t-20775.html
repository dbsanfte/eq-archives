<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cantyanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Sorry if this is posted elsewhere, I searched and well, it came up with a lot of not what i was looking for ...<br />
<br />
Anyway, I make an assist button for the main tank ...<br />
<br />
/assist [tank]<br />
<br />
When i hit assist my attack automatically gets acctivated which can be a problem occasionally.  I was told there was a way to turn that off but now how.<br />
<br />
How do i make /assist [tank] command only target the mob and not activate attack?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">/assist off<br />
<br />
That will turn attack-on-assist off for good.</div></div><hr />

/assist off<br />
<br />
That will turn attack-on-assist off for good.  <br />
<br />
That only works about half the time for me...and I can't figure out why.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>kuruk_xev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You only type /assist off ONCE<br />
<br />
After that it attack stays off when you /assist MAIN-TANK. It works fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dakkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Check the keyboard settings under your options menu Keevel, and look to see if Autoattack's mapped to the same key as any other function.<br />
<br />
Not sure if this is what's causing a problem but it was a real pain for me when they helpfully ninja-mapped autoattack to a formerly innocuous key (used by players for a wide variety of other functions) in a patch a while ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Makkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">yea they moved it to q instead of a, was kind of annoying..i was too lazy to switch it back though<br />
<br />
/assist off is important, so you dont break mezzes and whatnot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>nimic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">For some reason when it was set to 'a' I used to attack quest mobs all the time.  I remember this being a common problem that led to the change to 'q'.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dirk92GTA</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Look in your EQCLIENT.INI file.<br />
<br />
There is a line that is set by default:<br />
AttackOnAssist=TRUE<br />
<br />
I changed mine to FALSE because I had the same problems you did :)  Now when I assist I no longer auto-attack:<br />
AttackOnAssist=FALSE</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have it only once in a hot botton for assisting<br />
It only works half the time.<br />
<br />
I'll try the ini file thing - I think that has been what I have been looking for.  I saw it once a long time ago but everytime I ask my pals in game they only know the /assist off or /autoattack off thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>strag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">if you type /assist off once then you will no longer attack on assist.  If you type it again, I believe it turns it back on...<br />
<br />
so get it out of the hotkey, or do the ini thing and get it out of the hot key.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Not once each time you assist, once ever.  Type it once and forget about it (or edit your ini as suggested).</div></div><hr />
