<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Akronis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm hoping I'll have a greatblade soon, once Bertoxx is kind enough to drop one, and have been giving some thought into what to aug it with. My magelo is up to date if for any reason you need to look at it. Our warriors are just starting to get equipped with time bps and darkblades of the warlord so they are turning into aggro machines. The guild as a whole is starting to generate a lot more aggro and I was thinking a little aggro boost from a Ykesha proc could help for tanking phase1-3, ldon, GoD, EP xp groups, etc. The only reason I guess I'd pass is if it gets resisted way too much to be useful, or if it would generate so much aggro that it would get me killed all the time on boss mobs. I did a search, but the only 2 relevant threads I found seemed to have turned into flame wars over l33t speak and unable to provide much useful information.<br />
<br />
Anyone have experience with this aug on time level raids that could offer advice, thoughts, ideas? I doubt I'll have a time 1h and shield for quite a while since RZ hasn't dropped a shield yet and most of our paladins have their sights set on Hopebringer... so I imagine once I get the greatblade it will be all I use for a while, and I don't really want to spoil it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't think you want to do this. IIRC, mobs 55 and above are immune to the stun portion but they still receive the (small) knockback from ykesha procs. The proc aggro/hate is less than Anger 3 for warriors, so for us that is equivalent to saying less than one cast of Terror of Thule.<br />
<br />
Sticking this onto a GoC would be sort of a waste, wouldn't you rather have a better dd augmnent or eventually a +4/5 damage augment on this? Especially with the Mental Horror/Black Shroud proc buffs and SA3, mediocre proc augments just get in the way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Uhh, Ykesha&gt;Anger<br />
<br />
I would grab a 150dd for it, throw Ykesha on your 1h, type 4 on a BoC type 8 on a Cudgel of Venomous Hatred, thats your best options for aggro, you'll be glad to have an aggro proc on your 1h later on.<br />
<br />
Damage augs are less of an upgrade than a 150 aug thanks to weapon affinity, they're also less of an aggro upgrade.<br />
<br />
Also, I really prefer Vanazir to GoC for a few reasons:<br />
1.  Better dps on boss fights which is where you can actually do damage.<br />
2.  Looks<br />
3.  Easier to get and in DKP guilds usually goes for less than a GoC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My mistake then, on anger 3 being more hate than yak...steelwarrior was the source on that...<br />
<br />
I'm using a Vanazir now myself, and the 150 poison dd augment is probably going onto it, although your setup with +5 dam and a Cleave bracer looks like a lot more fun, Brael.<br />
<br />
Do you self buff pestilence shock very often for aggro as well?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Dont have a symbol so I cant.  5 dmg aug on vanazir is really disappointing, the day after I got it I wished I hadn't looted it.<br />
<br />
Don't use Cleave bracer anymore, forgot to update bracer when I put my new legs in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ah, thats good to know about +dmg being disappointing...still must have been fun when Cleave hadn't been nerfed yet. Thanks for the reply Brael.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">+5 dmg should increase average non crticial hit by 15-20 depending on your atk... if we say 15, and you hit the mob on average once every 1.9 seconds (which should be about accurate considering double/triple attacks &amp; misses), this is about +7.9 DPS. a 150 DD going every 20 seconds is 7.5 DPS.<br />
<br />
alternatively, it should increase melee DPS by about 7%, so you can compare to what you do now.<br />
<br />
<br />
also... having the +dmg augment doesn't reduce your combat innate buff proc rate, which would be reduced by about 10% if you had an augment proc.<br />
<br />
for DPS, +dmg augments own</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Akronis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks. Doubt I will be seeing any +dmg augments any time soon, they drop from ldon raids probably? of which we have never done one. May be a while till I loot a 1h upgrade to the heavy bludgeoner, but for now I guess I can live with just a dd on a 2h for dps. I've just been kinda frustrated lately in places like PoE when I can't get aggro after first cast of fear/CD/miasmic spear and a lot of times I have trouble channeling that second cast through stuns and lose it.<br />
<br />
Brael your 3 reasons seem quite sound too. Not that I've seen parses but I'll believe you on the dps part, GoC really does look gimp compared to Vanazir, and Vanazir definitely has gone for cheaper. I guess I'll give it some thought, but since I'll be missing TT this weekend cuz of work I'm most likely going to jump on GoC if it happens to drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dakkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">All aggro is good, and proc aggro can be handy in some situations.<br />
<br />
But a stun/knockback proc on your main, my-precious weapon is risky as Dyrkk says.<br />
<br />
The issue isn't whether or not you'll kill yourself, but whether in a strictly run guild you'll pick up a hefty DKP fine and/or xloc if you get caught using even a small knockback proccer.<br />
<br />
Plus if you get a couple of early procs and are caught turning the wrong red con trash mob the same thing might happen.<br />
<br />
I remember in my guild MTing and offtanking used to be a knightmare of mobs jolting all over the place and whistling back past the MT's ears till the RL leaned heavily on all the people who thought their personal knockbacks wouldn't matter.<br />
<br />
But a neat proc weapon is good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>aress</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Originally posted by window <br />

<br />
Well, I would have thought that myself, and I am interested in what Brael has to reply to that.<br />
<br />
My opinion so far was:<br />
<br />
Ykesha on the one hander to improve aggro when tanking.<br />
Damage augment on the 2 hander to increase dps while leaving aggro as low as possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Akronis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Ok, another Ykesha question, since I just caved and got shield of strife (Bertoxx and Terris have both been very stingy for us, only 1 greatblade and 2 vanazir drops in total so far) and will probably get cudgel soon. Does it have a noticeable knockback that will become a pain in the ass on raids, in LDoNs, etc? One of our guild warriors has the sword from the Smith Rondo event in Ferubi and the knockback on that is just ridiculous. If it's anything like that I don't think I'd be interested in it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>UGLA</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I have a yak proc on my SeWS and i can't even tell it has a knock back effect if it really has one :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I am using the same setup as Ugla and it works well.  I have not pulled aggro off anyone yet on a boss fight with it, although I do wait a bit for the warrior to have solid aggro before I start swinging it.<br />
<br />
I have not seen a knockback on it.  If there is one it must be so small at to be unoticable</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The Yak knockback is &quot;1&quot;.<br />
<br />
Good discussion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Any estimation on the hate value of a Ykesha proc?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I dunno but with WA 5 I am pulling so much aggro that I dare not use it on boss fights.<br />
<br />
I just got a cudgel so I am going to Yak that like Brael suggested and I might take the yak off the sews.  then I would use the covh and with yak and shield for those rare occasions when I am actually asked to do raid tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">That's what I did yesterday.  I auged my CoVH with the type 8 yak proc from Guk.  It was just interesting that a warrior in my group was going for the Anger 3 aug proc at the same time.  Anger 3 is 600 hate, according to Lucy.</div></div><hr />
