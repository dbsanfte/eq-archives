<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wyrdlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know what AA I'm supposed to get, but I'm somewhere between a casual player and a heavy player so I don't earn AA that fast, and when I do I like to &quot;feel&quot; like I'm getting something for the time spent.<br />
<br />
<br />
What I'd like to do is rank the AA's not in terms of usefulness but in terms of fun value, and hanging out with lower level friend value.<br />
<br />
I use a 1hb/shield so the SoTK which I would have gotten originally no longer appeals to me, but I understand KA will work, confirmation?<br />
<br />
AA's I've got<br />
<br />
RS3/Regen3<br />
<br />
SCF3<br />
CA3<br />
ND3<br />
CS1<br />
CF1<br />
<br />
PE<br />
IHT<br />
<br />
LR1<br />
TOL1<br />
UHT3<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As you see, I'm trying to balance practical and useful with eye candy.  Obviously on the practical side I need to go CS3, LR5/ID5, PP5/PD3<br />
<br />
On the eye candy fun list though, what should I get when I want to work on a fun toy to slack off.<br />
<br />
TOL2/3 is tempting, largely because they are relatively cheap, and I use the Heavy Bludgeoner with it's lifetap.<br />
<br />
Steed is tempting too, mostly for running around.<br />
<br />
SA is one that I'm wishy washy on, I know it comes highly recommended but is SoC with SA3 really enough to make up for not using MC?  I've got low FT so those procs make a difference for me.<br />
<br />
What about KA or the new shield bash stun aa?<br />
<br />
Basically, I want to rank AA's in this order: FEELS fun OR Kills low blues faster in alts-groups<br />
<br />
If feels like my DPS options are pretty low since I use a one hander, so I was thinking more heal crits may be the next best thing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I like SCF3 as the first archetype AA's personally, but most prefer tanking AA's first.  SCF3 is easily our most versitile AA, though, and I like the idea of getting it early.  <br />
<br />
CA3 &gt; ND3 &gt; CS3 is a poor order for tanking AA's.  I'd go CS3 &gt; CA3 &gt; ND3 personally, but one could argue for CA &gt; CS too.  <br />
<br />
KA and SotK are 2h specific.<br />
<br />
ToL 3 is useful, looks good, and is rediculously cheap.<br />
<br />
SoC vs MC is situational, but with SA3 there are definately plenty of situations to use SoC.</div></div><hr />
