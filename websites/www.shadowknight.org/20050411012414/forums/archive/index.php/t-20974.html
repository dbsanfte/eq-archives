<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ammud</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">sorry if this is in the wrong spot for this question, let me begin by saying i have recently changed main classes from monk to sk, i understand and have done on many occasions the snare fd pulling,( lots easier i think) but have never seen pet pulling and never had a chance to see it done. whenever i'm pulling with my sk i always kill the pet so it doesn't aggro at the wrong time. can someone give me the basics of pet pulling and maybe when ity's better than the snare fd ?</div></div><hr />

It has been discussed before.  If you are not high enough level to have Pet Hold, then your pet will not survive pet pulling.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ammud</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">not looking for anything too specific here just a general how it works type thing having never seen it, and ya am 65 just not many aa</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>phlegyas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">FD and pet attack + pet back off.<br />
<br />
very easy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ashrai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There's about 10 threads on this in just the last few months. And no you don't need Pet Hold, I have been pet pulling for a long time and only recently got pet hold. You can do it, just need to pay attention, and warn your group that they're gonna get spammed. <br />
<br />
For details on how it works just scroll down a page or two and there's thread after thread on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ammud</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">thanks i'll have to try experimenting with it to get it down</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Amphitryon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">yea pet hold makes it a LOT easier but you can do it w/o it (just have to spam Pet back off a lot)<br />
<br />
get some mage goodies to help the pet live longer<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nemya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Occasionally I use this technique to pull a mob from the crowd.  I have used it a lot in Veksar, to break up the froggie camps in back, and in BoT.<br />
<br />
I send the pet in and then spam him to back off, till the mob is far enough away from the other mobs.  Then get a spear off on the mob.  Spear spells, will usually draw the attention off the pet to you, even if they are resisted.   If for some reason, the pet gets 2 mobs, FD, and let pet die.<br />
<br />
In BoT its essential to get the aggro off the pet or you will loose, the pet.  If you do loose the pet, hopefully the mob is far enough from the others, not to aggro them.<br />
<br />
Once you get back to camp, try to park the pet, if you have that aa.  He should not get aggro, but if you let him fight the mob that was pulled, he might and since he dont' have a lot of hps, will die.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It is also ver helpful to have the pet buffed before hand. I like to have my pet get Virtue and focus or whatever buffs might be available. <br />
<br />
His hps are really low so these buffs make a big difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>jyaik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Pet pulling takes MUCH less time than fd splitting IF the pet lives. Send in pet, he whacks mob, mob chases him back to you, other mobs dont add because your pet is green to them. Been doing this the last couple days in PoV outer, CoD, down in PoJ too, quite fun.<br />
<br />
I dont have the pet hold command tho so when the mob hits my pet, the pet turns and hits back. When spamming pet to back off, pet has to get out of melee range of mob and run back towards you, if it can't get out of melee range because it keeps getting hit and turning back to attack the mob, then the pet dies. If you have the pet hold command, which I don't, apparently the pet will not turn and hit back when hit by the mob so it should make it back to you faster.<br />
<br />
 All the pet needs to do is get the mob out of range of the adds and then you can hit it with darkness or whatever your favorite is to pick up the agro.<br />
<br />
My pets seem to die fairly frequently, hopefully the pet hold will lessen that. Don't forget sow/shrew. Haven't tried it on casters yet ; )</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>XebarisTP</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Tried to pet pull in Tak a few times, recently, with horrendous results. In the other themes I never have to fd first, but when trying in Tak, pet is likely to bring the whole room, or hesitate and get beat some more first, or outright ignore pet hold despite replying.<br />
<br />
I think fd'ing first helps, but it's a bother to manage, especially with the doors (hm.. is Goner back all the way yet?), and pet gets beat more than usual.<br />
<br />
1 mob is better than 5, though, I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Tak can be goofy at times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ashrai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Yea Tak's a pain- luckily that was where I pretty much started petpulling constantly and got used to it without pethold. Scout room (FD at door/entryway, pan camera out), back waay the hell up and send pet in on target. As soon as I see his health drop I /hold him, back off, and /follow me, while I start backing up. Biggest cause of trains out of rooms in Tak when petpulling is triggerhappy debuffers who cast on the mob while it's still in agro range of its friends. Still though there's times when Jabober seems like he's gotten a clean single then 30 seconds later a caster add comes crawling out of the room. <br />
<br />
Couple things about when it seems like he's ignored /pethold and back off: Jabober will stay there at the mob if he's in a casting animation, mage pet weapons contribute to this, and Maybe I'm just superstitious but... I don't bother giving him any if I'm pulling with him. Sometimes it just seems like he's stunned, and he's telling me he's on his way back but he's standing there getting pounded on. Jabober has a mind of his own sometimes, and at least once an adventure I lose him because he refuses to come back quick enough :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Okami</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I think fd'ing first helps, but it's a bother to manage<br />
<br />
Have to be FD for it to work. That way you are indiff. Otherwise, you and pet share the same faction and agro, and bring anything within agro range.<br />
<br />
With a monk partner, it works well in elementals too. While monk runs by the fd sk, pet attack and pet hold. Monk drops, then the one pet tagged makes a beeline to you away from his friends, so he can be tagged off.<br />
<br />
Too bad I just joined a guild that sees 0 value to sk's =|<br />
Pulling on raids is slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Klaaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">You don't actually have to FD, thoguh it can be incredibly useful.  Mages have the ability to pet pull just as well as SK's with the exception that they cannot feign if things go wrong.  As long as the pet is alive, you are fine without feign, but if the pet dies you get the aggro.  If this happens outside the aggro range of its friends you are fine, but if not they will all come after you as soon as your pet dies.<br />
<br />
If you want to play it safe, you can just feign before sending in the pet.  If you want to speed things up, just wait to feign if the whole room comes out to play.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Ephyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">quick question on pet pulling and coth....<br />
<br />
if i fd...pet attack...pet hold...and get cothed...<br />
<br />
will the pet run back to where i am cothed to? bringing the mob with him?<br />
<br />
will the pet get confused and die in place?<br />
<br />
since coth clears any aggro on me? does it clear aggro on my pet?<br />
<br />
will the pet disappear? will the pet come with me?<br />
<br />
im not an expert on coth....have only used it to get to certain raid spots when i did not yet have a pet up...so sorry if this seems like a dumb question to some of you...<br />
<br />
in any case...seems like there would be a bit of a timing question...since coth cast is 10 secs i think...but if you coordinated in right...could get coth to hit before pet dies i would think..<br />
<br />
thanks for the input if anyone has tried this...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Klaaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">CoTH is supposed to work just like Succor.  Prior to today's patch, any pet (including suspended pets) die when you get CoTH'd.  With the new changes that are supposed to let the pet zone with you, I am not sure how aggro will work.  <br />
<br />
My Alt is actually a mage, and there have been times when I have COTH'd people, and it has not fully cleared the hate list.  I have yet to figure out when it does, and when it doesn't, but it is somethign to be aware of.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">There is a range for CoH where it does not clear aggro; however, that said, I don't know what that range is offhand.  Originally, a CoH always cleared aggro but there were instances where say, clerics were getting beat on and they were then being CoH'd to clear aggro (say from a few feet away) -- so a change was made so that a CoH of a person fairly close to the mage prior to the casting of CoH would not have his/her aggro cleared.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Meriboh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I’ve never pet pulled before.<br />
I have a question though…<br />
If I snare the mob first then FD, send pet in and tell him to back off till the mob gets to where I am FD.<br />
I figure the pet would live longer by not being hit as much.<br />
<br />
Would that work, or am I overlooking something?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Elkar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">The problem with that is that you're snare will agro surrounding mobs, so you will have to stay FD until the others reset, by which time your pet will probably get eaten.<br />
<br />
Pet pulling works because the mobs around don't agro a green con.  YOU DO NOT HAVE TO FD TO PET PULL.  You do, however, have to be out of assist range, if not FD'd, which can be fairly large.  To make sure, I creep into the range that my pet will actually attack from (if you are too far away and give a pet attack command, the pet will ignore until in range)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Ravenar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">As far as Goner buffs, mine always has at least Virtue, singly cast inside by the cleric.  On the flip side, any time I can, Goner wears mage summoned plate armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Kruggan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I've never used FD when pet pulling - not in over 20 LDoN missions.  I use it all the time when 3 boxing LDoN.  I just buff the pet up with my shaman, send him in to the closest mob and immediately spam Pet Back Off until both of them are out of range of the mob's friends and then I just tag the mob with Spear of Decay to get him to follow me.  I love pet pulling and hope it takes a long time before they decide to 'fix' it, if ever. :)  It's so handy.  And really, in a lot of ways, I don't think it's really unbalancing, at least from an SK pet standpoint, since our pets really couldn't be used to pull anything too high in level - since the pet barely survives LDoN pulling as it is.  I'm guessing he might survive some Sol Ro or 'maybe' elemental pulling if he got lucky.  Just guessing.<br />
<br />
As a side note, I'm very pleased about the new pet-zoning code, as I can SoW the pet and grab a Virtue for him before entering missions now.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Elkar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Almost always works on casters.  I singled out the Firecaller (magician mob) in Vxed with skinny the other day, so situationally it works in some pretty tough content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Nemya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I tried to pet pull in SRT, its almost impossible.   Even with a virtue, pet gear, ect....   They stun the pet and kill him easily.   Even with a decent cleric you will have a tough time keeping the pet alive.<br />

Sill works on ldons, and thats fine by me.<br />
