Issues like this just add to the watering down of the game.  Shaman have the ability do reduce disease resists, if they're working with an SK, they should have it loaded.  <br />
<br />
While we're at it, should we just ask for the shaman to get a slow component on their malo line?  That way they only have to cast one spell... <br />
<br />
Obviously things are so different at the 65+ level that I just don't understand the issues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Elkar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It's not watering down.  There is just simple not enough spell gems and time to realistically ask a shaman to malo, slow, then disease debuff.  By time that's done, the mob is or is nearly dead.  In a raid situation, perhaps more emphasis could be put on the disease debuff by the player base, but that is usually only done on a disease slowable only mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>TelimTor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yup, I understand that one Elkar.  I just don't see the devs taking an issue like this seriously, as there's really nothing broken in this scenario.  Shaman DO have the ability to debuff disease resists.  <br />

Eating up an extra spell slot isn't going to happen for the SK and the SK alone.  No one else particularly misses it if disease isn't debuffed.

Agreed on your point about 10 spell slots, just a different form but the result is the same, game gets easier.  Just being greedy there.  <br />
<br />
Also agreed that when compared to other hybrids, it doesn't seem fair that the resist we need the most is left off the main debuff line of the core debuffer.  But again, from my playstyle, it's not a huge deal at all, but I can sympathize with those who aren't in my situation, I just don't like the idea of combining spell lines.<br />

Merely commenting on the fact that they seemed receptive for the most part.  Now if that was, say...the Warrior board...<br />
<br />
<br />
Telim Tor:  The game does change a lot in the 60s.  There are plenty of zones (most?) where there is simply no point whatsoever memming spears because they won't ever land, or one in 10.  <br />
<br />
Spears are supposed to be a good chunk of our DPS.  No other class to my knowledge has this limitation on landing DPS spells, because their nukes are based on magic, fire, cold.  <br />
<br />
Its annoying.  Not game breaking, but annoying.  Our fastest nukes, theoretically our best spike damage addition between melee hits, fast cast time...  <br />
<br />
and they never land.<br />

In a lot of situations, by the time a shammy got around to casting the decay line, after malo and slow, the mob would be at 50% or lower, and the SK would have lost at least half the fight.  Furthermore, by casting the decay line, that's one less nuke, heal, or whatever else the shaman can cast during that fight, and that cost will more than likely outweigh the benefit of casting the disease debuff to begin with.  <br />
<br />
It's not watering down the game - it's not a matter of shammys needing to &quot;adapt to having SK's in their group&quot; - it's a matter of the nature of the resist debuffs putting shadowknights at a signficant disadvantage.</div></div><hr />

How do you figure?  Our only &quot;nukes&quot; that land regularly have the efficiency of a Sherman Tank's gas mileage, Spears are resisted too often, and DoTs aren't worth the time to cast in almost every case.<br />

Aye, Lets look at DD spells from 3 hybrids, SK, BST and RNG...<br />
<br />
Format:<br />
Class:<br />
POP, GoD, OOW(highest spell)<br />
Relative % gain from POP<br />
<br />
SK best Spear:<br />
600, 660, 780<br />
0%, 10%, 30%        <br />
<br />
BST cold DD:<br />
752, 810, 1053 <br />
0%, 7.7%, 40%                    <br />
<br />
RNG fire DD:<br />
770, 840, 1000<br />
0%, 9%, 30%<br />
<br />
RNG cold DD:<br />
700, nada?, 910<br />
0%, ?, 30%<br />
<br />
What does this show? BST got LARGEST gain in % for their cold DD for OOW. I find it funny that BST gain outpaces RNG and RNG used to have BEST DD hybrid in game but now BST will gain that position when OOW comes. BST is already strong class and they still got good GoD AA and now they still do for OOW. Must be BST true fanatic in SOE development team. ;)<br />
<br />
BST AND RNG spells are only 30 sec re-cast and ours are 45 sec but trade off is that they have higher cast-time vs ours but they also gained higher damage. PLUS they gain good chance for it to land thanks to Malo. They have THREE advantages and 1 disadvantage. We gained out of this is fastest cast time but we are being penalized by longer recast AND no malo (higher resist factor) and lower dmg base.  We have ONE advantage and 3 disadvantages.<br />
<br />
BST new cold OOW DD isn't far off from our undead OOW dd which is only 1145! We had HIGHEST, situational base dmg from LDON era which is 880.  1145 is a 30% gain. I think undead OOW dd should be damn 40% gain. :)<br />
<br />
The biggest thing is that it hurts us is that we had LOWEST base damage in POP for DD and it scales smaller compared to RNG and BST spell. <br />
<br />
In conclusion, I think SOE clearly made mistake by making BST OOW spell a full 40% gain while it was supposed to be 30% gain to be in-line with other hybrid spells.</div></div><hr />

hehe I know. I was just making point to other poster that rng/bst never bothered to cast those spells. It's not true on BB server that I kept seeing them casting every 30 sec. <br />

<br />
None of the malo line is disease based.  The big resistable line is magic, and Malo/Malos specifically are unresistable.  <br />
<br />
I see BL particularly casting their nukes a lot, never around rangers enough.  Using the cast time on our nukes to justify anything but mana cost and recast time is a bad idea.  It makes it difficult to balance unless the developers can always keep that in mind when designing content, assuming they even care about our resists.  Because honestly, in the scheme of things our spears are small fries.  It only really matters to us.  <br />
<br />
I tend to think all hybrid nukes should have similar low cast/high recast formats.  Balance them with damage and mana cost.   I never understood why we're the only hyrbid that gets the quick casting spells.</div></div><hr />

Malo actually resists against Magic. So in this case your disease debuff is not helping malo to land.<br />

Bah, what am I thinking, you can cure tash with Disease cure. So not sure where you came up with that Tash was diseased based.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">a spell adding poison/disease/curse counters does NOT mean that's what it checks against. the counters are just used so cures will get rid of them and disspells will not. so mobs can be tashed and slowed and _then_ disspelled.<br />

some slows are disease based and add disease counters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, they aren't.  All of the malo type line, both the resistable and the unresistable, are simply detrimental spells with no counters.  The only way to get rid of them is something with a dispell component.  Either regular dispell which strips everything else too, or something with the line &quot;Remove Detrimental(x)&quot; such as Radiant Cure or the cleric single target thingy.</div></div><hr />

Would probably have something to do with the fact that we are a tanking hybrid.  Rangers (despite weaponshield and GoD:P) have swung farther into the DPS end of the scale, and Beasties...who knows, someone loves them, but they aren't tanks.<br />
<br />
Witnessing all the calls for greater channeling ability, and experiencing personally how difficult it is to get a spell off in GoD in a tanking role sometimes, the low delay is understandable.<br />

Now, if we could only use them on a regular basis... <br />

<br />
Untrue.  Rangers can augment their damage output quite nicely with their nukes and do so.  A little over 1k damage on average with 40 percent foci in 1.7s... I'm not sure what rangers you group with who think they are putting out 600 dps so that they cant manage to fit in a nuke or two.  Yes, on raids, some of our rangers dont have the spell gems to mem nukes between buffs, snares, and a heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Maicom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">i've come to love our spears...<br />
<br />
the low cast time is can be very usefull for a bit of snap agro in GoD versus the low delay mobs there(even more so since the spell cast recovery time fix) when I'm having issues w/cd/fear/etc.<br />
<br />
If they get resisted, i don't really give a fuck, its still agro, if they don't get resisted you just got a little chunk of dps.<br />
<br />
I believe i read brael posting a while back that a fear followed by miasmic was our highest burst agro setup at the moment.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
That's not to say I wouldn't love having DR added to mal____. As it is right now, I usually end up buggin a wizzy/mage if there's one around so i can get aopain off before tanking a big mob(no HEB /cry).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">While spears are the most striking/severe example of our disadvantage because of the lack of debuffing of disease, they're certainly not the only one.  Asystole (along with Dark Constriction) are disease based and unmodified, and we have a plethora of disease based spells with small/moderate resist mods on them that would also benefit from such a change, as would necros and shamans.  <br />
<br />
As for ranger/BL nukes' casting time issues, they are something that is often complained about on the ranger boards (don't usually read BL forums) as needing changed, and that's an issue I'd tend to back them on.  A defeciency in one class shouldn't justify a defeciency in another - the fact that ranger nukes' relative value is significantly degraded by higher melee output at the high end is something that needs to be addressed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Rueeliar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I believe our Spears are set up the way they are because of the expectation that we will have to channel them.  That is why the discrepancy in casting time doesn't bother me in the slightest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">That may have been the intention when designing them, but it causes an unfair disadvantage to rangers/BL's, particularly at the high end.  While our spears have almost no impact on our melee DPS, their nukes do cut into their melee DPS.  This presents a problem for them, and should be addressed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Rueeliar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Reducing the innate casting time to anything more than 1.5s would be a waste of time.  Reducing it beyond that cuts dangerously close to stepping on the single advantage Spears have over their nukes.  Ranger nukes are less mana efficient (except for Brushfire), but higher damage and with better recast.  Beastlord nukes are more damage, more mana efficient, and with better recast.  Both classes had their Ancient as an upgrade do their GoD nuke, which was an upgrade from a level 63 nuke, putting both classes at three nukes when spell DPS is most needed.  The only explanation I can think of is that our taps were expected to be used as DPS, which is completely assinine as impacting our melee output every bit as much as their nukes do, for less DPS output, less efficiency in healing (Chloroblast and Sylvan Light), and higher expenditure in mana.<br />
<br />
That being ranted... er... said...<br />
<br />
What do you propose as a good fix?<br />
<br />
Edit:  Tired as shit, and it shows.  I don't actually believe there was any backing to the ranting, as I'm not sure I even believe we're behind on nuking power by enough to care.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">They're both DPS classes - why should our nuke have to have an advantage over theirs?  It would stand to reason that the DPS classes would have more effecient nukes than the tank class.  <br />
<br />
That said, lowering the cast time is not necessarily the only option...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Rueeliar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Again, true.  If the Terror line worked, I would like to see that line dropped to the .5s casting time that it should be, as a VITAL to channel spell (again, if they worked properly).  Then, I would have no problems seeing all the nukes have their casting times re-arranged.<br />
<br />
But I digress.  What do you feel would be a satisfactory way to adjust them?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Personally, I'd just like to see the cast time lowerd to 1sec or maybe even 0.5.  That said, many people have suggested such things as an AA to allow hybrids to melee through casting times and such; anything along those lines would make it a moot point should it be implimented, and in that case, the longer cast time would actually be justified.</div></div><hr />
