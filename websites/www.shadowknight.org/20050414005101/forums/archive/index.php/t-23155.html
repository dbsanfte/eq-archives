<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>PokenHopen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am looking for a decent BP, something I can 1 or 2 group maybee...<br />
<br />
any idea if I could maybee 1 group statue of zek with my current gear? and if so what kind of people would I need(simliar or lower end gear)?<br />
<br />
maybee some other reccomendations on a decent 1 groupable BP, also thinking about buying or farming a magnetized/chargeded bp... any info on those?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vasik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A Charged Magnetic Breastplate is probably the best you can attain right now, unless there are some droppable/attuneable BPs that have yet to be uncovered. Maybe keep an eye out for a cheap ornate BP that someone is trying to get rid of. Farwater plate may be close, as well. They usually run 100-130k on Torv. These have the added bonus of being able to be sold back when you do upgrade it later.<br />
<br />
I can't really comment on if you could tank the Statue, as I have never been at a raid where anything but a warrior tanked it. If I had to guess I would say that you could though, with a decent healing team. I didn't check your AAs, though. <br />
<br />
If you can get a higher group together, Seru should be 1 or 2 groupable without too much difficulty. <br />
<br />
LDoN is an option as well. The BP out of Tak can be modified to be pretty damned good, though it does take a substantial amount of points.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>PokenHopen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks for the tips, will deffinately see about lord seru, but he may be beyond us(very small family guild)  we got about 12 active members and no real dps classes atm(like 3 beastlords me 2 clerics 2druid 2warriors and a few assorted others)<br />
<br />
so we will have to see about him, but I got the key to work on and weapons to get for him.<br />
<br />
Till we can get to him though, I would like to find out about Statue, like how easily slowed is he(3 active beasts 1 shammy 0 chanters).  and once slowed would I even need more then 1 cleric to keep me up other then patch heals?<br />
<br />
how much hp he got?<br />
<br />
any help would be much appreciated(yes I know its old as ass content, but I think it would be fun to try and get him and his bp would be a huge upgrade)</div></div><hr />
