<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ardrick</div><div class="date">03-22-2002, 07:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am in charge of these quests in my guild and have done them like 30 times so i know them pretty well. Heres a walkthru i posted on my guildpage. i stole some of this info so dont give me credit on it~<br />
<br />
<br />
Quest #1. Getting the 2 HQ Tundra Kodiak pelts for this is a real drag, they are rare drops, and you can spend HOURS just getting two, so if you can buy them using /ooc DO SO even if someone wants 500plat apiece for them. The 2 HQ Cougerskin Pelts are easy to get, just do a /ooc in Iceclad to purchase them, occasionally the gnomes by the docks in Iceclad have them for sale from players selling them. You need a large sewing kit to combine the pelts to make Garadains Blanket. It can be MQd if needed. Turn in blanket to Garadain to get the copper Coldain insignia ring. (i recommend tailoring of at least 50, 60 to be safe)<br />
<br />
Quest #2. Garadain will give you an axe to take to his nephew Boridain. After giving the axe to Boridain you need to protect him until a Rabid Kodiak spawns. However, he wanders directly to the Giant fort first thing after starting the quest and gets killed quickly. The solution is to go kill the two giants at the entrance to the fort and THEN start the quest. After the fort Boridain will wander over by the Orc fort, if there aren't people camping the fort, then run ahead and dispatch the two orcs by the entrance. Boridain then wanders away and sits down, when he sits down the rabid kodiak spawns behind him....kill the rabid kodiak, loot the pelt and quickly give the pelt to Boridain and he will give you a broken axe. Turn in broken axe and copper ring to Garadain to get the silver coldain insignia ring. <br />
<br />
Quest #3. You need a HQ Walrus hide, Wooly rhino horn, and a skinning rock (found on ground at random places in EW, they look like red dots). combine all three items in a forge to make a knife. give knife and silver ring to Garadain to get the gold coldain insignia ring. Again this can be done by someone else, it isnt NO DROP. (i recommend smithing of 50 or so)<br />
<br />
Quest #4. Find Tain Frostbite, hail him, then type &quot;help&quot;. As soon as you type &quot;help&quot; the quest starts and in about 15 seconds four nasty giants, including one named, will run straight towards Tain, go off to the side, target the named one and snare him away from the other three. Run him off aways and kill him to loot a elixir. Now, wait till Tain spawns again (I think spawn time is 30-45minutes) and re-trigger the quest with the &quot;help&quot; comment, but this time IMMEDIATELY after typing &quot;help&quot; give Tain the elixir and he will give you a Coldain Smithing Hammer. Now run outta there and let the giants kill Tain again. Give your Coldain Smithing Hammer and gold ring to Garadain for the platinum coldain insignia ring. *NOTE* you can do this part easier with a FD person. After you say &quot;help&quot; have the FD guy attack Tain and pull him away to safety then FD. This way the giants do not attack him and you do not have to wait on respawn. <br />
<br />
Quest #5. Go wait by the Ry Gorr orc fort until a messenger spawns. Kill messenger and loot the invasion plans. Go over to the coldain camp where Garadain is. There is a coldain lookout to the east of the tents, give the invasion plans to the lookout. Immediately after you give plans to the lookout, Scarbrow (a named orc) and 5 other orcs will spawn to the West of the coldain camp. Run over and target/snare Scarbrow to pull him away from the other orcs. You need to do this quickly as Scarbrow leads charge to the camp. Kill Scarbrow and loot his head, and hopefully the Frozen Orb too if you're lucky. By now the other orcs will probably have killed the coldain so when Garadain re-spawns, give him the Scarbrow head and platinum ring to get the obsidian coldain insignia ring. <br />
<br />
Quest #6. Go to orc fort again. On the west side of fort outside is a little shack/building. Eventually a Ry Gorr Emissary will spawn here, do not kill it(also make sure you stay back or invised as you do not want agro), a few minutes after this a named coldain called Rodrick will spawn, here you can pull him with a dot or DD or a snare. If you dot or DD you will need to kite him and its hard because he cannot be snared OR rooted. Loot the head. Also keep the dagger if you plan on doing 9th ring. Now, wait until night and go to the south end of zone. There is a coldain camp here where a coldain ghost pops only at night named Korrigan. Talk to korrigan and give him the obsidian ring. He gives ring back and Icefang starts coming towards Korrigan, back off, and follow him from a distance, make sure nothing kills him if he gets jumped by any other npc's. Icefang will wander for a bit until he eventually goes to the ry gorr camp by the bridge, this is where Poxbreath Yellowfang and a few other orcs will spawn, snare Poxbreath away from others, then kill and loot the Kromrif Note. Give your obsidian ring, rodericks head and kromrif note to Garadain to get your mithril coldain insignia ring. <br />
<br />
Quest #7. First, you need to kill Warden Bruke to get a shackle key. He is over by the prison camp of orcs and giants in north part of zone (where ulthorks spawn). Warden Bruke cons blue to a level 60, runs faster than ordinary sow, and cannot be dotted, snared, rooted or Direct damaged by magic. In addition, when pulling Warden Bruke, 1-5 Kromrif Guards will insta spawn to help/protect him. This is how to do this...target him and walk behind fort. Cast thru the wall to pull so you dont get agro from the 5 giants out front. You will need a small group to do this guy hes tuff. Loot key and head over to Corbin Blackwell who is also located in the prison camp. Kill guards around Corbin Blackwell, then give Corbin the shackle key and your mithril ring, he will give you ring back start to make his escape to Dobbin Crossaxe. 4 orcs and 4 giants will attack you all at the same time as corbin makes his way to Dobbin. Have someone with FD attack Corbin as they try to ambush you. Then pull him safely away and FD. He will then continue on towards Dobbin. When Corbin makes it to Dobbin, Dobbin will thank you for rescuing him and says he will give you a note if you give him your mithril ring. Give Dobbin your ring, he will give you a note. Give note to Garadain to recieve your admantium coldain insignia ring. <br />
<br />
Quest #8. Before starting this quest MAKE SURE that Gloradin (the female coldain NPC) is spawned in the Garadain camp. Give Garadain your admantium ring and he will give you marching orders, give these to Gloradin and the quest starts. You need about 4 peeps to help on this part. Have them wait for you in the back left side of the fort. Once marching orders are handed in inv up and go inside fort where cheif, a few named orcs, and some giants are. Kill all these but cheif is most important, you need his head.( pull cheif first, a 60 can get him solo) After you have his head inv and walk out to tree on the hill right in front of fort. Here is where garadain calls his atack. As soon as he yells charge, hand him the head of the cheif. Gratz 8th ring! <br />

There its posted and its a pretty easy quest so STFU and get to work on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bludge</div><div class="date">03-23-2002, 03:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A very nice guide.  A suggestion if you'll hear it.  You might list what levels the various rings can be completed, if it's possible, or suggestions on what type of force might be needed.  Information on levels of the critters involved might help too.  I know I'd appreciate it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gash</div><div class="date">03-23-2002, 09:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Required faction information would be good too, if anyone has it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Szandor</div><div class="date">03-23-2002, 11:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As far as I remember, your faction has to be indifferent or better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ardrick</div><div class="date">03-23-2002, 01:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i think all non kos factions work for quest<br />
<br />
and i would recommend lvl 50+ to start<br />
<br />
a lvl 60 can solo these till 7th ring (Xilith soloed to 7th at 57, with some help from dorfs on Bruke)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jobrill</div><div class="date">03-23-2002, 02:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm seriously considering doing this quest once I get mid-50s, and I've seen guides for soloing it for Bards and Monks, but no SKs. I figure I can use some of the strategies, but not all of course.<br />
<br />
So anyhow a couple questions, if anyone has the answers?<br />
<br />
1. On Boradain's travels, lets say it's a worse case scenario and no-one is camping the giants or the orcs. What level would one be and what strategies would one use to solo kill the giants and the orcs at the front of the forts, is it enough to only kill the two there, and is the respawn time enough that you can kill em fast enough while still having enough mana to face down the rabid grizzly when that spawns? (It's been a while since I been to velious since I restarted, maybe I should head there and scout these places :p)<br />
<br />
2. Regarding the giants after Tain...I remember finding Tain on the ground on like the 1st day of Velious, telling him I would help, and seeing 50 million giants coming at us. I suppose it's just a matter of Snaring the Head guy? Do the other giants aggro if you pull him away, and if so, is it safe to FD, or does that depop them and the captain? or will they stand where you are and refuse to move, making FD Useless as a splitter?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Moolentheus</div><div class="date">03-25-2002, 11:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been wanting to do this quest but first I've been getting my tailoring up to 80 so I don't fail and have to do the tedious HQ pelts over. (also my smithing)  So I've been thinking how I can do each part by myself or with my 53 level shammy friend.<br />
<br />
1st, 2nd, and 3rd rings are very doable with me (53sk and a 53shammy or just by myself)  <br />
<br />
but the 4th I'm doubtful on.  I know i can just pull the named giant but i was wondering after I say &quot;help&quot; can I shield+dorf head = follow and then fd , clear arggo and then pull the named singlely or will they all arggo on me? Or can you only single pull the named as they are running towards Tain? <br />
and what level is the named giant?<br />
<br />
5th i'm doubtful also because I don't know the level of scarbrow.<br />
<br />
6th might be easy to do if Rod and Pox are low enuff in level that 53 sk and shammy can do them solo.  <br />
<br />
7th might be pretty hard with just a 53 sk and shammy cuz warden can't be snared.<br />
<br />
any tips on doing these quests before i dive head in?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xilith</div><div class="date">03-25-2002, 12:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's the monk guide I used to solo steps 1-7.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NarcosisDOA</div><div class="date">04-14-2002, 11:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So far I've done up to the 5th solo.  2nd you may need help with, it is a pain..Just someone to watch dwarf while you go to each camp and pull away mobs then FD. 4th ring was just a matter of Tain being up. Backed up, the giants come from direction of bridge. Pulled him solo out with Darkness, and fear kited him. Tain died, so I had to wait for him to come back. Solo'd name again for friend, vial is not no drop.<br />
<br />
 5th ring wasnt hard either. Scarbrow is the first to rush the camp, so be quick or something, be able to pull him away. If not, fear kite him if you have dwarves on him, and HT him when he's low on health for the kill/exp/loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alhazro</div><div class="date">04-15-2002, 02:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">one little hint doing warden: he resists even lifetaps so be sure to have steel/diamond~ skin memmed. I was able to straigh tank him without dorf assists using diamonskin a few times. warden is the hardest kill all other are easy fearkites or greenies</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
He Is Highly Resisted ... i was able to kill him with the help of the coldain ... i took him to the one with the captain NE coldain hunt i attack him with 2 dworf after those two died he went after me =( i had to kite him around for 30 minute just to kill him. i then i went to the coldain hunt near the ry'gorr fort.. those dworf need SOW. i was low on HP so i couldn't stop and let the coldain get agro. so i had to regen and run toward him pass the coldain that were chasing the Warden so they can hit him. i had to do that alot and i had to regen alot.... FUNGI really help me on that. He also Gated on me to his spawn point. So i went to his spawn point also he had two guard with him from the first time so i tag him and ran north to the shore line which look like to work and i never agro the guard with him and finish him off .<br />
 He resist Lifetaps on me . Dooming Darkness, and Harm Touch.</div></div><hr />
