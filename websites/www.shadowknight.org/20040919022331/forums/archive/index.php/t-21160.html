<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Space</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Zbite upgrade dropped tonight in Qvic for some lucky shad<br />
<br />
didn't pay too much attention to link but 300 health listed and id guess 150mana</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>nekko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">hmmm, I thought ancient Z bite was from a chaos rune turn in</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It is.  Anyways the spell is worse than regular zev's 220 group heal 110 group mana for 300 mana cost, compare that to Zev's and its quite a bit less efficent.  At 20% mana pres you're looking at 180 mana for 200 group heal 100 group mana (bringing your mana cost down to 80 basically) for regular Zev's, for the &quot;improved&quot; version you're looking at 248 mana for 220 group heal 110 group mana (138 mana cost).  62.5% increase in mana cost for 10% more benefit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">WRU Ancient Touch of Innoruuk &amp; Ancient Aura of Pain?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">its 275 mana, 300 damage, 110 mana 220hp recourse<br />
<br />
its both a downgrade and an upgrade from regular zevs. overall its still worth having...<br />
<br />
although, it would be nicer if it was just a straight upgrade, like 300 dmg, 300 mana with 300hp, 150mana recourse, and the spells were linked so you couldn't cast both, like you could only scribe it after regular zevfeer's was deleted from your spellbook, and couldn't scribe regular zevfeer's if this was in your spellbook.<br />
<br />
*shrug* but that'd be work so i don't see it happening.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Or they could just let us use both and not make one suck, we can use multiple voice spells, clerics can mem multiple invuls, shaman can mem multiple avatars... whats the difference here?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Naelael Sang'Noir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think, for me at least, the big draw to having the spell is you can keep both up at once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You could, but what are you going to drop for another Z bite?<br />
<br />
Only reason I see is to use it with Pet Affinity.</div></div><hr />
