Since I spend 90% of my very limited EQ time soloing I am wondering what are the better buffs to ask for and long lasting.<br />
<br />
So far I know of:<br />
KEI - payed 50 plat for it and is just about makes me a little God - hitting crits withs dots and taps.<br />
<br />
What about <br />
<br />
Avatar: cost and is it worth it, how long it last - how easy it to find to?<br />
<br />
Blessing of Aegolism: (AEGO) - long lasting.<br />
<br />
Since I dont want to burn the the purse I'm limiting my self to one buff at a time since that can get a bit expensive<br />
<br />
Thoughts and any other ideas: would love to know.<br />
<br />
Shem</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lzert</div><div class="date">11-20-2002, 09:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">avatar lasts only a few minutes... you don't want to solo with it :)<br />
<br />
Aego a nice one, but it really only saves you from death.  Mana and HP regen are much better than total hp/mana over time with no healer.<br />
<br />
KEI is probably the best you can ask for really.  Focus of Spirit (lv 60 sham HP/str/dex) is a nice one too, but is similar to Aego in regards to usefullness</div></div><hr />

<br />
As long as there isn't any chance of you dying while soloing, kei is the only buff that lasts long enough to be worth it.</div></div><hr />

I wouldn't go out of my way for anyother solo buff but KEI , Damn I'm addicted... don't even want to solo without it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PlatPhoenix</div><div class="date">11-20-2002, 09:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My personal rule (keep in mind, it's personal); don't get buffed<br />
<br />
Actually, more specifically, don't get buffed unless you can cast it yourself. Stick to your own spells and right-clicky items. Crack is exempt from this rule. Why? Because those that get too dependent on buffs can't do jack crap without them<br />
<br />
When I have KEI it's bloody Christmas<br />
<br />
Instead, concentrate more on your own skills and capabilities. Little things do matter, like training a guard to a mob that they're KOS to, letting the MOB whack on em while you do, and getting the exp (which will only happen if you do more than 50% damage AND get the last hit in. I've KSed the HighKeep guards before)<br />
<br />
Buffs are good things in raids. Soloing, if one goes out, you're SOL. Play as you want, I'm no 'master strategist', but I've played lvls 1-49 for 3 years (multiple SK's, 50+ was tedious until PoP came out) and like to think I have some idea of what I'm talking about<br />

<br />
Recently went through a series of long waits for KEI and realised I had a KEI addiction problem, so decided not to worry to much about getting it and have got back to enjoying life without the KEI kick.<br />
<br />
Not sure if there are support groups or what ;).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ueuelr</div><div class="date">11-20-2002, 10:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only buff I would pay for is KEI. <br />
<br />
<br />
As far as other buffs go, just try to beg for a shaman FoS (or HoS) if there are any groups nearby (or shamans soloing). Aego is good, but not worth paying for it. <br />
<br />
And Pheonix is right, is better to play with your self buffs, makes it easier to know your limits and pushes you to get better gear.<br />
<br />
Since PoP came out, I stoped soloing, but before I used to solo a bit when had spare time. Things to look for when soloing are click iterm. Things than have AoB, DS, Regen (click or worn), lifetap procs (or any good proc, enen bandages) will make your soloing so much easier. Look up any &quot;uber&quot; sk's profiles and you will see they all colect things with clicks and procs (I recomend Lejina's profile).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Akeikyl</div><div class="date">11-20-2002, 11:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Buy a Stave of Shielding and Lodi Boots to buff yourself also.<br />
<br />
Oh and a Embalmers Skinning Knife</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PlatPhoenix</div><div class="date">11-20-2002, 11:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bandages! Oh my god, you have no idea. I have the SoP, which is cool not only cuz it ups my ATK 13 points but the cast looks cool. I love running full speed through a zone repeatedly clicking it, looks like fireworks ;)<br />
<br />
But the Embalmer's Skinning Knife is da-bomb! Floor 4 of the Tower of Frozen Shadow, drops off Cara Omonica or whatever. Procs bandages, 1 per 2 levels. And best of all, it procs on greenies more often than blues. I love gathering up a few stacks of (NO RENT, btw) bandages and soloing till I hit 50% HP and just bandaging, and rocking along again<br />
<br />
And what really twists my rod is the fact that I can carry it anywhere in 1 slot and not have to carry a bag-full-o bandages everywhere I go =) Heeeee<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slein Jinn</div><div class="date">11-21-2002, 12:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">KEI (manaregen/mana pool)<br />
PoTG (HP/AC/6pertick manaregen)<br />
that BL HP/mana regen buff... spiritual purity? something like that<br />
Focus of Spirit (HP/Str/Dex=more MC/SoD procs)<br />
Visions of Grandeaur (haste/dex/etc)<br />
<br />
Those are the top 5 IMHO.  All last ~1hr or more (VoG and the BL buff are about an hour i believe; KEI is 3hrs, Focus is 2hrs, PoTG is 2hrs i believe... all can be increased with goodies on the caster tho).  <br />
<br />
I know it doesn't show your true power to solo with all this shit but hey, when you need xp; you can't beat those 5 buffs.  When I'm in nexus, I usually refuse to leave till i've gotten at least 2 of them (usually donate 50pp/casting, less to a chanter who does both chanty  buffs... its not double the effort).  Can I solo w/o any of em? hell yea... I do it all the time once they fade but when you're there, get what you can.  Its WELL worth it in terms of XP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kebsis</div><div class="date">11-21-2002, 01:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you're soloing correctly, KEI is really the only one you'll need, besides maybe sow, because you wont be taking that much damage.  Just need the help in the mana department...and you have plenty of spells to up your own atk, to increase damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rikkar</div><div class="date">11-21-2002, 02:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">then only buff I won't solo without is KEI (too much medding without it)<br />
<br />
extra goodies are PotG (really high on list, HP/ac/and MANA REGEN)<br />
Spirtual Purity, won't go out of my way, but if I can it's nice<br />
aego if hangover from a raid (free)<br />
FoS (again, hangover it's nice)<br />
VoG/SoS, hey... haste is haste :P fades quick compared to the rest, but helps while you have it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">strucwolf</div><div class="date">11-21-2002, 09:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know you guys are set on the &quot;all you need is KEI!!&quot; thing, but PoTG is  a HUGE help, 6 extra mana regen rocks, with KEI i ocassionally have some down-time . . but with PoTG, never.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shemlen</div><div class="date">11-21-2002, 03:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok I'm going to sound like a Noob (or is it NOB?) and ask<br />
<br />
what is PoTG and who casts - went to casters realm looking for it but did not find.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hrendra An'ei</div><div class="date">11-21-2002, 03:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">KEI remains the only buff I've ever gone out of my way to get while soloing. Why? Because I hate downtime. <br />
<br />
However...Mental Corruption goes a long way towards mitigating that downtime. <br />
<br />
I can't believe I just said that. <br />
<br />
Seriously, however, with MC I was casting spells the other night with the same frequency as when I have C2. Figure if a fight takes a minute, and you proc twice (200 mana), that's 200 mana over 10 ticks, which is...<br />
<br />
20 mana regen/tick. <br />
<br />
That &gt; KEI. <br />
<br />
If it only procs once, it's still only 1/tick shy of C2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mystina</div><div class="date">11-21-2002, 06:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">KEI aka C3 is THE buff to get, it is well worth 100pp or so, especially if the ench has aa an stuff to make it last longer.<br />
If you pay well, you can also ask for a VoG-SoV(speed of vallon), they are long lasting hastes.<br />
<br />
Tranquillity aka C4 is not a good solo buff: its duration is like half C3's, and its mana boost isnt worth it at all, only good for raids.<br />
<br />
Other buffs are not worth to pay money for imo, hps dont help you to solo better.<br />
PoTC/PoTG (from 60+ druids) can be nice if you get it for cheap, but its far inferior to C3. (both stack, tho)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chaoticness</div><div class="date">11-22-2002, 12:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">PoTC is the single buff by 59+ druids and PoTG is the group buff, the single one lasts longer. I allways have to have KEI on when I solo, but normally others are around when I want to get buffed so I try to get PoTC or the new PoTN (9 mana regen woot!) with Focus and chanter haste - VoG SoS or speed of vallon- With these buffs I can fight non stop casting every dot/dd/fear when I want and not go OOM. Its really nice, it allows me to get 2 yellows per hour...thats good for me but I know some of yall out there get a point of AAXP in that time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Catharsis</div><div class="date">11-22-2002, 01:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was alternating fear kites and straight up tanking solo in Akheva last night.  With only mental corruption up for mana and epic for health, I didnt have to stop to med or heal for over an hour.  MC has freed me from crack!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mordeth</div><div class="date">11-22-2002, 02:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you're lookin to buy Buffs.. only the one is really necessary but added gravy buffs are<br />
<br />
KEI &gt; all<br />
PoTG (6mana regen) - Protection of the Grove for whoever was wondering (druid spell)<br />
Spiritual Raidiance (7mana 7hps regen) from Beast Lords.<br />
<br />
Thus proving its not the size of the mana pool that matters... just how fast you can regen the bloody stuff :D<br />
<br />
anything else is nice but unecessary...<br />
<br />
Of course with MC I find I now have reasonable down time without any external buffs.</div></div><hr />
