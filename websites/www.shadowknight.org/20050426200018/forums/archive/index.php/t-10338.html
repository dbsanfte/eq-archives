<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>shoggoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all,<br />
<br />
After taking a break from EQ for a few months I am thinking of starting up an Erudite SK. Although Erudites are quite an unpopular racial choice for SKs I am interested in them for the following reasons:<br />
<br />
- In terms of appearance and from a role playing perspective Erudites seem to fit the evil persona of SKs perfectly.<br />
<br />
- I want soloing to be a viable option for me, therefore in my view an Erudite’s higher mana pool would be beneficial. As I became more adept at fear kiting with my main character (a 53 Ogre SK) I began to notice that I rarely got hit at all. The thought occurred to me ‘Whats the point of having an Ogre’s tank stats if I am hardly taking any damage?’ Frontal unstunability also seemed a waste in these situations. <br />
<br />
- The spear line of DD spells seem very useful for adding significant damage between melee attacks - another reason why more mana would be an advantage.<br />
<br />
On my server 30+ Erudite SKs were completely non-existent (although there were a few 55+ players, but they were in uber guilds so they do not really count). Having never encountered any Erudite SKs above level 25 I am pretty unclear as to their role in high level raid/group situations. My Ogre SK was quite a respectable MA on a few guild raids, however, due to their poor tank stats I very much doubt than an Erudite SK could fill such a role. <br />
<br />
I would be very glad if any seasoned Erudite SKs out there could let me know what to expect. Some advice on gear and starting stats would also be much appreciated.  <br />
<br />
Cheers :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jobrill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Add +5 agi to bring your AGI up to 75. Spend the others where you want, my personal route was to split it between sta and str.<br />
<br />
Other than that...Prolly not gonna be much different than your Ogre really. Any stat deficiencies will be made up with gear. I don't raid much (yet), but I've MT'd in many a group just fine. You'll get stunned, sure, but never having played an Ogre seriously, I dunno how much of an advantage that really gives.<br />
<br />
Honestly, Don't expect any earthbreaking changes from your Ogre. Races are 10% different stats, 90% Looks/faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chozzen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">if i knew what i did now, i would have put 5 points into agi and the rest into sta. whereas when i started i think i did 15 Str and maybe 10 Int. working on the idea that SKs were a warrior/necro hybrid. It's worked out fine so far, but if i hadn't already gotten him to 40 i would have rerolled but as it's been stated. you can adjust stats via AAs and gear. so it's no big. <br />
<br />
if you are going to &quot;twink&quot; at all. the best thing to do is get a suit of crusty armor (decent AC, great Str+Sta) and then get jewerly to make up for the crusty's noticeable Dex hit. <br />
<br />
you're good until at least 30-35 with that setup. Erudites start off with decent mana so you'll have your large mana pool so you can solo/group at will. <br />
<br />
my 2cp. i'm sure someone will come and prove me wrong. : )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gwenix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You definately want your agi to be atleast 75 Dex as well. Since you want to make an erudite because of the big mana pool put the rest into int.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Amphitryon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">as a DE SK, id agree, gear makes up for a lot.. really dpends on if you want to tank a lot or cast a lot<br />
<br />
im in the 'cast a lot' category and one of those inverted sks with more mana than HPs (hehe with KEI my INT goes well over 200)<br />
<br />
in fact i cast so much, im looking at getting an Improved Dmg IV item from a master potter (some idol thing) to boost my spell damage (has nice melee stats too)<br />
<br />
though id get annoyed having to cast spells so i could see in the dark..hell i never did see the diff between night and day in the game until i played a barbarian beastlord)<br />
<br />
roodites are ok i spose but ikies are seckcier (im biased of course :-)</div></div><hr />

<br />
/agree</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Emnity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I put 5 into all melee stats i think, maybe 10 in stamina. I tank just fine in crap gear, solo fine and rarely get stunned when tanking. The first 20 levels or so were shitty as all the early weapons and armor weigh a ton and you don't have any +str gear.<br />
<br />
only difference you'll notice is lack of exp penalty, being blind and being kos in slightly different places.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Baelic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Have played 2 erudite sk's now. First one to lvl 35 on a blue server then started my second erudite on the pvp server sullon zek when it went live, currently lvl 60. (only a casual player)<br />
<br />
Have never had trouble lvling either both as a MT in a group or guild raid or soloing, at all levels. <br />
<br />
Because I started both untwinked I put 10 into str to help out with that heavy armor and carrying loot at lower levels, 5 into sta, 5 into agi and rest into int.<br />
<br />
It doesnt really matter where you put your starting stats. I do wish occasionally that I had put more into sta now that my guild seems to call on me more to tank hard hitting PoP mobs, when our other main tanks arn't on. I still get by ok with Aego or Virtue and all my ac hp gear on and the cleric knowing when to heal me depending on the mob I am tanking. (Went for 2 months there without dying recently).<br />
<br />
I never run out of mana and use life taps alot to help with healing and incase the mob gets a few hard hits if cleric or Shammy is slow on heal. Dots and spears every fight to help with agro. (Usually have kei on and always Mental Corruption).<br />

<br />
-Never jump in The Hole outside Paineel<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Lunaticfringesk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">As an ERU SK, you would probably want to focus your point allocation in one of three ways:<br />
<br />
1.  5 AGI, 15 STA<br />
2.  20 STA<br />
3.  20 INT<br />
<br />
Between the first two, flip a coin I guess.  Personally, Id take option 2 over 1 because you will get gear that adds 5 to AGI pretty fast, so that problem essentially goes away.  Many, however, will argue that you have to have 75 AGI no matter what, so that is an option I suppose.  <br />
<br />
As far as option 3 vs 1 or 2, Id ask yourself one question:  Do you plan on taking this ERU SK to lvl 65 and raid high-end (by high end I mean SSRA boss mobs and beyond) and playing with this character a *ton* or not?  If so, then 20 into INT is definitely arguable.  If not, Id go option 1 or 2.  As a matter of fact, Id probably take option 2 over option 3 regardless, but that is highly debateable (heh--we have this discussion on these boards many times), so I make no conclusion as to such.<br />
<br />
<br />
One other thing worth mentioning...<br />
<br />
Mana pool is basically *worthless* when referring to an xp-grind.  In general, an ERU SK isnt going to solo any better than a ogre SK.  I dont know if I will ever stop hearing this, as someone always brings it up somewhere, somehow.  So what if the ERU SK has a larger mana pool then an ogre SK....all that essentially means is that he will have to med longer to get it back to full.  <br />
<br />
Want to make a difference for soloing?  Get something that affects your mana REGEN (c3/4/5, FT items, etc).  That is where the difference is at.  <br />
<br />
A large mana pool, many will argue, only really becomes important at the high end raid game; NOT the xp grind.<br />

Hmmm... let's see:<br />
<br />
-Never jump in The Hole outside PaineelWrong. Do it at least once, but before level 10.<br />
-Don't go running to Erudin and the Paladin guild thereOn the other hand, the paladin in Erudin library is an good source of xp and cash low teens/early twenties.<br />
-Don't try to hail Cazic Thule when you go to Plane of FearHeh, I'll have to try that.<br />
-Don't make Iksar jokes when you are in Kunark. Yes, because you certainly don't want to hurt the feelings of a bunch of has-beens who got beaten up by half-breeds and frogloks. :D<br />
-Don't listen to people that say that you look like a black version of Frasier.  Just /face yourself to have that pimp white beard and you will be set And how do you know that the original poster won't be playing a female erudite SK? After all, we're even more rare than the male SKs...<br />
-Never let them see you sweat  Nil persperandum or something like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jupke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">And how do you know that the original poster won't be playing a female erudite SK? After all, we're even more rare than the male SKs...<br />
<br />
Do they excist ? i thought you couldn't pick female when playing an erudite SK :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>tetanus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Female Erudites in plate armor look fantastic.  I created an Erudite SK named for my newborn daughter, never having really noticed one before, and twinked her up in some Validus Custodus trash.  I loved the way she looked so much that I started playing her, and she's now my new favorite alt.  She's so cool looking I created a female Erudite cleric to two-box with her.  <br />
<br />
Just how rare are female Erudite Shadow Knights?  I've done searches and seen very few Erudite SK's on Quellious, none of whom have obviously feminine names.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Itzena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Well, on Vallon there's me and um... :confused: <br />
There was another female erudite SK who started about the same time as I did, and joined the same guild, but the player quit her and went back to his main.<br />
<br />
And agree on the look. Here's the Paineel quested newbie armour, (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/fashion2/Luclin_Erudite_Female_FellBlade.jpg) for example. We even look stunningly good in bronze....shame about the chain look with old models, though. Still, at least then you get used to wearing pink armour. :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
Plus, we don't get a teapot for a helm with the new models/custom helms.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I saw a female erudite SK on drinal once.  Well I saw her a bunch, but it was the same one.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure either how ogre stats make that big a difference in MAing.  I do fine and I'm a weedy little dark elf.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Alduran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">If you where a Ogre Sk and didnt like it, then go play a Human Paladin. The Erudite Shadowknights dont need Ogre rejects!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Airamwu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Honestly, stats are very similar in the high end game.  It does not matter what race your are only the gear you have.  One thing that we erudites have that no other sk's will ever get is the sense of uniqueness.  As it stands im the only 60+ epified female erud sk in prexus and 3rd of 5 total erud sk's in the whole server.<br />
<br />
Here i am right after being epified<br />
