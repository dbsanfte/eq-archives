<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jergory</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ok so here is how my epic quest has gone so far.  im using the quick and easy method to cut out the ghey faction work and ratman guard and stuff.  so far the /hide trick has worked for every turn in, except glohnor who i had to have someone cast an invis vs. undead on me.  and then it worked fine.  epic fights :  Kyrenna and caradon ,  this was an easy fight, we had complete overkill.  keep in mind im not in a raiding guild at all,  but we have enough force to throw an epic hit together if its a few days in advance notice.  we had no cleric at all,  just druids and shammys as healers.  the key to give to caradon drops off a &quot;chest&quot; or a &quot;treasure chest&quot; or something like that.  the entrance to them is through a hidden wall ( you can just walk thru the wall ) .  it is marked on the map of the Hole (My map) as &quot;secret&quot;.  <br />
OK, now , Marl Kastane is indeed in Kerra Isle.  say you just got in the zone, and are headed towards the castle thing and the huts.  as soon as u get to the end of the passageway and can see the huts... Marl is in the hut , i think the 4th one on your left from the end of the passageway.  the door to the hut he is in faces out at you just to clear up any confusion about which hut he is in.  Now when he was finally up,  /hide didnt work as i was standing infront of him, i can verify that,  he still conned apprehensively to me.  so i walked around behind him and did /hide and i was indifferent.  once you do turn in he poofs.  one sure fire way to get Marl, is wait til there is a patch or a server reset or something.  after the patch or reset, Marl will be up in exactly three days. and after you do turn in he will be up in exactly three more days.  <br />
OK , now on to Glohnor.  To do this fight, we went in the back way by jumping down into the Hole in Paineel.  It saves a lot of time by not having to plow through entire zone, and plus that bad ass Yael that everyone used to be scared of isnt up anymore.  You can survive this jump by casting Harmshield right before you jump, you will zone mid-fall and should still have it up when u zone from paineel into the Hole, then u hit the ground and should be fine.  Clerics and Pally's can survive this fall using divine aura.  When we first went in zone,  all we had was  me (58 SK) , a 61 shammy ,  a 55 ranger, a 53 mage, a 57 wizzie, and a 65 paladin ( pally was from strongest guild on my server , caer cadarn , thanks a ton Faenor).  so we all jumped, pally rezzed my comrades,  we fought maybe 3 or 4 mobs in and said this is too hard... luckily a 65 cleric friend of mine had just logged on my guild's alliance channel.  so i had her come join us (thank you Vkeira).  After we got a real healer, it was just a slaughter.  pally was bringing in 3 or 4 mobs at a time.  We got up to the entrance to the castle/tower thing.  paladin cleared both sides of the area.  he told me to follow him up to the tower,  facing the tower, ghost of glohnor was on the right, he was laying down in a coffin thing.  i initiated trade with the dark shroud, had pally IVU me , and waited while him and rest of group went down first flight of stairs in the basement.  once i got the OK i hit trade (it HAS to be invis vs undead) and ran back around to other side of the tower and down the first set of stairs.  group was there already fighting the mummy.  once again, it was complete overkill,  easiest part of the mission i think.  i looted my wrappings and head and we  ported out of there.  i gave many thanks to all that attended and we went our seperate ways.  <br />
since i was keeping track of marl kastanes pops in kerra, i knew when to go there.  sure enough 3 days after i did first turn in with him he was up.  i went behind him , started turn in, /hide , checked to make sure i was indifferent,  and boom, i got myself a nice shiny new will of innoruuk BP.  <br />
now getting to gerot kastane was a bit of a problem, it was hard to find any information on this guy at all so i have no info on pop rates or anything like that.  every day i logged on i just had someone open elevator for me to see if he was up.  once u get in elevator, go thru the library type thing, (i think its a library) go down both sets of small curved staircases.  go thru a few more doors and hallways.  not far from elevator you will come upon a stonehenge looking thing, this is where gerot pops.  he is inbetween two of the rocks.  once i finally saw him up, i took off invis (im KoS here , being an iksar) , had to kill a few guards before i could do turn in.  i walked behind gerot , initiated trade , /hide, checked to make sure i was indifferent, and walked away with my head of the valiant.<br />
now about rharzar.  rharzar took me a while to get him to spawn.  i think i was there for a total of maybe 5 hours spread over 4 different trips to rathe mtns.  i killed absolutely everything on the sphinx hill (i heard that that zazza character may be a placeholer, i cant confirm or deny this tho). while i was clearing area (pet helps out a lot here) i was the only one there.  i was running around killing mobs when i spotted a little green drake.  it was rharzar.  i unfortunately had gotten too close and was agro'd .  this guy is a bad ass.  i got a FD off and called in the cavalry to &quot;get your asses to rathe my epic mob is up&quot;.  first one to show up was 61 shammy (same one that was with me on the Hole/Glohnor hit)  she unfortunately died,  others started to show up (including a 65 cleric (same one that was with me on the Hole raid)) .  once we started to fight, we had a 61 ranger, 61 shammy, 65 cleric, me 58 sk, 58 warrior, and a 62 wizard.  it was still a tough fight.  this guy has a ton of hp's  it seems.  he hits for 200's and nukes for anywhere from 400 to 600.  we had no deaths other than the shammy who died before the rest got there (sorry ssquigglez).  <br />
one thing i forgot to touch on, the ghoulbane.  i camped about 5 hours for the froglok shin lord.  he never showed up so i just did the quest.  quest took me about 2 days to finish with the help of a druid to port me around and track.  none of the drops seemed overly rare, certainly less rare than waiting around for froglok shinlord.  i never spent any insane amount of time at any one camp.  so just a suggestion, i would advise to just do the quest.  <br />
so this is all i know about the epic quest up to this point.  the last three things i need are the planar drops and ill be done with epic.  i have a MQ of the bloade of abrogation locked down  though,  but the hide is what im really worried about.  well i hope atleast someone found some of this information helpful to them.  good luck with your epic quests everyone =) , and remember , if it weren't hard, everyone would do it.</div></div><hr />
