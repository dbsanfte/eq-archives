While I haven't reached the point yet where Fear is no longer an effective aggro tool I have come across a post or two that describe how useless it is after a certain point in GoD progression.<br />
Might be good to know Dev's future plans (or lack of them) when it comes to Terror Line, Fear, and overall Sk aggro tools in general.  Just throwing this out there because i know as an Sk my effectiveness in general would be reduced without the aggro i can generate from Fear.  For most of us NOW this is not an issue, and it most likely will be a while before it's an issue for me . . . . still, now's the time to act.</div></div><hr />
