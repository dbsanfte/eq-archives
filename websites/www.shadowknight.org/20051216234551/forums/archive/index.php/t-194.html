<br />
Ideally things that can equate X ATK = Y % increase.   Those sorts of formuals.<br />
<br />
Bored, learning script programing; need somthing interesting I can program without nodding off.</div></div><hr />

I've found that the primary hand 1HB weapon bonuses seem to apply to SK 1HS as well.   The 2HB equations also seem to apply to 2HS and 2HP(ierce) weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daegul Mistweaver</div><div class="date">03-29-2002, 01:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow, nice link! Thanks :)<br />
<br />
Only thing missing though is the effect of raw ATK additions.  I'm guessing that raw ATK effects things in the exact same maner as raising weapon skill (rather than a coresponding STR increase).  Anyone comfirm this?  Also, anyone know how many weapon skill points equates to how many ATK? <br />
<br />
Being at work and er, memorically challenged, what's our max weapon skill? 235? I forget.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xilith</div><div class="date">03-29-2002, 03:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">afaik pure atk raises operate like a skill increase (different than adding strength)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flanders</div><div class="date">04-01-2002, 11:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So basically (Other than the damage bonus) your level has an indirect effect (Skill caps) on your maximum damage?  e.g  a lvl 51 SK with the same wep skill, str, and weapon dmg will have the same maximum as a lvl 60 (Minus the damage bonus) or for that matter a lvl 23?<br />
<br />
Also, is the damage cap lifted completely at lvl 20 or does it phase out over many levels?  Say at lvl 20, if I have weapon dmg at 40, str thats 165, and 2hs skill at 105, will I max at 108? (40 *((165 + 105) / 100) = 108)<br />
<br />
Im about 50% sure about these equations and was wondering if I could get some confirmation from others<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
Like he said, it IS primarily for monks, and SK's have a very, very different set of class rules than monks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you have anything to back that up?  Like some corroborative details, parses, what have you?  I know there are (or at least were damage caps below 10 &amp; 20 - I have seen no evidence for any others.  No offense, but that's not consistent with any of the more serious combat analyses I've seen.<br />
<br />
Urgh, I REALLY need to do some detailed parsing of my own logs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Naelael Sang'Noir</div><div class="date">04-01-2002, 07:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Unfortunatley I dont have any info on me, but being a SK since 1999, I like to consider myself pretty aware of things..  TKW was also a source of info, but since the boards had to be moved, all of the logged stuff for the moment is gone. I'm really not going to go through a huge effort of parsing damage when in fact its already been done, and with a little patince, it will be added to TKW section of the boards. Just wait for it.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rartawk</div><div class="date">04-01-2002, 11:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd say that there is still a damage cap between 20 and 30, judging by my experience wielding a Weighted Axe. I forget the exact numbers now, but I believe my max hit was 99 from about level 27 on. Then once I hit 30 there was a significant jump in Max damage ( before any 2hs skill improvements ).<br />
<br />
Though I don't remember now exactly what it was, it was higher than anything you might normally expect from simply going up one level.<br />
<br />
now in the era of affordable big damage weapons that you can use regularly in  your 20s, perhaps someone else has noticed a similar cap?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flanders</div><div class="date">04-02-2002, 10:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well being that it is an article for monks only, I didnt take it as gospel.  However, if it isnt the correct formula for SK's, it seems pretty close. <br />
<br />
And back on the original subject of damage caps....damage caps are restricted by weapon dmg.  e.g.  a lvl 12 with 200 str, 65 weapon skill, and 21 weapon dmg will only max to the low 30's becuase their weapon dmg is calculated as only 9 or 10.  So technically for those below lvl 20, raising your strength and weapon skill is a good way to get around the cap, or get a low ratio weapon with low damage/delay to max your DPS.  But after 20 Im fairly certain either the dmg cap is calculated differently (as in not by weapon dmg) or its gone completely....but of course I, like many others, dont know quite for sure.....and if any of you out there do know please clue me in :confused:</div></div><hr />
