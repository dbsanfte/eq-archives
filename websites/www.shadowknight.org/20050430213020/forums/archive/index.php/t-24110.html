<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Deccado</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi, just a short intro - I'm a lvl 51 Ogre SK on Rallos Zek, been playing since May 2004.  I was wondering if anyone had any info out there as to what lvl was most efficient to AA at.  I'm aware that lvls &gt; AAs, but if certain zones that give good xp are no longer an option then I'd like to pick up AAs while they're still easy before shooting up the lvls some more.  Personally, I'm thinking of stopping to AA at lvl 52 for a bit.  It seems as if there's still a lot of zones to xp in that are good in terms of the toughness v. xp given.  Additionally, it gives me some time to get people together to kill Naggy and Lady Vox, which I've wanted to do for some time (even though it appears the res stick doesn't drop anymore).  I tried to use the search feature, but it wasn't returning anything useful, so any help would be appreciated.  Thanks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KlowdKill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Spells &amp; AA forum has this question posted multiple times.<br />
My server has very few 50-65 people, most PL themselves and takes 6 hours to find a group, so I wanted out of that bracket.  If you have no issue with keeping up with people, and find it fun AA, than go that way.  Eventually, by 65 defensive aa's will be more important than levels for improvement wise for tanking.<br />
And having run speed 3 is really leet to have asap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Croix VorAbaddon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Stop at 52. Get Run III, Innate Regen, Innate metabolism. <br />
<br />
Level to 62. At 62, do Combat Stability, Combat Agility, Natural Durability, then Physical Enhancement, 2H bash, and Unholy Steed. At that point, you can also pick up IHT and Soul Abrasion. Soul Abrasion is also highly recommended.<br />
<br />
Level to 65, pick up Innate Defense, Lightning Reflexes, PLanar Durability, Planar Power, and Theft of Life.<br />
<br />
From there, up to you.</div></div><hr />

I promise you won't find a better AA spot than RS at 70, especially not one where you have access to greater/glowing runes, kickass augs, and EP-raid quality loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Eggborn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">At level 51 I got AA's in the Great Divide at the giant fort on top of the Hill.  You can fear kite them back and forth, be rdy for a wolf add every so often.  Sell the weapons, decent vendor cash.<br />
<br />
Rathe Mountains can provide some decent AA xp at 51 as well.<br />
Both areas give you pp.<br />
<br />
Later when you get to 52 to 57 head to Veskar and use baby fear (not your long one) and fear kite the Goblins.  Once you can single pull them it is easy.  FD if a train is called, cause it is hard to make it out in time.<br />
You can also use baby fear to fear kite in Chardok at the entrance.<br />
<br />
My favorite spot for solo regular xp at about 53 to 56 was the Burning Woods.  Fear kiting at the giant fort on one side is the fastest, but the undead at the ruins are nice too.  After they start getting light blue head to Skyfire Mountains.  The burning woods zone in is ok, but  always prefered near the overthere.  When feared they path along the wall.  You may wish to wait until your late 50's unless you have good mana regen and some haste.<br />
<br />
Another favorite spot of mine for many, many levels was the Guards in Felwithe.  great  xp, sell the swords they drop for 20pp, you can't fear kite, have to straight up tank.  You can do either zone of Felwithe. Check, I think you need to do this later.<br />
<br />
Also worth checking is kiting the guards in Katta.  Go to the edge of the graveyard once you snare them, cast fear and watch for a few adds coming from the soil.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Elkar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Giants have never been good xp.<br />
<br />
I would think Katta would be great xp, kiting in the graveyard, now that it's a hot-zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Maniacles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">On red servers, the conventional wisdom of levels&gt;AA falls a bit flat.  AA's are RELATIVE power gains, something that is actually of importance on PvP servers.  Once you find that &quot;sweet spot&quot; grind location, where you enjoy killing the critters and don't feel vulnerable after the kill, work your aa's there, and kill anyone who tries to snag it from you.<br />
<br />
My sweet spot was level 58 at katta costellum graveyard, killing guards, with deathly temptation and the new pet.  At 59, some of the guards turned light blue, which ruined it, so I'd recomend snagging all your pre class aa's there at 58 before hitting 59 and getting the rest.  The place is worthless at 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Silvershadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Early 50s has a nice fear spot at the bottom of the stairs to the castle in Gulf of Gunthak. It was decent level exp, so should be decent AAxp. Guess that is also the level when people do the High Keep nobles, never did those myself tho.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nod on that but you wont be able to tank up there for sure. getting to 65+ will also give you access to the OOW uber buffs ( not sure what the level restriction is )<br />
<br />
Unless you have some good friends, getting a group in RS is gonna be a pain but i do agree on doing the jet to 70 before anything</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Aatnam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Heya Decc,<br />
<br />
I went with the Levels &gt; AA's idea, stopping for Run 3 and Regen 3 in my 50's then levelled to 65 to work on my defensive AA's.  I can't say how fast AA's would be in your 50's but grouping in OoW at 65 they're pretty good.  <br />
<br />
You Mighta also consider the peeps you group with, if they're lagging behind and you want to stay within range switch over to AA's to give them time to catch up.  Otherwise level up.<br />
<br />
See ya on Rallos,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">if you weren't on rallos it'd be easy.<br />
<br />
for blue servers i recommend get to 66 at least before working on AA (optionally doing run3 before then). when you're 66, if you can't tank effectively in decent exp content (like WoS) you might want to do luclin defensives. then i'd get up to 68 at least, and decide if you want to work on more AA or become a better tank by levelling.<br />
<br />
if on a PvP server you need more AA at a lower level to feel secure, fear kiting in katta should be pretty decent exp at the moment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Deccado</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Everyone,<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the advice.  Due to connectivity problems at my apt, I haven't been able to play EQ for a week or two.  However, before that I got Run1.  Wow, I'm uber.  So here's what I'm thinking now, which I'd appreciate feedback on again:<br />
<br />
Hit 52 (rather close), and finish off Run3 and Regen3.  Then it depends if I can find that amazing xp spot.  Would I be able to function in a group of similarly lvled people in the Katta graveyard?  If so, I'd sit and stack 30 AAs while filling my in-between time with killing Nagafen, Vox, and Pks.  If not, it's up, up, and away, only stopping to AA when I get my defensives (at 65?).<br />
<br />
Is Metabolism worth-while?  I know I'm an ogre and consume food like a small village, but I just don't see the worth in it.<br />
<br />
Do I need 2HBash?  I can already Bash (or I think Slam, actually) since I am an ogre.  Does this improve that, or does it just allow the smaller races (gnomes and what-not) that same ability?<br />
<br />
I'm not too worried about the people I play with because I have friends at the end-game and friends who are just starting the game, in addition to those people I've met and become friends with.  However, for some odd reason, most of the people I've lvled up with seem to have gotten stuck (or bogged down) in the 50s.  Any particular reason why?  Those in particular I'm talking about are clerics, rangers, druids, bards, palis, and shaman.<br />
<br />
PvP servers are a bit different, which brings me to my last question.  Is it assinine to spend AAs in the increased resists?  Or will all these problems clear themselves up once I gear up a bit more?  I'll try to dig out a crappy Magelo I put together, but I can never remember what the hell I'w wearing.<br />
<br />
Once again, thanks for all your help and input.<br />

Saves a good bit of money on stat food, especially once you get your horse.  It's just a convenience, but 3aa is cheap anyway.<br />
<br />

<br />
I think it's fairly worthless for big races, though I'm not sure about the impact of illusions and your innate slam ability.  You may need this AA to bash/slam in skelly form.<br />
<br />
Is it assinine to spend AAs in the increased resists?<br />
<br />
Spending 15aa on the MR line doesn't seem like a bad deal, assuming that 30MR makes a significant difference in your PvP ability.  I'm no PvPer, though, so maybe someone like Bolas would have a better answer.</div></div><hr />
