<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vorth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My guild had a member pass away last June, Sorrna, for anyone from the Rathe Server.  His soon to be daughter in-law is going to run in this marathon to raise money for  Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society.  Below is a post Crysanni did to our forums.<br />
<br />
From Crysanni:<br />
So the fundraising portion of my marathon training has begun!!! I'm pretty sure everyone knows by now but just in case some of the new people don't know, I have been training with The Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society's Team in Training to run the P.F. Chang's Rock &amp; Roll Marathon in January in memory of Joe Brown, our beloved Sorrna. Roethke's dad was truly an incredible person and when he was diagnosed last September with Leukemia it was one of the worst things I've ever had to experience and I could never imagine how tough the whole ordeal must have been for Joe and Paddy as well.<br />
 <br />
This whole endeavor has been SUCH an experience, last weekend I completed an 11 and a half mile run!!! While it was very mind blowing that I could even do something like that, it also was a bleak reminder of how much farther I have to go, as that's not even half the distance of what I will be doing in January (26.2 miles!!!).<br />
 <br />
I have an online secure website that tax deductable donations can be made too. I need to raise $3,200 in order to do this marathon and not get kicked off the team, or else I personally will have to make up the difference and let me tell you that's just not possible! So please visit my website and feel free to forward it on to anyone and everyone you guys might know as well, post it on the message boards you all visit, and leave flyers up around town! Well you get the idea!  I'm not going to be able to do this on my own, so this is where everyone gets to help me out and do something in memory of Joe.<br />
 <br />
Thanks in advance for anyone able to help out whether it is with donating, forwarding the site on etc... <br />
