<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>DragonKnight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey i was wonder what race and who was THE first SK? I ask this because im not those surfers that can like just make a space in the search space on google and get all the info they want in the first pick :-/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Talonmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Each player race that can be SK's generally has a story about the first or best SK of that race, but as to which race came first you would probably have to look to either the Dark elves (depending on which version of &quot;history&quot; you buy) or the Ogres.<br />
<br />
Its pure conjecture on my part and I have yet to see anything elevated to the level of game dogma that answers your question, however.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Drynnious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think he means who in RL made the first sk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Drakonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Could have been pretty much anybody... wouldn't be much of a title to say you made the first, considering how many people could have made them within a few minutes of each other when the game first started...<br />
<br />
As far as ingame lore goes, wasn't Lhranc the first SK?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ziglug D</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yup, And he was a humie =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>DragonKnight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I talking about history of the SKs. Who was the FIRST to become an SK history wise and what race. And who or what race is Lhranc?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ziglug D</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Dude, and what people are trying to say is...Who cares? Cause someone could have made one and 5 sec's later someone else did, We do not know...<br />
<br />
To question- Lhranc was the first shadowknight who virtually became one because his brother stole his lover, They WERE both pallies, But Lhranc turned to the dark side and was gided by Innoruuk to kill his brother G-something rather, been a long time since I read the lore...<br />
<br />
EDIT: And it doesnt really matter who CREATED the first SK...It prolly only matters who got to 50...Before the lvl cap...Cause the first SK created could have quit at 20!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jodgrim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you are talking about the first player SK then you are out of luck. If you are talking about EQ lore the first Shadowknight was a human named Lhranc his story is below.<br />
<br />
Ages ago, two brothers were born. Glohnor was highly favored by the pompous Lightbringer, whose name we do not utter. Lhranc was chosen by the Prince of Hate to bring destruction and turmoil to the sons of men. The one thing they shared in common was their love of the fair priestess, Kyrenna. Kyrenna fell deeply in love with Glohnor. When Lhranc discovered this, he was overcome with rage and unwisely attacked his brother, who happened to be far more adept in combat. The fight cost Lhranc dearly. He lost his dignity as well as an eye in the struggle. He was ordered to leave Freeport and live his life in exile from the only home he had ever known. 'Lhranc wandered the deserts of Ro for weeks, sinking deeper into depression and giving in to rage. Reports from the local merchants and caravans had him roaming the dunes muttering to himself incoherently. Eventually, he was forgotten, blending in with the hermits and madmen common to that region, forgotten by all save one.<br />
<br />
Innoruuk had not forsaken Lhranc. Once his rage and hate had matured and sufficiently altered his soul, the dark prince summoned him and gave him dominion over the demons that had enslaved his mind. He was given a weapon that made him powerful enough to slay any enemy that stood in his way. He was to become the first human to harness the power of the almighty shadowknight. After years of traveling and teaching mankind his newfound abilities, Lhranc sneaked back into Freeport through a series of sewers in search of revenge against his brother and in hopes of kidnapping Kyrenna, the source of his obsession. Waiting until Glohnor was alone, Lhranc sprang from the shadows and slew his brother. This was the act that brought about his curse.<br />
<br />
When the contemptible god of honor discovered what had been done, he transformed Lhranc into a deformed spectral knight and placed him in the ruined city. Lhranc then used what remained of his power to summon Kyrenna to his side and bind her there in a timeless, seamless sphere.<br />

The above was copied and pasted from our epic walk-through.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It says he was the first human to harness the power of the Shadow Knight, not that he was the first Shadow Knight.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jodgrim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">There is no EQ lore pointing to a (playable race) SK before him. That's the problem with actual EQ lore (not player fiction) there are no dates so it is hard to tell what happened when.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Correction, Originlal content lore has very few dates. Kunark lore is pretty well documented.<br />
<br />
It comes from most of the lore in original content coming mostly fom quests and not the books you can buy in Cab.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Calamity_Daemon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I am pretty sure the Teir'Dal were the first ones to combine martial skill and necromancy. Why do I think this? Well, in my lore books that I have here say that the humans/erudites ventured out to find magical texts for their spells. Of course OF these spells many were made by elves. Probably the only ones that were evil were found in Neriak. The people that made it back probably saw the Teir'Dal practicing the art of a shadowknight and began to pick it up as well. I.E Erudite shadowknights. I dont know maybe I'm wrong but it makes sense. The trolls and ogres probably got it from the dark elves too or just had it bred into their warlike cultures by their gods.<br />
<br />
    As far as the human Lhranc goes...well he was a warrior and so was his brother. The reason he could not have been a paladin is because he had no religion whereas his brother did (Mathaniel). It doesnt matter if he was the first SK or not. All that matters is that he was the first to wield Innoruuk's Curse.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Zero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">In responce to the initial question I bet it was a GM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Erudites had paladins (a melee/caster hybrid) and when some of them joined the dark side and discovered evil death magic (destroying the heretic's city and creating the ruins of old Paineel) it seems logical to me that mixing magic and battle probably seemed natural to them.  <br />
<br />
Now if they could only find more helmets that don't have a damned handle on them......:mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Meriboh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">According to the original lore, Veeshan was the first to deposit her brood upon the face of Norath. Soon after, Brell, went into the belly of Norath and created all manner of creature, however, none were the Dwarves and Halflings which came a little later.<br />
A meeting was held by Brell, Tunnare, Prexus and Rallos Zek to decide the fate of this new world. The Dwarves, Kedge, Giants and Elves (not Dark Elves) were created. No other races exsisted on Narrath exsept these.<br />
Feeling left out and jealous, Innoruuk kidnapped the first King and Queen of the Elves and tore them apart and thus created the first Dark Elves.<br />
<br />
Since the Dark Elves are only creatures mentioned above, able to be a Shadow Knight, I would assume that under Innoruuk’s dark influence and guidance, the Dark Elves were the first to practice the Dark Arts which led to Necromancy, which is the heart of our craft.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">You're forgetting the lesser races.   Kobolds and Goblins both have SKs among their ranks at some point.  And according to the lore, these were secret creations of Brell and Rallos, or something like that.  I believe before the fall of the elves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Meriboh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Those must have been the collective “All manner of creatures” :)<br />
Some certainly do practice Necromancy, but not as a result of Brell.<br />
I can only speculate that they learned this art later in the history of Norrath, as Necromancy spread and became a common and recognized art.<br />
