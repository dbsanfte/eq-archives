<br />
Now we just need an upgrade with an hour duration on it with OoW...!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What about a nice upgrade to this a level 66 or so version with about 40 damage or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Not worth wasting a spell upgrade on.  It falls in the &quot;it would be nice&quot; category, but wouldn't really &quot;do&quot; anything significant.  As has been pointed out in other threads, there is a limit to how many spell upgrades we can reasonably receive - this isn't worth wanting to use one of them on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Darkenesis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It is arguable if we'd even want to sac a spell for a Banshee Aura upgrade.<br />
<br />
However, it is also very arguable if we'd want to sac a current spell lined up for OoW.<br />
<br />
Not saying we NEED a DS upgrade... But I would be more inclined to use self DS if I didn't have to recast it every (now) 15 minutes.  4.2 was not worth the effort... 15 minutes is just not as much as worth the effort.</div></div><hr />

Dear FUCKTARDS @ SOE LIVE,<br />
<br />
CAN U FAGGOTS GET THIS THROUGH YOUR THICK FUCKING HEADS: Having to REBUFF SHIT (read DURATION LESS THEN 1 HOUR) IS FUCKING SUPER FUCKING GHEY!<br />

I would personally prefer a ds upgrade to that useless upgrade to festering darkness they have listed.  Thats totally a waste of a spell upgrade.<br />
<br />
We have the intense hatred aa so I guess they consider us a DS class I mean i know rangers have it too.<br />
<br />
On a different subject its getting close to the point where the spells are going to be locked in for release and we still dont have anything thats going to significantly help our tanking or pulling in our Oow spells.  <br />
<br />
I can see this is going to be another GoD release where we get nothing to prepare us for the increased dps of the mobs we will be having to tank.<br />
<br />
We really need to step up our voices on these spells or its going to be another GoD for us</div></div><hr />

Look at it's cast/re-cast time.  That alone makes it not useless, even if it's not amazing.<br />
<br />
The OoW spells overall look good.  Our tanking problem isn't so much a problem with our OoW spell line.  Adding the right new spell line would be a good step toward fixing the class, but for the most part, the current OoW spell line up is shaping up well.</div></div><hr />

I have to disagree thats its shaping up well all I see is a small increase to our current spells I don't see anything new really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'd trade all of those minor spell upgrades just to have a very fast/instant FD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Parasite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'd rather have a faster recast on the new high lifetap. 10 seconds is teh suck in OoW obv~ or raise the amount.<br />
But suxx if you tap for like 800ish with ID n all the nifty stuffz when a mob nearly one-rounds ya..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shurlock</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Inferna's right, Slein.             Unless you've got some kind of crystal ball or have an SoE spellguy for your neighbor, our spells aren't &quot;shaping up&quot; worth a shit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ukbar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Agreed, a very fast/instant FD would be great to have, too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">It'd be nice to have spell choices.  IE: any given SK can pick either this spell or that one, but once you make your choice it's final.  It'd be kind of like specializations.  You could opt to focus more on tanking, or more on damage, or whatever.<br />
<br />
Just a thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>DConquest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Geez guys, did you see the spells we got before PoP?   Continuing the PoP spell line isn't a horrible thing,  we just need some major class issues dealt with either via spells, disciplines, AAs, etc... not to mention the way spells are dealt with in EQ.  Casters are almost over powered at 1st, then melee catches up and makes them almost obselete. <br />
<br />
Think about this, with OOW I'm sure there'll be a continuation of the LR / ID lines... and GoD was tuned for those AAs.  Probably another reason we're having issues.  Imagine taking on PoP w/o any defensive AAs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Exactly, the spells are solid for the most part (they still need some work, obviously, but that's what happens when you're still months before release) - they just don't address the class balance problems, so people don't give them enough credit.  <br />
<br />
And why is it that each new expansion's spells need to &quot;show creativity&quot; or whatever?  I see it on other class boards and I'm seeing it here and frankly, it doesn't make much sense.  Spell lines have rarely shown much creativity - you get spell lines and then you get upgrades to them, you don't get new fancy toys each expansion, and that's probably for the best.  I'll take an upgrade to a proven effective spell over a SOE attempt at creativity any day and twice on Sunday.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Geez Slein even the warriors think our spells suck and we need help.  For them to be saying that it must be pretty bad as we know on the whole what a helpful bunch they are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">No, warriors are trying to appear like they think we need something to compete with pally stuns (and of course that will prevent us from competing with them against anything meaningful).  They're trying to give us big non-scaling abilities (I.E. big 25/75 lifetap... ooh, ahh, that'll fix us!  Wait, no it won't - it'll just overpower us on trivial content and leave us shitty on the hard stuff.  ) to make it look like they care about balance when really they just want to maintain their stranglehold.  <br />
<br />
Knight tanking in general needs re-worked to reduce paladins' reliance on stuns, as that's the major roadblock to our classes getting meaningful upgrades, as I've suggested elsewhere.  These issues aside, our spell line is simply not bad; like I said, it could still use a little work, but that's true of everyone's spells at this stage... a few of them havn't even been worked on at all yet (I.E. lich upgrade).</div></div><hr />
