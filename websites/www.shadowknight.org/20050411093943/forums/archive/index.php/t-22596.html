<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>pazuzu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was fighting in the Gates zone (Vxed) for xp/loot with a 6 person group (all 65).  Monk/CLR/ENC/DRU/ROG and me SK (191AA).  One of the named guys popped (red to me) and he proceeded to beat me down.  We regrouped - I got fully buffed - I clicked my Leech Discipline.....I popped my leech Harm touch....I got delay healed - Cleric/Druid double healing me....he beat me down again...not really close either.  So with the entire group in obvious agreement that our 6 man group could not kill this mob...the enchanter said  - &quot;Why Don't I try to solo him&quot;.   <br />
<br />
So I watched as the enchanter used his charmed/hastened pet to tank this named mob.   He wasn't actually soloing him...the cleric and druid were healing the pet (alebit I'm not sure he needed the druid).  But he certainly did kill it.    Myself / Monk / ROG - did nothing...just watched the entire time.  <br />
<br />
And as I am sitting there watching this enchanter tank this named mob.....watching 2 ppl kill what a well-balanced group could not.....I'm thinking is this an exploit? Is he cheating? The Enchanter claimed no..and said the best groups that he has been in is a ENC/ENC/ENC MAG CLR DRU team...with no tank at all...<br />
<br />
I guess I am not too concerned that a warrior can tank better than a SK....that isnt humiliating.   But this whole enchanter charming seems to be out of hand...it seems unbalanced ; unfair; and quite frankly made me feel like quitting the game.  <br />
<br />
I mean I am glad we killed the mob....but I can't whip out a super heal better than a cleric...or a super nuke better than a wizard...  How is it that the enchanter (the guy that casts clarity...haste...turns me into a scarecrow....mezs mobs....) does like 8 important things I can't do...and on top of all that....can charm a level 65 mob that hits for a 1000 and tanks (way better) than me.<br />
<br />
I am not seeing the balance here.   What am I missing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ghismonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm not even going to try to argue whether it is balanced or not.  But some things to consider that this enchanter may not have mentioned to you:<br />
<br />
Enchanters can only 'solo' mobs with 2 other people.  Once a 4th person enters the mob's aggro list, if it has the ability to summon, it very likely will.  Dead healers or charmers.<br />
<br />
As soon as the charm breaks, all hell breaks loose.  I'm not an enchanter, but I doubt the validity of his super group.  Looks like there's some enchanters tanking as soon as charm breaks.<br />
<br />
These badass pets mostly only happen in Tipt and Vxed.  That's not much of a consolation I know, but at least you haven't been replaced full-time yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Blackmerlin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Charm pet tanking named mob is like playing in the casino.<br />
You have a chance at winning, but there is always the chance of an charm break and if charm breaks -&gt; chanter is dead.<br />
Only exception would be that there are multiple chanters grouped, so that one charmed pet could continue to tank while the other one is recharmed.<br />
Still high chance at failing. You can do some awesome things but you always rely on your luck. When you are able to tank these nameds yourself things will change, since you are a much more reliable tank then a charmed pet ever could be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">the bad ass pets do happen else where, but even then I don't think it's unbalanced, let the enchanters have some fun ;P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Elkar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Worse is, if you had a ranger in the group, he'd weaponshield tank the thing for 24 seconds, which would leave it pretty close to dead anyway.<br />
<br />
That's why you see all the discussion about SK's getting some melee discs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>pazuzu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks for the replys....<br />
<br />
But the charm DID break during the fight....the druid had the pet already snared..... the enchanter was standing far enough away that he just re-cast charm before the mob got to him.   The named guy chased the druid around for a second until the pet got re-charmed....then back to business.<br />
<br />
There was no &quot;casino&quot; about it - I would say the success rate was at least 80%+ with their tactics.  This compared to my tanking success rate of 0%.<br />
<br />
The enchanters have been having their fun for 3 years....Did I spend 56,887 hours of EQ...working on my gear...my AAs....to sit and watch the enchanter tank the high end encounters?  <br />
<br />
Looks like I did.  Thanks Sony.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ghismonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">That isn't a high end encounter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>bfeyter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">&quot;That isn't a high end encounter.&quot;<br />
1- higher end then....and if this aint a high end. what about tanking in high end hm?<br />
2- the point is that the chanter pet should be an accesory (no i cant spell)<br />
not a replacement.<br />
<br />
risk is not realy a question.<br />
When you charm the chanter as a bigger risk to meet death.<br />
If the sk tanks then the sk has a higher risk to meet death<br />
<br />
If you get the DC pet snared and can get enough diffrence between chanter and pet i think the risk is less then let the sk tank.<br />
<br />
But hm...this topic has bin coverd.<br />
Almost the whole forum is about it.<br />
Knights need some attention.<br />
Keeping my fingers crosed for oow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I could tank the named... /shrug<br />
I tanked it before I even had much EP or any Time gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>pazuzu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I am glad someone said they could tank the named in Vxed...because I now remember the enchanter saying he only had 13 AA(s),,,...and his gear was pathetic.<br />
<br />
Basically 100% of  level 64+ enchanters can tank &quot;higher end&quot; mobs.  Maybe 10% of level 65 SKs can tank them.  <br />
<br />
But if you are in that 10% of Shadowknights - maybe you just don't care.... all you want is your FD hot button... Thanks.<br />
<br />
I am not saying I think SK(s) should get a new tank discipline.,..I am saying the ENC spell is unbalanced...just delete it....it hurts the game....an enchanter has no business tanking anything.  No business dishing out that kind of damage.  They already have way too much power.<br />
<br />
If they gave SK(s) a spell that would charm level 65 undead mobs....everyone would freak out...how is ENC charming accepted?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>cames</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">My original main was a chanter.<br />
<br />
Charm soloing and Charm tanking are high risk, high reward methods.  Having a druid/ranger around for snare makes it a lot easier as does spell haste.  Remember CoD is 700 mana so it works best on mobs that have relatively low MR.<br />
<br />
As for Vxed, my SK tanks there.  Its a LOT easier with a 2nd healer and a LOT easier if we have a chanter with pet.  But the same would be true if I was a warrior or a pally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Notice the Mage in his supergroup?<br />
Malo line to lower resists to make charm last longer and to make it easier to recharm.  <br />
Druid snares and heals<br />
Cleric heals...the other chanters do the pet thing of course, but have a full set up of mem blurs and everything else to help each other if a mob breaks.<br />
<br />
That super group has an answer to every danger of Charming.  Depending on the clerics mana pool the druid can be switched out for a wizard or necro too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Atrocity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Class jealousy is a bad thing.  Charm is not unbalanced for enchanters, it's one of their core abilities.  I've been in these tipt/vxed groups with chanters and without and I have to say it's much much easier with.  Pretty much the only down side is people get bored and stop paying attention, then death comes quickly...  These are situational tactics, they don't work everwhere in the game, but they do work extremely well in tipt/vxed.  There are times when my situational abilities work well also, for example fd and circlet use, invis and invis v undead, ht...  If we all scream &quot;unfair!  nerf! nerf!&quot; every time a class uses their skills effectively then the very small bit of fun left in this game will be completely sucked out of it.  If you want to loby that SKs should be more effective or be able to contribute more in various situations then by all means go right ahead, but we've been on the recieving end of this jealousy thing too many times for me to buy into it.<br />

<br />
Not if the mob they are fighting summons.  In Vxed and Tipt, especially on nameds, charm breaks, enchanter gets summoned, enchanter dies.<br />
<br />
What about high end encounters hmm?<br />
<br />
I've tanked Cazic Thule in Time, and no enchanter pets have.<br />
<br />
Are we fixed?  NO.  Are we balanced?  NO.  Is this a problem with enchanters?  No.  I've had my ego bruised by enchanters suggesting that their pets tank things when I first was doing Vxed and Tipt, as well, but I'm not calling for a nerf.  Your mileage may vary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Not if the mob they are fighting summons.  In Vxed and Tipt, especially on nameds, charm breaks, enchanter gets summoned, enchanter dies.<br />
<br />
They said they had three chanters; I bet what they were doing was keeping 2 mobs at a time charmed. When charm breaks on one mob, the enchanter is summoned, more than likely the one round of damage will eat through rune, then they'll run away. While they are running away, the other, free enchanter now has 6 seconds to charm the pet and sic it back on the main mob. Problem solved. Repeat as needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Time isn't exactly high end either.  Tipt/Vxed are about mid game though, in the actual high end it's not bad at all now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Shizzythugmasta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Some questions i'd have about this, when you tried tanking, how long did the fights last?  Did slow land? If you only lasted a round or two, then thats one thing, but if you lasted 40 secs or a min maybe, then the problem is your group didn't do dps fast enough.  I've also seen this happen in a group, and then have one of the healers be swapped for a different one, and the tank lives just fine. <br />
I've played an enchanter in those trials, charming works great and all, except the group gets lazy, and the exp starts to suck because the pet takes it all, and the chanter dies every 5-15mins, depending on whether or not people in the group are paying attentino or when the pet breaks.  on a named if the pet breaks, healers die quickly or the enchanter also dies quickly as they very soon get thrown into the maw of the beast.  <br />
As others have said, taking something away from a class because they are situationally able to do something u want to do isn't a good thing to do.  Charms are incredibly random, even with Total Domination 3 and 305 charisma and malo/tash u still get instant charm breaks, and it always breaks at the worst times.  It takes alot of FT and a big mana pool to be able to keep up with even 4 minute charms, which is a nice long charm in lots of places.  Not to mention usually the enchanter has to be slowing, mez'ing buffing and other crap.   Also the group has to be smart and keep an eye on the chanter and his pet.  Hell i have on multiple occasions asked for SoE and had the idiot druid/ranger SoE my pet.  Yeah that was fun when he chain raped us all in about 15 secs.  Charm, like defensive can let people who are slightly undergeared do some things in certain situations (though defensive is certainly more reliable) but I don't think either need to be removed from the game.  Without it chanters would be unable to solo at all basically, unless its in content thats 5 expansions old and the mobs are light blue or barely blue.  And would certainly have no reason to get a trial group in vxed or tipt where a shaman or bst would bring much mroe to the group, as usually a 2 or 3 in certain situations will cause a large number of the group to die anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Daywalka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">just delete it....it hurts the game....an enchanter has no business tanking anything.<br />
<br />
They aren't tanking it, the pet is. And does it hurt the game that the Enchanter allowed your whole group to do something that they otherwise could not? You won the fight, and loot was dropped, right? I personally don't see the problem. You couldn't tank it, most can't. Congratulations, you're normal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Simu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I got my ass handed to me a vast number of time when tanking in Vxed. I have tu flee like a coward dog for time to time while waiting for a cleric heal... No matter how good is the cleric, soon or late some mob is gonna have a lucky round on me and i'll die.<br />
<br />
I am probably undergeared for Vxed and though I got the flag (thanks to the Ench'pet) I refuse to try Tipt as I dont like wasting my friends time. At least as long as i am not lvl 70...<br />
<br />
As usual, I'll have to wait for the next expension to trivialize content before being able to discover it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Shizzythugmasta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Generally, unless yer guild is one of the top on yer server, and very hardcore at raiding, you generally will not be able to tear thru the beginnning of any expansion, especially one geared toward the higher crowd, a la Planes of Power.  And for the most part, if the mob hits 2 rounds for full on most tanks that aren't thoroughly geared in elemental or time or higher, the tank will die.  Unless the healing is exceptionally well timed / lucky.  Alot of chance goes into those encounters, its part of what makes them a little more exciting than grinding out aa's in an agro kiting group in HoH or PoV.<br />
<br />
Also a number of things came from GoD that are helpful for the non-raiding crowd.  The Velium Gemmed weapons, Lots of nice droppable items, (ie mace of dark glory, Blindeye).  Also the exp in sewer trial 4 for example is very good considering mobs weren't even hitting over 500 there last night, and the exp was much better than a hard ldon, and the mobs hit half as hard.</div></div><hr />

anyways just wondering about how much ac i would need to be a decent, non-dead hey look at me im still alive after this one tank?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Moegid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">To keep your healer from running completely out of mana in a fight, I would suggest 10k+ hp and 2k+ ac for a tanking knight.

<br />
Yes, but how much AC do you have? Some people have 8k hp, but only 1650-ish AC. Some have 7k hp and 1900 AC buffed. It's a big difference.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Uh, you confused &quot;the mob they're fighting summons&quot; with the mob the chanter has charmed summons.<br />
<br />
There is no reason to charm a summoning mob in Vxed/Tipt. <br />
<br />
How Vxed/Tipt (charming in general) works: snarer snares mob, debuffer debuffs, charmer charms. When charm breaks, charmer pops hotkey and runs around all silly, snarer resnares, debuffer debuffs, charmer charms. <br />
<br />
~~~<br />
<br />
Also, the only way ENC/ENC/ENC/MAG/CLR/DRU works is if three chanters are the only DPS with the CLR healing and the druid/mage just there for chanter pet maintenance, due to pet aggro holding rules. Mage for debuff is better than anything a NEC can provide, IMO. Usually a chanty will have to cast debuff then charm, ballsy ones won't - skilled once don't have to.<br />
<br />
~~~<br />
<br />
And to the original poster - if that's happening to you, consider the chanter's abilities a gift, as once you get past that you're basically fucked in regards to nameds as they don't exactly get easier. Slow down, absorb some gear. Heck, now you have levels to win the fights for ya =)</div></div><hr />
