<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Poote</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings, this is my First post on these boards. I am in need of some advise on this quest. I have a lvl 38 Dark Elf Sk on the Luclin server. Now i've done The Penance quest for the newbie blade, did the turn in just fine, go to the next guy Lord Gikzic for the test of the Pawn and he won't give me the freaking Bag, WTF. His exact words are.<br />
<br />
&quot; Ignorant lout!! The Crusaders of the Greenmist shall have nothing to do with you. Go While i ponder your suffering to come. &quot; <br />
<br />
then i go back to the Sk merchant guy and now he wants nothing to do with me with his faggoty comment.<br />
<br />
&quot; I don't like to speak to your ilk much less sell to them! &quot;<br />
<br />
What did i miss, i did the same quest on the Test server with a lvl 25 Iksar SK and it turned out great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aelali</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sounds like you don't have enough faction. You need amible with the SK guild for them to give you the quests, and to accept turn ins. So if you don't have at least that, the will tell you to get lost. Most of the quests are also level capped (getting progressivly higher along with the progression of the quests) I believe, though I'm not sure that will be an issue at lvl 38.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Poote</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">thats kinda funny, according to allakhazam, all the zones they have me kill in for each stage of this quest, Lower faction with Crusaders of the Greenmist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Naika</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">To increase faction for them, I did the bonechip thing.  Kill many skellies in Kurn's tower, run back to the guy on right side of doorway (forgot his name) before entering Cabilis from field of bone.  Turn in 4 at a time, unstacked, receive faction, coin and xp.  Also, the &quot;iksar bandits&quot; in fob and ww give faction for the crusaders.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Poote</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yup, 1 step ahead of ya, had too many stack of bone chips on my Necro, Turned them in and........ Nothing, so i'm reduced to Bone chip hunter for a long time. I hope this blade is worth the trouble.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Naika</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">many, many bone chips .............. i had to turn in atleast 2k or close to that.  I'm a de of inny and it took forever just to get the faction.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Do the explorer knife quest, its much much faster than bonechips (unless of course you have a necro with the Flesh to Bone AA or a metric fuckton of bonechips already). Took me two afternoons of explorer knives to get the faction I needed, and then one night of afk faction farming (I r teh haxx!one1!!) to get decent enough with the necromancer guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Poote</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Woo hoo made an awesome bazaar kill. found somebody selling the Hero's Khukri for 5k plat. saves me alot of trouble cept the faction issues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Aelali</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You can significantly reduce your faction farming with an iksar Illusion potion. As a Dark Elf SK worshiping Innoruuk, iksar illusion should be able to take you to above the required faction if you have dubious faction un-illusioned. Also, starting faction for you should be enough to get dubious to the necro guild for that one turn in. The downside to the illusion method is that you will need to be illusioned for all of the turn ins, which include a few not in cabalis, so you end up needing 3-4 illusion potions (give or take, been a really long time since I did the Greenmist quest), but if you bought the hero's khukri, then that probably won't be an issue for you.<br />

And is it worth it? Honestly it falls in the same catagory I would put epic 1's, if you can get it early, (i.e. about your lvl) and with only a decent amount of effort, then it's awesome. I got my enchanter's epic when he was 51, soloing almost all of it and having him loot the pieces (I think I got his first piece at 20 or so and just killed the mob(s) for each piece whenever I happened to see them up, so it wasn't a huge drain on my time, just &quot;oh look, ____ is up, guess I'll get that piece&quot;), and his epic was amazingly awesome until 63, when his casted spell haste became better than the clicky haste, but had I waited until he was 65+ to get it, it would have beeen more or less worthless. Same with the SK epic, nowadays if you can get the help to get it close to 50ish, it will be an awesome weapon for you, but if you can't get it done until lvl 65+ then you gain very little with it. The Greenmist won't proc for you until 45, but if you get it by then, it will be an awesome weapon for you until you get much higher lvl (closer to 65+). It will even compete with some of the PoP weapons for SKs just because the proc is so awesome, you can't beat a STR, AC defuffing(and tapping) lifetap DoT (besides the fact the katana animation is cool looking). I used the Greenmist, and Innoruuk's curse until I finally joined a raiding guild and replaced them with GoD weapons (I didn't join a raiding guild until just before GoD was released), mostly because imo at the time the procs more than made up for the ratio and stat differances in PoP weapons pre-Time (but that of course was my opinion).</div></div><hr />
