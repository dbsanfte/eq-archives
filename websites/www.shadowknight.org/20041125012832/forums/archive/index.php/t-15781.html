<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Muted</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all , My main is a 59 necro on the Luclin server (muted). Anyway I i need a change in pace so i took what little pp i had (2K) and was able to mix and match som ok weapons and armor for him. I kinda solo alot (necro thing) but also wanted to be feared and be able t otake a hit every once in awhile, So in comes my new Toon (Hatemee lvl 10 Sk) He is very cooo and seems t obe able to take hits nice and love the Harm tuch. I was just woundering when in a SK life does he truely start to shine. And also since this is my first tank type alt.. Im kinda find it hard to keep both 1hand slash up and also 2 handslash up. Using a centi long in my Primary --so i hack into the mobs good-I forget my 2 handed sword name---but its ok also---justwhen i switch to it the delay causeme to get by butt stomped faster---So i find myself just put skill points into it at the guild master.Any thought on getting 2 handed up? do i gota group to do it----or do i not worry about it untill lvl 20 when the skill cap comes off.<br />
<br />
Thx kinda long and wordy---but thx for any info on how to play  a new SK--(first tank type ever) And onfo on anythink would be nice<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Romuluas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not sure what others did, but i personally didnt really use 2h weapons til i was in my 40's where i found i  really needed to group more, until that point i was soloing mostly so i used 1hs/b for the lower delay, and at the time there were no aa's and sk's 2h skills tend to miss much more then 1h skills, i would say tho, by the time you are 50 you will want to have your 2h skills totally maxed. But this is just they way i did it, others may have different suggestions for you, but in the end it all depends how you like playing you SK and the type of fight you want to dish out.</div></div><hr />
