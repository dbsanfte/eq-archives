<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hekk Fire</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Seems none of the old epic weapons are really &quot;epic&quot; level anymore, nor are there any new ones.<br />
<br />
  For the effort required to get the epics shouldn't it still be better than a vault space holder?   I realize no epic 2.0 is in the works, but how hard or imbalancing would it be to just go ahead and up the ratios on these things to current useful levels?   How many would bring their epic out of retirement if it 50/45 instead of the current 40/45 ratio?   Windblade still has a better ratio, but is it nearly as hard to get?  Or as rare? Fix the other melee classes' epics similarly of course.<br />
<br />
  Wouldn't SOE rather have people motivated to quest for their epics instead of going bazaar trader and buying a windblade?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lejina Bloodbath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Epics are Kunark weapons.<br />
<br />
Windblades are PoP weapons.<br />
<br />
Should a Kunark weapon be better than a PoP weapon? No.<br />
<br />
Epics stoped to be Epic with Velious.<br />
Dragon Necropolis weapons have comparable damage output to epics and every 2handers from ToV are better than them.<br />
<br />
The epics used to be the best weapons available, in the Kunark ERA.<br />
Then there has been the Velious weapons.<br />
Then the Luclin weapons.<br />
Now its the PoP weapons.<br />
<br />
If you wish to play with the encounters of 2 years ago, i doubt SoE would mind. Actually thats a great way for them to have the folks going for different ecounters. If everyone would go for the PoP stuff, they would be quite bummed since they would need to make more of it so we can all play with.<br />
<br />
For the first time since the creation of the Epics, the members of the guilds who cannot kill the end mobs have access to a weapon clearly superior to their epic (the raiders got access to such weapons with Velious).<br />
<br />
Heres my tip :<br />
Take the upgrade and go kill stuff, dont complain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kizzestra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Epic weapons are not &quot;EPIC&quot; weapons. If people start to get that idea through their heads it would be alot better. The so-called &quot;epic&quot; weapons are simply high end Kunark particle-weapons as they are called by SOE. You did your quest for them, they got outdated, get a better weapon. I don't think you are going to get them to upgrade your SSoY even though that was once one of the best weapons in EQ.<br />
<br />
Besides, I think SOE would like you to do new things in the game. If your weapon is top-notch and from 3 expansions ago then you may not have the same desire to go to new places in the game to try to earn a better weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hekk Fire</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I see your point.<br />
<br />
   Guess I'm just disappointed since my guild seems to be doing a lot of epic encounters these days.   I would love to have Innoruuk's Curse, but can't justify the effort for it considering what I can buy so easily.<br />
<br />
  I seem to have trivialized my own epic by buying a nice sword for a nice price.   Given the opportunity, I will further trivialize it without a doubt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ganaith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I still ocassionaly use my epic. Lance of thunder beats it senseless in dps though :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jinsei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">They shoulda expanded the epic quest with each expansion. add damage, stats, and proc do more while lessening weapon delay. More things in quest, only available to those who beat the epic in last expansion. Would have been better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Khat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">They shoulda expanded the epic quest with each expansion. <br />
<br />
I agree, our epic, (and all others) should scale relative to the newest expansion.<br />
<br />
To me that sounds like the most obvious and realistic approach.<br />
<br />
Epic should be &gt; all, period.<br />
<br />
Take out the `sense of accomplishment`, etc. out of the equation and here is what we get:<br />
<br />
Innoruuk's Curse<br />
14 different zones<br />
19 different NPCs<br />
Faction issues from the beginning<br />
Unrelenting timesinks for some ultra-rare to rare required items<br />
Hoping the mobs for rare drops are up<br />
Hoping you can acquire the forces needed to engage the mobs for rare drops if and when they are up<br />
<br />
<br />
Common drop Uber_weapon_01 2X better than epic<br />
Gather group<br />
Zone in to PoP<br />
Kill PoP_mob_01<br />
Loot<br />
<br />
The more expansions we get, the better the weapon drops become, the less desireable the epic is going to be percieved.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Keyan Aubaine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Epic is one groupable easily. Now try and justify how a one groupable weapon should better than weapons that take 50 well trained and well geared people used to work together to get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jupke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Epic weapons do not exist.<br />
<br />
They are called particle weapon quests.<br />
<br />
Go kill Rallos and get yourself a better particle weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dkhar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">What if they let you do a quest PoP style to upgrade the already existing particle weapon/epic ? Maybe an Epic Rune that would take a raid force of 50 people to get. Attach it to your Epic and it would gain bonus' that might equal todays weapons ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Brazzo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Originally posted by Keyan Aubaine <br />
Epic is one groupable easily. Now try and justify how a one groupable weapon should better than weapons that take 50 well trained and well geared people used to work together to get. <br />
<br />
except that the 50 trained/geared people are going to get 4 or 5 other great drops off that same kill and it will take a couple hours.  SK epic will surely take more than 100 man hours, and i'd be interested to watch a one-group Lhranc raid by people who actually could use an SK epic.<br />
<br />
the epic quest at the time was way harder than other quests in the game and people did it because it gave the best weapon.  the weapon was a little better, but the quest was a lot harder.  people tolerated that because there wasn't a comparable weapon, which is no longer true.<br />
<br />
i don't think this is one of the bigger things wrong with the game, but it wouldn't be ridiculous to retune this at least a little.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Xieroth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">/sigh<br />
<br />
I'll probly never see my epic till I can solo the entire thing as time vs reward is crap. I still want it thought. It's just a goal I set out and I'd like to finish at some point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gorrum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Whats sad is the casters continue to get use out of thier epics (for the most part) even with the new items added since, not the hybrids/warrior. Ours has a great proc and nice stats..its just the damage ratio thats off by comparison...and anyone willing to be reasonable realizes that the epic (ours at least) is an incredible time sink. Its just a damn shame to see a weapon so cool in its look,with such a really neat back story, become bank-space junk. These items (the epics) were some of the most creative work the people at verant/SoE have EVER done.  To the people who have done the epic..remember how you felt when you handed the coin in, etc and got the blade...held it in your hands. Damn, but that was awesome..the columnation of months of labor, right there! My whole guild was happy as they knew we had all earned it.  I pity the up and coming sks..who will never know that thrill as there is no real impitus for them to strive for it now, and if they did get it..the thrill wont be as great due to the fact they know they are holding what is now a sub-par weapon. :(<br />
My 2 bits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jobrill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">It's a quest from THREE DAMN EXPANSIONS AGO!<br />
<br />
I wish someone would link something where some member of the Dev Team said that the &quot;Epics&quot; were supposed to be the Be all and End all of all weapons for all time. Do you sit around whining that Blood Ember needs to be upgraded to Ornate Armor Level?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Elkar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Yes it's from 3 expansions ago, but I don't think that is the point.  Many people consider particle weapons to be &quot;epic&quot; in that it is a quest so involved and intense that it should be top-end.<br />
<br />
I started EQ during the Velious era, so I am not doing IC.  There is no point, my current weapon is better.  But for the game's sake, wouldn't it be nice if they upgraded the &quot;epic&quot; weapons to be top end, so that it was a worthwhile accomplishment for a very involved quest that is still in the game.  I think that is the point.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, its a shame that some other class &quot;epic&quot; weapons are still viable, while ours is not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Keblez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">maybe something along the lines of the khukri quests (ending in greenmist)<br />
<br />
you could get another quest, which would be harder than the epic by a factor of x. you complete the quest, handing in the stuff and the epic. you then get a weapon which is better than the epic by a factor of x.<br />
<br />
maybe more than one for each class could be introduced.<br />
<br />
no wait, this would require SOE to actually do something.. nm then :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Cirulik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">It would indeed be nice, if Sony considers this a RP-game at all and not a colorful chat room, to keep the class-Epic-quest idea alive.<br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe the Khukri idea - but I'm biased because I decided early to do just Greenmist and not Inny's Curse, and I like the &quot;turn-in-for-upgrade&quot; model as you get higher in levels and able to do more.<br />
<br />
So if Sony reads these boards for more reason than to look for items to nerf, I hope thay listen and put a little more of the RP-history back in and some day give us a reason and a way to upgrade.<br />
<br />
Oh and I still use Greenmist at times - but even as MT, it's just situational.......&lt;sigh&gt;</div></div><hr />
