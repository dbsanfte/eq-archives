<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Akronis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Now that numeric mana is out in all the new UI's, has anyone seen exactly how much mana bite spells give? I checked it on myself, and when it landed I lost 60 mana, which makes sense (200 - 20% pres = -160 + 100 from recourse = -60).<br />
<br />
However... I talked to a cleric from another guild on my server that uses SK's a lot in tank groups on raids and he claims that he saw a 200 mana gain from regular bites. Has anyone tested this at all to find out, and is he just pulling my leg? Also, do we know if it gives more mana if we land a critical blast or exceptional heal? I've meant to bug people in my groups to find out, but I hate bugging people about such trivial stuff on raids. If I missed a similar topic on my search I apologize.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'll look into today shouldn't be too hard to tell since i box a cleric will just look at his UI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rhumba_Kween</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I vote for pulling your leg. I doubt there is anything that would allow for a crit on the mana increase portion, like there is on the heal side of things.<br />
<br />
But maybe (and its a small maybe) a crit is tied to a crit on the mana increase?<br />
<br />
As you can tell I've not investigated at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">should only take about 10 minutes to find out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Update sorry so late but you know what when i zbite my beastlords mana bar # does go up exactly 200 mana... i think i was execptional healing everytime i cast zbite to check (checked like 10x) but i mean every single zbite couldn't of exe on the bst...?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">bump... anyone want to confirm or deny that our zevfeers bite gives 200mana to group per cast?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ghismonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Mine is also giving 200 mana per cast.  I've taken up 3 boxing, and it was giving 200 mana on both my 65 cleric and 62 shaman, critical heals or blasts didn't seem to matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Okay now someone with ancient say how much it gives hehe :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Shh! Don't let SOE hear this. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Scal4u</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ancient is giving what it should.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>DConquest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">This is not new actually, but never really mentioned.  Not really in fear of SoE finding out, cause they know... but other mana regen classes or Warriors. Since to them it's 200 mana everyone min, so that must mean we give FT 20 ( OMG, we can replace chanters )... when it's rare that we actually cast it on every pop and avg's out to be half of that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">So basically the basic spell is better than the Ancient?  While that seems strange to me, I won't complain too loudly if you won't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Scal4u</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">In terms of mana, sure. Although I don't know why someone would not mem both.  Although the Heal pales in comparison to the twitch, the heal is still fairly attractive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I was just saying that it was strange to have an Ancient version of a spell be inferior to the normal version you get several levels earlier, in any way.  Considering the difficulty involved in acquiring the spell, I would have thought it would be better in every way.</div></div><hr />
