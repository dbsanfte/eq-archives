<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>spanky4458</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i want to start to dual box, but im not sure what i need,  from what ive searched i realize i can do it with one comp.  but do i need 2 accounts.  im off to search for eqwindows but any info would be greatly appreciated<br />
<br />
thanks:confused:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>natus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">1) you will need a new account key for your 2nd account but Sony makes that &lt;a href=&quot;https://store.station.sony.com/hardgood.jsp?SKU=EQEVO-HG-SW0803-EQEVOL&quot;&gt;easy&lt;/a&gt; when the download is in stock<br />
<br />
2) you don't need eqwindows since EQ will run in windowed mode now, ALT R to release your mouse from the first instance and ALT TAB to the 2nd instance of EQ running, click on it, ALT ENTER to activate that character and repeat the process to get back to your first EQ instance<br />
<br />
3) you might want to just copy your current eq install to a new drive instead of patching a whole new install, unless you do purchase it online from Sony at which point you'll be asked to save it somewhere on your machine<br />
<br />
<br />
it will take a little practice at first timing your window transitions to taunt, slow, heal or whatever spell/abilites the 2nd char you plan on making will use<br />
<br />
<br />
good luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Silvershadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You need a second account and you need to buy all the expansions you want to use on that account for it as well. Other than that, it's all there already, be it with eqwindows or the built-in window mode.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tirnan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I somewhat ineffectively two and 3 box at times (all on seperate machines).  I know one person who can 4 box better than I two box.<br />
<br />
Learn to make hotkeys... they will become your friends.  The more stuff you can combine in a single hotkey, the more effective you become.<br />
<br />
Mob positioning isnt too much of a pain with the main char, but you do have to anticipate where you are stopping your mobs etc.  The challenge is fun, but in long play sessions can begin to wear you down.<br />
<br />
Good Luck and enjoy.  I suggest you start in a zone you know you can solo to learn timing and positioning etc.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>spanky4458</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">thanks for all the help, ive decided to wait until i can afford a laptop to dual, i figure it will be much easier as far as setup and gameplay</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kuvak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Actually I just recently started dual boxing on the same machine, and I first tried it using the default windowed mode for EQ, but it was way too much of a pain changing windows. Now I use EQWindows and it's a simple key press to switch windows, and it's near-instant too, which makes it much more manageable to me. It is best to copy your EQ folder to another one though, and set your secondary box down to the lowest possible graphics settings, and turn off sound. Then set your primary one to whatever your computer can handle. Good luck.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Noctix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I dual box on a single machine using eqw.  My two characters are a sk and a rogue (I always play with a friend who 3 boxes a monk, cleric, and shaman).  Both of my windows are the same size and I use the same interface on both.<br />
<br />
I actually prefer having two windows on one machine to using two seperate computers.  I find it far easier to only have to worry about a single keyboard and mouse.  Plus, with a rogue and sk, I always have one character facing the other in combat, which helps me keep track of both characters and all the mobs.<br />
<br />
I get good performance, almost no lag at all.  I only have a 1ghz cpu too, although I do have a 128MB Geforce4 and 768MB RAM.  That's not an amazing computer by any means though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tymor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I two box my SK and either a cleric or shaman.  If getting a seperate computer isn't an issue, then I would strongly recommend it.  As mentioned, if you don't know how to do macros learn now.  They will make life so much easier.  With macros and seperate computer healing/nuking/debuffing is a single keystroke.  Having monitors with two different vantage points is addictive all by itself, it is invaluable when watching for adds or trying to avoid adds when pulling. <br />
<br />
There are alot of good threads over on the cleric board for making macros, and even botting.  Definately check them out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>ZilshasisEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I three box on one machine using EQW. Since you can only Alt-CTRL-S between two boxes with EQW I unlock the mouse in the middle session so I can always swich between them. I box a shadowknight, a wizard and a shaman. Works great :)<br />
<br />
I start them all up from the same EQ install, I run the patcher on the first one and just set all grafics settings to Low and play from there. It takes a while to zone and such, but I only have a AMD XP1700+ with 512mb ram and I use a Geforce IV ti 4200 with 128mb. Windows XP complains about lack of virtuel memory at times, but thats life :) <br />
<br />
Thus I would recommend getting atleast a gb worth of ram, the difference really is noticable. Even if you don't two-three box.</div></div><hr />

Yeah I'm the same, its way easier with that quick key, if you get crafty you can actually setup on of your mouse buttons (using the intellipoint software) to switch the screens just by using a mouse button (say mouse5 :P).<br />
<br />
I currently either Tri box on three boxes.<br />
Or Dual on the big machine and run the healer on the second next to me if my flatmate needs the pc ;).<br />
<br />
Pretty easy once you get the hang of it.<br />
<br />
I use SK, Druid, Chanter (trying to replace druid due to only having ghetto heal :P)</div></div><hr />

I three box on one machine using EQW. Since you can only Alt-CTRL-S between two boxes with EQW I unlock the mouse in the middle session so I can always swich between them. I box a shadowknight, a wizard and a shaman. Works great :)<br />

Your absolutely wrong about ONLY being able to Alt-CTRL-S between EQW. Alt - Tab is the only thing needed. Directions for the Windows XP Alt-Tab fix are as follows:<br />
<br />
Step One: Download the Windows Compatibility Tool Kit from <br />
 <br />
here (http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;FamilyID=09DAC794-B803-4B92-83C9-6A9E8B801434)<br />
<br />
Step Two: Install it<br />
<br />
Step Three: After installed, start the program from your start menu.Windows Application Compatibility Toolkit then in that sub menu. Compatibility Administration Tool<br />
<br />
Step four: Select &quot;Search&quot; from the top bar<br />
<br />
Step Five: Select Query Database<br />
<br />
Step Six: In the box Search for application type in EVERQUEST<br />
<br />
Step Seven: In the bottom box you should see the everquest search result. Double click it.<br />
<br />
Step Eight: In the right window pane you should see at the top eqgame.exe. Right click it and select Disable Entry<br />
<br />
Step Nine: Close out the program and start up EQ as you normally would.<br />

btw this was copied from Sanctuary of the Silver Moon Guild website. (Although if u go to everquest windows website and search the forum there are alot of posts on the subject.)</div></div><hr />
