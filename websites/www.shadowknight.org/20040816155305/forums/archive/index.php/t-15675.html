<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dracas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is this charm a part of a bigger quest. I found a NPC in Mistmoore at the very entrance that won't go any further on talking when you don't have the charm.<br />
I now have the charm, but wanted to know if anyone have tried this yet. Please let me know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xygoz Shadowreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">havent been to MM since before i got my charm...ill try look into this...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Putrid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Its the only charm I have and it sucks.  It would be great if it led to something better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have five charms.  Kinda fun to have a charm bracelet, but the most recent charm kinda obsoletes all the others.  A pity.<br />
<br />
If this does lead to other quests, I would be very interested.<br />
<br />
Some tips on the charm of the brotherhood quest -- each race of NPC drops a different medallion.<br />
<br />
Ogres drop platinum.<br />
<br />
Trolls drop gold.<br />
<br />
Elves drop silver.<br />
<br />
Humans drop bronze.<br />
<br />
Something like that, anyway.  So if you keep killing elves to try to get the platinum medallion, you'll never get one.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Khat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">A Ranger in my guild got the Brotherhood charm last night.<br />
Someone on made a good point regarding the race/class issue associated with it.<br />
Everyone gets wolf form cast on them and bang, max stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hatre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Eirod Haerod is infact one of the NPC's in the lead up of the quest for the charm of the brotherhood however as most are aware (since many who have it don't know of her existance) you can skip her entirely and just give the man the coins for the to receive the charm.<br />

Also regarding you point Khat thats true of any illusion, race value (as far as the charm's concerned)  taken from your apparent not your actual.  S you can do it with enchanter illusionsas well as wolf formfrom a druid or ranger.</div></div><hr />
