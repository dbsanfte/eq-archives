<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Pheargore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Catching up on some of the latest threads reminds me of a few reasons why I play more and read less now a days...<br />
<br />
Mainly, I play and have fun now, stopped worrying about fixing the game for SoE or even trying to give them feedback. Take the game for what it is, a broken set of bits that loosely re-creates a RPG adventure experience better than what is currently available (based on several sets of criteria, User Base, Game Play, Etc.)<br />
<br />
If you are tired of feeling like a game designer, class balancer, advanced SOE math wizard, then STOP! Either you can try to make your own game, or continue to work for them for free. <br />
<br />
Did anyone ever create something as a child or adult, you look at it and think, that's okay, kinda fun, but I know too much about it to appreciate it fully. Everyone else not involved in the creation process thought your work was genious, but you were left feeling unsatisfied... EQ will give you that same feeling if you learn more about that game through 2nd hand experience than 1st hand experience. If you tell the Dev's to add 3 secret aggro keeping abilities that combined at the right keystroke rate create a ubber 40k Death Touch, they do it, then you use it all the time and tell all your online friends how 31337 you are, do you feel smart? Cool? Powerful? No, I think you'd feel like you wasted 5 dollars renting that Porn when you blew your load in the first 30 seconds on the Opening scene..... Similar to someone's comment on how GoD Boss wins feel so much better than previous boss encounters because they had to work to win. A zone wide -300 to all Stats modifier for instance makes things tough :)<br />
<br />
SK's have been broken since I started playing when Velious came out. They were even more borken before then according to others that played Beta-Kunark. We are too powerful in a small set of circumstances, so in return we are under powered in other areas that just happen to be important in the high end game. By the time they fix that issue, the high end game has changed to the point that new issues crop up.<br />
<br />
Quick Example:<br />
225 Weapon Skill Cap - Probably brought down from 250 due to Feared mobs not being able to defend themselves during testing. So because SK's can solo like no other Tank class, when they show up to a raid to do something other than Tank, Can't hit Shit! /ooc need Ranger Attk buff please!!<br />
<br />
So again, for about 2 years I thought Brael and crew were all whinners.. but as I found out for myself, since SK's are not broke at all until the very End Game, people think all the High Level SK's are whinny little babbies or All SK's suck at any given level.....<br />
<br />
Neither are true, the High Level SK's are bored and tired of getting the shaft by guilds/raids/GoD groups and the rest of the SK's are standing around wondering what the problem is.. &quot;Common I tanked in PoJ when the Ranger had to log with my Bazaar twink gear and was doing ubber DPS!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway, my 2 cents, carry on...<br />
<br />
(wow the turn over rate of vocal SK's on this board is about the same as the turn over rate at the local McDonald's)</div></div><hr />

After checking your magelo, just what are you basing this on?<br />
<br />
why I play more and read less now a days... <br />
<br />
Here's a thought....post less too, k?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Warrl Kyrie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">After checking your magelo, just what are you basing this on?<br />
<br />
<br />
     I believe he merely either made a mistake in wording or has a mistaken definition of End Game.<br />
<br />
     I remember when I was leveling up my first toon, which happens to be my Shadow Knight, I was under the assumption that level 60 meant you were end game. After all, what else was there to do once you capped out your levels? There were no AA at the time. Hence the logical end of the game for that toon.<br />
<br />
     He may have also meant that he didn't feel that Shadow Knights are broken until 60+ or 65+ or what ever.  I personally don't feel that I'm broken at the point of the game I am in. Then again, I don't ever aspire to tank anything that quads for 2k or the like.  As of now my tolerance is about Ferubi level with an occasional 900 hitter thrown in.  My equipment isn't anything special, I don't have a ton of AA and I raid only once per week, schedule permitting.<br />
<br />
     The definition of broken also seems to vary from person to person. I for one feel that broken means that I can't do my job with the tools I have available to me.  Others seem to feel that broken means a diffrent class being far surperior at the given job, in this case, tanking.  <br />
<br />
     I think that the level of the game I am currently at, which is about to enter VT, I can do the job required of me.  Both on raids and single group situations. Can a Warrior do the job better than me? In most cases yes. Does that make a Shadow Knight broken, not really. We can still do our jobs, just not as efficiently as a Warrior. Means that Shadow Knights need some tweaking to bring us in line is all.  As for the arguement of, &quot;Then why have a Shadow Knight at all?,&quot; not everyone min-maxes. In fact, most people in the game do not min-max. Some of the most successfull and enjoyable times I've had in EQ have been with non-typical groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Your level of play was actually the salad days for us.  Off tanking if VT like crazy.  Mezz tanking and plow tanking in SSRA.  Pulling.  So I can see why you think there is no issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Pheargore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I can clarify for the eternally bitter...<br />
<br />
I don't expect some of you to understand simple logic and recognize patterns and trends.<br />
<br />
Trying to get into the End Game, you realize all the issues and bias against SK's. I don't expect the band wagon SK to understand what I am saying. You can go from 1-65 with no issues, you can contribute vastly on lots of things. It is always at the end game though that the balance of power is noticed.<br />
<br />
Basic exponential math. By the time they fix it, the next expansion comes out and re-breaks it. I know I am not at the End Game, I have always been an expansion or two behind. That is why it is easy for me to say this. Since I am behind, I see no issues in my play until I try to push into or catch up to the current End Game level. Then I find out from everyone why they don't want a SK, or why the SK shouldn't get X loot, or why SK's suck, or why I can't Tank this MoB or that MoB that I'd already tanked 2 months ago, Etc. <br />
<br />
Same logic why 72 people can wipe on a Zerg raid that are better equiped that 16 people that do it the next day. Difference being the main healer in charge of the healers is not dumbass that day. Or someone put their bing down during the raid for once.<br />
 <br />
- Peace</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Moonslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I know I am not at the End Game, I have always been an expansion or two behind.<br />
<br />
Yeah... I still don't see why you're posting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Thenger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I don't really understand your post to be honest with you, the more of the end game I see, the more happy I am in being a shadow knight.  The people who say that SK's suck, are normaly people who played with a hand full who didn't know what the hell they were doing.  <br />
<br />
We may not have that high damage migration as warriors, but knights are able to tank in GoD, even off tank mobs in GoD that have their high DPS.  One word, &quot;shielding&quot; can help you tank.  Right now I am only at 8% shielding, but I hope to get that up soon.  I am lucky to be in a guild that sees the uses of the shadowknights, and knights in general.<br />
<br />
Try to impress the people you play with, show them that shadow-knights don't suck.  And as for the problem with shadow-knights being broken with every new expansion, we just need to learn to adapt to the game.  When we started in GoD, I thought that SK's were tottaly useless in so many ways, the deeper we get into GoD and the more gear I get, I see that SK's are not broken.<br />
<br />
EQ is a game based around loot, that's the simple truth, without the best equipment you won't be able to see the full power of your class.  Skill does help, it helps a ton, but so does equipment.  It's late and I may not be making all that much sense.. LOL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The question a lot of people have is this:  Why is it considered balanced that Shadow Knights must have much better gear than nearly any other class in order to accomplish their primary job?  To many people, the fact that we must have gear of a quality much higher than other classes in order to be adequate, means that we are broken, or at least underpowered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Rueeliar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My complaint is not that we cannot do our jobs, but that we require so much more support to do it in high-end raid environments.  We CAN do our jobs... we just usually require more backup/assistance from other individuals to do it at the end-game content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>PokenHopen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">that or it is litterally impossible with out riposte disc or defensive disk because we can get 1 rounded and have no way of stoping it like every other class(excluding casters).  The biggest issue atm is of the three tank classes 2 of them have no way to mitigate damage or stop it for a short time while even dps classes can.</div></div><hr />
