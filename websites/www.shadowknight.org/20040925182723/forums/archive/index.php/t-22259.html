<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>The Zenogias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Which guild has a pretty decent website showing basically what's going on at the later stages of GoD going along the story line? I have been watching the Arch Overseers for awhile, but I was wondering who else was making advancements</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Saruton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There seems to be no advancement in Tacvi atm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>signa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">according to what ive heard, the first named in the zone keeps crashing tacvi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">We are all stuck at the same spot. Rumor says it will be fixed soon, but until then, probably won't see much updating.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Askeer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The devs are working on fixing / tuning tacvi for now so you will have to wait for that for news updates.<br />
The question is, what guilds will still be around when they fix tacvi ? :p<br />
Depends on how long it takes. But another 3 months cockblock like Uqua would suck.<br />
It's already been more than a month since AO's kill and at least 10 guilds (that I know off) are stuck in Tacvi now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Daywalka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You'd think that it would be easier to have things not fuck up in the end-zones of an expansion nowdays. Hell, this is the seventh expansion (Kunark, Velious, Luclin, PoP, Ykesha, LDoN, GoD) and they haven't been able to get high-end encounters right the first time yet. I hope that OoW will come out in mid 2009, when SoE has another 5 years to get shit straight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Space</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Tacvi partial tune up going in 29th july<br />
see the dev journal for more info</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>signa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Tacvi Changes<br />
Hello all,<br />
<br />
Later today, we'll be pushing out an update for Tacvi to all live servers. Although this update will only affect a small portion of the audience for EverQuest, those that are affected have been waiting eagerly for it, so I wanted to run through the changes that you'll notice and talk briefly about what is coming in the near future for that zone.<br />
<br />
First, I believe that I've located and corrected the problem that was sometimes causing a crash in the first event in Tacvi. I've run through the event for many hours now, both by myself and with the aid of a testing guild and the zone has remained stable throughout.<br />
<br />
Second, some tuning changes have been made to the bosses of Tacvi, so some things may work slightly differently than before. Although the encounters themselves haven't changed in any major fashion, don't assume that tactics you've ruled out in the past still won't work.<br />
<br />
Finally, I've laid the groundwork for a change to how the zone works. Although this is the least noticeable of the changes, it's also the biggest. Tacvi currently works like other dynamic raid zones. Players gain lockout times based on their accomplishments in the zone. I'm in the process of changing Tacvi so that it will remember which bosses you have killed recently. Then, the next time you start up the dynamic zone, the zone will only spawn those NPCs that would have respawned since you last killed them. This will negate the need for lockout timers in Tacvi. The code to support this change is brand new and doesn't exist on live servers yet, so this change must wait until the next full patch to EverQuest before it can go in. In the meantime, the most noticeable difference you'll see is that all of the bosses in Tacvi are now up as soon as the zone spawns.<br />
<br />
Although I'd normally rather wait until all the changes are all done before pushing the zone out, I'm pushing out these first few now, because I know how eager people are for the changes to the initial encounters.<br />
<br />
Thanks all,<br />
