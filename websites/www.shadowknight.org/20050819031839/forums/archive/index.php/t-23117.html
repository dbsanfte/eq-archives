<br />
I 3 box with a 65 druid, mixed ep gear.....and a 62 mage twink..medium quality baz gear with a small bit of ornate...<br />
<br />
Been a long time since i have done a POJ Trial...but need to do one for my mage....last thing he needs for EP flags....<br />
<br />
Anyone boxed a trial recently with less than normal group?  Think its doable with the 3 box?<br />
<br />
Don't want to trouble too many of my guidlies...as they are grinding away to 70 in OoW...so what is the minimum you think i would need to get through trial<br />
<br />
thanks in advance...<br />

<br />
just happened that another guildie needed a trial last night...so did it with full group inc lvl 70 wizzy.....those mobs went down like cheap $2 hos.....took more time getting everyone into zone than doing trial...<br />
<br />
still interested in whether i could do it 3 box....but ill give it a try later...too much other stuff to do atm....<br />

We went in with fullbuffs and a chanter but chanter fell through world while putting his horse back up before first wave.  I was probably about the same as you at the time, probably less ac even.<br />

It was the wizards show almost entirely. I think I was wielding a heavy bludgenor at the time.</div></div><hr />
