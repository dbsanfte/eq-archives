<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Azaezel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone know Marl Kustane's respawn time? <br />
<br />
Yes I tried search, guess someone kacked him and I don't want to miss him again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Maelrae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm thinkin' he's got a whacky spawn timer. I've seen him 1-1/2 to 2 days after I have done a turn in.<br />
<br />
The good news is, after last night, I don't ever have to camp his happy ass again.<br />
<br />
Good luck!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Utanlain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">As of today, we've had 7 days without Marl spawning on server Venril Sathir.<br />
<br />
SKs doing their Epic are getting a little edgy, especially when GMs say they can't help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Feriin Cydovu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Not really sure... I know I did the blood turn in yesterday at 9 AM est. and today I turned in the mummy wrappings for  the will of inny. at  5 pm est . <br />
<br />
I pretty much afk camped him the entire time , checking about once an hour till I saw him up. ( note I was at a Raid for about  4 hours during that time, it is possible he spanwed then) . anyway do the math  thats 32 hours before he respawned...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Utanlain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Then we definitely have a problem with our Marl pop on Venril Sathir :)<br />
<br />
The GMs ask us to wait another 5 days before repetitioning for it though...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kaledine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Marl has a 36 hour respawn time. I know because a SK from another guild did a turn in... 1 day later he spawned and some other SK beat me to it.. and then I got the last two turn ins. Yesterday and this morning.. within 1 1/2 days of each other..<br />
<br />
At least that's how it is on Vallon Zek</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Feriin Cydovu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Kaledine....<br />

    You're fucking brilliant.. especially since the question of his spawn time was answered already..  you even contradict yourself in how long the respawn time is. <br />
<br />
First you say  it is 36 hours , then say its within a  1 1/2 days ( Do you know what that means?  It means you are saying this.&quot; respawn time is anywhere from instant to 1 1/2 days later.&quot; atleast that is what the second part of your post says.)<br />
<br />
God I hate people who can't read/ comprehend what other people have already posted. and then again can't even comprehend what they say...<br />
<br />
( Yes I am a dick , go fuck off...)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Khat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Feriin,<br />
While we're on the subject of fucking brilliant people, what part of the rocket science known as Magelo are you having trouble with?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Excuse me if I dont sit here and read every response to a post. I saw there was a question asked so I answered it. <br />
<br />
Sorry if you can't comprehend plain english as I believe you read too deeply into my post. I was never implying his respawn time was a random spawn. <br />
<br />
And where was it already answered? Someone did say they saw a 1 1/2 to 2 day spawn.. someone claimed he hasn't spawned in 7 days... someone said 32 hours... I see no definite answer... just people's experiences... so that's what I merely posted... my experience with the mob.<br />
<br />
God I hate people who have nothing better to do with their time than to flame those who try to help.<br />
<br />
Go fuck myself? nah... take your own advice, bitch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Feriin Cydovu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">There were only 4 responces  to the orginal question. I would understand your statement if this were 4+ pages long. <br />
<br />
Again reread your post you stated his respawn is 36 hours, not that it took him 36 hours to respawn. Huge difference in how the  2 of those read.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now onto the subject of Magelo..<br />
<br />
When I attempt to update my equipement I keep getting an error message, due that error I can not read any text from the Magelo site.<br />
<br />
Oh and Khat atleast my Magelo links work..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Uggliey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">He spawns roughly 36 hours +/- 12 hours.   I just parked a low level assling rogue I had in paineel there, and got him once, and then again 36+ hours after a server patch.   He may of popped sooner, but was not up right after the patch.  This NPC should not despawn on turn it.  Just a pointless pain in the ass, it's not like it's important to slow the amount of epics entering the game any more.<br />
<br />
Speaking of pointless....,  hey you useless fuck who added nothing to the thread except attacking other posters.  Why don't you add something to the topics instead of spanking your virtual pecker.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Khat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Oh and Khat atleast my Magelo links work..<br />
Touché, Feriin.<br />
It seems my Magelo listing wonked out on me and I didn't even know it.  Being that it's worked fine all this time and it's all server-side it can't be on my end.  (Especially since all of us use the same naming convention to point to Magelos).<br />
I hit Update Character without any changes and all is back to normal.<br />
<br />
I appreciate you pointing it out that the Magelo was screwy.  What errors are you getting?  Perhaps they are somehow related.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>kutsokare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Server went down Wednesday morning this week...It's friday mrning now and Marl isn't up on Emarr.  I just need Will of Innoruuk and I can do the final turnin, but with Marl being an ass I'm not sure.  As for his spawn time, I've heard from Allakhazam he is a 3 day spawn after server goes up, or 1 week if he is killed.  Not sure if this is true, but If he pops early saturday mrning, then the 3 day thing will be true.</div></div><hr />
