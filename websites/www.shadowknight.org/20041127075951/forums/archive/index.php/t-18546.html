<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Davistus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey everyone, havent posted in a while, i am have a 53 SK on fennin ro, hes semi twinked, fungi, rbb, windblade....*feedbcak on whether to keep wb would be great if not np* and i was wondering where the perfect spot for me and my RL best friend (52 shammy) to partner. Right now we hunt in velks....my DPS isnt all that great, so exp is slow at times, perhaps Howling Stones? I did use a search on this forum and found different all different levels of partners. Any feedback is much appreciated thank you all~<br />
<br />
P.S.~Where can i find a good damage parser?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You can maybe duo PoJ?<br />
<br />
http://www.yalp.org/<br />
for a parser.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ramgar SK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Fear kite the flies in PoD.<br />

Your windblade is fine, if you want more DPS, sell that and get a War Marshal's Bladed Staff and upgrade your armor with the profit.<br />
<br />
LDoN was great exp for me around 55.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Davistus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Also i have offers of a war marshall blade staff and 17k or 26k for my windblade (i payed 28k) the 2k is nothing im just wondering whether the WMBS is that much better</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Putrid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">WMBS is slightly better than the Windblade but not by too much.<br />
<br />
  Highpass keep nobles and bards would be good exp for you.  Highpass is often camped but it is good exp and loot.  <br />
<br />
The initiates in Gunthak and the back of the armory in dulak are also possibilities.  Other places would include dock people in twilight sea and the guards in good city, can remember name, on the moon.   You could join a POJ basement group or do the tsete flies in POD.  At 55 the flies were not giving much exp to me.  Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ramgar SK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yes, the WMBS has slightly better DPS at 55+.  That alone should be enough to upgrade to it.  The huge price difference is just gravy.  WMBS are going for as low as 5k on a good day on Lanys.  And WB sells for as high as 28k, and sells easy for 25k.  Check out Slein's post in The Armory for more info on dropable weapons:<br />

Also a very good spot is the Shrine Bruisers in Nadox.  They drop weapons frequently, gems sometimes, and plat.  Named can corpse pop there too.  Good loot, safe, easy fear kite, single pullable.  Set up camp at the TM zone in Nadox (outside the temple).  You can get there easy with invis, or easier with a druid (evac from lava when you zone in to Nadox from Gunthak).  Oh, and don't worry about falling in the lava on the bridge, you can't.  :)  I've stood still on the gaps, and didn't fall through.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Davistus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ok well im still 53, but have recieved 3aa since then, my friend hit 53 working on 54. Im going to get baron , hit 55, get Sir, hit 60 get Duke...thats how i plan on doing my levels / aa. Now my question for everyone willing to help me out is.....I am currently hunting in velks...I average about 45dps with my pet...his pet is about 20dps and hes about 10dps with DoT's a total of 75dps. We currently have found velks is better exp than PoJ, PoD, Maidens eye. Any ideas or suggestions that might possible be better exp than velks? Im satisfied with velks, its just if you guys know of a place thats much better for us i would greatly appreciate it.</div></div><hr />
