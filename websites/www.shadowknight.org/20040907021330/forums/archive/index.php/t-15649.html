<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hemlocc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i printed off a full explination of the epic and i was reading about the first mob i had to kill a 55 rouge. i'm sure the description was written when the epic was new so i was wondering if the information was still up to date. it said i needed 1 -2 groups lvl 50 60 people and that the mob i had to kill was resistant to all spells. so my question is am i still going to have to take 2 groups of all mele and clerics or are casters going to be ne use to me? <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shintou Shinai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">One group, 55+. To be on the safe side make sure your MT is 57+, but should be an easy battle anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">he's got heavy resists, but he's not immune to all spells.<br />
<br />
I did him for a guildy not too long ago.... was me, a low 50's cleric, a 58 druid, and the other SK (low 50's).  He hits for maybe 200 max... he's pretty weak.  The fight wasn't even close, I think I got 2 CH's the whole fight.<br />
<br />
So no.... 2 groups at low-mid 50's would be appropriate... at 60, 2 groups is obscene overkill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aoninie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Kurron is a punk, took him out at lvl 45 with 1 group, average lvl around 54, highest was a 60 monk. Cleric was complaining that it was too easy. Just make sure you don't have any bozo's in the group. Had a necro that almost agroed him before I did the exchange. I just saw he was up and put a shout out in PoK, got a group together and dropped him. If you have toons that are KoS, just swim around the wall and pull him to the beach.....too easy.</div></div><hr />
