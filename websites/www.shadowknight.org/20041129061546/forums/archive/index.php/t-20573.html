<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zakko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was thinking about a way to give SK and Paladins a defensive like ability, this is what i cooked up:<br />
<br />
...............<br />
<br />
AA Ability in 3 ranks 5/10/15 aa's progress (30aa's total).<br />
<br />
two weaker and one final, ill skip right to the final as the two others arent what you want anyway.<br />
<br />
Mana Shield 3:<br />
Instant cast time, instant reuse, puts up a buff: &quot;Mana Shield&quot;.<br />
20% of all Melee damage is absorbed by the Mana Shield. <br />
Every 5 Damage absorbed will devour 1 Mana.<br />
<br />
While Mana Shield is in effect, all your spells are as &quot;waiting-to-recycle&quot;. You can still &quot;cast&quot; clicks, procs and AA's, but your spells in spell bar, you cant cast.<br />
<br />
You can at any time click off *Mana Shield* to have your normal self back.<br />
<br />
<br />
...............<br />
<br />
Little Math:<br />
Good SK / Paladin has around 6k Mana, 1mana = 5damage: 6kmana = 30khp.<br />
30k x 5 (20% of total damage) = 150k hp's total damage (of witch 30k is absorbed), to make a 6k mana SK / Paladin go oom (and lose Mana Shield).<br />
<br />
A 2000 hitting mob would do 1600 damage, 2400 would do 1920.<br />
<br />
<br />
Would also like to see SK / Paladins become the 1h / shield masters. Make our 2hand AA's affect 1handers please.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dkhar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I actually like this idea. Quite balanced really, take away our mana and spell casting ability for pure defensive purposes. Would like to be able to click it off though at the last second in order to FD and let the next tank take over - warrior defensive or SK/PAL mana shield.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">-25% mob melee reduction<br />
-35% your melee reduction<br />
+25% spell cast time<br />
3 min duration , 40 min recycle, obtained from 2nd ikkinz trial, disc timer 3, same endurance cost as defensive (10/sec)<br />
<br />
There you go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zakko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Brael is that a fact, or an other suggestion ?<br />
If its a fact, could you please link the name of the this disc.<br />
<br />
Dkhar you can click off the buff at any time, to regain your normal spell casting ability's.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kritr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Okay I have a question? <br />
<br />
Is anyone listening to whatever we say?<br />
<br />
Seems some people think Warriors, Monks and others needed a little fixing and by golly they got it.<br />
<br />
So where do we post our sorrows?<br />
<br />
Maybe better, upgraded AA for melee/ hybrids?<br />
<br />
Get rid of SCS or at least make it an activated AA.<br />
<br />
<br />
Talking to SOE is like talking to my dog. <br />
<br />

:rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>aress</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">your dog at least responds and licks your face</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>aress</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Brael, the 40 minutes recast makes it less than desirable.  In a fast paced progression we need it at least every 25 minutes.<br />
<br />
Also, are you not worried about keeping aggro, or do you think you can channel an aggro spell through when it is slower (unless reverence would negate it, I have not done the math).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Penality for using it, I actually like that part it makes other buffs more attractive as well as spell haste focus allowing for some improvement to characters where we previously had none (also it favors festering over clinging for aggro).<br />
<br />
40 recast is actually good, theres very few situations where you would need it more than that, infact I can't think of any other than a patch day where lots of named pop in kod'taz and thats a bit of a stretch to use as justification for a low recycle.  The only other place would be flesh hunters in Ikkinz trial 3 but again I don't see it as an issue there because you would have it for 2 of the 3 which is reasonable enough, if you die other melees can handle the rest with ripo discs there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>BrikBludgaard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">-25% damage taken - fine<br />
-35% damage done - fine<br />
<br />
-25% Spell casting haste reduction is fine... <br />
<br />
duration should be 2 minutes like defensive(to do the job)<br />
reuse should be 20 minutes (half as powerful as defensive)<br />
<br />
<br />
this would help.<br />
<br />
Brik</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">40 is better I think, 20 is to close to allow a rotation of Knights to replace Warriors tanking large mobs in raids (ya, won't happen but it's possible at 20 much less likely at 40) and SOE wouldn't let us do that.  3 minutes is the better duration also I think since some 1 group encounters do have fights that go that long and the main point of this is to up our surviveability to a reasonable enough point to get us in groups that kill harder 1 group mobs at the very high end point progression wise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">you talking about a +25% mitigation bonus brael, or 25% of *all* mob damage reduced? (ie... does it affect a mob's damage bonus like vie, or no, like defensive?).<br />
<br />
If it's 25% mitigation, there's still no reason to have us tank over warriors on raid mobs, as defensive gives them +45%... plus the fact they mitigate and avoid better on top of that, and have more hp.  I don't think a higher timer is needed to make us unattractive compared to warriors as raid tanks.  But it would be enough to give us a fighting chance if we were the only tank avail, or left alive, or give us a shot to stay alive in trials vs a warrior.  Why not a 20 min timer then?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">di dmg number*.75 like def is that *.55</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Belyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I hate this idea it takes up a buff slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>BrikBludgaard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">20 minutes allows us to use it liberally....  but still half as well as a warrior...<br />
<br />
make us preferred over warriors?<br />
No, I don't think any warrior could make that point...<br />
<br />
the difference between 50% and 25% is still pretty large...  not to mention warriors having 1000HP more than knights nakid...<br />
<br />
either way...  its simply time for us to become raid-eligible tanks second only to warriors.<br />
<br />
Brik</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Except theres no need to use it even half as much as Warriors.  Very few mobs theres a need for it on</div></div><hr />
