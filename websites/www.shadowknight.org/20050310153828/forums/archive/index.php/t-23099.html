<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Krassus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Been there for 57 PH's between overlord and knight camp. Does someone have the loc to the mistress spot ? WTF is up with this spawn  :confused:</div></div><hr />

Easily soloable camp.  Second named dropped the essence for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Krassus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I just have crap luck, was in hate from Friday till last night wiping Tier4 and mistress camp and finally late last night named pop but no essence, almost seems easier for me to do epic 1.0</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Airemus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I feel your pain, i just spent 15+ total hours at the mistress camp, only to have her spawn and not drop the essense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nasiir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I cleared the Mistress PH a dozen or so times without seeing her pop once. Maybe today will be better...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Krassus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It took me about 2 hours to do the amygd eye, pog hair, and pon hide. It took me like 20 mins to setup and kill Varn with 8 people, it took the same for the postorms giant. This stupid PoHate thing is rediculous, I two boxed and killed EVERY named PH on tier 4 even the casters and the mistress. I finally got one DreadLord, one sorcerer and neither dropped it. Tonite I am going to start killing ashebone drakes and if the hide drops then fug it i will do 1.0.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have not even seen a mistress yet in 12 hours of camping. <br />

PoG and PoF combined took about 3 hours.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am hoping for better luck in PoH considering I didn't get my PoG drop until lucky number 66.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Good luck Lynx. I logged on after that post and sure enough the Mistress was standing there. It was the first one I have seen, killed her and she dropped the essence. <br />
<br />
Glad she did. Now comes all the hard parts.. so far everything has been 100% soloable (I dont 2 box) so now its up to finding groups to get this other stuff taken care of.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Iosif_McCloud</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ouch, lol... Might be faster to do the Old Epic..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Voroth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">5 days up in PoH, each day was 8ish hours each.   Mistress popped twice, first time didn't have essense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Krassus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">today is my day 5, maybe it will be my lucky day</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Elkar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Two hours in Hate.  Spent the first hour and a half or so at Mistress with no luck.  Moved over to overlord.  One clear and he popped, dropped essence, and a BP worth like 9k tribute.  Was a lucky day, indeed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Krassus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">5th day was the charm, was killing PHs with my shaman while raiding on SK and overlord spawned  :)  all i gotta say is fook pohate</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Zobb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Can anyone confirm whether the Essence drops off any other named besides Mistress or Overlord?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Croix VorAbaddon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Yes, Got it off Dread Lord something or other. I think it's ALL Tier 4 named. Just camp em all. Hell, camp em and do the Marsinger quest while your there =) That's what I'm going.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Cryptia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Camped the Misstress for about 4 hours total over this past weekend, finally popped sunday morning after two camp clearings.<br />
<br />
I read another thread about camping this spot and it made it sound alot harder than it really was. All you gotta do is snare either the ph or the other mob, fd, wait for the mem wipe, stand up and beat down the snared one. All of this can be done on the steps right in front of the Misstress room. No need to pull all the way out of the house and fight outside.<br />
<br />
The misstress was gimp, roughly the same HPs as the PH and only hit for about 100 more every once in awhile.<br />
<br />
Earlier in the week, a chanty that farms pohate alot said that he saw the Essence drop off of about 3 different named mobs.</div></div><hr />
