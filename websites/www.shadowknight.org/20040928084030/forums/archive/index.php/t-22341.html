<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tomic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Shroud of Undeath was from battle master in chardok.  Don't know if it still drops  when they revamped chardok or not. <br />
<br />
Shroud of Death can usually be found in the bazaar, if not,  velks I think is where it drops.  Shroud of Death Strike is the proc that  happens from this spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Daqar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">That named was located (in Chardok) on the rocky path to the royals after the bridge, where all the skeletons are laying on the side of the path.  There are 2 named in that area, one skeleton and one ghost, I dont remember which was which.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Marruk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Shroud of Undeath seems ridiculously rare.  However, I have seen 2 copies for sale in the bazaar on E'Ci for 100p in the past couple of months.  Shroud of Death is usually available in the bazaar as well, although some idiots are usually trying to get 1000p for it.<br />
<br />
Shroud of Undeath is exactly the same as Shroud of Death, except it includes a skellie illusion.</div></div><hr />
