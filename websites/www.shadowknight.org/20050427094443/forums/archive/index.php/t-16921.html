<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Arcane_Rider</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">trying to decide a race to chose, im mostly going after looks. somewhat RP of a shadow knight, dark and powerful. anyway, im trying to find a good race that looks good in black armour, probably blackened alloy. on my server there isnt too much to chose from in armour, someone just got to shadowscream, does anyone know where i can get images of a few luclin models in black armour? im mostly thinking human or iksar, maybe troll, im definately not going for dark elf though, something just doesnt strike fear like a little dark skinned elf running about. the regen on the iksar and troll would be nice and make leveling up early levels somewhat easy though.<br />
<br />
ive seen a freeport SK in newbie armour, looks pretty cool, so any suggestions or links to images of iksar or troll in black armour?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
edit: found a page on allakhazam that has various armour on different races, iksar looks pretty nice in banded, so blackened alloy should look really cool, and plate looks really good. thing is, lots of iksars have funky looking helms, is that the default iksar helm model or are they special helms, because all i saw was a skull looking helm or no helm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Crynus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The catch about that regen you mention is the exp penalty.  Trolls and Iksars lvl very slowly in comparison to the other races.  Iksar have pretty funky armor graphics too, and you'll be in chain armor for a long time.  Humans look pretty good, and if you can stomach the forehead, erudites look pretty sweet with Luclin graphics.  Might try Darkforge armor, has pretty good stats and good color...iksar can't wear though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>AislinSteele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There's a reason there's so many Dark Elves. Nuff said</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vekro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thats what I choose, they look all sophisticated and cool. And I mean come on?! How evil is neon. Neon lights practically invented the whole evil deal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Paegan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've played all the SK races to at least 30. I like the appearance and overall RP of playing a Troll. But that XP penalty is a killer for a casual player like myself. You start noticing it about the time you leave Paludal :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
Personally I prefer the Erudite. Loinclothes rock :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Arcane_Rider</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i made a human for a few levels, since my friend decided to make his bard a freeport bard, so i wouldnt have to run back to cabilis every time i wanted to train or buy spells. i played an iksar for a level, the regen was great, but with summoned leather and some +hp items, a human is doing very well. theres so many DE shadow knights on the server, as well as troll ones. at least ill stand out in a sense.<br />
<br />
and i might not even do paludal :eek: not like im in any hurry to get anywhere, ill probably be doing newbie armour for a while anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jodgrim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you have Planes of Power training is only a zone away from freeport no matter what race you are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Arcane_Rider</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">thats true, my human sk looks pretty sharp in summoned leather for now though. im working on his newbie armour, and might have my friend bring another character to slaughter all the giants to try and get a giant leaf scarab to drop one of the nodrop things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>TeetoJaxon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Erudite is the only way to go!<br />
<br />
Be a proud dark brother!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Arcane_Rider</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">already have an erudite, hes just not a SK ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Naubi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">To me, male erudites in plate look kinda like Jame Earl Jones in the Conan movie... that's sort of menacing without looking like a freak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>signa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">this was my first character and i made a human based on what a friend of mine told me (damn paladin) its not bad. but i cant see for shit in the dark :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Duke Xerro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Deadeye is your friend as a human. Btw Human sk is the best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Calamity_Daemon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">For looks go: Iksar, Dark Elf, Erudite (Controversal)<br />
For Stats go: Troll, Ogre, Human (Well rounded I think...still slightly controversal)<br />
For just some fun I suggest: Iksar (Rp is so much fun with them), Ogre/Troll (Bash's Dems Guud. Again RP is fun but you can always play a smart beast), Dark Elf/Gnome (Roughly Same stats and Dark Elves look REALLY intimidating if you play them right, be a gentlemen and be DEMANDING and most people will FREAK at you. Gnomes are just wierd and have their strange little gnomy quirks that are wierd too. For some good debates go with the short folk)<br />
<br />
I think that about sums up my opinion. I truly love Iksars and Dark Elves the most because they are so COOL LOOKING. Hands down there is no denying that they look the best in armor. Trolls/Ogres run with a stick up the butt and Humans have those wings at the top of their heads. Erudites look BOSS with some types of armor and gnomes look so funny with their little telescope glasses on their helms. Even though I chose a troll, if I could chose again I would go Iksar (As stated so cool), or a Dark Elf (Not so much because I dont like being everybody but the RP value is priceless). Honestly its all on your preferance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Rugmok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">OGRES SMASH ALL  INCLUDING DE's   NUFF SAID</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Drynnious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I think troll/iksar/de are the best. All look really good. I've played a little of all, but still like the DE.</div></div><hr />
