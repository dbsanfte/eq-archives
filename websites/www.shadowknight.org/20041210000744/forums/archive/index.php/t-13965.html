Lend me your ears!<br />
<br />
Being fairly new in EQ and still kinda low level, I need your help.<br />
I have managed to learn the basics of the game (knowing my way around in newby zones, levelling, chatting, the abreviations SOW, KEI, PoP and PoK ...), now I need a more advanced course ;)<br />
<br />
I have several questions that you, more experienced knights of hate, can answer for me.<br />
<br />
First of all, being lvl29 with my main, being untwinked (mostly, ... a friend bought me a nice crown, so that my hair wouldn't be so messy after a whole day of meleeing :D Oh yeah, and a Dark Reaver that I got from a complete stranger, and that doesn't want to proc because of too low Willpower), I am direly in need of equipment. I would love to quest for it, but I don't know if my gear is good enough to do so.<br />
I wear mainly coterie stuff, the recondite bandit rings and bracers.<br />
<br />
I have read the description of the Darkforge quest, and will make my attempts when I get to lvl 30, but are there other quests that I could do a this lvl? What is this Befallen quest I heard about? And if I there are no quests, could you at least tell me what I should pay attention to when buying stuff? Anything I should really have? For the monent I hunt in South Karena... any better spots? And being a newb, how do I get there?<br />
<br />
I realise that I may be asking stupid questions, but any help would be appreciated!<br />
<br />
PS: I almost forgot! I know the principe of fear kiting, but could someone explain it properly to me? Thx!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bohdy Bagg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">just read up in the 'evil beginnings' section of the board, and *cough* do a few searches. all your questions have been answered numerous times ;) <br />
<br />
can go to eqatlas (http://www.eqatlas.com)  to get lvl break downs and maps/info about most of the zones in EQ</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Putrid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Allakhazam is great for quest info.  I dont know of too many good ones, other than darkforge, at your level.  You could start collecting braids from Sarnak beserkers to get your faction up with the overthere inhabitants.  You would get exp and some loot.  You could then do the workers sledgemallet quest.  You can't use it to gate until level 50 but once you have the hammer you would not have to worry to much about your faction with them.  Many of the Kunark dungeons will give negative faction hits with the overthere inhabitants.<br />
<br />
Fear kiting is simple.  Snare with a darkness, then fear and attack.  Works better with engulfing darkness than clinging.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zakton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Darkforge is good at 30 because you can get exp and work on some of the components for your epic (DF BP, Greaves and Helm).  Plus its good armour if you can't buy anything better or you don't have a sugar daddy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mixtli</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">For level 30 South Karana is a good zone but kinda hard to get groups there these days I've found. <br />
<br />
Nexus scion is fastest way to get there, or th eqeynos pok book but running through karana is even more mind-numbing  then waiting at scion. practice spells wile waiting .  <br />
<br />
If you haven't hunted in a dungeon yet  Paw is a great place to learn.  You will need these skills later on.  <br />
And read this board, use search , use eqatlas and use search some more.</div></div><hr />
