<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lizarde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The wine quest will only work if the Ogre is on one of three factions:<br />
<br />
Dreadguard Outer (DE guards in Nektulos)<br />
Dreadguard Inner (DE guards in Neriak)<br />
Neriak Merchants (don't remember what their faction is called)<br />
<br />
Wine quest can be done while KOS to these factions.  Get your bags full of wine and an invis, and find Lothar in (I believe it is) the Third Gate.  He was indiff to my IKS SK when I did the quest, and the only faction I had at the time was dreadguard outer, so I assume he would be indiff to you.  He is far enough from other NPCs that you should be able to drop invis and be safe, as this is what I did.<br />
<br />
Hand him enough red wine (8 stacks?) and you'll be ally with merchants and dubious with DG inner/outer.  You will still be KOS to some Neriak factions, so invis on your way out.  This allows you to bank/buy/sell in Neriak without any trouble.  Dunno if this makes finding that Ogre safe, though.<br />
<br />
And of course, if the ogre is on another faction you'll need to check which one and fix that one as well.</div></div><hr />

Factions lowered:<br />
<br />
Dark Bargainers<br />
Dread Guards Inner<br />
Dread Guards Outer<br />
<br />
Quests you can do to raise the faction (Dark Bargainers): <br />
Bone Mail Weapon <br />
Book of Turmoil <br />
Bottle of Red Wine <br />
Evil Research  <br />
<br />
Odds are that the red-wine quest will help you fix that faction.  Or the GLS/LS quest in SRo.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>nnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">go apeshit on halflings for a few days. the three guards in misty thicket can be soloed in the early 50s easily. three at a time if you like. hell i think our pet can beat them up solo.<br />
<br />
there are also little halflings in Nektulos forest scattered about to kill. just take them out till you are not kill on site with the guards. it makes getting to the wine quest all the easier. <br />
<br />
to do the wine quest, just use the &quot;hide&quot; trick as you do the trade, or get a friend to invis you while you trade, if that even works still. <br />
<br />
good luck. neriak is a nice town to be able to use for an Iksar so far away from home.</div></div><hr />
