<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ffaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">[I][FONT=Times New Roman] Well I am back to EQ after my 1st go, which ended 'cause of stupid reasons. Anyway, this time I have made an SK on Sullon Zek. I amlooking forward to the PvP aspect, but I was wondering if roleplaying is encouraged as well? If the roleplaying server were PvP I would have started my new character on that one, but as it is not... At any rate, and insight into this would be appreciated. Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Want roleplaying then you best go to FV  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ffaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thank youfor the reply. I am still looking forward to PvP tho (I think!).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>:asylumbound:</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ive been out of the game for awhile but SKs arent for the faint of heart in PVP.  Necros will own you.  It really is disgusting.  Then again the player makes a huge difference.  Good Luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>nezzka is bad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">sullon is diety so its evil newtz good, fewfinator</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ffaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">yeah at least i don't have to worry about necros.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Meriboh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Role-playing is not encouraged…in fact, most people who try to, usually end up being flamed.<br />
Good luck on Sullon Zek. It’s a big gank fest that doesn’t cater to the casual or faint of heart player. Be prepared to fight for every copper piece and equipment you get, as you wont be able to merrily skip into a zone and camp your favourite mob.<br />
And oh yeah, buy a supply of diapers…Never leave your character unattended.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ffaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks very much for the heads up. Sounds like it should be fun... I hope so anyway!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>brian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">What's your character named on Sullon?  I will look you up and give you a few pointers!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>GenoReaper999</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">basically griefing, ganking, and general ass kicking would be roleplaying enough for a sk i think</div></div><hr />
