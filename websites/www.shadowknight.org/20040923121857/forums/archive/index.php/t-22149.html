<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bastardlunatic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My guild just hit sol ro.  We are farming VT.  we are knight heavy and extremely good with large pulls offtanking and shit.  almost all our kills, even firsts, are flawless.  Should we stay the F out of GoD and continue to focus on Vex thal/elementals?<br />
<br />
I really see focusing on GoD as a mistake in progression.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Askeer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hitting GoD without at least Elem Gear is suicide.<br />
(well until everyone's lvl 70, then it will be trivial for everyone).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Menon Lifeblight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I don't see any reason you couldn't kill Rondo and do the single group vxed/tipt trials in your situation.  You can get some nice upgrades that way, and it's a fun change of pace.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't try to go any further until you've at least broken into PoTime, or get those new 5 levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thenger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Vxed/Tipt will be a challange for any body who is not in Time yet.  Progress the way you are through VT and now are moving into the elementals.  Even if you do get past the Vxed/Tipt areas, their is no reason too.  Kod'Taz will rip any tank apart who is not Time equiped.<br />
<br />
Ofcourse with the expansion level 70, will make to many things to easy, another gay thing that SoE does. :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nazak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">A guild that's farmed VT for a while should be fine in much of GoD.  My guild started killing stuff in GoD before we had done any serious farming in the elementals.  I think you should be able to some or all of these just fine:<br />
<br />
Ferubi:  All mini-named, Zun Murum Votal (Could be hard if you don't have a few good offtanks), and Weaponmaster (Takes a bit to get the strategy down).<br />
<br />
Barindu:  All mini-named and Ikaav (the mob for the BiC quest...even easier if you do the BiC part before killing).<br />
<br />
Sewers:  Should be able to do them all either as trial or as exp zones.<br />
<br />
Vxed:  Should be able to complete it and/or farm it, but would need well balanced groups.<br />
<br />
Tipt:  Well balanced groups of your best equipped should fair pretty well here.  You might lose some, but as you get used to it, and learn it, it gets easier.<br />
<br />
Our top end warriors do well enough in Kod'Taz on single group stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">KT will not rip apart anyone who is not in time gear. Named, maybe, but for regular xp, KT is easy as fuck to tank. I can tank there; unbuffed, i'm just over 4.5k hp, and 1200AC. The first time I tanked there, I had nothing but self buffs (CoL) and Virtue for hp buffs, topping me out at a whopping 6.2 or 6.3k-ish hp. Just snare pull (festering doesn't get resisted much on xp mobs), kite it for the time it takes to slow, then engage; I was kept alive with a simple chain CH+yaulp. I was a drain on my cleric's mana I'm sure, but not to the point where the cleric actually had to sit and med. The next day we went back with a shammy in the group, with the 7.3k hp or whatever it was I had, plus the occasional shammy heal, it was easy. Anyone who is decently decked out in VT gear will have WAY more hp than I have (my magelo is far from updated).<br />
<br />
Named I doubt I could tank; I've only been in on one kill, and we killed it through a combination of ping-pong agro kiting and all-out DPS, we didn't have one death. Granted, I'm sure we got lucky, but for XP, I'm sure a VT geared group could easily handle it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'd recommend that you continue raiding Vex Thal and trying to get flagged for elemental gear.  Do not do GoD raids yet.  However.. when you aren't raiding.. work on vxed and tipt trials.  It's tough to tank the boss mob of tipt and the named in vxed at 9500 hp and 2200 ac.. but the rest is doable.... still get munched if the healer(s) mess up tho.<br />
<br />
I'm in mostly vex thal gear with 2 pieces o' elemental armor (gloves &amp; helm) and a stone etched war sword.<br />
<br />
-Bolas</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'd go ahead and start to work toward getting everyone Kod'Taz flagged.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Maicom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'd definetly work on gettin KT flagged.<br />
<br />
Get enough people flagged and you could set up exp groups there and if you can't kill the nameds that pop, bring in a few extra healers/dps/etc and get some nice shit~<br />
<br />
sewers/vxed also have some nice drops, and there's always the bracers from tipt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>AoWtho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">There's enough ways to get around not being able to tank named until Ikkinz group events or thereabouts, and you can still somewhat use them.  Tricks with DA, parry/riposte discs, doubling up on charm pets, etc.  It's almost like you're using cheat codes, but hey... whatever gets you through them and helps you progress in the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sahaya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I believe there was a thread floating around  on the safehouse that linked to a guild of mostly hard ldon geared players with almost no planar progression who successfully beat ikkinz raids one and two.</div></div><hr />
