<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Axxon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I looked for this in past posts but did not see it.  I did the Blood of Pain quest, but have not been able to complete Comatose as of yet.  A friend looted the blood and bile and I was wondering 2 things:<br />
<br />
1. Can the blood and bile be MQ'd if I get the saliva?<br />
2. Is the spell scroll itself no drop?  From  this link  (http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=19122) it seems like it is not no drop, but I have heard tales to the contrary.  <br />
<br />
Any help is appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Excessium</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Don't do it unless you plan on being in your 50's forever. Just Exp, get to 60 for your final FD upgrade. Comotose is not worth the time IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zakton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Comatose will be left in the spellbook once you get Death Peace.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Oagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I believe the LoY spells can only be mq'ed by someone of the same class, as well.  That's the word on the Shaman boards for stoicism.  At your level, the camp for those pieces is actually pretty good xp, and you will come away with some gems and possibly a drop or two of sellable gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Daemoness</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Since necros get the same quest they can MQ it too, its how I got mine at 54, also got a bout 2 yellow from doing the quest.<br />
Another thing about the LoY quests, if you take a lvl 1 toon to do (both for what eve given class) it will ding them up to the late 30's, possibly even 39.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Axxon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I wound up getting the saliva and bile pretty much by accident:  I was asked into the zone to help someone's friend level and we trudged all the way to the back where they drop.  Necro friend MQ'd the blood for me and now I have it.  Problem is I get quite a few fizzes getting the cast off which is pretty inconvenient.  Abjure is 193 atm and if the fizz rate on Coma is any indication, I'd better get it up between now and level 60 when I will want to use DP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It's an easy quest.  I did it solo (and drunk) in about an hour at 65; two or three 50-ish toons should be able to pull it off fine.  Come into the furthest room in the Luggald tunnels (room with a door) and turn left, go to the corner, set up camp there.  Pull left to right around the room, sweeping through the middle as you get the mobs cleared out.  Simple FD splits, mobs on the other side of the door don't seem to aggro.<br />
<br />
The only thing I'd offer as advice is make sure that you have a slower and that you keep snare on.  They hit a little fast if you're lower level and your gear isn't excellent.</div></div><hr />
