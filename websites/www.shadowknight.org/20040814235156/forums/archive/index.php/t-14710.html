<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Malice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has there been any word from sony on how the revamp of droga will effect faction killing for sarnaks? Because if its turned into an exp zone for 50+, there is no way in hell to farm faction efficiently there anymore.... It has me worried</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shadowsoal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">look at your key words, there is no way in hell to farm EFFICIENTLY anymore, sony wont care, its possible then fine deal with it, I worked my ass off the moment I heard revamp to make sure I was ally b4 it hit, now I'm just chillin in droga LF angry gobo...<br />
<br />
They are prolly gonna pull a CT and move Gobo Traitor and Angry Goblin out into some ruins in FM like they moved quist mobs from CTs onto pyramids</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Derok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Farming for faction - do it now, do it fast.  :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>sinjionsk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Took me about 5 days of soloing after raids and before raids to get to Ally....basically i killed all the way down, hit every goblin i saw, cast a pet ( which had Tactics swords heheheh ), and made a huge circle, making sure to hit the chief ropom too ( little bastard still has never dropped an idol of thorned for me ), even got a post nerf CoS out of there ( whew thank god i got one a long time back before it was nerfed) <br />
<br />
Easy way to con faction without going to Chardok is conning the Goblin Traitor near the housing area close to teh exit out.<br />
<br />
Hit everything even have word of spirit up ...<br />
<br />
I went in Inny tap on top Zev, all 4 spears, word of spirit and pet speed and like i said would make the trip around and would be out in roughly 2 hours with a lot of salts and skins on me....<br />
<br />
Once i hit kindly thats when i started turning in the salts and skins....<br />
<br />
hope this helps...</div></div><hr />
