I think you're confused. Dark Temptation = 25 atk for 4hp/tick.<br />
You were probably thinking Dark Empathy (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=357&amp;source=Live)</div></div><hr />

1st tier armor<br />
<br />
Vorkiev can be found in WOS at 1345.98, 1035.06, 444.18 in Nobles' Causeway.<br />
<br />
You need warmly faction to get quest.<br />
<br />
[Wed Oct 20 16:59:43 2004] You say, 'Hail, Vorkiev'<br />
[Wed Oct 20 16:59:43 2004] Vorkiev says ''Hello, Kurim. I am Vorkiev, a former smith of Dranik. Word of your battles against the Muramites has passed from ear to ear across Kuua. You bring hope to the dragorn who long to be free from the shadow of Mata Muram! Perhaps we can be of [service] to one another?' '<br />
<br />
[Wed Oct 20 16:59:46 2004] You say, 'service'<br />
[Wed Oct 20 16:59:46 2004] Vorkiev says ''A decade ago my forge created great suits of armor to protect Kuua's strongest warriors. When the Muramites came, however, they sought to conscript me to make armor for their captains. Rather than comply, I fled into the wilderness to live as an exile. I have no regrets about my decision, but I do long for the old days, back when the land was green and the dragorn stood side by side against their enemies, instead of kowtowing to these forsaken Muramites. There many tasks I need accomplished that I am unable to see through myself due to my exile. If you can help me, I can reward you with finely crafted plate armor for your [hands], [wrists], [arms], [head], [chest], [legs], or [feet]. What say you?''<br />
<br />
[Wed Oct 20 17:00:12 2004] You say, 'hands'<br />
[Wed Oct 20 17:00:12 2004] Vorkiev says ''I appreciate your enthusiasm. Be careful though, this will not be easy for I require a rare item that is entrusted only to the Muramite captains. Harbinger's Spire was once a dragorn lookout tower which Mata Muram has since claimed and bent to his own purposes. He uses the spire as a beacon to receive news on his domain. Some of his captains possess infused crystal shards which can be used to send messages from Harbinger's Spire. If you can capture one of these infused spire control shards along with the satchels of two discordling messengers, it may disrupt the Muramite chain of command long enough to afford me a chance to return home for a day. I have not seen many of my kin since The Darkening fell upon Kuua and I long to know if any of them are still alive. Recover these items for me and you shall be rewarded with my finest plate gauntlets.''<br />
<br />
[Wed Oct 20 17:00:53 2004] You say, 'wrists'<br />
[Wed Oct 20 17:00:53 2004] Vorkiev says ''Did you know that dragorns were created by the death of a single dragon named Dranik, the great father? The first dragorn to walk Kuua created many things in his honor. Among these creations was a fearsome battle standard painted with a drop of blood from each of Dranik's firstborn sons. The last dragorn armies to carry the banner fell to the Muramites. No one can say where the Blood Standard of Dranik has gone, but the recovery of such an artifact would leave me in your debt. Return with this banner along with two Ashlock branches, so I can remake the haft. From there, I can reward you with a powerfully crafted wristguard.''<br />
<br />
[Wed Oct 20 17:01:03 2004] It begins to rain.<br />
[Wed Oct 20 17:01:32 2004] You say, 'arms'<br />
[Wed Oct 20 17:01:33 2004] Vorkiev says ''The armies of Mata Muram are but one aspect of Discord's deep shadow. The Darkening ravaged not only the denizens of Kuua, but the landscape as well. Many of our old landmarks no longer stand and the sky -- once blue and vast -- now seethes with ash and storms. If you can find a map of Old Kuua, one drawn before the coming of Discord, I will be in your debt. Return with this map along with two ukun quills so I can take notes on the map. My exile is long and there is no end in sight. I would like to reorient myself out here in the wilderness. Do this for me and I can reward you with some of my finely crafted arm guards.''<br />
<br />
[Wed Oct 20 17:02:11 2004] You say, 'head'<br />
[Wed Oct 20 17:02:12 2004] Vorkiev says ''When Discord first impinged upon our world, sentiments of treachery and paranoia crept into our lives. Dragorn turned on dragorn and longstanding friendships ended in bitter squabbling. One dragorn, Noble Yemall the Arcane, kept his wits enough to realize what was happening. Yemall toiled tirelessly to counter the effects of Discord. Although his efforts were ultimately in vain, it is said that he was able to author a treatise before the Muramites seized him. This treatise, entitled The Duskfall Chronicles, contains his reflections on the nature of Discord and was likely seized by the Muramites. Retrieve this treatise along with two bristling ukun hides to use as book covers so I can bind the book and protect it from the elements. Hopefully the knowledge in this book will help me to survive in Kuua on my own, now that Discord is seeping further and further across our world. Do this for me and my best plate helm shall be your reward.''<br />
<br />
[Wed Oct 20 17:02:14 2004] You say, 'chest'<br />
[Wed Oct 20 17:02:15 2004] Vorkiev says ''The chest piece is the most-prized piece of my collection. For this I will require a special favor from you. Before the Muramites came, the High Council of Eight ruled over Dranik. The eight nobles, lead by Jelvan the Eldest, each carried scepters that were said to be carved from the bones of the first dragorn sons. It is said that these scepters will glow as long as their owner is alive. I have not seen or heard from the council since the Muramites overran our city, but I have heard that these scepters were handed out by Mata Muram as trophies. If you can recover one of these scepters along with three shorn murkglider tentacles to disguise it from the searching Muramites, I can keep it with me. Its soft glow will remind me that there is still hope for Dranik.''<br />
<br />
[Wed Oct 20 17:02:17 2004] You say, 'legs'<br />
[Wed Oct 20 17:02:17 2004] Vorkiev says ''Kuua was not the first world touched by Discord. There have been many others. I know this because I have heard the Muramites tell stories of past conquests. One of the stories they tell is that the last ember of a Discord-ravaged city will burn for many years, long after the ruins of the city itself have been covered over by time. Some say it's the city's spirit slowly dying. Others claim it to be a side effect of the Discord's lingering magic. Regardless, these embers are highly valued by the legions of Discord, for Mata Muram rewards them to his fiercest captains as war trophies. If you can bring me one of these embers along with three Dranik incense burners to hold it in, I will reward you with my finest set of plate grieves.''<br />
<br />
[Wed Oct 20 17:02:20 2004] You say, 'feet'<br />
[Wed Oct 20 17:02:20 2004] Vorkiev says ''When Discord first descended upon Kuua, many of my own kin turned traitor. Most dragorn who marched against Dranik were already in exile and seeking vengeance for their punishment, but a handful were established dragorn who conspired against us from within. These established dragorn did the most damage to our defense efforts as they worked against us without our knowledge. There is talk of a traitors' stone which is etched with the names of all dragorn who conspired with the Muramites in those dire days. The Muramite captains carried these stones and used them to determine which dragorn to slay outright and which to spare with a life of slavery. If you can bring me one of these Kuuan traitors' stones, along with two kyv bowstrings so that I can hang this rock of traitors for all to see. Although the dragorn have been occupied for the better part of a decade now, this may still cause stir up trouble for the Muramites. Do this for me and I can grant you my plate boots as a reward.''<br />

2nd tier armor: <br />
<br />
Trelak can be found in WOS at neg282 neg1568 .<br />
You need ally faction to get quest.<br />
<br />
[Fri Oct 01 03:32:32 2004] You say, 'Hail, Trelak'<br />
[Fri Oct 01 03:32:32 2004] Trelak says 'Greetings stranger. What can I, Trelak do for you? Surely you are the strangers that I have heard whispers about . . . the ones that have struck back against our enemies? Perhaps we can aid each other? I am an armor smith that has crafted many fine pieces for the more prestigious officers in the dragorn militia. Many of these pieces have unique magical qualities that I crafted into them. If you are [willing] to recover them, I can recapture most of this magic and create new pieces for you.'<br />
<br />
[Fri Oct 01 03:32:42 2004] You say, 'willing'<br />
[Fri Oct 01 03:32:42 2004] Trelak says 'Good, very good. When The Darkening came upon us, I could see by the ferocity and viciousness of the invaders that they would not be easy to defeat. So I took as much as I could and hid out here preparing for the time when our warriors would have need of me. If you help me, I will craft superior pieces of plate armor fit for our mightiest fighters for you. I can provide a [helm], [sleeves], [bracers], a pair of [gloves], a [breastplate], some [leggings], and a pair of [boots].'<br />
<br />
[Fri Oct 01 03:32:49 2004] You say, 'helm'<br />
[Fri Oct 01 03:32:49 2004] Trelak says 'Before I can make you a plate helm worthy of Makyah himself, I will need you to bring me some food. I was so busy with taking all of my tools that I did not have time to stock myself with enough sustenance to see me through this ordeal. From time to time I have seen kvy archers eating from a small food sack. I think if you bring me two of these sacks I can continue my work for quite awhile. Your main task though will be to bring me a certain piece of metal I have long had my eye on. There was a certain dragorn elder by the named of Patorav, a wiser and kinder noble did not exist. Wherever he went, he always carried with him a fine [walking stick].'<br />
<br />
[Fri Oct 01 03:32:51 2004] You say, 'walking stick'<br />
[Fri Oct 01 03:32:51 2004] Trelak says 'This was no ordinary walking stick. The top held a jewel of some mystery for I would always see Patorav whispering to it, but I am more interested in the bottom tip, for it you see was sheathed in a strange metal. I witnessed Patorav striking the ground with the tip only to see it penetrate any surface it encountered. The hardest stone, the most durable metal, nothing could withstand his walking stick. Thus, I have always held an interest in it as the enchantments contained therein may prove to be beneficial to my craft. Though Patorav fell during the noble's march through the causeway, his stick may yet exist. Find it and bring it back with the food and I'll reward you.'<br />
<br />
[Fri Oct 01 03:32:54 2004] You say, 'sleeves'<br />
[Fri Oct 01 03:32:54 2004] Trelak says 'Though I managed to bring nearly all of my tools before the Muramites overran our lands, I did forget to bring the enchanted tongs my mentor gave me. I secretly returned only to watch the Muramites destroy my shop and steal what was left. I saw the leader of this pack of dark thieves place my tongs in an embossed leather sack . . . Which was probably stolen as well. I want you to bring me this sack so I may retrieve my tongs and perhaps other possessions he stole from me. I also want you to repay those brutes for wrecking my shop and home. Bring me back two noc right hands so I know they will no longer steal from me or my people ever again.'<br />
<br />
[Fri Oct 01 03:32:59 2004] You say, 'gloves'<br />
[Fri Oct 01 03:33:00 2004] Trelak says 'One of my people's most famous warriors was Makyah the Fierce, who had no equal when it came to the battle arts. Enemies would routinely pause momentarily when he strode upon the field. After the portal exploded though, no trace of Makyah was found. I am more interested in his axe though, which may yet hold salvation for my people. It is my hope that the enchantments and techniques used to create the axe might be used for other purposes. Find and return Makyah's axe to me so I may use it to help my people. To remove the enchantments properly though, I will also need two yearning crystals. With the proper ceremony, gems such as these can be used to transfer charms from one object to another. Come back when you have recovered these and I will give you a pair of gloves that I was crafting in honor of a dragorn elder.'<br />
<br />
[Fri Oct 01 03:33:04 2004] You say, 'leggings'<br />
[Fri Oct 01 03:33:04 2004] Trelak says 'When I tried to go back to my shop to retrieve my tongs, I found it overrun with a mob of thieving Muramites. At that moment I, a mere smith, vowed revenge for destroying what it took me a lifetime to build. I did not know how or when I would accomplish this until I crossed paths with you. You will be my instrument, exacting the revenge I cannot achieve on my own. Find the leader of this particular group of Muramites and repay it ten fold. Return to me with the medal it smugly wore -- a medal it no doubt stole from some other hapless dragorn. You also must bring me three blackened discordling tails as proof that the rest of this group has been slain as well. Do this and I will give you a pair of plate leggings that I have been working on for some time now.'<br />
<br />
[Fri Oct 01 03:34:16 2004] You say, 'breastplate'<br />
[Fri Oct 01 03:34:16 2004] Trelak says 'Many good friends and loved ones perished in the invasion. One of my good friends was a famous hunter, Jayruk. He and I went on many hunting expeditions together protecting our lands from some of the more wild and dangerous beasts. I was not skilled enough to take care of a bazu mind you, but at least I could remove the threat of a few murkgliders. Jayruk, however, had no equal. I could regale you for hours of tales of how he narrowly escaped death, but I shan't waste time. Simply know that I wish to pay my respects to my good friend and for this I require the hunting vest he so loved. I will also need three dragorn ceremonial candles too. Return to me with the vest and the three candles and I will give you a plate breastplate that I was crafting for myself. '<br />
<br />
[Fri Oct 01 03:35:15 2004] You say, 'boots'<br />
[Fri Oct 01 03:35:15 2004] Trelak says 'As much of my customers were dragorn warriors, over time I came to befriend many of them. Though most of them perished during the fighting, some were captured by the Muramites and tormented in their Proving Grounds. This was once a serene place where our elders would meditate . . . A place of peace and tranquility that my people looked toward Dranik's spirit for guidance. Now it is a place inhabited by the foulest horrors where resistant dragorns are tortured. One such dragorn was a noble warrior named Ethask. Thrown into the labyrinth unarmed, he fought off a horde of discordlings and kyvs, breaking their bodies with his bare hands. Seriously wounded, he still managed to find an exit through sheer force of will. Just as he was about to exit that black pit, a soaring [Muramite] cowardly struck him down from behind. Mortally wounded with the axe still lodged between his shoulders, Ethask crawled through the exit only to perish on the other side.'<br />
<br />
[Fri Oct 01 03:35:58 2004] You say, 'muramite'<br />
[Fri Oct 01 03:35:59 2004] Trelak says 'I know little of this particular Muramite save that he received a medal for his dastardly deeds. Find and slay this Muramite so the spirit of Ethask may find the peace it longs for. Return once you have done this with the Muramite Cruelty Medal as proof that this monster shall trouble my people no more. Also bring me two kyv hunter rings to celebrate Ethask's victories.'<br />

No, they are droppable (as the lucy link should have shown), and the only drop spot I've heard of since my last post (two sources, one being here) is RCoD.<br />
<br />
Btw, other hybrids get Improved Damage V and an effect (BST improved block 1, RNG ferocity 1, etc) on their arm piece so it would make sense for our arms to have the same focus at least.</div></div><hr />

Guessin it totally depends what kind of gear you have now. For those of us that are mostly preelemental and will not see much elemental for 6 months, this gear offers some nice hps. And from what I've seen they are easy to get (once you have faction). We'll see what the affects on them end up being, but so far they look pretty weak.  Spell haste does not thrill me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Nasiir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">If all of the focus are Focus_Name_V, then a couple pieces could be fairly nice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
LDoN augmented Chest is AC69, 13sta, 11cha, 10int/wis, 140HP, 100mana, 12cold/pois/MR, FT2 if you use the type 2 and type 3 slots like most people do.  Type 1 slot could be 10AC+ or 25HP+, etc.<br />

<br />
Not to mention that most level 70 players have been having a hard time getting LDoN groups if they don't have a set group they play with, due to forced 65 Hard adv with low exp for the effort.  These could end up being much easier to get than the RA armor, and better than Ornate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">all the pieces are significantly better than LDoN.<br />
the extra two slots on LDoN pieces hardly make up for the lack in stats and effects, especially when a type 7 slot is more useful than a type 1, 2 or 3 slot.</div></div><hr />

Most faction was just killing mobs but I turned in probably 10 kyv hearts and a seeping murkglider fluid.  Literally tons of time in RCoD and I have yet to see one damn ashlock branch.  Bot Kyv bowstrings I got soloing in NC.  Both Ukun quills I got in RCoD.  The satchels I bought cause I avoid WoS like the plague.  Have yet to see a shorn murkglider tentacle drop but i bought one of em for like 100pp in the bazaar(course the only other one i've seen since is up for 30k).  Pretty much enjoying this expansion cause I'm a one group/small raid type of person.  Also finished the ring quest in DS after bowlord rorn finally came off those gauntlets after about 15 kills.   These faction levels are long, I killed alot of stuff.<br />

is the quest, it says all the items you need (just as the info previously pasted in this thread). As for drops, that would indeed be useful compiled, but in general I would say Allakhazam has or will have such info if you look at the separate items. What I can say for sure from personal experience: the Ridgerunner in NC drops the boot nodrop part, one of the Feran nameds in WoS can drop the arms nodrop part, I got one ukun quill off a random ukun in RCoD (droppable, arms)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">It's not hugely powerful, but at 5min reuse, it's still nice to have... Of course, it all depends on what the other classes get.  If it becomes another case of pally vs. SK epic 1.5's, then it's a serious problem, but hopefully that won't be the case - what I've seen of the other classes' effects suggests it won't be.  <br />
<br />
People seem to expect too much out of too many things... not every effect needs to be game-changing; it's a nice boost with no real drawback that, as long as it's in line with what other classes receive (and it appears likely that it will be), leaves no real room for the bitching everyone seems so prone to.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if its cast time was reduced a lot (say 0.5 seconds from 1.5 seconds), and its effect was increased to 30% lifetap, it'd be slightly more reasonable.<br />
even if they double the reuse.</div></div><hr />

Can you give me some idea what mobs you got the ashlock branches from ?  I've done pretty much every camp in RCoD and been there almost daily since release.  I have yet to see even one of these drop.  Dont quote me but I think the shorn murkglider tentacles only drop in RCoD from what I've seen.  Got 2 of them couple days ago while camping breeder and have yet to see one drop in NC like some info states.  Any info would be appreciated on those ashlock branches, they are killin me.<br />

Murkgliders in NC do drop the shorn tentacles, however the drop rate for those (like everything else in that zone) seems to be incredibly low.  I think it took about 2 hours of constant pulling of murkgliders before we saw the first tentacle.  A Tuaan? Lodestone also dropped during that time.  So I'm guessing the murkgliders in NC do drop the items they're supposed to, however the drop rate is much much lower then in the other higher level zones.</div></div><hr />

My group has been pulling Murkgliders (NC) for days and we haven't seen one tentacle. We did have a &quot;Muramite Dragorn Slaver Whip&quot; for the tier one leather boots drop. I also did get a &quot;Dranik Blood Standard&quot; the other day from one of the named in NC. I can't remember if it was the Battleleader or a Poison Murkglider.<br />

I tend to believe the droppable components needed for the tier one armor is random off of trash mobs.</div></div><hr />

We tried on Tunare the other night also. I think the problem is, if it gets blown because the mobs do not get killed right when it initially spawns, it never resets, and you end up with Tiorpat being annoying.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u106"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p106">Can the Tier 1 armour quests be MQ'd?  Now I do realize that because there are no containers involved, etc. that theoretically it should be as possible as other MQ's have in the past.  But I've heard reports that the NPC's hand back items if you don't hand all of them in at once -- meaning we can't MQ.  Now this also is on non-armour quests that this happened (I think a RCoD neck piece) so not specifically the Tier 1 armour. but it stands to reason that perhaps we might not be able to MQ.  This is assuming the factions are correct (most of us are all ally to Loyalists now) and there is a slight possibility that the failed MQ on the neck piece was from a person not Warmly+ but the text quoted to us indicated that wasn't the issue.<br />
<br />
Has anyone MQ'd the Heartstiller's stuff?</div></div><hr />
