So far I have been going along the lines of everybody know gnomes are truly the most evil race and leving it at that.  Anyone have any other ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ghorz</div><div class="date">04-02-2002, 12:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">According to the race/class description upon character generation troll shamans are the most evil around. And not the cute, little gnomes.<br />
<br />
Well, about roleplaying a gnome. Hmmm.<br />
How about playing him as what he really is? A snack with a sword. A light meal on thin legs.<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cactuz</div><div class="date">04-02-2002, 01:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You should come to one of our famous gnome cook offs.  The troll kebabs are pretty tasty but gotta be careful cause the sure to burn easy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First off, they have that whole shorty complex.  Then the god-awful ticking in Ak'Anon, it's enough to drive anyone insane.  Lastly, Bertox promotes the spread of decay throughout the land, and what better way then a harmtouch to the ol' twig 'n' berries. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mystina</div><div class="date">04-02-2002, 02:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with the shorty complex thing, a well roleplayed nome should provide fun to everyone he meets while trying not only to show his  mental superiority over medium and large races, but to also demonstrate the numerous advantages of being small.<br />
<br />
The roleplay shall not only to come from the nome, but also from persons surrounding him, especially from fatties.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jobrill</div><div class="date">04-02-2002, 02:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Seems to me a gnome might not be outright evil, but rather insidious. Gnomes as a whole race seem insidious really, looking all cute and happy and pious to brell, when in reality they are building machines and tinkering objects of war, and you get the feeling if they really wanted, they could take over the world. Hell, There's a Clockwork Torturer in thier palace! Bertox Gnomes could be like this x100. They could act innocent, but they just want to spread thier disease, a quiet cancer across Norrath, slowly but surely....I'd keep that in mind when rping a gnome.<br />
<br />
I definitely agree that rping also comes from reactions to those around you. You cannot rp in a vacuum, you can only tell a story. True rp must take into account what those around you do...<br />
<br />
And I wouldn't call Troll Shamans the most evil...More the most chaotic/sadistic. Personally I think the calculated, focused evil of Iksar and Erudite beats them anyday...:)</div></div><hr />

that to me is the essence of a gnome sk<br />
if you're scottish you'll have met plenty of short psychos if not renting either of those movies should give you some pointers</div></div><hr />

It isn't how HARD they bite you really, it's where, and whether they ever let go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Garila</div><div class="date">04-02-2002, 04:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the biggest part of RPing a gnome is to get into the being the first one . . . act like a VERY intelligent 4 yr old . . . and walk around ducking alot . . . nothing cracks people up quicker than a shorty walking around ducking telling everyone how gnomes are superior beings</div></div><hr />

<br />
The guy in Quest for the Holy Grail with his arms and legs cut off.  &quot;Come back here, I'll bite your head off!&quot;  (Or something like that).  <br />
<br />
One of those little rat dogs that yips at you incessantly until you step on it.<br />
