<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Taelvenaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all.  I am a 43 lvl DEF SK,(atm).  My question would be what spells would be best to use and why?  I am looking for anyone sugguestions on what spells they use and for what types of encounters.  I am trying to build my experencie off of other people and what they have tried just to smooth the path a little for me on my climb up the ladder.  I know everyones play style is different but if i could get not only what spells but why to use said spells it will help me build my spell list to use for each encounter.  I currently have all expansions up to and including LDON.  I would be grateful for any help anyone has to offer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Krastus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would recomend somewhere like Casters Realm, or Lucy for a good list of spells, however they don't list the &quot;Sense:Obvious Forums&quot; spell.<br />
 It may be possible that this spell which allows you to see things like the &quot;spells and skills&quot; section of the board, is quest only. Or perhaps it is only given to players who register their IQ with SoE.<br />

PS: If you have some sort of flesh eating disease, which renders your mouse wheel finger incapable of scrolling down....then I heartily apologise.</div></div><hr />
