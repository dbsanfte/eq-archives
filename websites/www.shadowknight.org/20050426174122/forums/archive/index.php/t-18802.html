<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Valkyria Grymreaper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Did Emp in Ssra recently and decided to use Greenmist over my Corrupt 2hander.<br />
<br />
This is what I noticed:<br />
<br />
While landing hits on the Emp, I noticed my Shield Bash was also landing on him. <br />
<br />
Decided to remove GM and see if I could Bash. After 3 min. trying I could NOT land one single shield bash. Soon as I re-equipt my GM my FIRST try Bash landed.<br />
<br />
I was under the impression that shield bash would not land because there is no Shissar Bane damage shield (at least that I know of).<br />
<br />
Is this working as intended? A bug? Does warrior kick land if they have a corrupt weapon in hand?<br />
<br />
This whole thing just made me curious, and if other SKs have noticed this as well.</div></div><hr />
