<br />
In my guild we have 5 Male Dark Elf SK's, 1 Male Troll, 1 Male Iksar SK (don't play as much anymore ), and me a female Iksar SK.<br />
<br />
What can I do to start my male Dark Elf harem?  I have tried commenting on the sleek hair that my Class Officer possesses, guessing he must be using a new hair gel.  One other time I admired and commented on anothers beautiful skin that day.  (He must have just gotten a facial before the Fennin Ro Raid, it just glowed! in the firey zone! oh my)<br />
<br />
What else can a lizard gal do to impress them!<br />
 :o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hard to say.... if they're like people on this board, violating yourself with your tail is probably the way to go. I really don't know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Click Guise of the Deceiver.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If someone wanted to impress me in EQ...I'd suggest starting by making an Erudite female and walk away slowly...very slowly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Keevel like teh ghetto bootay?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">No.<br />
<br />
Keevel love the ghetto bootay.<br />
<br />
And moving of the hips in a woman's walk, always loved it IRL and when I saw it in EQ it made my penis cry with joy.<br />
<br />
P.S. so does Spermzilla<br />
<br />
EDIT: On topic though Eggborn I'd assume just being a female Ikky should be enough to draw their interest.  Sleeping with new races is what every man has dreamed of since the races met each other.  Also, point of the advantages of being an egglayer means that you'll never get knocked up, the kid can be adopted before hatching and ridding oneself of unwanted young is as simple as throwing the egg off a clifr, or selling it to a Troll chef for a nice profit.</div></div><hr />
