<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Daerkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have done this trial several times, originally when GoD first came out (which is when I went through all the first trials to get KT flagged), and subsequently with random friends and alts for augs etc. In its current state with the trash hitting as hard as it does, its frustrating to attempt as a wipe on the way to the end room pretty much guarantees a time out while waiting on corpses to pop.<br />
<br />
When GoD first came out and I realized the significance of warrior tanking for the expansion (or should I say insignificance of knight tanking), I grabbed and alt warrior on another box of mine and started levelling/gearing him. He is now at the point where I use him to farm Vxed nameds with one cleric healing no real problem (whereas I still often drop to them with a single healer when they get a lucky round). So to the reason for this thread - I have read pretty much everything I can find on the SK board and Steel Warrior with regards to tanking Jhiru and different strats on him.<br />
<br />
I have a very consistent group but lack a chanter (who makes tipt trivial from my experience). Group members I have available nightly are: SK (me), War, 2xClr, Wiz, Pal, Bard, Druid. Wiz and one Clr are partly Time geared, 7k ish mana. Others are ele/vt geared. War has 7000hp unbuffed, ac 1600. Given my available toons and given I need to get them all through tipt bar myself and one cleric what is the best group makeup. Additionally given the warrior stats and my magelo, who should tank trash, and who/how should Jhiru be engaged. I have previously engaged him with bard pulling (annul/fade, harmony/Slow on inc) deftdance til warrior furious takes over. Problem with warrior on jhiru (warrior has pretty shitty weapons) is once furious wears off what is the best next stance on discipline, some say defensive and evasive are nerfed but stonewall is not, others seem to dipute these claims. Usually when I HT and melee I grab aggro off warrior (ok if its a tanking switch but hard on single healer if I only have one). It has been my experience that this often turns into a hectic mess (I like hectic and love the 1% tanking heals but success is on the line for a lengthy trial)<br />
<br />
I usually always tank the trash just because of aggro issues allowing the wizard to all out nuke, and bard is on cc if we get an add. It just seems much more challenging to get to the end room now, though Jhiru by all accounts is himself easier. Any specifics or suggestions would be appreciated either as response or pm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Avryce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Make sure you use aura of pain.  I noticed a pretty large decrease in damage taken going from 2175~ AC buffed to above 2300 using aura of pain.<br />
<br />
If you're snaring as mobs come into camp and your slower is slowing right as they arrive/are on the way that will help a ton so perhaps you should do the pulling unless your bard is the slower.<br />
<br />
Heartstriker still made me its bitch with one healer though.  Had to use a furious warrior for it.  Basically it seems like SK's can't reliabliy one cleric tank this unless there's a lucky slow right when he gets into camp.  DI went off and chain holy light wasn't enough to keep me up until slow (resists on first two attempts) harm touched then went directly into leech curse and got mowed down.  As the cleric stated &quot;The spells just didn't recycle fast enough to save you until slowed&quot; this is true &gt;&lt;<br />
<br />
Seems like you have everything right very important to dispell Jiru on pull since the pathers on the bridge like to stop and haste him.<br />
<br />
I've tanked Jiru before but usually with a druid cover healing kinda annoying how unreliable knights are *STILL* I believe Tipt wasn't hit with the changes such as to ikkinz etc if I recall correctly. (please correct me if I'm wrong)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Svartrot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I tanked Jhiru today and parsed him at 1172 dps on me. I had 2 clerics mixing SL and SR on me (none of them had HL, one was a twink). DI fired and one divine arb was used. I had aura of pain about half the fight so ac was around mid 2350 on the average. We had a charmed hasted pooka so the fight only lasted 39 seconds. He was slowed about 15 seconds into the fight. I was at 10900ish HP.<br />
<br />
Looking at the DI numbers (small sample, I know) it looks like more ac is needed to hit the cap on this mob. The numbers are a bit messed up by a rune but the biggest spike is a bit above what looks like the minimum.<br />
<br />
The trash hits harder than KT mobs. I even got handed a McFlurry by a Ra'Tuk and visited the time dial briefly.<br />
<br />
Edit: Jhiru's max hit was 1759. Cragbeast momma did 567 dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Daerkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I posted this on TSW this morning to get the warrior response as my question is mostly regarding using warrior discs on Jhiru.<br />
<br />
Post:<br />
<br />
Ok I just did Tipt last night and had some issues on Jhiru that maybe were because I am not clear on the disc nerf SOE put in on warriors. Grp was War, SK, Clr, Enc, Dru, Bard - and it went like this:<br />
<br />
Bard dispelled/fade, HoS/fade, RoT/fade (slow resisted), pulled again with HoS and backed Jhiru to group (on right side of room), bard disced and tried slow again, Warrior jumped in with Furious (Pet engaged by this point) - was looking good until Furious expired, War hit Stonewall (thinking defensive was nerfed), and got emote something like ' I'm not going to waste my time beating down your defenses.....I will feast on your companions' Jhiru ate pet (cleric didnt notice), Sk jumped HT and died with Jhiru at 27% summons finished the rest of them. Actually cleric never got aggro and rezzed everyone (yeah he must of been sleeping I'm thinking), but without pet and little dps there was not much to do, but decided to test defensive on Jhiru just to see what emote I got - didnt get one with defensive up.<br />
<br />
So what gives, what discs are nerfed? and what is the best strat for engaging him with the given group. I am sure if pet had been properly buffed and cleric had healed him we would have won, but still want to know how the warrior should have played this one.<br />
<br />
What is the consensus here on this question? I was boxxing the warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">This is the stuff I am trying now; flagged for 1 - 5, but have not attempted Jhiru yet (mostly pharming augs and doing other named) in Tipt.<br />
<br />
I am comparatively poorly equipped (6100 hp / 1650 ac) and I have been able to tank Chavoor, Ikaav, Umbiki, Enr.Mat Cragbeast, etc. with 2 healers but know I am way short for Jhiru.  We do not use ranger WS nor charm -- just straight up tank / heal / dps.<br />
<br />
I feel I am at the absolute edge of my tanking ability here, and have no chance to tank Jhiru.  We do have rangers with WS and enchanters with TD but have not tried thus far -- as generally there are 3 of us 2-boxing each and controlling a charmed mob seems risky.  We do our fair share of wiping on unexpected trash adds and such; so adding another element didn't seem prudent until now.  I think we're going to have no choice but to try it if we want to make it past Tipt.  We have no warriors to call on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Daerkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You can do this boxing - to give some perspective I 5 boxed last night, with a friend on the duid on permanent pet guard duty. basically with a pet its all timing combined with good pulls, I run a timer mod in a window on bard to monitor pet charm duration and repet frequently. As for tanking him yourself I have tried this without pet and can say its pretty hard to land slow on Jhiru and unslowed he hits for 1740 though rarely seemed to hit for max. Still he can eat you in a flash even with 2 clerics unless they are really on their toes. Additionally without some disc class getting sufficient dps on Jhiru before cleric is summoned or oom is very difficult. I decided to bag the idea of tanking him straight up and took on the difficult task of boxing and enchanter alongside my other toons. Difficult as its a new class to me, and being puller and enchanter has its share of exciting moments (pulling 2 to camp within aggro range when pet breaks - always fun!)</div></div><hr />
