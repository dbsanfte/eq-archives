<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Paynreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I see many people requesting that mob DR is lowered and debuffed more often to help balance us out. Obviously, I must be missing something important because it is such a prevalent request among people who tend to know their shit.<br />
<br />
So, someone do me a favor and fill me in on why DR is so important. Other than DPS from Spears I don't see why it matters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Virtually every meaningful SK spell aside from lifetaps is disease-based.  <br />
<br />
Currently, disease is by far the most resisted spell category in the game, and is the only resist not regularly debuffed in raids/groups.  Malo coveres everything BUT disease, even.  <br />
<br />
Forcing SK's to rely on numerous disease-based spells with no/low resist mods when it's the most resisted game-wide and the least debuffed game-wide isn't quite fair.  It's not like our spells are so powerful they need to be balanced by resistability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There are some zones and areas where the mobs have such high DR I have to have a special spell line up I created just for those zones.  But really there is not much useful in it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>GorranVZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Mind Wrack is a DR check, but usually necros tap the bards for that.</div></div><hr />
