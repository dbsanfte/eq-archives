<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Oagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just finished this for the FT1 earring with 70hps/stats.  It took about 2 weeks getting the blades from the king area and earth seer area.  When I went to get the &quot;Mark of Imprisonment&quot; from Jailor Maufan, I wound up getting two more blades in about 4 rounds of spawns.<br />
<br />
I know these things are rare (the blades), but I would say that perhaps there's a better drop ratio in the area where the named piece drops, since there's usually more of the quest piece mobs in this area.<br />
<br />
BTW, with a 65 Shaman/65 SK 2-box, this was not an easy spawn to break for the named area.  Without Virulent Paralysis 3 on the Shaman, it would have probably been a wipe.  If the prison warden is up, you're going to get 3 mobs (all lvl 60) in both rooms.  You're going to get HT'ed or nuked hard by the mobs here (unless one's a spider).<br />
<br />
Recommend a full buff before you camp this spawn if you're 2 boxing.  With 3 or more I'm sure it's easier.  Maufan drops a very decent monk/bl weapon (17/23 with stats) as his rare, which should fetch some good plat in the bazaar (or nicely twink either if you have an alt).   <br />
<br />
Of course, I would have to get all the pieces after a patch, which will require a re-freeing of the slaves.  Quest NPC's had been up for weeks prior to this latest patch.<br />
<br />
Oh well, at least it's ready when they are freed again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wienaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Slaves have only been reset once that I know of, that was when they patched Droga to fix the quests...since then the prisoners have been free after every patch so far as I know...I would advise checking to see if he is free</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Oagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Vax T'Qurom (sp?) hasn't been up since, either (on TM).  But, I'll check again today after being off for awhile.  Maybe I should send a bug report.  I've actually got the makings for a 2nd earring, now.  So it's sitting on my trader for 50k for someone else, which is about in-line with other ft1 stuff.</div></div><hr />
