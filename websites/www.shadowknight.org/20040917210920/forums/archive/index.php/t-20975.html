<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>gromrot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">When you head in to Oggok like you were headed for the SK guild, on your left in the cliff wall is the citizen area.  Looks like a bunch of caves or something going up the face of the cliff.   I can't remember the NPC's name atm, but it was a female ogre up on the top level of that area.  Just have to keep following the stairs up and you'll see her eventually.  <br />
<br />
Not sure if I explained the location well or not.  I didn't spend much time in Oggok when I started.  Hope I helped a little.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kript</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">When you get into Oggok use your find button and find one of the Beastlord GMs.  The person you need to see is located in one of the caves very close to them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>LaBlade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ah, thanks.<br />
<br />
I know the cave area, I'll look in there, and use it with the find button.<br />
