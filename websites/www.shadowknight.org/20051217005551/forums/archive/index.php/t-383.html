Also, how about the Queynos badge quests?  I am new to the sk class, only level 11 DE SK now, but I love this char and want to do everything possible with him.   Any information you all could give me would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks</div></div><hr />

Once of the named revenants drops a shissar eye earring which is something like ac 5 +15 hps +15 mana effect enduring breath.  Its a pretty rare drop, but beats doing faction work.<br />
<br />
Just for info an iksar monk friend was able to do the quest using sneak.  Got a mage to CoH him up behind the quest mob and did the hand in.<br />
