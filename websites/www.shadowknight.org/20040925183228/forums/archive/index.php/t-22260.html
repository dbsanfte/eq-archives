<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>zaistikaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">any word on these new cards seeing how they hit the streets running , any conflicts or major malfuntions with playing EQ on them , seems like they just kinda pushed everything else right to the crapper, say nvidia to a rep at Dell now and they laugh at you WTF  :eek: <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rueeliar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Will it matter, when the coding for EQ will inevitably be the bottlneck in a top-of-the-line system?<br />
<br />
Edit:  Talking to a Dell person about computers?  Erm... that's like asking a parrot about hardware installation, they just might randomly say something helpful or accurate, but there is no way to tell which part it was.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Space</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">At the moment AMD doesnt support pcie not for another 6months+<br />
<br />
Intel are pushing ahead pcie and some new technologies but Intels new chipsets and cpu's are loosing pretty badly in most tests to the athlon 754 and 939 pin cpu's and chipsets.<br />
<br />
Also pcie for the forseeable future does not offer huge performance increases infact in graphics at least pretty small.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>neferaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I would steer clear of it until the bugs are ironed out. Current chipsets for Intel have bugs in them, and AMD ones are not available yet. See...<br />
http://www.linuxworld.com/story/45750.htm<br />
and<br />

Add to that such a bus would never suffice for data throughput and dedicated ram and buses on the card is always a better solution, so there is not much benefit compared to AGP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Uggliey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">When ever new tech hits the market,  never buy the first generation of them unless you have no other choice.  Always wait for the 2nd generation and the bugs to be worked out.   Right now you won't see much of a differance over a AGP 8X card,  but 12-18 months from now will be prime time for mainboard upgrades as gen 2 should hit the market, and newer cards will take more advantage of the faster speeds and bigger bandwidth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>vilesoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">unless your PC is athlon t-bird or sub 2.0ghz P4 level...I would hold off fomr buying any motherboard until the BTX format goes live.  <br />
<br />
BTX has tons of nice features, like eventually phasing out 32-bit PCI, floppy controllers, IDE, serial/printer ports, and PS/2 ports. Basically legacy-free.  Instead you have usb2.0, SATA, IEEE1394, PCI-E, and a special chassis  and system board design that's built around optimal cooling. Intel has the spec sheets for it somewhere on their site.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Space</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">also be waiting an age for it unfortunatly  with amd not supporting pci-e till 2005 its gonna be a small market and high prices.</div></div><hr />
