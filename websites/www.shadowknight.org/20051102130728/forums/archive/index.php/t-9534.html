&gt;   ACROSS AMERICA<br />
&gt;   HONORING A TRAITOR<br />
&gt;   This is for all the kids born in the 70's who<br />
&gt;   do not remember this, and didn't have to bear<br />
&gt;   the burden, that our fathers, mothers, and<br />
&gt;   older brothers and sisters had to bear.<br />
&gt;   Jane Fonda is being honored as one of<br />
&gt;   the &quot;100 Women of the Century.&quot;<br />
&gt;   Unfortunately, many have forgotten and<br />
&gt;   still countless others have never known<br />
&gt;   how Ms.  Fonda betrayed not only the idea of<br />
&gt;   our country but specific men who served and<br />
&gt;   sacrificed during Vietnam.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt;   The first part of this is from an F-4E pilot.<br />
&gt;   The pilot's name is Jerry Driscoll, a River Rat.<br />
&gt;   In 1968, the former Commandant of the USAF<br />
&gt;   Survival School was a POW in Ho Lo Prison-the<br />
&gt;   &quot;Hanoi Hilton.&quot; Dragged from a stinking<br />
&gt;   cesspit of a cell, cleaned, fed, and dressed<br />
&gt;   in clean PJ's, he was ordered to describe for a<br />
&gt;   visiting American &quot;Peace Activist&quot; the<br />
&gt;   &quot;lenient and humane treatment&quot;  he'd received.<br />
&gt;   He spat at Ms.  Fonda, was clubbed,<br />
&gt;   and dragged away.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt;   During the subsequent beating, he fell forward<br />
&gt;   upon the camp Commandant's  feet, which<br />
&gt;   sent that officer berserk.  In '78, the AF Col.<br />
&gt;   still suffered from double vision (which<br />
&gt;   permanently ended his flying days) from<br />
&gt;   the Vietnamese Col.'s frenzied application of<br />
&gt;   a wooden baton.  From 1963-65, Col.  Larry<br />
&gt;   Carrigan was in the 47FW/DO (F-4E's).<br />
&gt;   He spent 6 years in the &quot;Hilton&quot;- the first three<br />
&gt;   of which he was &quot;missing in action&quot;.<br />
&gt;   His wife lived on faith that he was still alive.<br />
&gt;   His group, too, got the cleaned, fed, clothed<br />
&gt;   routine in preparation for a &quot;peace<br />
&gt;   delegation&quot; visit.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt;   They, however, had time and devised a<br />
&gt;   plan to get word to the world that they<br />
&gt;   still survived.  Each man secreted a tiny<br />
&gt;   piece of paper, with his SSN on it, in the palm<br />
&gt;   of his hand.  When paraded before Ms.  Fonda<br />
&gt;   and a cameraman, she walked the line, shaking<br />
&gt;   each man's hand and asking little encouraging<br />
&gt;   snippets like: &quot;Aren't you sorry you bombed babies?&quot;<br />
&gt;   and &quot;Are you grateful for the humane treatment<br />
&gt;   from your benevolent captors?&quot; Believing this HAD<br />
&gt;   to be an act, they each palmed her their sliver<br />
&gt;   of paper.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt;   She took them all without missing a beat.<br />
&gt;   At the end of the line and once the camera<br />
&gt;   stopped rolling, to the shocked disbelief of the<br />
&gt;   POWs, she turned to the officer in charge and<br />
&gt;   handed him the little pile of papers.  Three men died<br />
&gt;   from the subsequent beatings.  Col.  Carrigan was<br />
&gt;   almost number four but he survived, which is the<br />
&gt;   only reason we know about her actions that day.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt;   I was a civilian economic development advisor in<br />
&gt;   Vietnam, and was captured by the North Vietnamese<br />
&gt;   communists in South Vietnam in 1968, and held for<br />
&gt;   over 5 years.  I spent 27 months in solitary confinement,<br />
&gt;   one year in a cage in Cambodia, and one year in<br />
&gt;   a &quot;black box&quot; in Hanoi.  My North Vietnamese<br />
&gt;   captors deliberately poisoned and murdered a female<br />
&gt;   missionary, a nurse in a leprosarium in Ban me<br />
&gt;   Thuot, South Vietnam, whom I buried in the jungle near<br />
&gt;   the Cambodian border.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt;   At one time, I was weighing approximately 90 lbs.<br />
&gt;   (My normal weight is 170 lbs.) We were Jane Fonda's<br />
&gt;   &quot;war criminals.&quot;<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt;   When Jane Fonda was in Hanoi, I was asked<br />
&gt;   by the camp communist political officer if I would be<br />
&gt;   willing to meet with Jane Fonda.  I said yes, for I would<br />
&gt;   like to tell her about the real treatment we<br />
&gt;   POWs received different from the treatment<br />
&gt;   purported by the North Vietnamese, and<br />
&gt;   parroted by Jane Fonda, as &quot;humane and<br />
&gt;   lenient.&quot; Because of this, I spent three days on a<br />
&gt;   rocky floor on my knees with outstretched arms with a<br />
&gt;   large amount of steel placed on my hands,<br />
&gt;   and beaten with a bamboo cane till my arms dipped.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt;   I had the opportunity to meet with Jane Fonda<br />
&gt;   for a couple of hours after I was released.<br />
&gt;   I asked her if she would be willing to debate me on TV.<br />
&gt;   She did not answer me.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt;   This does not exemplify someone who should be<br />
&gt;   honored as part of &quot;100 Years of Great Women.&quot;<br />
&gt;   Lest we forget...&quot;100 years of great women&quot;<br />
&gt;   should never include a traitor whose hands are<br />
&gt;   covered with the blood of so many patriots.<br />
&gt;   There are few things I have strong visceral reactions<br />
&gt;   to, but Hanoi Jane's participation in blatant treason,<br />
&gt;   is one of them.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt;   Please take the time to forward to as many people<br />
&gt;   as you possibly can.  It will eventually end up on<br />
&gt;   her computer and she needs to know that<br />
&gt;   we will never forget.<br />
&gt;<br />

She is a traitor and should be looked at as one. However a few of the facts in the story are fictional. <br />
<br />
Truth of Fiction (http://www.truthorfiction.com/rumors/hanoijane.htm)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aaoogaa Soulhunter</div><div class="date">12-23-2002, 01:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like the truth.  So in all fairness.<br />
<br />
The Truth:  <br />
This story hearkens to a real visit to North Vietnam by Jane Fonda and her husband, Tom Hayden, in July of 1972, but includes a couple of stories that are not true. <br />
<br />
The Fonda-Hayden trip became unforgettable because it infuriated Americans, especially Americans in uniform, many of whom still regard her as a traitor.  She praised the North Vietnamese, posed for a photo at a Communist anti-aircraft gun emplacement, made several radio broadcasts for the Communist North Vietnamese in which she called American military leaders &quot;war criminals,&quot; then when some of the POWs returned home and described mistreatment by the North Vietnamese, she said Americans should &quot;...not hail the POWs as heroes, because they are hypocrites and liars.&quot;  There is no dispute that her visit took place, that her words and actions were in support of the enemy, and that her conduct caused harm to the war effort and to some of the prisoners of war.<br />
<br />
This particular email includes three stories, two of which have been denied by the POWs who are named, and one of which has been confirmed as true by the source, although he was not named in the email.<br />
<br />
First, the &quot;100 Women of the Century&quot; was a project of the Ladies Home Journal and a TV special hosted by Barbara Walters.  Jane Fonda was one of the 100.<br />
<br />
How the email story about the POWs got started is not known, but it has been widely circulated. <br />
<br />
TruthOrFiction.com located Jerry Driscoll who said that the accounts about him in the email are &quot;...the product of a very vivid imagination&quot; and he requests that people please stop passing it on to others.<br />
<br />
TruthOrFiction.com also contacted Mike McGrath, President of NAM-POWs, who says the Larry Carrigan events never happened either.  He says Carrigan calls the story a &quot;hoax&quot; and does not want to be associated with it.  McGrath also says that some versions of the email include an account from a Dave Hoffman and that his story is true.  Hoffman says he was tortured (hung by a broken arm) until he agreed to go before Jane Fonda.  He was among a small group who witnessed one of her radio broadcasts for Hanoi.  <br />
<br />
The part of the email that begins with &quot;To Whom it may concern&quot; is true.  It's a quote from an article titled SHAME ON JANE originally published on the Advocacy And Intelligence Index website on April 28, 1999 and written by Michael Benge who was a civilian captured by the North Vietnamese in 1968.  In his statement, he also makes reference to a missionary nurse who died in captivity.  For your interest, that was Betty Olsen, a Christian Missionary Alliance nurse from New York.<br />
<br />
In 1988 in an interview with Barbara Walters on 20/20, Jane Fonda talked about her Vietnam visit and issued what some feel was an apology but which her critics say was not enough.  Fonda said, &quot;I would like to say something, not just to Vietnam veterans in New England, but to men who were in Vietnam, who I hurt, or whose pain I caused to deepen because of the things that I said or did.  I was trying to help end the killing and the war, but there were times when I was thoughtless and careless about it and I'm...very sorry that I hurt them.  And I want to apologize to them and their families.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Didn't John Walker Lind also said he was sorry for being a traitor er I mean for what he did?  This true story paints her as more of a traitor than the fabricated one.  The e-mail I recieved seemed almost to much.  In my personal opinion she should be branded a traitor and go on trial for the crimes she helped perpetuate and cover up.  Honoring her is a sick joke.  Thanks for providing the link...I don't like passing on stuff like that but I could not find the information myself and it really pissed me off.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Gonna side with Fenrix here.  The cost of one bullet, and even the gun to discharge it, sounds like it would save the world the money to feed this bitch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">synnoira</div><div class="date">12-23-2002, 05:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">She certainly was a traitor. But she was also nothing more than an actress, i'd question her appearance on a 100 women list on that basis alone. Put a bullet in the head of Robert McNamara and all the other surviving politicians of that era who sent American forces to die in Vietnam with no actual clue of how they were going to win the war. They knew it at the time according to the released LBJ tapes. Beefing about Jane Fonda in the context of the Vietnam War is like beefing about Martha Stewart in the context of CEO corruption. She may be guilty but she's waaay down the list.</div></div><hr />
