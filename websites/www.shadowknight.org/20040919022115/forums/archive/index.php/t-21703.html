<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mehatesu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, lets be honest here..If you walked into a dark alley and encountered an Ogre ShadowKnight you'd probably spend the next ten minutes or so cleaning out your undies..Same with the Troll..Pretty scary there as well..But, if you happened to wander into the afore mentioned alley and ran into a Gnome SK, what would you do then?  Laugh?, point and scream &quot;Quick call the circus ones escaped?  Point him in the direction of the yellow brick road maybe?.. As much as I hate to admit it there are some races which just dont need to be SK's.. Humans make decent SK's, and of course the all mighty Ogre, the occasional Troll, but Gnomes??  And those dirty nasty Dark Elves?...Nope, not in my book...lol...IM sure some like to play them..But when I think of Shadow Knight I think of Fear and Power incarnate..Not &quot;hey bub, can ya help me up over the curb.&quot;...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">When I think of a Shadow Knight, I don't think of a retard running around going &quot;SHMASH SHMASH!! ME CRUSHY YOU GUUD!&quot; while trying in vain to cast the spells he 'thinks' he should know. I think of my small little Dark Elf, who is cool, is calm, collected; and when its needed, he'll cut you, he'll smash your face in, and he can summon forth magics like no other. He can be sneaky, he can be quiet...... he is a knight, he is an assassin. That is a Shadow Knight. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
That is why Dark Elf &gt; You.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Saruton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Dark Elfes not good as Sk ?? Where do you live. The life of a Dark Elfe is full of fear, pain and suffering. They are the perfect race for a Shadow Knight.<br />
<br />
Not that i am a DE, but i do think Dark Elfes fit the Sk role pretty good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Oagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Once you hit PoP loot, it won't matter what race you are.  DE's, Gnomes, and Erudites will kick an ogre's butt INT-wise, which = Mana.  Ogres might have to make hp/ac sacrifices to keep the INT up.  <br />
<br />
You are best off getting/keeping your casting skills maxed for level, because you're going to fizzle, due to lower INT...more than the more intelligent DE's, Gnomes, and Erudites.<br />
<br />
You have one advantage over other SK's - not stunnable from the front.  That does help, and others definitely complain about it (recent thread).  <br />
<br />
End game (actually, elemental +), melee stats are usually maxed, so race doesn't really matter.  Not being stunnable will be about it.<br />
<br />
People play the race of toon they like.  Everyone's glad you like your Ogre.  I like mine.  But, I wouldn't want to take on someone like Brael on in a duel...neither would you.  <br />
<br />
Race doesn't really matter much, anymore.  Luclin/Pop and above took away factioning.  Play the toon you like, and don't bother with the race arguments.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>signa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">when i think of my human sk...<br />

i think of a blind old man weakly stumbling into walls and various pieces of furniture screaming for someone to turn on the lights</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Silku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think every race has it's own reason to be an SK.  I chose dark elf, because I was a fan of the dark elven race in D&amp;D, forgotten realms etc.   They were evil, it fit my cause.   However, if I had to choose how I want my sk to look I wouldn't even choose the graphic of any of eqs races, I'd want to be the named orc from an ldon adventure in Rujarkian.  Nothing says pain like spiked shoulder pads.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mehatesu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I knew when I started this thread Id get some intersting replys..Im disapointed none of our gnome brothers replied...I mostly chose the Ogre for the size and power he brings to the table.  End game stats dont really matter.  Being able to stand toe to toe with any mob and not get stunned for me is a big bonus, coupled with slam and just the cool way they look is right up my alley. If I could pick my own race to add to the mix though, Id pick the Orc or Half Orc..Not the cheesey EQ orcs, but the ones from Warhammer 40k..the seven foot tall regenerating wont take no for an answer Orc..My main is a shaman now, or was rather, Id allready worked my Barb Warrior to 65 and got bored with it and then started on my shaman..I think I prefer my sk most of all..The ability to FD has saved my bacon so many times I cant even beging to count the ways... Now, the only race that needs to get off theyre bottoms are the trolls..They need to march back to theyre old stomping grounds and kick some froggy but...If that fails they can come live with the Orgres..We could allways use a few janitors..lol..</div></div><hr />

You run into an Erudite SK in a dark alley and you probably won't be scared, but you should be.  That's what I like.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Velnarin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Everyone knows you DON'T see a Teir'dal Knight in a dark alley... he sees you.   :p   But if you did see his eyes, you'd know without a shadow of a doubt that there are indeed things worse than death.<br />
<br />
I like all SK races, well alright I can't respect gnomes... but same with halfling rangers.  I think it was a bad move to allow gnomes to be SK's.  I mean, just look at them.<br />
<br />
Mehatesu said, &quot;But when I think of Shadow Knight I think of Fear and Power incarnate..&quot;   <br />
Well, when I think of a Shadow Knight I think of Evil and Hatred incarnate.  Someone who upon meeting you is debating whether to kill you quickly and painfully or take you back to town where he can really go to work on you, taking his sweet time before ALLOWING you the pleasure of death.   :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Morbent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Just cause a gnome is short they can't be a sk? Seems to me most of you sterotype the sk. Sks should be rarely what you'd expect. Won't catch me playing a gnome sk tho... :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Flargle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I've read the Trolls saying &quot;how can you be intimidated by a 3' Gnome?&quot; I enjoy turning that around by being a better player. I hope there is nothing more humiliating to an Ogre tank named &quot;Barshum&quot; than getting out tanked by a midget in a superhero mask.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Nvader</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Damn you Gahhl, wondered what happened to you, Ntruder here, went from ranger to SK, and not looking back. 3.5yrs as a ranger, SK is a nice change. Going from trying to avoid aggro to wanting aggro is nice. How is CoH, my friends are telling me its hot stuff, I might have to check it out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Saruton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Have to make an addendum. I dont think Trolls or Ogres are such a good race for a Shadow Knight. For me a Knight - wether its a light or dark one - means beeing able to wield a sword with great skill and beeing able to speak in coherent sentences etc. So a knight is someone with a strong will and he lifes for his principles. Those are attributes i miss when i look at an Ogre. They are more like kill kill food women kill bash ... They lack any sense of pride, for me an ogre is the same as a warrior or even more a berserker. Brutish, uggly, allways looking for a fight, even if its a bar brawl.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Mehatesu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Its getting better, soon cable internet will be here and I can finally play again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kroolhand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I think DE's are well suited to a variety of SK that one might encounter, Polished, skilled, intelligent and underneath the exterior, wholly &quot;eveel&quot;. Erudites and humans would probably fit into this play type as well.<br />
<br />
I would also argue that Ogres and Trolls fit the sk bill as well. They are evil, just not as polished. I tend to RP my Troll as a calculating, intelligent, cunning, yet fear inspiring entity. <br />
<br />
Historical as well as fantasy precedents exist for this. Typically any fighter, whether far eastern monk type orders, or Dark Age knight, who had devoted his life to warcraft was educated on far more than sword play. Geopolitics, religeous implications, social order, history of a sort, strategy, and in some instances basic science and math were part of the curriculum for the aspiring knight, assasin, monk, samurai etc.<br />
<br />
I dont know if it still does, but descriptions of SK's back in the Kunark days included lines about being chosen at birth, consecrated to the gods od hate and fear etc, and beginning a lifelong journey of &quot;learning&quot; things like weapon skills, spells and exacting torture and death.<br />
<br />
For fantasy evidence, look only to Tolkien (but there are other examples across different genre lines) when he speaks of trolls becoming more intelligent as the power of Mordor grows. And don't forget the well spoken Ogre (his name escapes me atm) in our own  Ogreville who speaks of the hey-day of Ogre domination.<br />
<br />
My intelligence has risen from my starting stats, and if for no other reason than that, I don't play Krool as Ja Jar Bink's lost cousin. He isn't nearly as sharp as a DE or an Erudite but he does not live in a fog of blood lust, booger and beer either.<br />
<br />
Gnomes hmm, well I'd be curious to know the thought process or angle that goes into this decision. I know there are cultural advantages, not questioning that, but what goes through your mind when you unsheath your sword? I'm small but frightfully wicked? So are fleas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Vasto</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">How come Iksar was never mentioned? Pfft... Most ebil combo if you ask me.. One, no one likes us, and we don't like you. Two, from a gaming perspective, we have very decent base stats. Three, every hot Vah Shir and High Elf hunny wants to play with our tails.<br />
<br />
Iksars &gt; smelly ogres.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">..every hot Vah Shir ...hunny wants to play with our tails.<br />
I find the Vah Shir fantasies strangely disturbing and intruiging.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Vasto</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Ever since Luclin went live, and I came across my first Vah Shir in Lake of Ill Omen.. from the behind, of course, I've never been able to take my eyes off 'em. /drool</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Xakkoriz DragoonLord</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I'm an Iksar ShadowKnight and I think they make the coolest SK's they have average starting stats which will balance later anyways. They are lizard people how freaking cool is that??? And theyre armor looks cool :)  The plate in new graphics.  I do think that I could see myself playin a Dark Elf or Troll SK though.   <br />
<br />
                      If I saw any SK in a dark alley no matter the race I'd be scared because they might pull the skeleton on you.. heat your blood... DOT you... or HARM TOUCH you... but I do have to say that a Gnome is a little less scary than the others... If I saw an Ogre,Troll,Iksar, or Dark Elf one I'd pee my pants and if the Erudites eyes were glowin red I would run or pee my pants :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Razs Meows</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I tend to agree with Ogres and Trolls being brutes and not SK's, even though that's not the case.<br />
<br />
I think the way Iksar are is special.  They are a blend of raw carnage, untouchability, and a mind much calmer and yet more violent then the average.  You walk into a dark ally, and see this hulking reptilian beast calculating which organ he should remove with a rusty dagger first or make a sweep with his arms and take out whole chunks of body parts...<br />
<br />
Erudites would be similar, but that pure physically intimidating aspect is decreased.  The mentally intimidating aspect is increased.<br />
<br />
The human would be similar to the iksar, but a certain fear would be lacking.<br />
<br />
Dark elves would be almost exactly the same as the erudite, except I expect you wouldn't notice him until it's too late.<br />
<br />
The gnomes are a different story entirely.  In them I see a ton of hatred building up due to constant underestimation.  I see a more furious side to them. The biting, scratching, hissing, clawing, uppercutting-to-the-groin-with-a-spiked-hammer, tendon slicing, cheap shotting, knee-gnawing type of fighter.  His intelligence only elevates his rage as he goes over every wrong inside his head again and again, finding new ways that he's been injusticed - and subsequently finding new ways for revenge.<br />
<br />
I think gnomes would've made better berserkers then shadow knights :P.  I also think iksar should've been berserkers... <br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, and then the gnome would harm touch you in the groin, and hit you in the face once you bent over.   And then swear and cuss extremely loudly as his 400+ ways to torture you just got wasted.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ogres being the only race cursed by the gods because they were too powerful and invaded the planar realms long before any other races.  Just making sure we are on the same page...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>saeldidar si'ernmal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">to me a dark elf SK is much more frightening than an ogre or troll SK.<br />
<br />
1. DE's can hide, making them seem to appear out of no where.<br />
2. DE's are much more intelligent and sneaky.<br />
3. Ogre's couldn't sneak up on hellen kellar.<br />
4. DE's just plain look cooler.<br />
<br />
Dark Elves were made to be necromancers and shadow knights, while trolls and ogres were meant to be warriors.</div></div><hr />
