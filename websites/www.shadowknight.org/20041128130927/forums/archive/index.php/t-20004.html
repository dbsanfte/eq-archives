<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dkhar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You're way fine man. BBS and LoV is nice set of weapons. You have nice ac and decent hp. All I would say us upgrade from 16% haste to possibly 36% dragon haste. Even an RBB or RBG would be fine. Sure there are slots you can work on but for level 55 you are far better off than many around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Stattic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The haste is something I debated for a long time. My old SCHW or BLOOD ring. With my EYEPATCH OF PLUNDER I get 20% clicky haste there and plus the 16% on the ring I have 36% total. With the added STR on the ring it brings my Attack rate up and plus more Damage. PLus it frees up my hand slot for the better gauntlent . One day when I can get my hands on a Higher haste Item I will for sure upgrade that.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the info and I think Im doing well so far..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Oagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You're doing a lot better than newtank, that's for sure.  I think cultural bracers should be on everyone as soon as they can afford them.  They are probably THE best item in cultural armor.<br />
<br />
Since no one has said it yet, WMBS.  If you're a DE, I can see the use of the LoV, but I'd say get a Tae Ewe shield, as well.  That's a tough shield to beat for the money.</div></div><hr />

There are several minor upgrades you can work on to make yourself a *tad* better of tank, till at least 62 when tier 3 becomes open and Ornate smiles at you.<br />
<br />
Here are some ideas. <br />
(Keep in mind, I don't' know too much about DE Racial Armors)<br />
Replace your ..<br />
<br />
(finger slot)<br />
Rune Etched Wedding Band with something with better AC<br />
There are AC 10 and AC 12 rings out there with Htps/Mana and various other nice stats on them. (maybe a focus or 2)<br />
<br />
(feet slot)<br />
Incarnadine Boots need to go before Lv58, aim for some with at least 26 AC and stats - shouldn't cost too much.<br />
<br />
(legs)<br />
Camp Veksar for the Kylong Shinguards, or buy em - I saw them as low as 5k.  Or DE racial gear may be better.<br />
<br />
(belt)<br />
Normally I keep my haste here, so not sure what to tell you - the focus you got will be almost useless when you hit 61 or 62 tho, so definately replace that negligible 6AC then.<br />
<br />
(wrists)<br />
Grab DE racial Bracers, Asap. :)  Can't go wrong there.<br />
<br />
(arms)<br />
Nice arms, well - the STA is anyways.  I find it hard to get good arms so what you got there will do you good till you can find something better.<br />
<br />
(neck)<br />
Again, 8 AC is kinda low.  The STA and Htps you have there is nice tho for your level.<br />
<br />
(shield)<br />
Um.  Ya, replace that but watch the market - i have seen 35AC shields go cheap.<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
Nice pigstickers btw.  I was just 'awarded' a Black Bastardsword.<br />
A WMBS has better DPS but the BBS has nicer stats and is slower, so you get less repostes.<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
On a note, you should hit max STA with raid buffs so you it would be ok to let go of a point here and there for a major upgrade in AC or pure Htps.  Just don't let go of too much for too long.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Stattic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">OK,<br />
 I have made a few adjustments to my gear and I think I have a better hold on where my AC needs to be to be. <br />
<br />
<br />
Just need to get into that Ornate line of gear and things will change!!!!!<br />
