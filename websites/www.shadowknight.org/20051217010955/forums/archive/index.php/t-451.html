I'm also at a loss at where to go next after being in EW for the last 5 lvls and getting very sick of it.  :_)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Skanis</div><div class="date">04-05-2002, 11:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got from 48 to 51 quickly and easily in Overthere, fighting only dark blues.  At 48 you should still be able to find dark blue Knights, Stonegazers, and an occasional Spiked Succulent.  All Tigers should still be dark blue.  The cacti are the easiest, followed by chickens, sarnaks and tigers.  I used my Blood Ember gaunts for their mana-free snare, and I was able to kill 3-4 mobs without medding.  That's with an int of 67, using a Deathbringer's Rod and no haste item.  Engulfing Darkness usually wore off once per fight but it's a reasonably quick cast for a right click armor piece, I think its a 5 second cast time.  I wasted no mana on buffs, I used it all for Fear (and the occasional FD when I got an add).  I saved HT's for finishing off a mob if I got an add, or if a goon tried to ks me.  Keep an eye out for adds and you can get to 51 in no time without leaving this zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BrindalayShadowlace</div><div class="date">04-05-2002, 03:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the suggestions.  Figured i'd try spiroc's for a bit actually,  getting about 1/4 blue per kill out in tim deep and not having too much trouble playing the fearkite ping pong game  :_)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pheargore</div><div class="date">04-05-2002, 04:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe I am having the same problem, 48 everything started Light Bluing out, but the Dark Blue's still tough with 11 second Fear spell versus the level 49, 45 sec one.  <br />
I still find occasional blue's in Dawnshroud, Rockhoppers are doable solo, but not effeciently. Keep ending up back in Dreadlands though. Always an XP group when I get bored of soloing.<br />
<br />
The key to solong here is The Dreadlands / Burning Woods Zone line.<br />
<br />
Check out the MOB Pathing if you pull a MOB to the Line in the wide Zone Cooridor. They run straight for the Invisible Zone Wall at a slight angle when you FEAR them. Hit the wall at full speed and start slowly moving back towards the main area of the zone. Which is a pretty good distance away.<br />
<br />
So basically Engulf Darkness which costs a bit of Mana can be used once to Pull the MOB (giving you time to run close to zone line from where you pull, unless you have SOW you can save this step as well and save more MANA). Once you get here, turn around cast a few debuffs, then FEAR. follow the MOB along the Invisible wall recasting fear once or twice until they die.<br />
<br />
Usually MOBs die right as they back to main part of zone and strart running along the Northern E-W wall...<br />
<br />
I did this for about 3 hours one day, usually getting 2-4 MOBS between Meds. WOOT<br />
<br />
- Peace</div></div><hr />
