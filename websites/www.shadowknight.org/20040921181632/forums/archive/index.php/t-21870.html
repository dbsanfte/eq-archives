<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mehatesu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, Ive been hearing some rumours that shields are going to be the big thing in SK casual wear this year and I would love to hear what you folks prefer...I personally like the Tae Ew shield or the tacticians bulwark.. :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Wrong forum and we don't cater to laziness - if you can't be bothered to help yourself, why should anyone be bothered to help you?  If you're too lazy to *gasp* click on people's magelo links or something, at least make up some lame excuse for why you can't be bothered to do any work yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chayde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Stupid excuse-101<br />
<br />
The right click on my mouse makes it difficult for me to maneuver around the message boards, and when I manage to put forth the effort of actually left clicking instead of being an imbecile, I get frightened and scared when another window pops open in front of me. I might actually piss myself. You wouldn't want that to happen, would you? <br />
<br />
Magelo is so confusing, so much easier to have someone else just tell me what to buy, and how to play. After all, my mom still cuts my hair, and buys my panties.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Pretty sure that's a male... if his mom buys him panties... well, I think that speaks for itself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chayde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Pretty sure that's a male... if his mom buys him panties... well, I think that speaks for itself.<br />
<br />
   <br />
  <br />
 Doh ! !<br />
<br />
<br />
...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Onlee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">tacticians bulwark <br />
<br />
Haha. That's a good one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mehatesu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Actually, with the exception of being in the wrong forum, and having a slightly misleading title to the thread, get off your soap box.  I asked what your favorites were..Ive allways stated Im new to the sk field and thus far the only shields Ive ever used or had an interst in were the Tae Ew, Tacticians, and now the artremous shield..Spelling aside, those are my personal favorites.. To those who climbed up on theyre own personal pedistal and started screaming about laziness..I have two words..Fuck..Off..I mearly wanted to know your personal favorites..As for being in the wrong forum, I will correct that asap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You're not a mod so you can't move posts, and we certainly don't need TWO instances of this waste of a thread in existance...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Chayde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I like my soap box, it smells nice and clean.<br />
<br />
And I'm sure when the mods move this, it will go in the flame section, because I said &quot;panties&quot; <br />
<br />
=o)<br />
<br />
I think my cleric has the tacti shield, Or had, I was looking to rid myself of it, but the cleric isn't my main priority anymore the SK is, and though many SKs use one hand with shield, I still prefer a two handed weapon, so I could care less at the moment what shield is my favorite, I haven't crossed that road yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Mehatesu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thanks for the reply Chayde, my last outburst wasnt directed at you at all..I really only wanted to know what others conscidered theyre favorite shield to be..Right now I use the atry for my sk and the tactician for my shaman, I know there are much better ones out there, but for now they suffice for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dkhar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">There are shields ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">No Chayde, it goes to the flame section because if a post there survives its usually entertaining for me to read.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Maicom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">you guys remind me of chili palmers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>zaistikaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Duke Sleins favorite seems to be the panty shield.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Daywalka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I personally like the Tae Ew shield or the tacticians bulwark.. :cool:<br />
<br />
I, for one, prefer the Zek Crested Buckler (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=19919) rather than the Tactician's Bulwark (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=17964).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
talking about chaydes panties &gt; retarded questions about shields! <br />

That's what I love about this board.  No matter what the thread, we can hijack it and turn it into something about Chayde's sex life.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Okay!<br />
<br />
Why is It's mom buying you panties?<br />
<br />
