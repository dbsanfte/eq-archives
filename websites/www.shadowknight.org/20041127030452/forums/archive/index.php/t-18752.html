<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">kk apologize if wrong forum but just want a question or two, umm okay recently started liking ldon's now that im having an easier time tanking the normal's with maxed defensive aa's. <br />
<br />
1. If i spend pts do they remain in my total for that dungeon?<br />
<br />
Now if im saving up for miragul gauntlets because the mr on them helps more for me since im on pvp server these cost 760 i believe in miragul, now i do ldon's i do them wherever i can mmc and miragul are the most common followed by takish well i broke down and spent 100 adv pts to buy the 75 ice dd aug proc for wmbs now to get hte 760 gloves i just need 760 pts eanred total including the 100 i spent on the proc aug or do those 100 pts get erazed from my total? heh Just curious cuz im wondering if maybe i should buy some 5ac aug's to help my tanking ability while i slowy grind up to the gloves.<br />
<br />
2. How do you think i should aug my miragul gauntlets hehe :) couldn't help but ask thinking the 1000ish ap aug type 3 ft2 looks good since i only have ft1 atm but i am found toward having high atk :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Anash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No it doesn't get erased from your total, total stays the same but your total amount of adventure points drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The other issue is regarding unlocking items, which I can really only coherently explain with an example.<br />
<br />
For example you have 150 points in MM.  So you've unlocked all the items up to ~ 175 pts.  you spend 120 pts.  Now you have 30 points left.  You go back to MM and earn 60 more points and your back up to 90 pts, but nothing new has been unlocked.  <br />
<br />
The unlocked items are based on the highest number of points you've had in a dungeon at one time.<br />
<br />
edit: silly typos</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Oooh, didn't know this.<br />
<br />
So based on that info, it's best to just grind out the points for the most expensive (points-wise) item you want from a particular camp before getting any of the smaller cost items?  IE: I've been grinding out points in Mistmoore to try and get the 36% haste augment.  I recently crossed the threshold on points where I could get the lvl 54 scythe spell for 410 or so AP.  If I still want to get the haste aug for 1150, then I need to wait to buy the spell until after I've unlocked enough points for the haste aug?<br />
<br />
Damn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You don't have too, will just be a different type of frustration.  Either your pissed off that you can't see what you want to buy because you've spent your points and need a shitload more to unlock it , or you can see what you want because you've unlocked it but don't have the points to buy it. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hey thanks thats exactly what i wanted to know :) doh dissapointing though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Izus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think you may be a little misleading in your explanations. (or I'm confused by what you are saying LOL).<br />
<br />
I've bought several pieces of LDON armor, etc.  The total points earned won't changed by purchasing an item. If you do another mission in the same theme and it will add them to your total as well as availible points.  <br />
<br />
One interesting thing that I have yet to test since I never bothered checking adventure merchants until I knew I had enough points to buy the piece I wanted is whether you can see everything you've unlocked. I'll try to verify that tonight. I can't imagine that after spending lots of points on a  piece that I'd not be able to see the entire list of what I've unlocked but only the remaining points I currently have to spend.  Now would be a great time for me to check it out since I just purchased an armor piece and only have ~200 points to spend atm. I'll let you know what I find out.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You will see everythin you have previously unlocked.<br />
<br />
What you see is based on the most AP points you've ever had in a theme at one time.  <br />
<br />
I've earned over 250 AP in MM with my Shaman, but once I hit 130 I spent it on a nice ring.  So now I have 120 on me and 250 total earned, but I can only see items up to circa 150 (you always see items worth up to 15% more that what you've earned as an incentive to keep moving along and get more points).  That 150ish being the 130 (my highest points I've ever had accumulated at one time) plus the slight modifier.</div></div><hr />
