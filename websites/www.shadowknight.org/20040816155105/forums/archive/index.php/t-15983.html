<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xealz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Finally worked myself to the last test, the lord khurki. After spent 2 week, camping kly Imprecator(the lab one took one week and 3 day) in Dalnir, i was happy that i finally got it. Now, i have just finished collecting the 6 scrolls, and i have been reading many post saying that the whole thing about camping the keys and enslaved ikky(Argest) is moved away into some place in FM, burynai mine. I can't find a exact location about those mobs. i also read on EQ'Atlas FM map and got confused, http://www.eqatlas.com/kunark/frontiermtnsmap.html there are so many mines. Today i chose to explore Mines of Nurga and i think maybe the mobs are there. <br />

<br />
Will someone please help me out by letting me know where should i go to camp the keys or find the mob needed to finish off the last bit of the quest please???<br />
<br />
<br />
PS: Is it true that the Penskeeper and the Pensmaster will pop anywhere in the whole zone on any goblin spawn points and will start to walk around???<br />

HELP ME PLZZZ!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Talonmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">All of the named mobs that were in Droga (and unconfirmed, but several from nurga) are in the Burnyai Mines (A and B on your map, don't remember which).  ((Actually the Goblin traitor is still in Droga, but he may be here as well)).  They are not in Nurga.  Everything in those caves (as I recall) has a place holder, but you should only need to kill inside them to get your pops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xealz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">THANK YOU SO MUCH, so helpful info u gave me thank u, i managed to find the right place, a cave lil downward room with 2 iksar one is gold tunic(enslaved) one is naked, that must be the room. Thank you too much</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Qedemel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Okay, so I've collected all my scrolls (funny, when I had help none would drop and when I soloed I got them right away), and I found the cave in FM with the two iksar and a single penmaster (who does have a PH), and I've collected all but the bone key .... which I'm sure I'll get eventually ...<br />
<br />
My question is this : once I turn the keys in to the enslaved iksar and get my nifty little pin, where do I go to combine the pages and the pin to get the stupendous tome?  I've looked all over FM and can't seem to find anything that &quot;looks like a pottery wheel.&quot;  Please don't tell me that after moving all the old quest mobs out of the revamped Droga, they didn't move the stupendous machine as well.  Am I gonna have to go into that damnable Temple of Droga after all?<br />
