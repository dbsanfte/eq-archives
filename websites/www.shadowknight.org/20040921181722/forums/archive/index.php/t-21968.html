<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Beyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Gratz to me on winning Everquest.<br />
<br />
My Wizard friend Robe and another SK friend of mind have also won the game. Gratz to them as well.<br />
<br />
http://tmmrd.50g.com/iwon.jpg  &lt;-- copy and paste i guess<br />
<br />
Unless the devs pull their heads out of their asses real fucking fast, a lot more people will start winning the game as well, I think.<br />
<br />
Take it easy. This is probably my last mmorpg. Goodluck to everyone moving on to WoW and whatnot, and I hope you find the time you spend in those games more rewarding than the time you spent in this one. I had a big speech about why I was quiting, but then I realized I'd just be plagiarizing 90% of this board. If you really care why I'm leaving, just go read one of the other hundreds of disgruntled SK posts.<br />

  Bye<br />

You have to copy-and-paste the link into your location bar to see the picture. (By just clicking his link = hot-linking, and the error message says that hot-linking isn't allowed with his account)<br />

Wow. A tough guy !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Beyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I just wanted SoE to know that their players are actually leaving and not just complaining.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vaclav</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The majority just complain, and to be honest from looking at your gear - barring the Warrior overfix - you have little idea what any of the other SKs are complaining about.<br />
<br />
PoP was the highest point in any knights existance.<br />
<br />
Heck, from looking at your gear it looks like your guild looked down on you pretty badly - 3 pieces of Elem gear on a member that had been there long enough to kill Xegony is pretty awful, unless they were in a Time reflag cycle. I'd probably get disgruntled and leave too if my guild thought so little of me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Beyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yes, the guild I was in, Forsaken. was on a Time reflag cycle and I had only been in for 2 weeks before they completly disbanded. Rodcet Nife was having big problems with guilds falling apart for a few months. And about the only thing I felt I could do better than anyone pre-ele was tank Tallon on the RZ cycle. Kiting is debatable. I'll be reformatting my comp for the rest of the day and then probably packing it up to get ready to move, so I wont be able to respond to anything else for a while. I can hear your heart breaking from here.<br />

You make have won @ EQ but you lose at life</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ghismonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Shadowknights are getting crapped on, I don't blame you for leaving.  It's a shame Sony hasn't implemented an exit survey to determine WHY all these people are canceling all their accounts.  It might go a long way to opening their eyes to the problems people are most fed up with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">fuck you keveel you use to be the man, then you started cybering with chayde and now your cyber pussywhipped... fucking sad day.<br />
I used to be the man?<br />
I'm cybering Chayde?<br />
She's whipping me with my pussy?<br />
<br />
WTF  Am I surfing in a coma?  Why the fuck doesn't anyone tell me these things.  Damnit It's times like these that makes me drink the air conditioning drippings.  What was I talking about?<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, jam a fork in your asshole, nullo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Saruton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">If you had deleted your char and made a new Level 1 Char with the same name you could call it final. That is just a temporary hiatus from EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Beyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Done reformating, will probably have to pack my comp before the tonight though. Truth be known, they don't let students online for anything other than web surfing (no mp3 downloading, no games and, brace yourself, no porn! etc) on the campus I'll be at. <br />
<br />
I was talking to a friend of mine whos been there since last year, he said college isn't all it's cracked up to be (at least not shitty ones like UCF) so it might really be a temporary hiatus like you said. <br />
<br />
I came here and made this post directed at SoE to try and get SKs a little more attention, kill 2 birds with one stone by closing my account and helping other SKs by pretending to 'martyr' it as well. Then you had to go and be a dick.<br />
<br />
I hope they nerf SKs to hell, take away harmtouch, give you all shitty ass disciplines and spells with OoW and lower your mitigation.<br />
<br />
Nah, I'm just fucking with you. I'll probably get bored and come back in a few months anyway.<br />
<br />
<br />
Or maybe I DID delete my character! Take your pick!<br />
<br />
<br />
On an off-topic final note, can anyone recommend a decent adware remover? I reformatted this piece of shit last night and I'm already getting pop-ups.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Androsulach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Find a pop-up blocker for your browser and do some Googling for spyware removers.  There's a bunch out there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Beyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Ok, thanks. So far the only ones I've found charge money, but it's worth it, I suppose, to not have to reformat again.<br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kyfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Adaware, Spybot Search and Destroy, and Webroot Spy Sweeper. All have at least free trials. Spy Sweeper blows away the others imo. Even gets rid of those stupid toolbars that install themselves in IE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>kutsokare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Adaware, Spybot Search and Destroy, and Webroot Spy Sweeper. All have at least free trials.

<br />
It's easy to kill those toolbars...just go to:  View, Toolbars, and uncheck the toolbar -_-  But most often those toolbars come coupled with spyware, which Spybot takes of most of the time.  Between Googlebar, Spybot, and Ad Aware my computer is pop up free.  Now if there was only a way to kill email spam...<br />
<br />
edit: And if the toolbars constantly bring themselves back in IE, just edit the registry key for them =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
How can you win EQ if you dont shoot yourself in the face ? Anyway, gratz, you are a retard, i hope you are proud of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>brian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">bhodaemon lets you keep track of browser helper objects and alerts you to new ones, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Kahntun Derstand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Don't use IE.  Use Opera or Mozilla or some crap.  Spybot, CWShredder, and Ad-Aware are about 20% effective these days, so reformatting was smart.<br />
<br />
You want to prevent them all?  Download and install Deep-Freeze.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
If you can go to a website, you can use that website to connect to any other website. IE, NetNanny or whatever the fuck you're griping about doesn't block anyone who can do a google search. <br />
<br />
The same goes for anything else on the internet, including p2p networking and playing games. <br />
<br />
Rule of thumb: If something can get into your computer, anything can get into your computer.</div></div><hr />

College is not as fun as movies make it look. At least not this one. The Tang to Wang ratio is very poor, and everything around Orlando is expensive as hell. You'd think with all the billions of tourists coming to Disney/Universal/Seaworld etc etc, there would be tons of jobs, but no. I think I'll apply to Medieval Times and list my 3 years of experience as a Knight. I'll put a link to my magelo for a reference.</div></div><hr />

The movies lied to us?  Never!  <br />
