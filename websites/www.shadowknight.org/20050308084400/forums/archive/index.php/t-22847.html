<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Krushum Gudended</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Today I finally spawned the Breeder, killed, looted, and handed in.<br />
<br />
The 3 items for the sheath are Eye of the Dark God from amy knights in fear, Lock of Hair from a Blessed Unicorn from a rolling plains steed in growth, and a Gloom Nightmare Hide, from gloom nightmares in nightmare.<br />
<br />
Combine was trivial for me at 239+ 5%.<br />
<br />
When turned in, you get this:<br />
<br />
&quot;I admit that I did not think you could accomplish this task.  Perhaps you really are meant to be the sword's champion. Our work here is not done however. There are those that wish the sword to be destroyed. One of these beings is a froglok paladin named Fraga. He was last seen in the Plane of Valor.  Kill him and bring me any clues as to what his plans may be.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fraga is a blue to 68 con frog pally in one of the tents in valor.  Quad 2850 max but hes pretty gimp.  1 group took him down with me tanking.  Loot Fraga's Parchment and bring it back to Sienn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>SelrNeversleep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">what does your trivial say in the recipie list of the seweing kit?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Krushum Gudended</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">it wasn't recorded, being a quest combine</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kastizi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">So what happened after you turned in the parchment?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>kharan_zechts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Whats after handing in the parchment from the frog?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>vex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Is tailoring actually required for the combine?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>ezele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">YAY  got my Sheath of Darktidings just now. I was 153 skill and used a 5% mod and got it, and it wasnt trivial.  I still dont have egg done yet so i gotta do that but GL on everyone on that combine, i think i was prob reallly lucky  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>kharan_zechts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Killed Fraga just now. Hes kind of interesting. Hits for 3k but hits very slow.<br />
Pretty easy with one group.<br />
<br />
Still gotta do the sheath, shouldnt be hard at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Krazaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Sheath was trivial at 163 skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>ezele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Just killed fraga with a grp, very ezy, no adds, not even kos either.  Had a good tank and good cleric and a shaman to spot and slow, didnt need much dps either had a nec / shaman / shaman / me /  pal / cleric, but what gets me is the shield that he drps is no rent, anyone figure out anything on this yet? :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>ezele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">id turn in the stuff myself, but i dont have the breeder part done yet, guess ill pay for it if we end up usin the shield but im pretty sure only need the parchment i hope  :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Croix VorAbaddon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'm assuming all the stuff for the tailoring combine is no drop? At least, normally. I'll check if it is on FV. THe flamberge from Captain Varns isn't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bludvl Hatebringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">flamberge from Captain Varns is no drop.  He can drop 2 different ones make sure you have the ancient one.  He dropped both for me</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yep, got both, but not on Firiona Vie, the Ancient is droppable. We're special like that =)<br />
Edit: I realive that now that I've said that, it likely won't last =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Blackstone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Someone with zero tailoring needs to try and do the sheath combine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Utaldain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Someone with zero tailoring needs to try and do the sheath combine.<br />
Why?  It was posted not trivial to 160 (153 with 5% mod) and trivial to 163.  That leaves the trivial at 161, 162, or 163 skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Krazaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Why?  It was posted not trivial to 160 (153 with 5% mod) and trivial to 163.  That leaves the trivial at 161, 162, or 163 skill.<br />
<br />
Actually, skill mod items don't affect the trivial.  So, trivial is somewhere between 153 and 163.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Blackstone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Sigh, <br />
<br />
So I have to work on tailoring?  WTF.  I'm not here to tradeskill, I'm here to kick ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Ghismonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Nobody has failed the combine yet, correct?  Could have a trivial but still be no-fail.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>vex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Yes, Scal from our server failed the combine at 135 tailoring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Ghismonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Damn.  :-/<br />
<br />
Well, getting tailoring to 158 is pretty easy at least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Renaey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Poor Nachti(sp?) failed his combine at tailoring 22. At that time i only had tailoring at lvl 2. But got it to 115 just by combining High Quality cat pelts and Quiver patterns. Was cheap and quick. will work to 160 later with new recpie, then try combine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Teleran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Rumor is epic tradeskill combines were supposed to be no-fail, and will be made such after the next patch (wednesday?).  Might hold off until then!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Renaey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Was planning to hold off, but a Rumor is just that. A Rumor. So i figured if its untrue, i can still do the combine with less chance of failure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Sollador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I failed with 179 :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Renaey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">The only piece i see difficult to obtain would be the lock of hair. otherwise when you really look at it, its not all that hard. Time consuming solo, but not hard at all.<br />
<br />
poosibly explaines why the hide isnt lore. Dont remember if the Eye is, and i know the Lock of Hair is. So stock up the second time around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Krazaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I heard that the epic combines were supposed to be no fail, but skill restricted.  Meaning, if the trivial is set to 160 now, I'd suspect that it'll be set no fail, with a 160 skill required to combine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Sarrasis Darkmist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">It's supposed to have a minimum skill but be no-fail. Unfortunately, it can't be fixed without bringing the servers down. I believe we are patching on Wednesday, so we should be able to get it fixed then. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Utaldain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Yeah, forgot about the free points on smithing and such.<br />
<br />
However, teh original question remains<br />
<br />
What happened after the parchment was turned in?</div></div><hr />

<br />
So I have to work on tailoring?  WTF.  I'm not here to tradeskill, I'm here to kick ass.<br />
<br />
<br />
Awwwww.... /comfort<br />
<br />
Someone didn't get his juice box....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Luthaer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I just made 107 tailoring, in preparation to doing the Sheath combine, and when I did the actual combine, it was trivial.<br />
<br />
I did ofcourse use a 5% bonus, but that has no bearing on trivial value.</div></div><hr />
