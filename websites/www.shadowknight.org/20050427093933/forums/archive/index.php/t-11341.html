<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Antonius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know this is a race discussion board and my topic is about items. However, I felt this was the best thread to post under because so many people might like the stats of an ugly race, but not necessarily how they look. I am curious if there are any illusion items for quest or drops. I am currently considering an Ogre SK between a Human SK. The ogre whoops the humans ass in stats and they are unstunnable +slam. But I humans look ripped in the new luclin models and just look like they can kick some ass or die trying. Looks are very important to me. I've come up with two items so far that are feasible to aquire (not including the Circlet of Disquise which drops in vex thal). If you could name some other that you might know of would be some help. Thanks.<br />
