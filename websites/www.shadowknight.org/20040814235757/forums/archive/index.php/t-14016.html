<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I really dont remember because its been about 2 years, so Im just going to throw out some numbers ... between 50 and 180pp.  I *think* the merchant is near the bank.<br />
<br />
But when its in Rivervale for 3kpp, blame my memory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>kassdax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Anybody can get into the hole without a key regardless of their race - you just have to have determination or a few loose marbles. It took me close to 10 minutes of swimming up, down, left, right, back, forth and in circles for me to get my ogre through the gap but IT IS POSSIBLE!!!<br />
<br />
I imagine it's much easier if you have a shrink potion or a shammy with you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Khat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Rallia Hapera sells the Hole key inside Paineel.<br />
<br />
Easiest way to wiggle inside the Hole without the key is:<br />
From water and facing the Hole entrance, float above ent rock and to the right.  There will be a small opening.  Move towards the opening until stopped.  Face left and down with mouse hitting duck repeatedly.<br />
<br />
Just be cautious to make sure you are not ducking after you get through and making your short swim to Hole zone.  It will slow you down considerably.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Greggthegrmreapr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">no... its up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, b, a, start.  that code solves everything</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zakton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Duck as you connect with the rocks to propel you through.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Incurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Go grab a rogue and ask em to picklock the door =)<br />
Its 100ish i think?But im pretty certain someone else will give the exact number !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>linzen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Toss a baby halfling in to see where the current is :)  Thats how I did it anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Paynreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Just buy the key.<br />
<br />
If your faction is too low go do some Kobold Genocide in the Warrens for 2 hours and you'll be fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ramgar SK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I have found it impossible to squeese through as a large race.<br />
<br />
I once spent about 30 minutes swimming ducking and moving back and forth trying to squeeze through, gave up and bought the key.  It's not terribly expensive, I think it was about 180pp for me with a 50 cha.<br />
<br />
If you have good enough faction to get into paineel, down some guards for the plat to buy the key.  Have some molars on you from the warrens to fix your faction back up neatly.  Guards now have a faction hit! So be careful.<br />
<br />
Rogues hate to be used as door openers.<br />
<br />
Some other options are get a shrink or wolf form.<br />
<br />
I have used the key many many times, and had it pay for itself by raids and soloing the entrance.</div></div><hr />
