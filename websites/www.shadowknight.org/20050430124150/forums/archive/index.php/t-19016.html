<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Duke Xerro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My guild is working on completing all the trials so that we can kill the Seventh Hammer. But today, it seems as if the trials were bugged. The 6th member of our group could not enter the trials, and once, only one of our members was allowed in. Has anybody experienced this bug, or is it only on the E'Ci server? Thanks</div></div><hr />
