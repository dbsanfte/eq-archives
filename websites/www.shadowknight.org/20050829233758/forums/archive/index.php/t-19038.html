2. Pets<br />
3. 75% slowed mob<br />
4. Both regen mana at huge rates.<br />
<br />
Both can solo some big named mobs and when you combine the 2 its quite impressive.</div></div><hr />

Tried necro/sham, great fun, but runs out of hunting options at 65.<br />
SK + Sham is better in my opinion.<br />
Think of a SK as a necro that can take the hits untill the mob is slowed 8)<br />
AND tanks are always required for groups.<br />
Shams are in demand a lot, but if you have a sham and a good tank, you are a group, others are optional.<br />
Hope this helps!<br />

Rowf! rowf rowf!<br />
