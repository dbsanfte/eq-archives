<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neffera</div><div class="date">04-01-2002, 10:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm fairly new to the shadowknight class myself (although I've been watching over my husband's shoulder for 60 levels :)) while I played a cleric.<br />
<br />
Well, to make a long story short - why should he get to have all the fun? I decided it's about time I make a SK of my own.<br />
<br />
I've decided upon an erudite shadowknight (they're awfully pretty with the new graphics on) but I have a bit of an aversion to Odus, and I was hoping to get her relocated ASAP. Here's my question: is there anywhere on Antonica an erudite shadowknight can train, and perhaps buy and sell? I was thinking along the lines of Freeport/Neriak, but I'm not sure how they'd feel about me over there.<br />
<br />
Any insight into erudite faction issues would be much appreciated, and any overall suggestions would be welcome as well.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jobrill</div><div class="date">04-01-2002, 10:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your faction in Neriak/Freeport should be pretty much a-ok. I found I was dubious to NFP from the start (Although you might wanna kill a few DF Orcs just to be sure). Watch out for the Gnome inside the jewelry shop tho. You will be indiff to the Coalition of Tradesfolk (Faction most of the merchants are on). You will be apprehensive to the Milita, and Aimiable to the Human Shadowknights of Freeport. In Neriak, you will be dubious to a couple factions, but indiff to The Dead (Dark Elf SK/Necro guild), so you can train. HOWEVER, The Ghouls who guard the entrance to The Dead Guild Hall will be KOS to you, although once you get level 9, you can just cast invisibility to undead to get past them.<br />
<br />
As a bonus, you will also be non-KOS to the Orcs of NRO, Oasis, and SRO, and non-KOS to Desert Madmen.<br />
<br />
The only incredibly annoying thing is that commonsresidents will be dubious, so you won't be able to buy from all the merchants in that area, but even that is surmountable with enough Orcs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Syfon</div><div class="date">04-02-2002, 01:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can up your de faction with the gaurds and some of the merchants (esp the one who sells the coffins at the cleric hall) by giving  the one of the people in the library flasks of wine (you can purchase these in the same zone as the library). Give him 4 stacks of 4 and get 16 hits at a time. The wine is only a few silver and you can take your faction to ally with the merchants.<br />
<br />
I cant remember the guy's name but as you enter the library he is in a room by himself on the left. He wont really say anything if you hail him but just takes the wine and gives faction adjustment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sekhmeth</div><div class="date">04-02-2002, 02:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I started out as Kos to Neriak (Cazic Thule worshipper) but killing halflings in Nektulos corrected that very fast. <br />
<br />
You can train in Freeport just fine, and in Neriak after a few halfling massacres ;)<br />
<br />
However if you want to train in Neriak, be aware that the Ghouls guarding the entrance will be Kos to you. <br />
<br />
Use Invis to undead to get by and enjoy the benefits of guild training and vendors :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chozzen</div><div class="date">04-02-2002, 05:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Possibly now more than ever it's a good time to be a evil Erudite. With the Luclin portal only a stones throw from Paineel its a short trip from your new home to the rest of the world. As long as you have somewhere close by to a) Bank and b) Train. The world is yours...but you might need to invest a little time in obtaining it.  <br />
<br />
;) <br />
<br />
What I did with Choz was start him in the Paineel newbie yard until 4/5 for 2 reasons. One being it's simply the best newbie yard bar none and Two. Bone chips. You will need some when you hit level 9 and get your first pet and higher level Necros are always buying them. Sometimes as much as 5pp a stack. <br />
<br />
After the newbie yard greened out, Duck inside the Warrens and go on a puppy slaughter. It's fun and once again. The exp is dandy considering its so rarely used. at level 5 or 6 you can easily break/control the first 4 spawns.<br />
<br />
At level 10.  after getting the first set of spells. I managed to get a port out  to North Karana. I wanted positive Qeynos faction and to date. That's been the roughest faction to obtain. To start you are KoS to everyone there. Solution? Blackburrow...and another puppy slaughter. Once you get to the point where you can hand in Gnoll teeth to the Captain. You are golden. You can bank, buy/sell with most of the merchants and all the other &quot;perks&quot; of a light city. Save for the Casters. I never discovered how to improve faction with them, but even that is workable. Just avoid Nostahla Westfend as she wanders and never go past the bank towards the caster guild houses and you should be fine.<br />
<br />
After level 13, It's time to go to Freeport/Neriak and do the dreadful Ro/Oasis time investiment. Yeah. it's a pain but it goes quickly. Add to that you are apprehensive to both West/East Freeport and Neriak. Amible to the Church of Rage (SK Trainers in FP) and the fact you can start to Window Shop in EC. You will reach level 15 (and new spells) in no time. <br />
<br />
At 15 is where you need to make a choice. Do you want to carve out a new adventure for yourself? Or do you want to do the questionable but now commonplace practice of the loio/FM/OT/DL/KC/Seb grind on Kunark. <br />
<br />
That's boring. :p <br />
<br />
After being reltitively pampered in FP/Neriak, I wanted another faction challenge. So Highpass hold I went. And man..the fun you can have there.  <br />
<br />
Once in Highpass. Get your self set up on the Gnoll side. Its trickly at 15/16 but you and your new pet &quot;can&quot; solo here. If you get jumped by another mob, you are right by the zone. Maybe you will luck out and score a PGT or 2 to sell to some Halfling. :D <br />
<br />
Orc Groups are also nothing sneeze at. The exp is incredible, and the faction +'s are for both Karana residents and Highkeep as well. Shouldn't take long until you are able to turn in Gnoll/Orc scalps and even more exp/faction goodness and you will be 22 before you  know it. <br />
<br />
If I knew then what I know now..I would have keep Choz in Highkeep all this time instead of going to Luclin when it came out. Yes the exp in Neb Lair and MSeru is decent. But sometimes near impossible to get a group and the Downtime from soloing is brutal. <br />
<br />
So, at 22. With your new spells and your first damage cap removed. enter Highkeep and begin to whack goblins in the Guard Room and Lookout Room. at 26. You are primed for Warrior and Raider room groups. Watch out for trains though and you will hit 30 in no time at all and you will have aquired enough faction to go just about anywhere you want. <br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Except Rivervale. Slaughter the Halflings in Nek Woods as much as you possibly can. Because 1) It's fun and 2) Halflings suck. &gt;: )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Typhoid</div><div class="date">04-02-2002, 06:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not sure what your issues are with Odus, but it's a great place to start a new Erud SK.  As mentioned earlier you are a stones throw away from all you need, great noob killing field, fairly un-used low level dungeon, nexus portal, and Stonebrut came out after I had left Odus, but it might work well enough to get you to go with a group to the hole.  I happen to love Odus for the fact that many people have a distaste for it, meaning its much easier to find open space there.  Don't rush to leave Odus it has a lot to offer.  But if you must leave, I think a great plan has already been mentioned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Emnity</div><div class="date">04-02-2002, 06:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Before I rerolled as a smurf I was an Erudite, here's what I did:<br />
<br />
1-5 In the newbie garden, that flew fast.<br />
5-8 In the Warrens.<br />
<br />
Went to Odus and caught a boat to Qeynos, got killed on the dock in Qeynos but that was okay because I'd banked my gear in Erudin. (dont hand in Kobald Molars and you'll be fine in Erud - but dont go to the casters guilds upstairs in the palace).<br />
<br />
Second try, I snuck through the sewers and go a bind by the secret entrance near the gates in North Qeynos.<br />
<br />
Went up to Black Burrow and killed for a couple of levels which fixed my Qeynos faction, again dont bother with the Gnoll teeth to the captain in South Qeynos as it hammers your corrupt guard faction and more importantly your blood sabre faction (don't know what this is like by default).<br />
<br />
Sometime in my early teens I went out into WK and killed bandits, looted all the bronze and defaulted on sashes - was KOS to Karana residents and that stupid ogre or was it the gnoll killed me one time. Eventually I was either not KOS or not far from it and at 16 I headed to highpass. Got bound at the zoneline, got in a gnoll group until 18 and became non KOS in Highpass. Went to the orcs until around 20 to become indifferent nad handed in a bunch of gnoll pelts and orc scalps to the respective guards which got me in good stead there.<br />
<br />
Didn't take the erud much further than that tho, but remember being KOS to the dwarfs at the dock in Butcherblock.<br />
<br />
I'd imagine most of faydwer, halas and possibly the trolls would be a write off. Not sure about the ogres but they do worship Cazic Thule mostly.<br />
<br />
Wierdly I have better faction in Oggok than Grobb as an Innoruuk follower, i'd imagine you're the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tyrrax</div><div class="date">04-02-2002, 07:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you're looking for another way on boosting dark elf faction do the evil research quest in South Ro.  Basically give the NPC ( I don't remember the name) a lightstone or greater lightstone.  Good thing also is at lower levels the quest yields XP and PP loot.<br />
<br />
The quest also yields a faction increase with th Dread Guard Outer (Guards in Nektulos and Neriak Foreign Quarter I think),Dread Guard Inner (Guards in Third Gate I think), and most importantly gives good faction with the Dark Bargainers (DE merchants) which BTW the DE women in South Ro run on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">synnoira</div><div class="date">04-02-2002, 09:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">and to add another super xp spot in odus now...kerra isle off tox forest<br />
get a partner or a trio and you can make some super xp at the entrance off the cats in your mid to late teens<br />
the cats do all have sow though and tend to runaway and gather a bunch of friends so darkness/snare/root is pretty much a must<br />
well worth a go though if you can get the company</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ghorz</div><div class="date">04-02-2002, 12:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Originally posted by Jobrill<br />

<br />
I find that interesting.<br />
Me as an Innoruuk worshipping troll shadowknight am dubious to The Dead (even after killing a lot Arcanes in Nektulos Forest), but warmly to the ghouls at entrance.<br />
So I can only train in Freeport Tunnels and Grobb.</div></div><hr />
