<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Karsan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi fellas.  Where should I be hunting at level 36.<br />
<br />
I don't have an awful lot of time to play my SK lately, but I'm trying to PL him up to where I can group with my shaman and maybe one day dual-box them.  For the most part, it's safe to assume the Karso has constant shaman buffs of Focus(HoS), STA, AGI, Regen, Haste, AC buffs, DS potions, etc., in addition to his magelo.<br />
<br />
Here's my Magelo:<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=767385<br />
<br />
Karso's currently using the Hammer of Battle 17/25 + stats/hp off SoRZ along with an Atrameritous Shield 28ac 50hp/mana.<br />
<br />
I have an exquisite velium Claidhmore 32/36 in my bag, along with a WMBS and Great Maul of Hatred.  I'm keeping all melee skills (1hs/2hs/1hb/2hb/P) maxxed, but in your opinion, is the HoB/shield combo better for me at this level vs. the 32/36 2hs or one of the other 2hr's?  I like the extra mana/hp/ac from using the shield combo, but what do some of you guys think?  I currently switch out the hammer/shield combo in favor of the claidhmore depending on if I'm tanking or DPS.  Most groups though I just end up tanking.<br />
<br />
Back to the original question - solo'ing with shaman backup, where would I get the fastest progression for Karso so I can ultimately dual-box them?<br />
<br />
Also, any gear suggestions or changes would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sol B has a decent xp bonus.<br />
You can do Dread Lands.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>TelimTor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You can ride the bonus in Sol A until 40.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Squigle D'Muerte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you are trying to keep all weapon skills maxed I would consider getting yourself a two-tined pitchfork.  They sell for like 800pp or less and with a 26 damage 22 delay have one of the best damage/delays in the game.  Only disadvantage is they have a poor plus.<br />
<br />
As far as shield goes it depends how you are playing.  If you are fear kiting definitely lose the shield.   You want the biggest damage weapon you got out for fear kiting, screw defense you shouldn't be getting hit.  Otherwise you have to do what works for you but only 1 handed weapon I have used in a long time was the shard of night which makes rogues drool but is kind of expensive.<br />
<br />
If you have the expansion, The Gulf of Gunthak beach has crazy good exp at your level and mobs have fairly low hps.  Just go to the beach.  Living and undead mobs.  Not much room for kiting though so best to bring a healer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ramgar SK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Also try Dawnshroud Peaks, and Overthere.  Both are usually good for a quick group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Karsan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">on maelin they're both virtually empty all the time.  I zone into Dreadlands and I'm normally the only person in the zone.<br />
<br />
Rathe Mtns., OT, DL, DSP, etc.  Normally have 1 - 3 players at any given time, with me being 1 or 2 of them - so groups are hard to find in my experience on this server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">HUNT IN STONEBRUNDT!<br />
<br />
Words, gems, tradeskill items and a super sick ZEM.  Just no undead....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Androsulach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">From 37 to 44, I soloed cave basilisks in Jaggedpine Forest in the caves where the gem from Blackburrow sends you.  The basilisks are in the cave off to the right from the gnoll area.  At 36, the basilisk genitors will be tough, but great exp.  The side benefit from genitors are the eggs they drop.  I've looted as many as 4 per kill and have sold them for 5p a piece in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Oagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">DL would be good.  You could 2 box there until 49 if you really wanted to on a steady diet of dark blues.  No ZEM, but just alot of mobs to keep you going steady.<br />
<br />
Take him into Dulak's and do the mobs at the entrance.  Loot is probably some of the best inthe game for that level.  Don't save he shivs.<br />
<br />
Dawnshroud...close and like DL with steady supply of mobs.<br />
<br />
I'd say once you got to lvl 40, do the Hole Entrance.  Great xp there.<br />
<br />
You got a shaman that's gunna keep him buffed and alive.  Take your pick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Karsan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Update on this:<br />
<br />
I was able to play some this weekend and went from 36 - 37 in DSP on the gorangas by ME.<br />
<br />
Then I joined a couple LDoN adventures in Lfay.<br />
<br />
The first one we did was a collect 25, and I started it at 20% into 37.  Group composition was (twinked): Me (37sk), 36sk, 37 war, 36 rog, 37 bard, 38 cleric.<br />
<br />
We won in 16 minutes tearing through the zone like a whirlwind.  When the timer popped us out, we were 2 mobs shy of slaughtering every living thing in the entire zone.<br />
<br />
We were all laughing.  Sometimes it's just fun to go back through those.  Right after it I picked up another group and went back for a collect 21 in the same zone and while this group wasn't quite as fast - we won it easily and most of the group took off, but the rogue and I stayed on, and ended up duo'ing much of the rest of the zone - Including a named and working on my split techniques.<br />
<br />
I had a blast in LDoN as a SK.  I went from 37 at 20% to lvl 38 and 6% in 2 LDoN adventures.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Squigle D'Muerte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">LDoN is interesting because you go there for different reasons at different levels.  <br />
<br />
At 37 you get almost no adventure points for a win but great exp.  <br />
<br />
At 60+ you get great adventure points but no where near as good exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Karsan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well, I dunno - on my shaman at 65 going 100% AA I get 51 points per adventure, but generally we also end up getting around 40 - 60% AA.  Not GREAT experience, but not bad for an hour either.<br />
<br />
The problem I've found grouping with my shaman in there is after we win - everyone's hellbent on getting out and getting to the next adventure ASAP rather than staying on to exp until the timer expires.<br />
<br />
My girlfriend just moved in with me, and she has a 65 mage and 65 cleric that she dual-boxes, so add on my 65 shaman, and shadowknight that I'm currently PL'ing and we should be able to chew through LDoN adventures together VERY soon.  We can already trio them, but I'd like to get Karso into the mix as well.<br />
<br />
On collection LDoN missions - has anyone else noticed that the fewer people in your group - the better the collection item drop rates?  or do you think that was just the RNG being nice to me?</div></div><hr />
