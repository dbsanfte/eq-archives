<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bugok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I haven't played my sk  (lvl 52) in a long while. When I was playing knights would get the tanking role in xp groups over a warrior. <br />
<br />
After reading a few posts and doing some searches it seems that is not the case. from what I have read:<br />
<br />
Warriors get groups more now because of dropable agro weapons, increased mitigation and more hps.<br />
<br />
Pallys are are more wanted because their stuns reduce the damage they take (but we have the same mitigation when the mob can't be stunned?).<br />
<br />
This is the impression I get from reading some posts here. Is this true, or am I missing something else? Like I said when I was last playing knights were wanted as tanks in xp groups so I just wanted to know if this is why things have changed.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your time/info<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Shadow Knights actually have superior mitigation to Paladins on non-stunnable mobs, once you acquire Aura of Pain.  But overall, that's pretty much correct.  Might want to add in the trickle down effect from the status of the high end game as well.  SKs can certainly still tank everything they could before, but are sometimes passed up for the job because of perceptions of weakness and the desire every group has to have &quot;the best&quot; tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Marruk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My impression is that this is much more of an issue for higher-end content.  In my 50's, I had little to no problem finding groups that would take a SK as MT.<br />
Even in my 60's I am able to find groups without too much trouble, just so long as they aren't GoD groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My impression is that this is much more of an issue for higher-end content.  In my 50's, I had little to no problem finding groups that would take a SK as MT.<br />

<br />
The issue is more for higher end SK's as there is some content that they can not tank without 2 healers or being overgeared.  However the diference is noticeable between warriors and SK's starting in the late 40's.  It has gotten to the point that there are groups at these levels that will not take an SK to tank.<br />
<br />
Content is However SK tankable up to GoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Daemoness</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I got told last night by a shaman they didnt think that SKs are a tank class, they changed their mind after I let them tank for a few rounds. I know for everything up until PoV I tank fine, which isnt realy saying much.<br />
 But as with higher lvl content on my mage I have done hard LDoN and sewer trials easily with 7k SKs and they have done far better jobs then 7.5k+ Pallys and Wars. So unless you are going to rush to high end GoD you should be fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">A 7k SK can only outperform a 7.5k pally if the pally really, really sucks, nor can he out-perform a 7.5k warrior on content like sewer trials.  That's of course assuming AC is appropriate for the HP - for all we know you could have a 7k/1800ac SK and a 7.5k/1150ac pally, and that's just not a fair comparison.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The issue is more for higher end SK's  <br />
<br />
High end SK's don't have a problem grouping or tanking. It seems the issue is more with the very good LDoN/bazaar geared SK and perhaps the Elemental geared SK. Lower end and higher end don't seem to have too many issues getting groups.<br />
<br />
As far as who is the best tank choice for the group, it depends on the zone and the rest of the group make up, all three have strengths and weaknesses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Higher-end players tend to group more within their own guild, or with other players from similar guilds. There is alot less random /lfg groupage.<br />
<br />
Aside from gear etc. that Time/GoD SKs have, the big advantage for grouping is often the people that you get to group with. Well geared CLRs and high-dps group members make a huge difference in how viable SKs can be as tanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Very true.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>velourea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">the problem isn't tanking, it's perception. joseph goebbles said it best: &quot;a lie repeated often enough will eventually become the new truth.&quot; sk's can't tank as well as war's, but they were never meant to. sk's tank marginally worse than paladins on stunnable mobs as a trade off for increased dps. personally, i haven't ever been told i can't tank because of my class. <br />
<br />
to be honest, i have had problems tanking in the past, but that was almost always due to either trying new zones with mainly red mobs (hello PoV at level 55) or a gear deficiency (hello BoT with 3.5k unbuffed).<br />
<br />
at the level of progression i am at, as a bazaar/ldon sk progressing through PoP, i feel that tanking isn't a problem at all given that you are appropriately geared. if siilvir is being honest about tanking at the high-end, then i'm not sure what the &quot;tanking problem&quot; is. i know the squeaky wheel gets the oil, but running around telling all the other classes that you &quot;can't tank&quot; isn't very productive in my opinion. leave those complaints to the official class board or the sk.org suggestions forum. soe is slow to fix, but other classes aren't going to help &quot;fix&quot; us, as they have their own issues to deal with. <br />
<br />
i can see, however, that the tanking heirarchy could use some tweaking, but if that is the case then i think it should be a global-type change to mitgation tables. a mini-defensive as some have suggested would be a nice toy, but that alone without any sort of class damage calculation adjustment would be missing the mark (and not to mention infuriate those greedy warriors).<br />
<br />
the most pressing issue i deal with personally with sk's is that agro is fugged. the fact that no truly informed sk's use terror's unless given no other option is ridiculous. also, i havent so much as looked at a voice spell in months. why am i using level 15 spells for agro? i see that as a high priority fix. i don't care if i can't tank as well as a war as long as i can get the mob to hate me more on demand.<br />
<br />
maybe i just play on a server where people aren't so ignorant as to blindly believe what they're told without experience, but damn, some people need to get a grip.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>bugok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Thanks for all the info. I appreciate all the input you gave. Guess Ill have to spend some pp to gear up my sk again since I had a blast playinghim before my break form eq<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>cames</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I find that generally I have difficulty getting non-guild groups for GoD.  For anything else people consider SKs an acceptable tank.  The break point request on my server seems to be the following question:  &quot;Do you have 8khps unbuffed?&quot;  If the answer is no, they say thank you very much we will find another tank.</div></div><hr />

Terror of Thule<br />

 <br />
Mana: 	60 	<br />
Skill: 	Alteration<br />
Casting Time: 	1.5<br />
<br />
fast cast - check<br />
low mana - check<br />
dont fizzle - well, if they work like they're supposed to, the half-second delay caused by a fizzle shouldn't matter much, and the mana lost from fizzling is neglible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>cames</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">It would be even better if it actually generated aggro.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Synapticus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Dont be facetious.  <br />
We all know terror doesnt work as well as fear or CD (99% of the time). <br />
With casting expertise 1, it never fizzles, takes only 20 mana (even better) and are relatively fast casting.<br />
Like Atrocity says, any change would be a downgrade, and &quot;worse than the way it is now&quot;</div></div><hr />

You're an idiot if youuse that spell as it is..<br />
<br />
You have better spells for agro, use those.</div></div><hr />

 :rolleyes: how about you read the thread before imparting it with your endless knowledge. i was making the point that the spells were supposed to use would be just as efficient if they actually worked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">any time I see a suggestion with a hard coded  flat # I think of the terror spells and cringe.  That includes Brael's latest Protection of Calicov (SP) idea.</div></div><hr />

The very fact that it is hits and not damage guarantees it scales. 5 swings from an orc and you've mitigated 50 points, 5 swings from Heartstriker Jhiru and you've mitigated 5,000 damage with the same spell. Unless I'm mis-reading your post I don't understand your point.</div></div><hr />

I never said terrors worked better then CD. I'm stating terrors do in fact produce aggro just not enough.If sony changed it to like 1600+ hate it would be snap aggro.</div></div><hr />

you understood my point<br />
I was uncertain at the time if it was set # of hits or # of seconds at the time I posted though.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />

How about you reread what I said .. You're an idiot if you use that spell as it is. <br />

It wasn't dirrected at you, it was dirrected at anyone who uses it in its current state.</div></div><hr />
