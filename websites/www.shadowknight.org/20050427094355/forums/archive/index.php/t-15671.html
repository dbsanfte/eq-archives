<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>tatanka7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm starting a new SK soon, and can't get at the info I'm searching for with castersrealm being down, and was hoping the folks here could help me.<br />
<br />
What are the racial abilities/skills of the various SK races?<br />
<br />
The ones I know so far are:<br />
Iksar/Troll get better HP regen (is this pretty significant at 60+?  For 2-5 HP/tick, I really don't care).<br />
<br />
Troll/Ogre get slam.<br />
<br />
Ogres can't be stunned from the front.<br />
<br />
I know some races have better vision/infravision, etc, but not too interested in that.<br />
<br />
Gnomes get tinkering.<br />
<br />
So are there any more I'm missing?<br />
<br />
Also, what are the good deities to choose for cultural armor (or for other reasons)?<br />
<br />
I'll be rolling a shaman at the same time as the SK, and using my druid to PL them together.  So any issues that would be considered negative for a certain race based on soloing can be ignored.  I'll always be playing the three together.<br />
<br />
Right now I'm leaning towards the Ogre for great fighting stats, slam, and no stuns.  However, how hard will it be to get the INT raised to a respectable level in the 50s?  I'm not in a raiding guild, and will have limited funds to twink with.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help you can offer,<br />
<br />
Tat</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jodgrim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Dark Elves - high starting int, ultravision<br />
Erudite - High starting int<br />
Gnome - High starting int, infravision, tinkering<br />
Human - Average all around stats<br />
Iksar - AC bonus, increased regen, infravision<br />
Ogre - High melee stats, unstunable by melee attacks from the front, infravision, slam<br />
Troll - high starting melee stats, increased regen, infravision, slam<br />
<br />
No stat is really all that hard to raise, regen 60+ is moot, vision is easily corrected with spells/items. The only things that can't be compensated for with spells and gear is ogre no frontal stunn, and Iksar AC bonus.<br />
<br />
<br />
Seriously, just pick the one you like the looks of best, that is the only thing that matters anymore.</div></div><hr />

Go with a DE. Cultural armor is great for the price. Ultravision is nice. Don't have to worry about INT.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>tatanka7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks guys!<br />
<br />
I definitely will go with Troll or Ogre.  The Iksar looks nice, but the limit of cultural armor has me not liking them so much.<br />
<br />
I have to basically decide between better regen or no stuns.  Looking at a chart I found at Monkly Business, it looks like the racial HP regen is quite considerable at high levels.  Since this will never be a raid-type char (just XP groups), 20/tick or so of extra HP regen will be quite nice =)<br />
<br />
One other question, not race related:<br />
<br />
What is the default timer for HT?  Can't seem to find that info anywhere.<br />
<br />
Thanks again!<br />

With the bazaar he will have no trouble finding armor that will make up for not wearing plate.<br />
<br />
and lack of decent cultural armor. <br />
Yeah, you lizards did get boned there...<br />
<br />
And since the Greenmist quest is open to all and is now outdated, that shouldn't be a factor, either. <br />
Neither of us mentioned Greenmist.<br />
<br />

Ogre cultural armor is also quite nice. Although I will admit it is harder to come by. As for int, mana regen &gt; mana pool and without gear/buffs all races regen mana at the same rate. Not to mention that is probably the easiest stats to raise.<br />
<br />
The 20% exp penalty sucks mucho ass. Believe me. <br />
He is planning on 3 boxing so I'm doubting he is the type of person who worries about XP penalties that much.<br />
<br />
Seriously, looks are the only thing that matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lunaticfringesk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Jodgrim is right on in his comments.<br />
<br />
One other quick comment to add about IKS and armor...<br />
<br />
As Jodgrim mentioned, the bazaar will provide *plenty* of armor opportunities for an IKS to properly gear up, to say nothing about the quests (pretty easy to) to get palatable armor.<br />
<br />
On the high-end side of things, which is where cultural somewhat resides...<br />
<br />
Ornate *IS* wearable by all classes.  Yes, I know that the prices are VERY high (at least on the server that I play on), but I feel very confident in predicting that the prices will come down significantly in the near future.  They just drop FAR too often in Sol Ro to keep the prices high for very long.  Hell, this weekend alone, in the Xuzi caves fopr a period of approx 5 hrs, we must have got like 12ish ornate drops (chain is a turd to get a hold of though...).<br />
<br />
The point of all this is, the armor *drawback* of an IKS borders on meaningless nowadays.  What that basically means is that an IKS will generally have an AC advantage over all other classes, all other things equal<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Sometimes i wish i was a troll,  But no other race can kick much ass and look as hot as me :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>bernsy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I mentioned the Greenmist because some people back in the day actually used that as a factor. I did. An entertain series of quests resulting in a decent weapon.<br />
<br />
As for the armor, you can't start throwing in ornates/elementals and what not without considering the level, both numeric and usage. Tat, go to the bazaar and do a search armor for various slots. Do one without race, then do one with iksar. You'll know what I'm talking about.<br />
<br />
My argument was simply that if he's going to have an SK that's going to be played until around 55+ish (may 60ish) in a non-raiding guild, then the affordability and availablity of mid level armor is very significant.<br />
<br />
The comment about INT for a DE was that it was just one less stat he had to worry about.  Everyone knows that mana regen is way more important. But INT has nothing to do with that.<br />
<br />
And since he's leveling 2 characters at once, a big disparity in exp gain can be annoying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Lunaticfringesk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">While I agree that more options has to be superior to fewer option, it just isnt that big a deal.<br />
<br />
All you have to do is do a search on Allak for an IKS SHD, for say a BP, and see ALL the options that are avaiable that are not no drop.  The list is large and the choices are numerous.  <br />
<br />
There are just so many items that have been introduced into the game since Kunark, where this drawback originated, that the drawback is almost moot.  And dont forget, the IKS has an AC bonus from inception.<br />
<br />
Furthrmore, once you graduate to Thurg armor and above, its moot again, as all that armor is for all races as well.<br />
<br />
It just isnt that big a deal at all anymore<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>tatanka7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thanks again for all the comments!<br />
<br />
&quot;And since he's leveling 2 characters at once, a big disparity in exp gain can be annoying.&quot;<br />
<br />
Regarding the race XP penalties, I thought VI made a change about two years ago that basically removed them if you were grouped, so as to allow equal levelled friends to keep grouping together without spreading out in levels.<br />
<br />
I remember a quote about basically &quot;creating extra XP out of nothing&quot; to make up for the racial penalty.<br />
<br />
Tat</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>bernsy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">had my iksar SK grouped with my druid and the exp penalty was still there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Dakkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Tatanka, what they did a couple of years ago was stop applying your exp penalties to the group you were in, if I recall correctly.  Up till this point Iksar shadowknights were famous for not getting groups ...<br />
<br />
I remember a few months ago having to trash my troll shaman then PL a barb a little, because he was always falling behind the friend's character that he was created to duo with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Nibbs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">if your strictly going to play the 3 chars together (or 2) and never group at higher levels then troll/iksar is what i would choose, that regen is just to nice over time (saving mana not having to heal)<br />
<br />
if there is a reasonable chance you will group then i would say ogre, all else being equal nothing in game touchs not being stunned (cant cast, cant do damage just stand there like a doofus)<br />
<br />
one thing not mentioned about gnomes (and reason i picked mine through faulty thinking) their cultrul arms have a 40% haste spell that lasts about 20 minutes (10 charges for 56 plat)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Draven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Sorry, this may be off topic but i didnt wanna waste a new thread topic slot for 2 small questions, and this was the closest thing in search...<br />
<br />
<br />
1) Do ogres get EXP penalty?<br />
<br />
2) Do Ogres get hp regen?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jodgrim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">1) Ogres have a 15% xp penality<br />
<br />
2) No they do not have increased HP regen, but they are unstunable by melee attacks from the front.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Simple fix for this, choose a troll shaman (like anyone would want anything other than a troll shaman) so your shammy and your iksar SK have the same xp penalty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Lizarde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Originally posted by Lunaticfringesk <br />
While I agree that more options has to be superior to fewer option, it just isnt that big a deal. <br />
I agree.  And Veksar has also added even more armor that is usable by IKS SHD, and pretty much closes the AC gap on wearable armor.  Windworn BP (droppable PoP item) has more AC (54) than any cultural BP, and is Iksar-wearble.  And there are drops from PoP and Veksar that are close to or better than cultural armor in the AC deptartment, and often they have more stats and comparable or better +HP/Mana.<br />
<br />
The 'plate problem' for Iksar mostly affects them at lower levels, and their racial bonus helps make up for some of that anyway.  By the time you're in your 50s, if you can get into a guild that it doing Kael/PoG, you'll catch up on worn AC before long, and at that point you'll actually have a small edge due to your racial bonus.</div></div><hr />
