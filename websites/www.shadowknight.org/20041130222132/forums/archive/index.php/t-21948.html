<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all.<br />
<br />
I thought of good idea of raising FT cap when OOW comes out. I heard rumors that FT cap might be upped but unknown atm if it would happen or not and what amt it would do.<br />
<br />
My suggestion is improve it up to FT20 by lvl 70 and have it scaled each level<br />
Level   Max gear FT<br />
65       15<br />
66       16<br />
67       17<br />
68       18<br />
69       19<br />
70       20<br />
<br />
That way, it won't EVEN affect pre-65 content and it helps to accomodate more expensive post-65 spells to keep mana reg in-line while your innate hp regeneration WILL increase as you level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Belyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Wonder if they are going to raise the worn atk cap as well.  I gotta be well over 300 now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah I think atk cap should be upped or removed entirely as well. Heck, our AC from gear has no virtual hard cap while our atk has hard cap from gear, pfft.<br />
<br />
Hp regeneration cap from gear should be upped as well post 65.. The reason why I mentioned about FT cap cuz its sooo easy to hit cap with FT than with atk or hp regeneration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xanathol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Point on the matter ( not that I am against raising the cap - just making a point ) ...your FT in your magelo comes mostly from 3 items, 1, albiet, you will prob not replace for a LONG time, if ever, which happens to be 8. Not everyone stuck around in VT to get that neck piece. There are upgrades for the shield in the EPs, that lack FT6. The shoulders are not very good for a tank. So 8 from an item not everyone sticks around for these days, and 9 from items that will go away through PoP. There are items for SKs pre-Time PoP that give ~8 FT that would be potential upgrades to your gear, and a few of these off of gods. So yeah, I guess you can say Time+ its easy to cap FT, but if you aren't in Time or higher, and you are after the best gear you can get, the FT cap isn't &quot;soooo&quot; easy to reach as an SK. Other classes, another story. And no...I don't think its reasonable to fully aug an entire set of LDoN gear with all FT. Just a point on the matter. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Belyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">well, pre time i was ft1...the soltice earring.  Post time im at the ft cap and i didnt even have to plan my gear out to get it...just happend that way.  Im pretty sure there is a ok sk bracer in time that has ft 8 too, and i dont have one.  On a side note i dont have the VT neck either.  Far as i know omens is a post time expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Bah, I'm not talking about SK class specificially for FT cap. Its for everyone to enjoy. It's easy for most classes to hit FT15..<br />
<br />
Heck, if you wanna talk about my magelo.. I'm technically FT23.. Without Aten neck, it would be FT15..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Noctix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I really like Nocifer's idea of raising the FT cap by 1 per level beyond 65.  This idea is scaleable for future expansions too (so we'd get FT25 when they introduce level 75).<br />
<br />
Atk and regen caps should be raised similarly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Daywalka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">FT 15 isn't too hard to get even pre-VT nowdays.<br />
<br />
Casual Players- <br />
LDoN augments - FT 6<br />
Ornate Boots - FT3<br />
Solstice Earring - FT1<br />
Crown of Narandi - FT2<br />
Medalion of Arcane Scientists - FT3<br />
Girdle of the Tactician - FT3<br />
Eye of Cazic Thule - FT1<br />
Brain of Cazic Thule - FT1<br />
<br />
That's just what I can think of off the top of my head. If you had all of those, you'd be at FT 20 right there, and all of those, save the last 3, are available to anyone with some time and/or plat to burn. Even the last 3 in the list aren't too terribly hard to get with a decent guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Tribute = FT5</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">LDON augment = ft 1+1+1+2+2+2= 9 possible ft augs i think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Skvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Maybe I am odd in my thinking, but I actually think that mana regen has created a problem in the game....<br />
<br />
for a moment i would like to forget hybrids even exist in the game.. yeah I know they do but it is easier to explain if I can just ignore them for a while.<br />
<br />
In the old days pure casters HAD to med, these days how often do you really see an int caster on a raid having to med (wis casters slightly different story as they tend to burn their mana buffing, but even so its not often they need a real med break) other than after a named mob where they have gone all out for 5 mins. I know from playing a different character I rarely if ever had to actually med. Sure I would sit down every now and then but not out of real need, more out of habit.<br />
<br />
What this zero downtime has meant for casters , is that their sustainable DPS has risen considerably and has left the melee pretty much left for dust as far as DPS goes, burst DPS its an even worse situation..but then it always has been and that was the balance - burst DPS v sustainable DPS<br />
<br />
For hyrids it gets more complicated as their oppertunities to med are limited, but honestly, with FT15, bard song, c5, 9, SP how often do you even run close to running out of mana and having to actually manage your spell casting ? I know even with my FT1, C5 and SP I have to go pretty insane with lifetapping to chew through my mana and so if I avoid lifetapping I know I can pretty much cast what I want for around 1 1/2 hours before i need a med break. <br />
<br />
Upping the FT cap can only serve to further shift the balance towards pure casters in terms of sustainable DPS and that can only be a bad thing for all melee's (pure and hybrid) desirability both in a raid situation and in a group situation</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Belyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">In a way increasing the ft cap will diminish the usefulness/power of our bite spells.  They will be less useful because twitching a full mana bar is pointless.  And they will be less powerful becuase they provide ft10(zb) ontop of the ft 15 cap, if cap is raised to say 20, zb will still only provide ft10 decreasing the percentage of total mana regen it provides.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">You are forgetting that we get zev bite upgrade (FT13) for OOW to scale.. And there are OOW spells that cost more mana for casters. Upping FT cap would scale and we stil see about same mana flow pre- and post- OOW so there wouldn't be any difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Belyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">lvl 70 zb will be more ft, but weather or not it will scale will depend on what the cap is raised to and how mana intensive/useful the new spells are.</div></div><hr />
