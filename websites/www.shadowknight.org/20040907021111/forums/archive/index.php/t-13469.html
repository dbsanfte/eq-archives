<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>gebbly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I dont want to get into the whole race xXx is the best debate as it seems to have been gone through a large number of times.<br />
<br />
I am quite amused by the idea of a gnome SK and so am thinking of creating one. All I really want to know is how playable is a gnome SK. Do they solo/group well? Can they pull their own weight in raids? Am I going to get to a certian level and find gnome SKs are wholly unplayable?<br />
<br />
For example a friend mentioned that it is difficult finding armour for them as most SK armour is either medium or large, is this true?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vuloshek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I never had trouble finding gear as a gnome.  There are plenty of little people only items that are nice, actually, like an enchanted dwarven breastplate.  Having not been through the whole game, I can't say what it's like towards the end, but I don't see how there will be a problem.<br />
<br />
Other than that, asking if a gnome is playable is like asking if a dark elf is playable.  Stat-wise, they're near clones, except that a gnome has 10 more dexterity for those proc effects, and 5 more stamina.  They have 1 less INT than dark elves... not important.  So essentially they're easier to play than dark elves, except for one thing:<br />
<br />
I'd take into consideration that there are some people out there who'll disrespect you for being a gnome... but you'd never know that by reading this forum.  You'd better be a fast talker, you'll have to impress people to get them to take you seriously sometimes.  Lucky gnomes are good for soloing in those mid levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hsystah Shadowspawn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yup, you are going to be put down before anything.  Just play one and have fun.  Good luck.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>velin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Auctually gnomes have some very good player made armor...clockwork stuff. I have over 1150 ac unbuffed at 57 and my int is 199 so id say ya they are good for both grouping and soloing.  Dont worry about all these other whiney races saying the gnomes are no good cause they just jelous that they get stuck in doorways and have the int of a gnat..=) j/k.  But seriously they are a very viable race for a SK and just have fun with what ever one ya pick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Erasmus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I suppose it is probably fair to say that ultimately any existant race/class combo is playable.  Each race has their own set of advantages/disadvantages.<br />
<br />
Gnomes are as easy to equip well as any SK class. They actually have very solid stats too. They don't have an exp penalty, their cultural armor is quite excellent, and tinkering could be fun to mess with. Short size is a blessing and a curse. Getting mocked for being a gnome will be the only really drawback. But you know that going into it, I imagine. So have fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>yictor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I currently have a 64 Gnome Shadowknight on the Zeb. server, we are very rare and i am currently the highest active gnome sk.<br />
<br />
With regards to, are they playable or not, really is based on you the player. Gear is nice and basically the same as any other sk with exception to culture. The shortness is kind of a blessing and curse like some mentioned. In higher lv raids being small is a must, especially on 75 peeps raid.<br />
<br />
All in all the stats are basically the same as DE so a gnome is like you picking a DE. <br />
<br />
The gear is what makes or breaks the character not the race or lv.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Antihero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Gnomes sucks get over it..picka real race/class combo..geesh..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Calamity_Daemon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It's people like Antihero that screw up reasonably good ideas. Make a gnome. My alt gnome is at 26 now. I know he doesnt have great experiance in the gnome SK world but he seems really well at doing anything almost any other race can do. Except bash without a shield and regen but that really doesnt matter. If you like the idea then make a gnome. People are now going to totally flame this forum from this point on as I am like and Iksar in a high elf city on this forum. Prepare not to read mindless dribble from now to....now...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bohemith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Gnomes sucks get over it..picka real race/class combo..geesh.. <br />
<br />
Last time I checked gnome sk starting stats were almost identical to DE sk starting stats.<br />
<br />
Hmm.. of course gnomes are unplayable because of their inferior starting stats ( :rolleyes: ) when they are basically the same as DE sk's, probably the most common SK race.<br />
<br />
You, Antihero, are a fucktard.<br />
<br />
 It's people like Antihero that screw up reasonably good ideas. Make a gnome. <br />
<br />
I agree, don't let idiots tell you &quot;oh gnomes are gay&quot; when in reality they are a very viable SK race.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>gebbly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ok, thanks for laying those few concerns to rest.<br />
<br />
As several people have mentioned the gnome starting stats seem very similar to other intelligent races like DE.<br />
<br />
I read somewhere that a SK is usually 75%melee 25%caster but having played casters before  (wizard/druid/bard) I was hoping that with one of the more intelligent races and some careful gameplay I could lean those percentages closer to 50/50.<br />
<br />
I was surprised at the degree to which gnome SKs are disliked on these forums. Not that it bothers me much. When I first played EQ I had been playing ad&amp;d and had a halfling ranger and I fancied recreating him in EQ. At the time you couldnt get halfling rangers so I went with a halfling druid. A while later a friend explained halfling druids arent very popular as there are a lot of dr00ds instead. :o)<br />
<br />
So does anyone know what you call a female knight? I might as well go the whole way and have something totally differenf...Shimble Fizzywing female shadowknight extraordinaire!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>StruzorGnome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Antihero needs to suck my nuts!<br />
<br />
And, we actually get somewhat better stats cause they are identical pretty much cept for gnomes higher dex.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>kbern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">No offense but this is a dumb question.  Every race is viable to play the classes that are set for them if you know how to play the class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>gebbly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Calamity, I read in another post of yours (which turned into a bit of a flame-fest) Some rather interesting write-ups of the races from your perspective. Nice work there, just ignore all those moaners. As a newbie to SKs I thought it was handy.<br />
<br />
You said :<br />
&quot;I have outdamaged and ogre warrior with my gnome shadowknight&quot;<br />
<br />
How?!<br />
<br />
I'm interested as I would like to think a gnome SK could use magic or something to end up doing the same total damage as any other race of SK.<br />
<br />
And could we try and restrict this posting to useful information and debate for a newbie (me) rather than turning it into another contest to see who knows the most swear words?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>gebbly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Perhaps &quot;playable&quot; was the wrong word. I'm sure I'll manage to make my little gnome do fine. What I meant was is there a big gap between the different races of SK in ability?<br />
<br />
When I initially came to this forum there were so many &quot;all&gt;gnomes. gnomes suxor&quot; postings that it appeared as though gnomes were not nearly as good as any of the other SK races. However after reading up from places like castersrealm and allakhazam it seems any race can be played on par, with the more itelligent races using spells more to compensate in the lower physical stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Vuloshek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">When I was a gnome partnered with an ogre, the real difference I noticed in the low-mid levels was that he'd consistently do 10-15 more damage with a MoSS on average (someone hooked us up with MoSSes, we were new and didn't even know those were great weapons).  He had as many STR items as I did at this point, so our strength gap was the same as it was lvl 1.<br />
<br />
However, I had it in me to do some extra kiting if things went awry - generally, if he was kiting, it was 1 snare, 1 fear, fight until it dies whether fear breaks early or not, and that worked fine for him (and again, we had nearly equal INT items, so the INT gap was same as always as well).  My downtime was spent medding, his healing.  Pretty well equal; his edge was mostly that it was easier control-wise for him, but this justifies the XP penalty.  My edge was that I could more consistently take on whites or yellows solo (extra mana to recast on resists), and I could still fight if I was a bit hurt so long as I knew I had mana.  Of course, if things DID go terribly wrong, his chances of making it to the zoneline were a little better (but not much at all around lvl 20).<br />
<br />
Our differences showed clearly when it was just us two.  If I'd step back to lifetap while he tanked, I came back swinging with mana to spare and full life.  When he stepped back in, he'd have 3/4 health and be LOM, but then again it didn't much matter, and I'd be about as hurt as he was after taking over tanking for that short time.<br />
<br />
We didn't get far enough to do comparisons post-30, when magic starts to be more and more important.<br />
<br />
This only proves 1 thing - a gnome SK and an ogre SK make a kickass duo.  When you're medding next to each other, it's also pretty funny looking (I used to run back and forth jumping over him while he sat if he went AFK - it was hard to get over the crown of his head).<br />
<br />
There are probably many ways a gnome can outdamage an ogre using magic, but it's not an issue.  Either way, DPS isn't so great, it's all about control and tolerance - what can you do to prevent disaster, and how long can you take the punishment if you screw up.  At least that's my take.  Flames anyone?</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you like being a mischievous little tank running around and people giggling at you, then great.  But if your trying to be a serious tank or raid leader, you have your work cut out for you.<br />
<br />
I had a gnome warrior friend who had over 7k buffed hps and ssra weapons way back, our guild kept saying stuff like, &quot;Oh, how bout we let the little gnome tank the next one,&quot; or &quot;think he can handle that mob?&quot; and crap like that.  It was pretty depressing for the guy, but he never thought of that factor when creating his class.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, ya fun class with a ton of intel :)  <br />
<br />
Gear + Level &gt; Any melee stats...just dont wear banded and look to some ToV equipped troll thinking you picked the wrong class.  Its a trap some get into.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Vuloshek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">A quick note on banded armor - ogres in banded armor are wearing this in their graphic:<br />

A mesh skirt<br />
Fishnets<br />
Sandals<br />
<br />
Then again, just because you're dressed like a 1 ton dominatrix doesn't mean people will disrespect you or not want you tanking.  The way people percieve you is annoying as a gnome... I had many a bard jump in front of me to do the pulling and tanking when I was a gnome.  I know bards are good for pulling, at least at mid levels, but their reasoning turned out to be that they thought I wasn't as tough as they were.  It ticked me off, but it was their asses anyhow... I shouldn't have saved their lives so often (at least gnomes can move around the battlefield to taunt mobs off the others with incredible ease).<br />
And, like I'd said once before, goodies like bards are always happy to group with gnome SKs because &quot;gnomes can't be all that bad&quot;... Bertoxxulous is a sick madman, what are they thinking?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>gebbly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">&quot;I had many a bard jump in front of me to do the pulling and tanking when I was a gnome&quot;<br />
<br />
Well as a Warrior cleric of one of the dark gods I have no problem letting some fool jump in and die on my behalf. If I survive that suites my purposes :D<br />
<br />
I think I'm quite lucky with my server, I dont often see problems with people pre-judging others. [Mith Marr if your curious]</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>velin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I have never had a problem getting a group at 57.  Gear and lv&gt; race anyday.  No one is going to not pick you because you are a gnome cause anyone who knows the game knows there isnt a differnce in the race that is going to go one way or another.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Squigle D'Muerte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">All races are viable some just play differently.  Biggest real differences are size and extra abilities.<br />
<br />
Large size is a pain sometimes but if you carry shrink potions you can get around this.<br />
<br />
No Stun is nice for SKs because it means fewer interupts.<br />
<br />
Regen is huge (hence the experience penalty) for soloing SKs (my troll seldom needs to lifetap) but fairly useless in groups unless there is no true healer.<br />
<br />
INT is not as big a deal as some make of it especially since they fixed Mental Corruption and C3 became so common.  At 61 my int is 98 and I have no problems with lack of mana.  I fear kite DBs one after the next without ever resting and have been doing so since the MC fix.   Between Regen, MC and C3 my bubbles fill noticably during a kite and often I end the kite with more mana and health than I started it.<br />
<br />
Bigger mana pool is nice when things go bad but solo SKs should FD as soon as it looks bad rather than trying to fight their way out anyway.  In groups maintaining mana can be a problem but all tanks face this problem in groups where they never sit, large pool just means that it will be one more fight before you have to be careful how you spend mana.<br />
<br />
So nothing matters but having fun.  Although getting a plus to WIS on cultural armor don't help a whole lot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you people think that 10 str or 20 stamina means shit in the high end? lol.  Gnomes are as much a valid choice as any race, dont pick one if you hate the look though.  Remember, good buffs make up for a ton of stat disadvantages...skill, level, and gear make up the rest.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Vuloshek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">See what I mean?  People really WILL put you down for being a gnome.  I was insulted a few times, especially by dark elves.  I could say a million times that gnomes are marginally better SKs than dark elves, but instead I noticed the other guy's name was in purple, so I said something nasty back and went on my way.<br />
<br />
If you have a problem with gnomes in real life, you're in too deep, that's all.  Who's to say that, in reality, that guy playing the gnome isn't bigger, stronger, faster, smarter, cooler, and better looking that you?  And who cares?  Hell, 99% of the people I meet in the game are complete douchebags that I find mysdelf trying to get rid of after 2 minutes (and to make it worse, they end up liking me and looking for me all the time... I should try not to be nice) <br />
<br />
They're either <br />
a) people who can't type so it doesn't matter who they are, they can't communicate<br />
b) little kids or something... they use dudespeak, abbreviations and such, or share ill formed opinions freely without prompting<br />
c) those people that probably are pretty cool IRL, but they're so busy trying to prove to you that they're not geeks despite the fact that they play EQ (&quot;Yeah, gotta log, band practice... yeah, I play guitar, and I have a girlfriend, she's hot&quot;), that you can't have any fun playing with them.<br />
<br />
(as a side note, ever been playing with someone who pulled out a line like, &quot;unlike you guys, I have things going on IRL to take care of, *I* can't play all day&quot;?  that's the only time I tear into someone and tell them what's behind the keyboard)<br />
<br />
These people come in all shapes and sizes.  Most truly irritating people I meet are dark elves, not because &quot;dark elves are douchebags&quot;.... dark elves aren't REAL, so they can't be douchebags.  It's because dark elves are common, and I meet a lot of them.  Most of the really worthwhile people I meet are also dark elves, for the same reason.<br />
<br />
Besides, who is REALLY intimidated by Ogres?  They're not real either, but that's just my opinion, I could be wrong.<br />
<br />
I fully understand not finding gnomes to be scary or good looking or big enough, but make that YOUR CHARACTER's opinion.  Turn /role off for these discussions, please.</div></div><hr />

Now some might say it means little towards the end game, but I disagree, seeing that one of our most useful spells, Pact of Hate, could be compared to a DoT. <br />
<br />
IMO if I had a chance to redo my SHD, who is Human btw, I'd most likely play Iksar, for the regen and the natural AC. Ogres are always going to be the best SHD tanks in the game, with trolls and iksars comming up next. Hu are sort of the middle road, a little bit of everything, while the smaller SHD races will consist of that 50/50 you were looking for. One thing to consider however, is that late game a SHD tanks more than anything, and the smaller SHD suffer greatly by not having those nice abilities the Trolls/Ogres/Iksar do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>gebbly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Thanks for the constructive input (most of you).<br />
<br />
I was leaning towards either a troll (for regen) or gnome (for INT, tinkering and faction) really and I have to say I just liked the idea of playing a little gnome sk.<br />
<br />
[I had discounted iksar as I like to play a different race each time I create a  new character and plan on starting up an iksar monk at some point]<br />
<br />
Thanks to the reassurances here I have gone ahead and am quite happy with my little gnome. And no antihero she is neither an ebay-buy nor is she a twink. I never twink characters, whats the point? (but thats a whole other debate).<br />
<br />
My little gnome Shimble has started her adventures in steamfont and has already got a couple of pieces of her newbie armour at level 4. (largely due to HT saving my bacon!)<br />
<br />
So thanks for all the advice guys, a gnome it is :)</div></div><hr />

Good choice! I've played 4other races of SK over 50 and gnome is my favorite.  Love the high INT.<br />
<br />
GNOME POWA!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Gaklaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">maybe someone posted this already I didnt read all the posts  but yeah its not too hard to imagine any SK outdamaging an ogre warr, I have an ogre warrior and they sux, they are screwed royally right now so I chose the path of the sk. yes gnomes are playable by far, they have great stats, and stats arent too big of a deal its who you want. expect to get made fun of for being a gnome tho, and on my server worshippers of Bertoxx get made fun of too, so just duel them and show what the plaguebringer has to offer . =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>velin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">lv 65 gnome SK here 40 aa's and i have never been made fun of (except in a jokingly maner by friends) and i have 0 problems finding a group so dont listen to all the hear say about that stuff.  Also raid buffed i am at 7k hp with 1350 ac and thats with so so gear w/ my int at 200.  Gnomes are great if ya like the little guys but all the Sk races are a viable choice.  at the end game it doest really matter.  I have no problem tanking old world boss mobs like vindi , KT ect(up to POP ones) as a gnome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Kensha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">I just want to throw my 2cp in with other gnomers-- it's definitely playable. I didn't twink since I was returning to Xegony from having /movelogged all my characters to ABayle, but I think I've done ok on equipment in the last year through sheer get-out-and-camp-it, and I do just fine tanking. I've been the main tank in HoT (ToV), I've tanked Faydedar, I've tanked in PoV, PoS, Tactics, and BoT (except Gaukr. That proc thing of his sucks butt) and I hold up as well as anyone else... and somewhat better than people with the same scant number of AAs who went for offensive AA abilities rather than defensive ones.<br />
<br />
The obnoxious attitude that &quot;gnomes shouldn't be SKs&quot; that you see around here is pretty typical, but it is not as bad as it used to be. You grow a pretty thick skin after a while. I usually just smirk and say, &quot;Who knows what evil lurks under the beds and in the closets of men? The shadow gnome knows...&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Oompah Loompah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Personally a gnome made sense for me.  I don't have a lot of time to play EQ, so I like to login and start soloing right away.  I am not a end game player, have no desire or intention of being one. <br />
<br />
I don't want to rely on a chanter.<br />
I don't want to rely on a healer.<br />
<br />
I want an edge.  Clockwork arms give me that edge.  A nice 500pp item in the bazaar and I can boost my moderate 31% runed bolster belt to 71% self-haste.<br />
<br />
That *really* comes in handy.  Add a fungi to the mix and decent gear and I really am a self-reliant little bastard.<br />
<br />
That one item would allow me to excel past any other equal level and gear equipped SK.<br />
<br />
I realize this arguement doesn't hold true in groups where there is a shammy/chanter/bard but for my solitary little self it does come in handy.<br />

<br />
a gnome is more or less not respected for its size..an ogre how ever is aww'd at for its barbaric size that says &quot;me big, me hit hard, let me in now, or i bash joo!&quot;<br />
<br />
Now, i play an ogre, and if you people please look at the key point<br />
<br />
Ogres have around 130 stamina, 70int<br />
<br />
Gnomes have around 80 stamina, and 110int<br />
<br />
Now, i read somewhere that somebody said shadowknights are 75%mellee and 25%casting.<br />
<br />
Those standereds above ^^ go by ogres, imho. Before i left, my ogre had about 110 in int, making it possible for him to tap more, etc. <br />
<br />
A gnome how ever, will have a much easier time soloing for more mana. <br />
<br />
If anybody has ever looked at the erudite SK, look at it now, the strength and the stamina doesnt mean squat, their are buffs and armor to fix that, the greatness of its INT is what makes it superior at quad-fear kiting<br />
<br />
Gnomes will be able to do the same near... <br />
<br />
How ever, IMHO (and i stress IMHO), the Ogre SK is the Best tank their is for groups.<br />
<br />
Its my 2cents, dont like it, deal with it, my opinion, not yours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Yinaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Overall the only reason I didn't even consider gnomes is their size, Its just odd for me to be so short :P<br />
<br />
I've met some pretty good gnome SKs, you would be pretty on par with a dark elf excluding the ability to wear medium armor, but then again people dont have to shrink you on raids :)<br />
<br />
If you are so inclined to play one, I'd say Gnome fairs as well as DE. In terms of people liking you...... its almost as bad as the halfling ranger jokes<br />
<br />
I find it fun when a little DE girl (me :D ) is outtanking some large ogre in my group, just imagine if I was a gnome, then theyd be like *gasp*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Floppy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Gnome haters are every bit as annoying as the most sk8r-gnomish gnome SK that ever existed. They distract us from the real enemy, which is rangers and druids :)<br />
<br />
DEs, gnomes, ... they both taste good with tartar sauce, as far as I'm concerned. Ogre &gt; all :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>kbern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">The 75% tank and 25% caster is all in how you play.  <br />
<br />
MA for groups, more than likely.<br />
<br />
But if you are someone (as some of the posters are) who has limited time and wants something that can solo well, then a higher int sk is prob better for the amount of fear kiting and such you will be doing.<br />
<br />
All in how you play and what you like, cant be said enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Ileach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Race dont matter much, gear can compensate all starting stat differences that matter.<br />
<br />
As stated above the only thing that is a real differance is size and abilities (no front stun and regen).<br />
<br />
Being big has its drawbacks as do beeing small, gnome size makes you haveing to jump to get over obstacles all other classes just run over.<br />
<br />
Play what you think you would have the most fun with.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Feeyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Ok, as stated somewhere before.. ive forgetten where exactly, Its not strictly level or race based but gear based that governs damage amounts... I have a lvl 7 Gnome SK and i have a Strength of 95 and a stamina of 109 w/ an INT of 108 and i can hit for 25+ dmg...so at level 7 if you can have those scores WITH A GNOME, mind you than by all means, play the gnome!! lol its no biggie if your a tiny little gnome or a big stanky ogre. (no offense to any ogre enthusiasts :p )<br />
<br />
So, PLAY THE GNOME!!!! <br />
