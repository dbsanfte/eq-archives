<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I had previously passed PoJ trials on my SK and my Shaman.  Really was no problem any other time.  Our guild did alot of trials, very boring.  We have alot of multiboxers in the guild, and one thing we did not allow, was people to multibox through the trials.  We had it in our minds that this would not work, period.<br />
<br />
Well, things change.  I started 3 boxing and had a cleric up to 59.  Friend had a chanter up to 55.  Then I started 4 boxing to try and get chanter leveled too.  Well, we decide that we want to do the exe trial in PoJ with our twinks.   What the heck, we were killing 4-5 mobs at once in other places, that hit harder, and more HPs, how hard could it be?<br />
<br />
1 Person - 4 computers, boxing 65 SK, 65 Shaman, 59 Cleric, 55 Chanter.<br />
1 Person - 2 computers, boxing 65 Necro, 65 Druid.<br />
<br />
SK, Necro, and Druid have about 80 AAs each, Shaman has 50.<br />
<br />
Mission:  Complete PoJ Trial of Execution<br />
<br />
Outside buffs, etc.:  KEI, and Mage muzzles, belts, and ixi fists for pets.<br />
<br />
We buff up and start the trials.<br />
<br />
Round 1:  <br />
<br />
No mobs to banish, all 4 were razorfiend type mobs.  SK pet wants to go off and solo, and dies.  Realize on shaman, forgot to remem rain spells, to do dmg during Trial, because had to rebuff a pet right before went into trials.  Oops.<br />
<br />
So we lost the SK pet.  Shaman has no spells up to do dmg.  Chanter is worthless, and sitting in corner, because I cant run 4 chars at once worth a damn.<br />
<br />
We finished round 1 just fine.  One mob got kinda close.<br />
<br />
Round 2:  <br />
<br />
One mob to banish.  Banished it, but didnt really need to.  Shaman and Cleric are splitting healing basically.<br />
<br />
Round 3:<br />
<br />
Nothing to banish.  Mobs seem to die even faster.  Kinda getting hang of it.<br />
<br />
Round 4:<br />
<br />
A few mobs to banish.  Banished one, because we could.  Killed the rest pretty easy.<br />
<br />
Prime Executioner spawns.  Hmm, look at clerics mana.  78% Mana.  Look at shaman Mana at 85%.   SK - very low on mana, nuked most of rest down in 4th round.<br />
<br />
We immediately engaged PE right away (no kiting).  Slowed easily.  Died pretty quick.  When all was said and done, only person below 50m was the SK.  We passed first try, hardly was even close.<br />
<br />
4 boxing PoJ Trials is possible.<br />
<br />
Sent message to 65 SK in guild, who 4 boxes a 65 Ench, SHM, CLR and SK regularly.  Told him trials are possible to 4 box.  That evening, he successfully adds 2 people, and 4 boxes the PoJ trials too.   All 4 of his chars have about 200 AAs each.<br />
<br />
So it wasnt a fluke, and it was actually pretty fun.  Of all the PoJ trials I did previously to flag people, that last one had to be the funnest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Makkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">that is pretty funny, they were a real bitch back in the day. i almost quit from having so many failed attempts early on (mostly pickup groups with the nec). almost invariably due to cleric getting aggro<br />
<br />
now it's just another encounter you have to be mildly awake for. i remember thinking the mobs hit wayyy too hard..now it's barely half what a regular xp mob hits for heh<br />
<br />
SoE's idea of a &quot;fun challenge&quot; hasn't changed much.<br />
<br />
Make mobs hit really hard<br />
Give mobs a ton of hp<br />
For boss mobs add some kind of super annoying AoE</div></div><hr />
