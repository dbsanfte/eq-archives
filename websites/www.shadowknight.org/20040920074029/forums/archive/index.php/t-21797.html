LARPing is pretty nerdy in my book.  And I do tabletop.  (Dreadlands, AD&amp;D 3rd Ed, hopefully soon some Shadowrun if we can find some other players in this new god-forsaken town.)</div></div><hr />

this one time, i was out in jagged pine pissing on a tree. it turns out it was a druid roleplaying a tree, and he ran around taunting me about golden showers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>BullMarkOne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Hey.. I larp, or rather used to larp before the whole evercrack addiction thing, still larping isnt bad... as long as its live combat I mean..  cuz lets face it, Larping is all about running around the woods in august wearing chainmail and black leather and beating people with pipe..</div></div><hr />

<br />
I thought that was what dating was all about</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>BullMarkOne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Yeah, that too!<br />
<br />
In fact in my case dating requires even more imagination than roleplaying of any sort. At least when I'm 'roleplaying' there's other people involved.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Apokx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Table-top gaming is awesome with the right people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Darkenesis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Apokx is correct.<br />
<br />
I've played D&amp;D with some random people I never met at the game shop once.  My dear fucking god.  Absolutely no way I'll ever game with geeks.<br />
<br />
Everything else has been with friends since high school.  Just by looking at us, no one would ever tell we tabletop'd.  RP'ing is a LOT cooler with cool people  (who would have guessed?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Xanon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Heh, LARPing ain`t that bad.  Hell, I larp, but I don`t go as far as to dress for the occasion, but the materials (weapons) are very present.  My friends and I usually use bokkens (solid-wood katanas), shinais (also called a kendo stick), and the occasional oak western-style sword.  It`s not a good session if you don`t come out of it with a few bruises :D   But yeah... that whole 300LBS guy shouting &quot;LIGHTNING BOLT!!&quot; and throwing sticks at the dude is pretty lame... that`s Geek-LARPing :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Zero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">You use LARP for an excuse when you and your friends get together and beat each other with weapons?<br />
<br />
I just blame it on the crack  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Im noticing a trend with &quot;LARP aint that bad&quot; following &quot;I do it&quot; heh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Androsulach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Well, as far as LARP with weapons go, the SCA is what you really want to belong to for that kind of thing.  Most of the LARP I end up seeing is at the local SciFi convention and they end up being pick-up groups of total geeks.  Paranoia as a tabletop RPG is one thing, Paranoia as a LARP has possibilities if done right, but mostly I've seen it done very poorly.  The same for Star Wars and Vampire.  The LARP just doesn't cut it compared to the standard version of the RPG.<br />
<br />
Granted, I've never actually been to any SCA functions, but the GM I last played D&amp;D with was in the SCA, so I am familiar with it.  You can get as immersed into it as you like or you can just go to fighter practice to play with the weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Rackasaur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Vampire LARP = hot chicks dressed in tight leather , nothing wrong with that in my books ...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Darkenesis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Fuck LARPing.  Boff.<br />
<br />
You get styrofoam or carpet padding, wrap it around the &quot;blade&quot; of the weapon (PVC or wood), duct tape it from top to bottom so none of the padding shows, then just go beat the fuck out of each other.<br />
<br />
Boffing is fun.  And doesn't require a plot or story behind it, just get a weapon, and start beating.</div></div><hr />
