<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darkhan</div><div class="date">11-29-2004, 03:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, let me preface this post by stating that this is my first 60+ toon. Lately I have been growing very frustrated when xping with my 63 SK. I have read many posts about where to hunt on this and other websites. My problem is that it seems as if everywhere I go to hunt all I ever gain is .30% per kill (grouped). Less than 1% for 3 Kills SUCKS. I have tried HOH, BOT, POV (WW camp). All .30%. I did a normal ldon last night (lvl 57-63) and my regular xp would not move ANY % most kills so I had to switch to AA. I have tried being the highest toon in a group and I have tried being the lowest, but it always seems to be .30% When assessing my xp, I have none going toward aa. Is this lousy xp just part of being post 60? Am I doing something wrong? Any tips on better places to camp? Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wyrdlan</div><div class="date">11-29-2004, 03:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's life.  It gets worse.  Much much worse.<br />
<br />
Basically, the only way to get reasonably fast exp is to kill the biggest stuff you can the fastest you can, with the priority being on fastest. EQ has simply gotten to the point where anyone with a fraction of a brain can level through the lower levels at speeds unheard of when EQ began.  You are simply hitting the wall that comes from having gear you never could have gotten before, and are essentially new to the game at level 60.  Level 35 used to be a &quot;hell level&quot; that took some people weeks to get through, grinding a few hours a night.  Now you can get to level 60 in a couple nights of days of intense play.<br />
<br />
Best advice is to readjust your perspective.  At 67 in a fairly fun group I don't think it's entirely unreasonable to get 5 to 10% in an hour.  I group with my original main, an enchanter.  In the time it took me to get from 66 to 67, he went from 61 to 64.<br />
<br />
More practical advice is to group in the dps slot of the highest level group that will take you.  BoT isn't terrible exp at that level, and 2 to 3 kills per % sounds about right to me, you just need to be in a group that's killing fast enough to make it worth it.  I mean, if you could bribe some high level friends into taking you into a high level dungeon, like parts of RCoD or PG, you'd get stellar exp, but they'd just have you with your gimpy dps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When you are in a zone and killing things that have been blue to you for a few levels, it is a waste of time compared to higher level kills usually. This is why you are not still at the PoI zonein...<br />
<br />
I have to imagine that getting a solid group going at L63 is not the /ooc lovefest it once was. Take your charity/tagalong invites to WoS or whatever without question...but also try to make sure you know the few other people 61-64 that play at your times, and grind it out with them. Zones like HoH or BoT vary greatly in exp from camp to camp also...fast and easy kills in BoT West are not the same as the basically DR spell immune kills in South, from the SK perspective...</div></div><hr />

I am in a pretty solid guild, so finding hunting partners is not usually a problem. Our problem is experience since most of my guild is mid to high 50's and trickling into our 60's now. I will grab some friends and give WOS a try. Appreciate the tip.</div></div><hr />

The only way you're going to &quot;succeed&quot; in WoS is as the DPS/puller slot in a group that's stronger than you.  <br />
<br />
BoT is just dandy at your level, and 3kills/% is hardly aweful; it only gets worse from there.  You'd do better off just taking a group in tier3 PoP than worrying about trying to find yourway into a WoS group.</div></div><hr />

It's only going to get worse. &quot;Had to&quot; switch to AAxp? Well duh, if you keep switching to AAxp because you are not satisfied with the rate your normal exp bar is moving, here's some news for you: you won't level. The amount of exp you get from a mob doesn't magically change because you switch to AAxp, AA's just take that much less exp to move. I say this because you apparently have not comprehended this basic fact.<br />
<br />
Now, I'm not really mean and stuff. To add something more constructive, I'd advice you stay in BoT (just grind, stay focused, it'll end) and other such places until you're 65+ at the very least - most likely you need some AA's also - and then try WoS and RCoD (maybe not necessarily as main tank, puller would for example work).<br />
<br />
Possible other places? Dranik's Hollows, Sewer trials in GoD, Griegs End (still a hotspot, easy blues, just slaughter). PoV should still not be too bad also, and if most of your guild is just hitting 60's also this might be a good place for you to make a guild group.<br />
<br />
General advice: Levels suck post-60 yes, this is normal. But just grind through them and then you can do the fun stuff (AA's). If your guild is not fast in leveling, just level to 65 and do AA's while they catch up?</div></div><hr />

Never said it was too tough, simply that it sux and is it normal at my level. Notice my original post was in the form of a question. You yourself agree it sux.<br />

Notice I said my regular xp bar would not move at all most kills. The ldon was a short term project and I wanted to gain some progress out of it. Reading carefully is a drag sometimes I suppose.<br />

Wow, a shread of something useful! I hope you dont subject friends and co-workers to your razor sharp insight :) before you offer to share anything relevant. I simply asked about xp post 60, and you needed to give yourself a boost. Well good for you. Hope you feel good now, you flamed someone asking for help about a VIDEO GAME...idiot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That doesn't change a thing.  You're still an idiot.  If you want to level, you don't turn on AAXP because regular XP isn't moving fast enough for you.  Moving slow &gt; not moving.<br />
<br />
Well good for you. Hope you feel good now, you flamed someone asking for help about a VIDEO GAME...idiot. <br />

That hardly qualified as a flame, though it wouldn't have been unwarranted.</div></div><hr />

Dinged 65 in BoT Courtyard doing the wasp thingies. GoD wasn't out yet and I'd burned out on LDON during the grinds for Tak BP (and everyone else's Tak BP) and I was in no way equipped to do Hards.  If you want to see your exp bar move like it did in the 50s it's not going to happen right now without access to higher zones. Suck it up and grind it out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nolarr</div><div class="date">12-08-2004, 03:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm Nolarr of Maelin Starpyre, currently level 64 ogre sk with the most horrid exp penalty possible.  To get by level 63, I did chain pulling in BoT most of the time.  Although you may get 1% every 3 kills, the kills come way faster than in Valor.. the grind should not be that bad. <br />
<br />
Short of leeching off high level people in MPG or whatnot, the best way to get exp while making a significant contribution in a group is in WoS.  And if you can hit 6500 Hp and 1350 AC, you can tank with 0 AAs.  And if you can tank, just grab yourself a cleric and slower and you're good to go.  People might call me insane, but I have done it no problem.  But stay either on East Wall or West Wall.  <br />
<br />
The exp is considerably better than BoT, at somewhere around 50% regular exp per kill for me.    Here's how to tank WoS, which is the best way you can get exp IMO, with 0 AAs.  You gotta have SoW, or Spirit of eagle or something like that.  When you pull, pull with Clinging darkness.  This does negligible damage so you don't get summoned.  But if it hits, it snares the mob slightly, so it can still get back to the group in a reasonable amount of time.  After the first cast of CD, cast it again.  With 2 casts, you now proceed to run in a circle and kite the mob until it is slowed.  With this technique, you will never have to fight a mob unslowed.  A slower will be able to malo/tash, and land slow without aggro ever going off you.  If you feel the need, cast a third clinging darkness in case of lots of resists of slow.  I'm not sure how many people are aware of this technique, but it works extremely well and has enabled me to out-tank warriors and make slowers very happy when they don't get beat on after their slow lands.  <br />
<br />
Go and experiment in WoS and you'll be surprised how fast you can rack up exp here, while dispelling the notion that newb SKs like us can't tank.  Also from what I'm able to gather, you will eventually need to stop and collect AAs.. because trying to level up to 70 in WoS will take ridiculously long, and you will need the defensives/HP AAs to get to MPG.  Good thing though, the AAs come fast.  Hope this helped.</div></div><hr />

The penalties were removed.  Even if the racial ones are still in, you're not the worst.</div></div><hr />

It is much appreciated. I enjoy EQ on a casual basis and love my sk. Info I have found on this site has helped a great deal. I do find it odd to come under fire for inquiring about the nuances of a video game, but I just have to laugh and consider the sources. And to all the born 65, L33T, couch potato, keyboard jocks who I may have offended with my rather simplistic questions, my apologies...err, wait, how bout they kiss my ass instead? Punks. :)<br />
Cheers and thanks again for the insight!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SweetMeef</div><div class="date">12-12-2004, 11:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I loved BoT bees for xp - they die faster and in a normal group at your level you won't be sitting around waiting for spawns. Some people hate bees because they don't get that uber ring of torden they've been hoping for (they want loot not xp) or because they're lazy and don't like to move as a group but rather have a puller and /assist their heart out. I'd stick to Bees as much as I could.<br />
<br />
I will say this though. I used to wonder why higher-end players always turned down BoT groups. Then I got Plane of Earth flagged and saw why. If you can somehow tag along on as many flagging raids as possible, it'll be worth it down the road. PoE xp is sickening compared to BoT, and PoFire xp is sickeningly easy compared to anywhere. Tables may get boring, but the xp doesn't. I did ldons when &quot;the grind&quot; got mind-numbingly boring for the charm upgrades and gear/augs; so look there when you need something different, just don't expect a ton of xp.<br />
Have fun - it is a game after all...</div></div><hr />

By myself I can do 5 fights in a row before i need to rest...and when I play with 63 druid friend we never stop and her DS' and nukes keeps us killing just as fast with no down time....also in like 2 hours you can get 2k in gem/cash drops....I know this may be chump change for many but usually when soloing you dun get squat.<br />

<br />
Was 20% for hybrid + racial as you listed 20 for iks and troll, so in total halved but racial wasnt lowered. or raised in the case of the assling bonus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maniacles</div><div class="date">01-26-2005, 06:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, it was 40% for hybrid.  the 20% penalty was for monks.<br />
Class bonus/penalties used to be:<br />
<br />
Warrior/rogue 10% less xp per level<br />
Healers 0<br />
Int casters 10% more xp per level<br />
monks 20% more xp per level<br />
hybrids 40% more xp per level<br />
<br />
Racial penalties<br />
humans 5% less per level ...well, was was SUPPOSED to be humans, but they fucked up and gave the bonus to halflings instead.<br />
<br />
Barbarians 5% more per level<br />
Ogres 15% more per level<br />
Trolls/iksar 20% more per level<br />
<br />
Whats worse, those penalties were MULTIPLIED by each other, so troll and iksar sks had to make not just 60% more xp than everyone else, but 68% more xp than everyone else.<br />
<br />
Then came the xp change.<br />
<br />
CLASS penalties were removed, however the rogue and warrior class bonuses were left in...because rogues and warriors were little bitches.<br />
<br />
RACIAL penalties were left in.  It is unknown and untested whether they removed the halfling bonus, or whether they gave that bonus back to the humans, where it belongs...(god being human sux0rs!).<br />
<br />
<br />
These days, we get the backhanded xp penalty of having to buy both melee AND caster aas to match the same power upgrade that a melee can gain with pure melee aas and a caster can gain via pure casting aas.</div></div><hr />
