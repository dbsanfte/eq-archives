Edit: New comic is up, here is the link to the Troy Comic...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Excessium</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The movie was alright, but didn't live up to my expectations. Brad Pitt's acting style did not fit the movie at all. Also, the &quot;battle blood&quot; that was spraying everytime there was a camera angle change was pretty excessive and seemed to come from no where. <br />
That comic strip was funny though. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>cmdrbean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I actually enjoyed what Brad Pitt did with the character of Achilles.<br />
<br />
&lt;i&gt;&quot;Perhaps YOU should fight him. -- A king that fights his own wars, wouldn't that would be a sight...&quot;&lt;/i&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fycellia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I was expecting a bad ass fight when Brad Pitt/Achilles first steps onto the scene in the beginning of the movie. That big dude walked out and I actually thought in my own head:<br />
<br />
&quot;Awwww, shit. Its on now!&quot;<br />
<br />
That guy was a big dude. Instead of a big bad ass fight, what happens? Brad Pitt/Achilles leap frogs over the big dudes head like a nancy boy and stabs him in the neck/shoulder with his sword. Somehow while performing this leap frog maneuver Brad Pitt/Achilles is able to stick his sword up to the hilt in the big dude, and pull it out before he lands. The big dude falls over dead. Now I'm thinking:<br />
<br />
&quot;What the shit was that!?&quot;<br />
<br />
That was one sharp ass sword to go through the guys shoulder/neck bones and pierce the guys heart. How would they get a sword that sharp back 37,000 years ago? Weren't they just figuring out how to wipe their asses after having a movement? And this Brad Pitt/Achilles guy has one of Ron Popeil's new inventions or something.<br />
<br />
Another thing, did Orlando Bloom really want to be seen in another movie running around like a nancy with a bow and arrow cause he's too much of a nancy to get in the thick shit and mix it up, boards and swords style? Talk about a bad career move. And another thing about Bloom's character, I would have put my foot down and said hell no to having my characters name be Paris. I mean come on Paris Hilton is famous and all but shit. At least they could have changed one of the female character's names to Paris. Would have been nice if they had kept the original, historical name for the character Orlando Bloom played: Nicole Richie.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>cmdrbean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">As for Achilles' bad ass stunts... he IS supposed to be superhuman. Did you see those spear throws? Jesus. ;P<br />
<br />
Edit: It wasn't 37,000 years ago either... it was a little over 3,000, and I do believe Paris is the correct name historically speaking. Show me something that says otherwise and I'll withdraw that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dobbin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">it was written aproximately 800 BC about shit that happened in 1200BC i think.  paris is one of the charicter names from the iliad, but i dont know if that nancy ranger was actually playing the part or perhaps the director threw some b.s. in just to please the literary nazi's (still havent seen the movie).  Achilleus not only was supposed to be the most kick ass fighter that greece ever crapped out, but he was also invincible.  basicly the gods told him when his number was up (about 2 years after the death of hector) but that he wouldent die till then, on top of that his armor was forged by the gods (dont remember which god it was).<br />
<br />
i'm also working off the assumption that they left out the charicter patroklos, or they dumbed down the homosexuality.  Achilleus was a big time queer, which lead to his hatred for hector who happened to mestakenly kill patroklos who was wearing Achilleus's armor at the time due to Achilleus wanting to sit out the war.  he was so fucken pissed in fact that he ran around the city of troy 4 times (the diameter of troy was about 3 miles, dont remember where i read that from though) after having beatin back the trojan lines to the city gates.  after Achilleus lapped the city 3 times, hector came out only to find Achilleus so pissed about his slain fellow butt pirate that hector ran from Achilleus an aditional lap around the city walls, at which point hector summoned up some balls only to have them squashed by Achilleus who promptly beat his ass.  Dunno if that was in the movie or not, but the original story is always much better than anything holywood could produce, provided one can look beond all the man love.               <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>cmdrbean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">In a general sense the movie is historically accurate, though of course a few large things are changed.<br />
<br />
For instance, Achilles is not homo, Patroklos is Achilles' cousin in the movie, and the seige only lasted something like a week as opposed to the many years which it actually was. A few other minor things are different or simply not mentioned, but those are the big ones IMO.<br />
<br />
Of course, I'm not exactly well read when it comes to the Illiad, so I'm working off a basic memory of the events.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Azudno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">They entirely left out the Pantheon in the movie. Talk about a missed oportunity and complete dumbing down of the story.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>cmdrbean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I think that to be honest it would have taken more time than the average idiot would devote to include all the politics of the pantheon in an already 2.5 hour movie. Granted, I would've watched it if they made it twice as long (perhaps in two sittings), but most would not.<br />
<br />
In other words, I agree with you... but I see why they did what they did.<br />
<br />
I do find it interesting that they took the route of making the &quot;religious leaders&quot; look so silly, and basically shit talked religion the whole time. ;P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dolaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I heard somewhere I think History channel that the seige of Troy lasted 10 years.  On the show they also found the ruins of the actual city it is located in modern day Turkey.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't recall the reportedly exact number offhand, but I know it's supposed to be at least 9 years and I think somewhere up to 15. Could be 10, but somewhere in that range for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Arikash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Didn't Achilies die sometime during the war when they were attacking troy, when he was born, someone dipped him in the rivver Styx, and made him invincible, except his heel which wasn't dipped.  The guy's name was actually Paris, and he shot Achilies in the heel, thus Achilies's heel, and killed him.  Later, the lords were deciding who got his armor, made by the gods, and Ajax didn't get it, and thought it was politics, went on a rampage, and killed a bunch of livestock, because he thought they were the other lords.  <br />
<br />
I kept score on the Achilies Hector fight, 2 points for a sword hit with blood, or good hit, 1 hit for a punch/kick.<br />
<br />
The score was 9-1 Achilies, only becuase Hector scratched Achilies's armor, just barely....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>cmdrbean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">His mother dipped him by his ankle into the River Styx, and yes he died late in the war by Paris' arrow through his heel. That was actually done exactly as such in the movie, which is why Paris ended up looking a bit like Legolas at the end. ;P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Nulladar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">In the story Achilles gets shot in the ankle while riding on a chariot away from troy at the end of a battle. In the movie he is shot through the ankle deep inside the walls of troy after they get in from using the horse. I thought it was gay that they made Achilles look more mortal in the movie than he should have been. when he died they made it look like the 3 arrows he took in the chest was what killed him rather than the first one in the foot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Dobbin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">i dont remember what happened to the armor however there were two sets floating around, one that was worn by patroklos (and later by hector who looted it off of patroklos' corpse) who had stolen the original suit from achilleus in order to inspire the greek troops (i always liked how patroklos died, the gods really had a sick sense of humor), and the second set which was a replacement for the original, achilleus wore this set when he killed hector.<br />
<br />
The part about the river is correct, i had forgotten about that...  I'm thinkin its time to dust off my copy of the iliad and reread it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Benucifer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I am not really checking my spelling on names so, and I have left out a massive amount of content. <br />
<br />
Not everything listed here is direct from Homers poem btw.  There is such a body of sub myths surrounding all this its just amazing.....<br />
<br />
Pellius (Achillies father) invites all the gods to his wedding, except for the Goddess of strife.<br />
<br />
She is miffed and rolls a golden apple down the aisle, engraved with &quot;For the fairest&quot;.<br />
<br />
Hera, Aphrodite and Athena all think its for them.<br />
<br />
They ask Zeus to judge who should get it...<br />
<br />
He (wisely) decides to ask the most handsome man in the world to judge.<br />
<br />
Paris who is a Shepard (his father sent him to the hills as he was foretold to cause the downfall of Troy), has a dream which the 3 gods appear.  But being a mere mortal he can't decided, Zues decides each Goddess must offer him something whichever he picks is the winner...<br />
<br />
He goes for the goddes of love, who promised him the most beautiful woman in the world.<br />
<br />
Paris returns to Troy, and sets sail to capture Helen, believing his voyage will be blessed by the goddess of love.  It is and he returns with Helen.<br />
<br />
Helen's husband is outraged, and calls upon all the kings of greece to avenge this, according to their oaths (all the kings took an oath that when Helen choose her husband they would all attack anyone that took her, hence keeping peace).<br />
<br />
The Greeks, after taking the small trojan towns etc arrive at Troy...<br />
<br />
At this point Achillies, whose mother dipped him in the river styx (there are a few variations) made him immune to all attacks (except for his heel) is the major warrior.  But Agammenon is the overall leader, and remains so bar for a brief period.<br />
<br />
The temple of Apollo resides halfway between both armies, and is the major source of fresh water.  Both sides consider it neutral ground (this is important for later).<br />
<br />
As the war develops...<br />
<br />
Patrocklies is killed by Hector, who thinks he is Achillies.<br />
<br />
Achillies then kills Hector, for slaying is lover.<br />
<br />
Achillies kills the Amazon champion (who is fighting for the Trojens to atone for killing her sister), after he kills her and removes her helmet.  He falls in love with her, and kills one of his men who makes some remark about loving a dead body (he slays him with a single punch)...<br />
<br />
Achillies sees Polyxana (daughter of the Trojan king) at the Temple of Apollo and falls in love with her.<br />
<br />
He offers to leave the battle if the King of troy will give her to him.  This does not work out.<br />
<br />
Trolius steps up to the plate (another son of the King) and starts kicking ass left right and center.<br />
<br />
Achillies meets Trolius in battle and has the advantage over him.  Achillies is struck by his beauty and offers him a choice submit to him or die.  Trolius chooses submission.<br />
<br />
Trolius awaits Achillies in the Temple of apollo, Achillies takes him and kills him in a frenzy of man love.<br />
<br />
While this is happening, the gods are jumping here and there helping and hindering (I believe the two gods who lost the golden apple help the greeks alot).<br />
<br />
anyways...<br />
<br />
Apollo is outraged, and sends a dream to polyxana.  She lures Achillies to the temple, to organize an ambush (she wants revenge for her brothers death).  Paris shoots a poison arrow at Achillies.  Apollo guides the arrow to his heel he dies.<br />
<br />
Atlas and Ulyssis, both compete for Achillies armour (through speeches) I believe handcrafted by the God of Smiths Atlas loses and goes mad with grief killing himself (after killing a herd or two of cattle).<br />
<br />
Finally, the greek leaders recieve a dream telling them to get Achillies son Neptsomething to the war as he will end it.<br />
<br />
Eventually, the trojan king decides to get rid of his two guard captians.  They strike a deal with the greeks and open the gates in the middle of the night.<br />
<br />
Everyone (troy) dies, helen is taken back.  Polyxana has her throat cut onto of Achillies monument/grave.<br />
<br />
The end....<br />
<br />
Nerd facts.<br />
<br />
The ancient city of Troy has been located, but something like 10 cities have existed, each being built ontop of each other.  It is believed that Troy 7 or 7a are the most likely candidates for being the famous Troy.  Nobody knows how long the battle went for.<br />
<br />
Alexander the Great is supposedly Achillies great great grandson....<br />
<br />
The Movie.<br />
<br />
I strongly appreciate the way the makers of this film approached it. Sadly, I felt it was a big letdown.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>DConquest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Biggest letdown imo was the dialouge.  Tons of cheesy lines and speeches, nothing that really moved you or seemed thought out.  Best line in the whole movie imo was in the beginning when the little kid goes, fetches Achilles from his tent, and tells him he'd be afraid to take on that big guy.  Achilles reply was good. <br />
<br />
The action scenes and overall flow of the movie are great imo.  I also liked the fact it was told as if it was the real life event, and not the written story.  It would of been too much I think.  <br />
<br />
Brad Pitt did a good job overall as a &quot; real life &quot; Achilles.  If it was based more on the writings, then he wouldn't fit the part at all.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Mehatesu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">According to the Illiad the siege of Troy lasted ten years..So they kind of had to cut the movie short..The reason that Achilles was inviscible was that his mother dipped him into the river styx as a baby and held him by his ankle, hence his only weak spot was his Achilles Tendon.. As for the movie, I have to say that I enjoyed it.  The scene of Brad Pit standing outside Troy calling Hector out was intense.  Someone post about how the blades were to sharp.. At that time the blades were bronze, and incredibly sharp and easy to sharpen, couple that with the fact that he used weapons blessed by the gods and you have one bad mo fo.. Now Ajax was another story..He too is a legendary figure in Greek mythology and a bad mother all the same..All the big heroes of Greek legend were there at Troy...All in all, I enjoyed the movie..The only thing that crossed my mind was..Where the hell are all the Siege Engines!  Back then a big greek trick was to hural Naptha Via catapaults onto city walls and over them..Naptha was Greek &quot;fire&quot; or primative napalm...</div></div><hr />
