1) does every word ned to be capitalized?<br />
2) Clit size doesn't matter (It's not just a myth anymore)<br />
3) A clit is not a dick.  Yes they share many of the same qualities.  But a penguin also shares many qualities with a pelican, still a penguin is not a pelican.<br />
4) It's simple monkey/basket logic.</div></div><hr />

Actually, the clit IS a dick....it is homologous to the male glans penis (er dick-head).  Add a little testosterone during fetal development and you get a penis, whilst no testosterone = clit.....and, in chyna's case, testosterone used to enhance muscle growth = a freakish woman penis.</div></div><hr />

<br />
homologous does not mean equal to;  therefore a clit is not a dick <br />
<br />
(much the same way that a hydrox cookie is not an oreo cookie even though they are homologous to one another)</div></div><hr />

<br />
(much the same way that a hydrox cookie is not an oreo cookie even though they are homologous to one another)<br />
<br />
Er, homologous does mean equal to....it basically means that the glans penis is of the exact same origin and structure as the clitoris, but serves a different function (actually even the functions are the same in this case as the clit and glans penis both serve as an area for stimulis).  The two types of cookies, in your example, would be more analogous then homologous....they serve the same function/purpose but are comprised of a different structure (IE - the wings of a bird as compared to the wings of a bee).  As I stated earlier, the only difference between a clitoris and a dick (head to be exact) is a little testosterone.</div></div><hr />

Fuck, now you made me dig out my old A&amp;P text &lt;sigh&gt;.  Homologous, as it's used in the medical world, is used most often to describe &quot;two organs having the same embryonic origin&quot; (the same...equal to, identical as, etc, etc).  Also, depending on the language used, homologous is used to mean exactly &quot;equal&quot;...in fact, the synonym for homologous is equal (Equivalent, tantamount; indistinguishable; quits; homologous; synonymous; resolvable into, convertible, much at one, as broad as long, neither more nor less.; much the same as, the same thing as, as good as; all one, all the same; equipollent, equiponderant, equiponderous, equibalanced; equalized; Verb: drawn; half and half; isochronal, isochronous isoperimetric, isoperimetrical; isobath, isobathic.).  This happens to be my field and I think you may wanna ask one of your professors:-)<br />

One of her secret ancient ninja moves was making her clit enlarged to the size of a huge dick and then forcing her enemy into sexual submission.<br />
<br />
Great storyline in that series....Our heroine, Miko Mido, is an 18-year-old ninja for the all-female Miroku clan. Our antagonists are the all-male Suzuka Clan. The in-between forces are the demons of the Shikima, held in check by an ancient pact with the Miroku. Unfortunately for Miko Mido, the Suzuka murder her grandmother and steal the Shikima-manipulating talisman. The Shikima then attack Miko Mido, but fail. So they target Miko’s sister, Miyu, using her to lure Miko to Hell where they hope to defeat her by screwing her until she can’t see straight.</div></div><hr />

So what do you do the drugs for?<br />
<br />
Back on topicesque:<br />
From my experience as a male whore:  Women have different sized clits, just as men have different sized penises and women have different sized vaginal openings (based both on nature and usage).  <br />
<br />
Never in my life had I seen a clit that looked like a misplaced thumb as Chyna has in the bits of video I've found on the web (go go interneat piracy).  So if you or your husband will describe your clit in vivid detail I will beleive that you do not have a Chyna-esque &quot;pubic thumb&quot;.<br />

I figured it would be disturbing, but it was just boring and gross.  The most disturbing part about it was seeing The 1-2-3 Kids cock.  Granted, I won't be forgetting that any time soon.</div></div><hr />

The guy in the porno formerly wrestled as X-Pac, but WAAAAY back before that, he was the 1-2-3 Kid. His big nemesis was... Razor Ramon if I remember correctly, but it's been awhile so I could be way off. Think it ended with a spectacular ladder match.</div></div><hr />
