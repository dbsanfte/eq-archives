<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Teejay Hookah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok I just thought I'd post my tid bit here. I camped DS's room in HS for about 22hrs total over a span of 1 week (yes of course she dropped an urn for me) :cool: <br />
<br />
But anyways I finally got sick of it and read all the posts about and everyone seemed to be getting their drops from the ZO room, or where you first enter HS from the ZI so I decided to change the camp spot to ZO room.<br />
<br />
I got my corroded bracer in 5hrs so I hope no one wastes their time in DS's room like I did. I also noticed more diamonds and armor loots coming from the golems in the ZO room so maybe it could be a slightly different loot table in there I have no idea. Also the golems in DS's room can also spawn the named golems Mortiferous Protectors that drop the ES boots so that may be why the loot tables are screwed up assuming they are.<br />
<br />
I ran around with DA and FD'd alot to get my master key but you can also Shadowstep through the door in DS's room just takes a few tries upto you really.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps you all and saves you a lot of time this camp sucks either way!!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I spent a day doing the master key and was able to do the whole thing solo without any deaths and in one day.  Lucky me, I didn't have to wait TOO long to get the intermediate keys to drop.  While doing that, I cleared a LOT of named, and got some nice drops.<br />
<br />
From about 6 to 8 hours soloing in howling stones:<br />
<br />
Hand of Glory (master key)<br />
Necklace of Superiority<br />
Bloodpoint<br />
Guardian Mace<br />
Adamantite Club x2 (gave one to pet since they're LORE)<br />
Elder Spiritist's Boots<br />
Fingerbone Hoop<br />
Helot Skull Helm<br />
Stein of Tears<br />
Sash of the Dragonborn<br />
Siren's Scale Robe<br />
Enshrouded Veil<br />
Tarnished Gold Plate Vambraces<br />
Kylong Gauntlets x4<br />
Kylong Boots<br />
Kylong Vambraces x2<br />
Kylong Greaves<br />
Dusty Rusted Vambraces<br />
Rotbone Bracer<br />
Rotbone Sleeves<br />
<br />
And some NODROP quest junk for (presumably) unsolved quests.<br />
<br />
Now if I could just get the dang bracer to drop, I'd be happy *grin*.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Teejay Hookah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">yes the room with the 4 golems past DS's room which also has an extra 2 in the room with the zone out orb in it. these 6 golems seem to me to have a different loot table than the golems that spawn in DS's room itself but you'll need either the hand of glory HS key or have to do the shadowstep trick to get pasted the locked door...or you could bring a rogue too upto you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>makaky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">40 hours and 3 AA's<br />
 :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Belyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Im less then happy about having to blow my OT faction to do epic.  After all OT is an evil town and i started off not kos there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Go to VP and group for a couple grinds, not bad XP, and OT faction will be maxed again. Hell, a human cleric had max OT faction in something like 8 hours when I went there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>NighteaterDemonheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I had my bracer before i posted this query.. i got lucky went down to kill drusilla for a friends twink and it happened to drop off a golem in the room. BUT since i had master key a friend begged me to help him camp his bracer.... 5 days of camping both drusilla room thru the oz 4 aa at lvl 70 plus like 3 levels for twinks before it did indeed drop off an oz golem for my friend. Insanely rare is a very descriptive comment on this piece.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Belyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Got mine in ZO room as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Golem in the right on the zone out room today.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>SkafflocTZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well, I guess I got lucky on this one. I Zoned into Howling Stone, floated across to the east wing entrance, and the first golem past the doorway that I killed (like the 2nd mob I had to kill) dropped the bracer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Wyrdlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I also saw several off the first golem (in tunnelway between south and east) while camping for VP Essence.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bamkan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Just past Drussela's locked door there is a hallway that leads to a room with 4 golems, 2 static undead spawns, and 1 roamer undead spawn.  Past this room is the actual zone out room with 2 static golem spawns.  I got my bracer from one of the golems in the first room (the room with 4 golem spawns).  Took roughly 6 hours straight to get bracer.</div></div><hr />
