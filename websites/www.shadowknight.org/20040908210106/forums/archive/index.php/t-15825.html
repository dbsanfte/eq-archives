<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ffejdoow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was hoping to get lucky on the Hide from Hate but this is slowing getting to be another one of those horror storys I keep hearing about.  I have been to Hate now 4 times with not a single Hide drop.  Since Hate as been redone, its really not the number of trips but the number of kills that matter.  Before the respawn was turned down to 10 min.  You would average 4 to 6 mobs per raid.  Now at least, you can get almost 2 old raids worth of kills per trip.  <br />
<br />
Well the counter is now on 21 mobs and counting without a Hide.  Don't know how much more of this I can take.  At least the new Hate is fun to explore and the agro ranges is so small its funny. <br />
<br />
If anyone has an extra Hide on the Karana Server, save me from going nutts and MQ it for me!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Paradox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yep - it sucks ass.  Only thing you can do is keep trying and each time you leave Hate with no hide, do a /bugreport.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ffejdoow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thats funny you should say that.  I got the Greenmist last month and went crazy when I realized the thing was HURTING ME instead of giving me hps.  <br />
<br />
I proceeded to petition every time I logged in with a no need to respond message, and /bug reported it.  I also got 3 friends to do the same.<br />
<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jackkal Darknite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">12 Hate raids (before revamp), Guild goes up while I was gone and it finally dropped, I got it MQ'd.<br />
<br />
Soul Leech is being my bitch. been 6 trips to Fear and no SL. Guild doesnt do old school planes anymore (low priority) so how I gotta suffer thru pick-up raids :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Murgutroid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Since the revamp I've been spending a lot of time in Hate. So far I've gained a few levels and a handful of AA's hunting there exclusively. Between the Drakes I've killed and the ones my guild has killed when I'm not there, the total  Drake kill count has to be in the hundreds, and still no hide. I've seen just about every other epic piece drop at least once (including four Staffs of Elemental Mastery, among others), but not mine. I've pretty well lost hope, but my guild keeps urging me on, so I'll keep trying.<br />
<br />
Have you ever noticed the death message of an Ashenbone Drake? It says something like, &quot;This is no victory for you. Your hate grows with every kill.&quot; How true. I hate even looking at those bastards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dester</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">120+ kills, 4 hate trips before the revamp... to many to count after.<br />
<br />
Zero hides have droped... I use to have hope ... now i just curse the ashenbone drakes...  <br />
<br />
Innuurok.... how fitting in your plane we must suffer for our epic...<br />
<br />
Dester</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>SweetMeef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My guild doesnt go to hate...<br />
I'm 53 right now and want to get on some pickup raids there, but I never know of any.<br />
How do i go about finding if there's a raid going to Hate that I can tag along in???<br />
I've never been there and want to start going once a week or so on a pickup raid to at least begin the long slow grind.<br />
I know it'll take forever, but i need a starting point.<br />
<br />
Any tips on joining a Hate raid since guild doesnt go?<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Apokx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Just buy the MQ..<br />
<br />
Or if you are lucky you might know someone with a Hide rotting in their bank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grimsouled</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Will agree... been to Hate so much since revamp practically have all the spawn points memorized... nada on the Hides although a ranger buddy of mine was quite happy when I had my druid MQ the SEoC for him...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Litoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">How hard would it be to do zone in with a 65 SK, 62 cleric and 56 chanter? I need that damn hide and its hard enough to get a group up there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dester</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I did the entrance area plenty easy enough with a 52 cleric, 53 chanter and me 61 SK.  would be cake for you.<br />
<br />
Problem is the ashenbones seem to be an uncommon spawn.  you will be lucky to kill more then 3-4 an hour.<br />
<br />
zone in is completly safe now and the agro range is just tiny.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Grimsouled</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Question: Has ANYONE even seen a hide drop in hate since the revamp?<br />
<br />
I've spent somewhere close to 100 hours up there now and have not seen it drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jexdawg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Answer: Yes I have seen it drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Grotar Von Smash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">LOL Grimsouled and I were both on a hate raid last night and not a single dropped.  You would think one could peel it off their bones but NO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Vilanaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Was there Last night.  20 damn drakes and not one bloody hide *sigh* figures it's the last drop I need</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Duke Xerro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">It took me so long to get that damn hide, but I finally did, and once I got my corrupted ghoul bane, I stopped working on my epic. :confused:</div></div><hr />
