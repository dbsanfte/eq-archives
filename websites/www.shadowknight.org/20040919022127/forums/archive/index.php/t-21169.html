<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gruulgrul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So, they apparently nerfed sewers to not pop names on zone up.  (See http://www.shadowknight.org/forums/showthread.php?s=&amp;postid=266428#post266428 .)<br />
<br />
Where is now the best place to hunt for Mental Horror?<br />
<br />
The two choices seem to be Vxed and Kod Taz. <br />
<br />
Vxed Trikster / Umbiki, but I have never seen them drop SK spells at all, let alone Mental Horror.  Anyone gotten Mental Horror in Vxed?<br />
<br />
Or, Kod Taz named.  Kod Taz named seem to sometimes drop lower level spells too... I got Sylven Light from the same mob that dropped my Rune turn in.  However, they seem insanely rare there; could just be bad luck though.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts?  I finally got Miasmic Spear, and Black Shroud, but Mental Horror is eluding me!<br />
<br />
I suppose one could go *clear* sewers, but that seems bleh.  Maybe there is some really good spot or something though... deep in Plant seems to be good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Viserys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Isn't Mental Horror the spell you get from turning in the 'rune' type item that drops from certain named and not a drop itself?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gruulgrul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">No, I got Black Shroud from the (Kod Taz) rune turn in quest.<br />
<br />
I got Miasmic Spear from a yellow named Turpa in... crematory I think.<br />
<br />
I don't have Mental Horror, so I can't confirm where it drops, but other threads on this board have said it drops for certain off named flies in Lair and some named in Barundi.  (Some people say it drops anywhere that drops those two non-turn-in-quest spells, but other class boards apparently have different opinions on this, so I am not as certain.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mathas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I got my Mental Horror off a fly in sewers just within this past week.<br />
<br />
I've also seen it drop off of  Hexxt N`Vak Tkan (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=14212) in Ferubi, on the way to Smith Rondo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>signa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">hexxt dropped brells mountainous barrier for us last night, yay</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I can confirm the drop in Ferubi for Mental Horror. I don't know how often it drops, but so far for me it's been 1 out of 4 kills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>VeyRonZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i got MH from Umbiki in vxed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>kharan_zechts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I saw someone selling looting rights to mental horror in vxed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gruulgrul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Killed Hxxt, he dropped the ring and bard song.  Whoo hoo. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>ragnorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i heard from someone that the named still spawns pretty quickly after you kill a few mobs in the sewers, but i can't confirm this until i've actually tried it, which will probably be never!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Xanathol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well, until yesterday's patch...went in to farm a sewer and PHs popped in *most* of their known locations after ~20 minutes, but no nameds. Killing at least one known PH, 45 minutes later, still had nothing spawn in that location. For about 2 hours, no named. =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I got my copy of Mental Horror from the named that pops right outside the entrance to the sewers (in Barindu) while waiting for a lock out to expire. He was considerably harder than the named Fly, but still very doable.<br />
<br />
My belief is that the spells for all classes, minus the Rune turn in, are random off of any named in any of the zones that drop spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I got Miasmic Spear from a Blistered Larva in Lair this weekend, and the next named fly dropped MH (what are the odds?).<br />
<br />
The way the zones work now is very messed up, lot's of warping, pathing issues and strange repops. They need to put a lot more work into these zones to make them playable again.</div></div><hr />
