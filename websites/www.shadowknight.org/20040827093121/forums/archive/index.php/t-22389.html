STUART, Fla. -- A dramatic rescue ended tragically in Stuart, Florida, a rescue so difficult firefighters say they have never seen anything like it. <br />
<br />
It happened late Tuesday night and early Wednesday morning at the home of a 600-pound woman who was having trouble breathing. Rescuers went in not knowing how difficult it would be to get her out. 40-year-old Gail Grinds was literally stuck to her couch and had to be removed surgically at the hospital. <br />
<br />
Authorities estimate she had been on the couch anywhere from two to five years. <br />
<br />
Martin County Fire amd Rescue crews faced what seemed to be an impossible mission. Everyone going inside had to wear protective gear. The stench was so powerful they had to blast in fresh air. <br />
<br />
They tried to cut out the front door, but at four-and-a-half feet wide, it wouldn't work. They had to cut plywood since a normal stretcher wouldn't do. <br />
<br />
An ambulance was too small, so they brought in a trailer to get her out. While rescue crews came up with a back-door rescue plan, detectives secured what had become a crime scene, questioning family members about how it got so bad. <br />
<br />
Using planks, they loaded the woman on to the trailer, still attached to the couch. Removing her would be too painful, since her body is grafted to the fabric. After years of staying put, her skin has literally become one with the sofa and it must be surgically removed. <br />
<br />
Detectives are investigating whether they have a case of neglect, or if it is simply a very sad story. <br />
<br />
Grinds was taken to the Martin Memorial hospital where doctors removed her from the couch, but she died in spite of all the attempts to save her life.<br />

  Sorry to ruin your necrophilic wet dreams about me and couch cushions, but I am still alive, and kicking.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm sure you're disappointed, but I am also healthy, and not going anywhere due to lack of exercise or poor health.<br />
<br />
<br />
Get over it. I'm not a guy, I'm not fat, and I'm not offended by your stupidity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Khat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah, jaggoff!<br />
Put that in your pipe and smoke it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>vilesoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">first of all, if ur fat, and u dont move, u just get more fat, <br />
not neccessarily true.  They have to be fed somehow to get fatter, otherwise they will emrely starve themselves....so some jackass allowed this to happen...it's a neglect case at its finest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>EQ=TehDev1l! is BAD</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">hey..........................shutup</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>derakolwtf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">so she shat and urinated on this couch im guessing? someone was involved with feeding her, but she is an adult......how can you neglect an adult? she has can do what she wants. if she chooses to have her ass grafted to a sofa than i say go for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>vilesoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">whoever was feeding her should have contaced some medical staff, etc about it.  If all they did was feed her and not do anything to help her, especially if it was a family member or paid care, it could very well be neglect.<br />
<br />
I think it's about 450lbs where you can barely move on your own, and need to be wheelchair bound....I've even seen wheelchairs with shit-ports in the botttom for those who cant even get out of them.....just move over the special shorty can and go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kebsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">That lady is my hero.  I wish I was there when they finally pried her carcass of the couch.<br />
<br />
'Hey!  The remote!'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Derraj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">just think of the sores she got from sitting and then the shit and piss infecting them and sitting for 2-5 years...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">There was one a few years ago in a similar situation (though not grafted to the sofa)... in her rolls of fat, they found two universal remotes and an unopened bag of potatoe chips if I remember right.  What a wonderful place to lose stuff...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I remember something in Middle school World history class about a fat king (french or russian maybe?) who was stabbed and the blade that stabbed him just kind of sunk into his fat.  He didn't die from that if I remember right.<br />
<br />
So if you are bored IRL go find some fatties and stab them</div></div><hr />
