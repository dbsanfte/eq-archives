I have no idea if its worth it. My main is a Bst so I'm used to pulling with spells. Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taranis</div><div class="date">12-04-2002, 09:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi there... <br />
<br />
I'm currently a 54 ogah SK. Pulling.....<br />
<br />
If i am to pull with spells, i use something with a fast cast time, that also has a small agro radius... Something like Disease Cloud.<br />
However... with the new lines of spells that have been introduced i have found a bow to be faster and more efficient. Being an oger means a small mana pool... its hard enough to have enough mana for the things you want to do, let alone have to use it to pull with.<br />
<br />
Pulling with a spell<br />
- requires you to stand still<br />
- requires a cast time<br />
- nocks out your spell gems for a second or so<br />
<br />
Pulling with a bow<br />
- you can move while firing<br />
- you dont even have to hit the mob<br />
- you can cast strait after with no delay<br />
<br />
I got my very 1st bow at lvl 52... at the moment i pull for groups in PoI and PoD mostly (where i spend most of my time nowadays). The tactic i use is simple (only good if your MT aswell) and effective.. wouldnt be possible if i was casting...<br />
target mob, fire arrow, cast terror of darkness (agro increasor). <br />
Its fast cast time, and the agro generated from the arrow damage, increased by the spell hitting the mob... means that the mob can be slowed before it even hits me when i get back to camp.<br />
<br />
Personally, i prefer to use a bow due to: mana conservation; instant fire; mobility; and availabillity of the FD gem as soon as you see the mobs moving.<br />
<br />
Thats my 2cp i hope it helps.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bulvyne</div><div class="date">12-05-2002, 08:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used to carry a bow with me religiously, and arrows (or several stacks of arrows). <br />
<br />
Once I got a really decent ranged item, though, I got rid of the bow and arrows. It freed up several inventory slots, and it made it so that I didn't have to swap my great ranged item with the bow all the damned time (translation = laziness).<br />
<br />
I have used spells to pull once I stopped carrying the bow (since about level 45) and haven't looked back, and still am not the slightest bit interested in finding another bow - unless it has stats better than my ranged item, of course.<br />
<br />
I usually use Abduction of Strength to pull, and found that its range is very good, fast cast time, and it only uses 5 mana - which means I'd have to cast it about 20 times before I could see my mana bar move. ;)<br />
<br />
No worrying about getting/keeping arrows.<br />
No worrying about swapping bow in/out with my ranged item.<br />
And of course the benefit is the 'pre-emptive debuff', meaning that I have stolen the target's str before the mob is even to the group, which gives me time to cast other debuffs, as well.<br />
<br />
Some folks swear by the bow, and use theirs religiously, and I respect that. I suggest you try both ways each for a few days and see what you're more comfortable with. ;)<br />

<br />
Siphon Strength or Abduction of Strength is the way to go.<br />
<br />
Bows are ok, but if you have an idol (Goronga, Thorned, etc), it can be a bit annoying to switch your bow out.  Unless you have a great bow with stats (Nightmarewood Compound for example).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bumraz</div><div class="date">12-05-2002, 10:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally for pulling I prefer spells 99.9999% of the time.  However the Bracer of Fennin Ro from Ragefire is also a nice pull tool.  300 range firebolt, right click item =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shadwe Cniht</div><div class="date">12-05-2002, 12:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I also gave up my bow at 45. Pulling with bow was nice but making and carrying arrows all the time gets old.<br />
I'd go to a good stat bow if they gave us the AA ability of endless quiver. With a skill of 75 will never come near what a ranger does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aaoogaa Soulhunter</div><div class="date">12-05-2002, 04:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Use a bow till your skill hits 75 then use spells to pull to keep the skills up.  Eventually you will be able to pick up one of the nice bows with stats to stick in the old range slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zakton</div><div class="date">12-05-2002, 08:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bows are nice if you want to pull a mob from farther away than spells can handle.  I have a Master fletcher so I made myself a nice bow and keep some Class 5 arrows on me just for that reason.  Usually spells are better to use to pull because some mobs you want to slow their run before they get a chance to hit you.  <br />
<br />
Depends on the situation really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tarac</div><div class="date">12-09-2002, 02:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used both a bow and a idol in the range slot until I got a nightmare compound bow which fits the bill nicely for both purposes.  My suggestion would be that you do both so you are familiar with the pluses and minuses of each method and you can use them in the right situations.  One very important thing to mention - with a bow you have to be on the same level as the mob, with a spell you can be at varying heights (basically spells are much more flexible but I think you can get more distance out of the bow if you have the right arrows).  This makes a big difference in some zones so knowing how to use both is probably a good idea...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">caffino</div><div class="date">12-09-2002, 02:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally when I'm puller, I have both abduct str mem'ed and a nightmare compound bow in my range slot.   <br />
<br />
The bow is nice for range and speed.  It has been very nice for tagging when casting even a fast spell would just be too slow and you can move while you tag.  It also lets you refeign death if you need to that much quicker.<br />
<br />
<br />
Abduct str is nice for not needing LoS, only costs 5 mana, and for when you run out of arrows.  I'm lazy and I don't fletch so I rely on rangers/mages around me for most of my arrows.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But I LOVE my Nightmarewood Compound Bow..I was using that to pull with..the low delay and the fact and can shoot the mob while running backwards is great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Agoni</div><div class="date">12-09-2002, 07:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are times to pull with a bow and there are times to pull with spells.  I must admit since PooP came out my pulling with a bow has been minimal.  The reason for this is that I'm usually the puller and the MT so that by pulling with Terror of Terris and then casting again just as mob hits camp and starts getting debuffed and I'm getting healed I am able to keep agro.  This is important when fighting mobs that can bring it in a hurry.  However, a bow takes no mana, and with a decent bow/arrow combo you have a range of 300+ much farther than a spell will get you, and finally you don't  have to come to a stop to shoot a bow and are able to fire the arrow and be on your way back to camp non stop.<br />
I also swapped out a shaped shadewood compound bow / Idol of the Thorned until I upgraded to a Nightmarewood compound bow.  No more swaps for me until I am able to find a much nicer ranged item.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The advent of the Nightmare Bow has really changed this question for later levels.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Minta</div><div class="date">12-15-2002, 01:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ADVANTAGES of pulling with SPELL:<br />
* Doesn't need Line of Sight - You can turn around and be ready to run while you cast.<br />
* Works better when there is vertical difference between you and target - If you're on hilly terraine bows seem to get the 'target is too far above or below you' message.<br />
* You don't need to swap out ranged items if your bow doesn't have major stats on it.<br />
* You can't miss and aggro something on the floor above you by accident.<br />
* You don't have to worry about running out of arrows<br />
* You don't need a 'ranged attack' button<br />
<br />
DISADVANTAGES of pulling with SPELL:<br />
* You have to stand still while casting<br />
* You have a delay before you can cast again<br />
* Range on spells isn't as good as range expensive bow/arrow combos<br />
* You use up mana and might have to rest occassionally<br />
* Some mobs are highly magic resistant and spells might not cause much aggro for pulling<br />
<br />
That seems to about sum it up for me. I own a bow, but I have hardly ever used it.  I generally pull with spells, since it works most of the time. I'll generally pull with a strength tap spell or a lifetap or something that's a single shot, non-dot spell. If you pull with DoTs and have to FD, you have to wait for it to wear off before you can stand back up or you'll reaggro everything. Also if you pull with DoTs to a group with an enchanter or something, they can't mez things.<br />
<br />
However, once I was hunting with a warrior friend of mine and he had put a lot of points into fletching and had a good bow and some really good arrows. Stuff that was out of spell range for me, and nearly beyond my clip plane that I could barely see... he could hit them with a bow.  I think it's been fixed in a recent patch, but he claimed he could be so far from a target that he could kill it with archery and still be outside it's aggro range.<br />
<br />
Outdoors bows might be better, but indoors it helps to not have the bother of setting up Line of Sight for a bow. You can cast around a corner, through a wall a lot of times, etc.<br />
<br />
Like everything, it's situational.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ogan</div><div class="date">12-19-2002, 01:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its a different story here. I try and look at the group I am in and the mob I am pulling to see what my role is.<br />
<br />
if my role is puller/main tank I pull with high agro spell like Spear of Plague, run back to camp and cast a tap on mob. The mob never looks the other way. I found this to be a great way to keep agro and allow slow to be landed almost instantly with having to chase a mob around camp.<br />
<br />
If I am trying to split mobs I cast Darkness and FD wait until one of the mobs reset then get up and walk mob back to camp.<br />
<br />
If I am trying to pull a mob that sees invis and other mobs around him that don’t. I use gather shadows get just close enough in agro range to agro the mob without agroing the others and pull him back to camp.<br />
<br />
If I am pulling a mob with a big HT like the guardians in PoN or something like that I use Harmshield run up and pull them so Harmshield can eat the Harmtouch.<br />
<br />
If I am puller and there is a warrior as a Main Tank then I pull with arrows to allow warrior to get agro fast off me, and if he can't I FD mob off to him.<br />
<br />
To me there are many different functions we can use as pullers and we have many different choices, unlike other pullers, I try to use em to my advantage.  <br />

<br />
A bow shot has a lower range of help then a spell so if you shoot a bow mobs nearby are less likely to assist spells are greater area of assist but do have their advantages as stated in earlier posts.  For xp groups i use whatever when its with those i trust.  Quick mezzes slows whatever.  In a group I don't i use a bow to minimize adds untill i can be sure they are competent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaosbringer</div><div class="date">12-21-2002, 04:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I finally broke down and bought a nightmarewood bow at 62 . I'm now maxed at the skill (75) but I've developed an intrest in fletching (164) and on my way to being a GM fletcher hopefully . I like pulling via bow rather then spell just to conserve mana .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mystina</div><div class="date">12-22-2002, 04:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I allways pulled with spells, but getting a bow with good stats to put in range is on my wish list.<br />
I'd definitely use it to pull, but am not ready to sacrifice ac/hp/resists for it.<br />
<br />
The nightmarish bow thing seems to be a good range slot choice for anywone who can't loot a good no drop range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rekss</div><div class="date">12-23-2002, 07:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Plus of using a bow is it doesn't grey out your spell gems for refresh, can get feign off that much quicker when splitting etc.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zobb</div><div class="date">12-23-2002, 01:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I pull with spells exclusively. I use Terror when I am also tanking. One cast of Terror to pull, hit them with Clinging Darkness on the way in and the mob doesnt budge, even for Malo/Tash and Slow. When I am only pulling and not tank, I use abduction of strength. I got a Bracer of Fennin Ro for times I need to pull from afar, cast time is a little slow but has 300 range compared to 200 on most of our spells.<br />
<br />
Bows are nice to add a little extra dps (very little) on big mobs before the tank calls charge, but I rarely use one. Arrows are just a pain in the ass IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SuDanger68</div><div class="date">12-23-2002, 01:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">But the Stats can help a bit more than the one from &quot;wear only&quot; range items. As in your profile you have Idol of Thorned. Nice Stats but not real good either. You don't need to use the Bow to pull but many have stats on them that are quite nice ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baroc DBren</div><div class="date">12-31-2002, 01:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use a Nightmare Bow. No switching out as the stats are good on it. <br />
<br />
Pulling with a bow is excellent (as stated earlier) sue to not having to wait for a spell gem to become active. <br />
<br />
Depending on where/what you are pulling, mobs can cross over to where you are pulling from very fast. Being able to cast Death Peace quickly is great. <br />
<br />
Abduction of Strength is the other one I use.  I try and use a Bow as a rule, unless of course I am out of arrows. In that case, I use my l33t Fletching skill of 30 to make more :)<br />
