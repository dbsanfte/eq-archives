<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VilleCretur Hatebound</div><div class="date">03-27-2002, 03:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was trying to complete the quest for the soulfiend lance last nite but ran into some problems.  I have the grimy lance from cazic and I am amiable to heretic faction.  I am lvl 27 de sk and i had a 46 druid and a 60 bard to help me out (both of which are kos to the heretics). i found 'a spirit' using sense the dead.<br />
 Once we got to him, I gave him the grimy lance.<br />
He gave me the totem and the Rissodian guy spawned and headed for the cat city.  This is where things went wrong,  first he was jumped by one of the tigers.  We killed the tiger, then Rissodian started attacking the bard.  We didn't know what to do, so I disbanded from the group and they killed Rissodian (no faction hits).  He dropped the grimy lance again which is good. <br />
 However I didn't know the name of the cat in the city to kill, and I wasn't sure if the quest was messed up now anyway.  'a spirit' was no longer up, waited another hour and still no sign of it.<br />
<br />
I want to try this again so few questions:<br />
do we have to keep Rissodian alive?<br />
which cat do we need to kill in the village?<br />
is the first Rissodian the same one we need to give the totem to after we kill the cat?</div></div><hr />

Had to kill him and luckily got back the grimy lance.  <br />
If I remember correctly, dont worry about him at all, as soon as he spawns just run to the outpost, pull the cat you need and kill her.  When she dies, a ghost spawns in her place in the city, and him the No Rent Idol and you get the lance back.<br />

I'm at the twin trees to the south of the city and casting sense the dead every few mins for about an hour, no luck... anyone know?</div></div><hr />

That's the Allakhazam link to the quest. Only Problem is, I dunno if anyone's found the Lizard Ritualist who drops the Grimy Lance since the change to Cazic-Thule.</div></div><hr />

On the spawn time, I want to say 2 hours, might be even longer. I would hunt in the warrens a bit, pop out into zone, cast sense dead, if he was up, I'd run over to him and con him (long run).<br />
<br />
I've not heard of the ritualist being up since the CT change, leave it to Verant to shaft the SK's again. :(<br />

I have seen the Crusaders, Radiant, and even Taw Ew Diviner, but not the Ritualist. I think he is no longer in game, as I have not seen him inside CT either.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jackkal Darknite</div><div class="date">04-14-2002, 06:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well after seeing these post I decided to get off my lazy Troll butt and do this quest. So I grabed my dusty Grimy Lance out of my bank deposit and made my way to stonebrunt.<br />
<br />
Its been forever since I hunted the warrens so I had to go around and kill all the named in there just for old times sake :)<br />
<br />
Got to Stonebrunt then cast Sense Dead and bingo! The Spirit was up.<br />
<br />
So I run on over. By then a Wizard friend met up with me and he scoped out the town 'cause I coudnt remember which building he was in. After locating him my Wiz friend got ganked by a few wanderers and being nearly OOM he gated out.<br />
<br />
So I run down to the Spirit, run through all the gabbing talk then handed him my lance. I invised up then made my way to town.<br />
As soon as I stepped into the building that disciple aggroed me. It conned blue and all I saw outside was a lot of greens with a few lt blues. At first I thought I'd just kill her here. Then the others in the building aggroed and others nearby started in on me.<br />
<br />
I run out of town and down the hill picking up a few more on the way. Toooo many to fight so I FD. It took 3 tries before it worked.-Slowly the others started leaving starting with the greens. Eventualy there was the disciple, another blue con and a lt blue con left. The disciple started to leave. NO waay was I gonna let that one get away so I stand up &amp; started hacking. I feared the other two then killed the one I wanted with an HT.<br />
<br />
I invised back up then ran back to the building opening my inventory as soon as I went inside. I turned in the item from the spirit and recieved my soulfiend! :) By then the fear wore off the other 2 and I was getting aggroed bad. So I bail out of town again with MANY kerrans hot on my heels. Ran for a ways than I cast FD two times until it finally worked. Finally, at lvl 41 I finished the quest and soloed it and I had 192 hp left at the end :)<br />
<br />
Now to work on my piercing skill 'cause its just barely over the &quot;aweful&quot; stage. hehehehehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Emnity</div><div class="date">04-16-2002, 06:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've got one of the lances rotting in my bank from pharming the Ritualist with my shaman just prior to the change. When would be a good time to do the quest solo? I'm pretty sure all of my guildies either have really bad faction with the heretics or don't want to ruin faction with the cats.<br />
<br />
Also by the sounds of things, I could turn in the lance to get the dialog then get a guildy to gank the spirit and get the lance back, then go and kill the cat myself - and even if I fail haven't lost the lance. Is this true?<br />
<br />
Actually have a better spear now, but this one has a nice proc and seems like it would be good for healing up on greenies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frued</div><div class="date">04-16-2002, 02:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I have spent the last few days in the warrens clearing it out completely with Jaboner. Apologies to all there without anything to kill. But hey look at all the free loot ya got ;)<br />
<br />
 Fortunately for me I happen to keep a Grimy Lance. I had given several away to SK newbs in Feerrott never thinking that CT would be changed.<br />
<br />
 Tried the quest so long ago and the spirit hated me. But now that I am a key holder in Paineel and they love me I think its time to go see him again and finally get my SoulFiend Lance.<br />
<br />
 As for the ritualist. I have spent a few weeks in Feerrott getting DF pieces (Almost have a complete set again) I have seen every OLD CT spawn but the ritualist. Seems they forgot about him and the SoulFiend Lance will soon be just a myth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KaeruWak</div><div class="date">04-16-2002, 07:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">emnity...<br />
<br />
Its doable at your lvl, but would be very hard.  One way that your guildies could help out is by having a druid or ranger join you and harmony the guards and NPC's in the front of the outpost, so you can pull the cat single.  Also, a lot of mobs path through that area outside the town, so having friends there to deal with those would be helpful.  Just as an FYI, my druid has killed numerous titans and a few cats and is still apprehensive...the hits are very small.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frued</div><div class="date">04-17-2002, 01:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Went to do this last night. Kraggenskullz was already doing the SoulFiend Lance quest so I just watched (Invised).<br />
<br />
 Was kind of funny. He must of had about 15 cats on him. Had a huge train running out of the kitty fort. He is level 54 so was not in any real danger. One thing though. A druid was in the fort and attacked the ghost of Ridossan. Fortunately the druid high tailed it out of there after getting smacked around by Ridossan. May want to mention to the zone that your doing the Soulfiend Lance quest to prevent some idiot wasting Ridossan.<br />
<br />
 BTW, came back a few hours later and did the quest myself. Gonna bank it for a while and see if verant will sweeten the stats later. Good Luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarkWyld</div><div class="date">04-18-2002, 05:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have not confirmed this, but rumor has it the Ritualist spawns near the north point of the area outside CT.  Can anyone confirm?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frued</div><div class="date">04-18-2002, 11:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I for one have never seen him there and I get back to Feerrott quite often. It could be possible but the only significant Named that spawns there is Radiant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">logbash</div><div class="date">04-21-2002, 12:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">look behind the tower on the north point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Motak</div><div class="date">04-23-2002, 11:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have one of these bad boys.  I did this quest at lvl 36.  I found a spirit south of kitty town and gave it the grimy lance.  Unfortunately Ridosan did not spawn in front of me.  I went up to kitty town invised and noticed that the room where the disciple is sees through invis. (Just opened the door and conned the room)  I had a 49 druid friend help me out.  I went to the top of the hill above kitty town and the druid pulled the disciple to me and after a hard fight I was able to kill it. I then immediately invised up and ran into the room and gave the ghost the idol and ran because by then the whole town agroed on me.  FD at that time was not as reliable so I did die.  When I got back to my corpse there was one Soulfiend Lance in my possession.<br />
<br />
Not as efficient as most ways to do the quest but I do have the Soulfiend Lance.  Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />
