<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kowaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">you fall for 32k points of damage (http://www.sublimedirectory.com/stimes/grape.wmv)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>nezzka is bad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">LOL!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Khat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Originally said by Captain Obvious reporter at end of video<br />
I think she's actually hurt<br />
<br />
hee hee, that's what she gets for mashing up the grapes with her stank feet.<br />
<br />
yeah, yeah...I know it's a tradition...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>nezzka is bad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Those noises she was making when she fell turned me on ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">lol I am really kind of surprised they didn't cut away faster when she started wailing and moaning like a stuck pig.<br />
<br />
I especially like the &quot;I cant breathe&quot; part which of course requires breathing to communicate :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Odiumar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The sound on my comp is really fucked up...but I swear I heard her saying &quot;Oh stop.&quot; over and over...<br />
<br />
I'd say that she &quot;stopped&quot; when she hit the ground, and that was the problem.  What's left to stop?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Saruton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The camera ? And when she hit the ground with her torso and broke a rip which penetrates the lung it really gets hard to breath but you still can talk a bit ... as long as there is some air left in your lungs. If the lung collapses a littlebit later then she cant talk anymore. And probably wont live that long if she isnt treated fast ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Chayde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Not that funny to watch someone fall down anymore. Maybe when I was like 7 it was funny.<br />
<br />
I liked the ass shooting bananas video so much more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>brian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">maybe you should make your own &quot;ass shooting out bananas video,&quot; please.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>nezzka is bad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">its not the fall thats funny chayde, its the wierd noises she makes after words!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Originally posted by nezzka is bad <br />
its not the fall thats funny chayde, its the wierd noises she makes after words!  <br />
<br />
I found the fall funny...but only because she was trying to show off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>brian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">In my soul, I truly doubt that Kowaru is a hot teenage girl IRL. <br />
<br />
Discuss.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">She's a cop looking for pediphiles.  It's actually a pic of Chayde IRL in her sig.  I'd elaborate more but it's hard to type one handed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>brian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I am going to bring up the mangina claim everytime this guy posts until he can prove one way or the other he's a girl, or at least invents a complex fake persona and a buch of fake documents he bought to prove it.  then I'll just ignore him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'm going with the cop thing.  The &quot;girl&quot; who came on and always had &quot;tee-hee anyone wanna play with me&quot; somewhere in her post - or something to that effect - obviously didn't work so now they are trying the dark twisted self-assured girl.<br />
<br />
I keep telling them to go to the paladin forms but they don't listen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kowaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">21 is not a teenager</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Derraj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">depends on where ya live<br />
<br />
edit:  put your pic back in the sig, it is better to look at then what you have in now =D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kebsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">That was funny, and a good morality tale as well, since she was injured while trying to cheat at the contest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Arikash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">haha, that made me laugh, especailly the noises she made when she fell.  Also when she tried to scream and talk, when that only makes it worse =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Dkhar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Fuck, why am I firewalled ? God damnit.</div></div><hr />

Only because it's Friday night. I give specials on Friday nights. Any other night it is only handjobs or anal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>brian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Originally posted by Kowaru <br />
21 is not a teenager  <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Originally posted by Kowaru <br />
21 is not a teenager  <br />
<br />
That's okay 'cause your not 21 either, you're a 42 yr old cop pretending to be a young girl pretending to be 21.<br />
<br />
P.S. - can someone please post the pic of the fat naked guy at his computer to show the world what Kowaru looks like?</div></div><hr />
