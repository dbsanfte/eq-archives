<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Razza</div><div class="date">08-23-2002, 06:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">from a raid (aka many people fighting) perspective:<br />
<br />
<br />
-Warriors: warriors are the frontline troops. they are trained to take the beating and protect the casters/priests. its their purpose to be the meat shield in the first line. and in EQ they basically are that way<br />
<br />
-Rogues: rogues attack from where others dont expect it, from a roleplaying view the EQ backstabbing is pretty stupid =/ but if you just think of it in another way it makes sence. EQ engine wouldnt support a realistic way of rogues, so just imagine the 100 backstabs with the huge DPS were actually one trap / one suprise attack, one hit at a critical point .... then it fits.<br />
<br />
-Monks: monks are fighters who rather believe in the power of mind and body then weapons and steel armor. they are fast, great fighters and confuse the enemy. dunno how to put FD pulling into a RPG perspective but other then that its ok =/ <br />
<br />
-Rangers: scouts, light troops, supreme bowfighters and without bows their strenght is fast attacks who do alot of damage while being weak at taking a beating =)<br />
<br />
-Paladins: holy warriors, they are support forces. in a big battle the paladins fight in the first line with the warriors, mostly for morale boosts (&gt; BMB :P), taking/giving a beating here and there and supporting the troops with light heals. its not their job to be the main meat shield, its their job to support it (the warriors:P) and jump in if shit hits the fan and save the day.<br />
<br />
now for the shadowknight.....<br />
<br />
what do YOU want him to be ?<br />
<br />
<br />
1) *i like this one *<br />
<br />
where paladins are sent in to strenghten the defensive capabilities, shadowknights get sent in at points where offensive power is needed. they are self sufficent (lifetaps) and on their full strengt of power (FM:P) they can deal alot of damage in short time and make the fighters around them stronger at offence (torrent of hate), also they can take a good beating..... however the shadowknights power is not unlimited and after using his magic energies (oom, HT used... etc) he s just half a warrior.<br />
<br />
2) *this is how it is atm*<br />
<br />
shadowknights are basically crippled paladins. they can take a paladins job and fight in the frontline, but why would you want em to ? they can only heal themselves, and not even very efficient if someone is really beating em, they dont offer anything big to the troops... if you want a meatshield get warriors and paladins, if you want damage get rogues monks and offensive casters.... their only excuse is they can make any enemy hate em soo much he forgets about others, too bad thats really not necessary if you have good warriors or paladins.....<br />
<br />
<br />
what do you want ?<br />
<br />
i read all the time about Disease Cloud Nerf, about soul abrasion stacking SCF, Harmshield, self summon corpse reagentfree, more tanking abilities for hybrids..... yet while all this is nice...... would anything of it change the fact that we are sharing our raidrole with the paladin class and they perform way better in it ? do you really want to be a defensive class given there is already warriors AND paladins and both of these classes have very realistic and valid reasons for them being better tanks then sks ?<br />
<br />
and honestly, do you think the SK even has to be a tankclass just because its wearing plate ? bards and clerics wear plate too =/ and honestly while the warrior/cleric hybrid combo sounds very defensive, i have a hard time imagining a warrior/necro combo defensive too =/<br />
<br />
i know what i want, since the first time i saw seru till i killed him, this guy is what an SK should be, dealing huge damage with a badass sword while with the other hand calling destructive magic upon his foes......<br />
<br />
short casttime nukes please to use between swings, a huge HT upgrade in damage. some kickass discs...... SK shouldnt do outdamage wizards or rogues..... really thats not my point, rogues and wizards have every right to be the DPS kings, BUT it would really rock to have a class that could simply blow away rogs/wizzies for a short time, but not over long fights.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tropics</div><div class="date">08-24-2002, 12:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Shadowknight as I see it is a knight of terror and where the pally morrally boosts the troops in battle (nice analogy BTW, some kind of group castable short duration yaulp with nice fighting increases would be great for them) we are their to destroy the moral and gumption of our foes. Really we should do little for our compadres cause really do we care if they die? (from a RP stance of course) but we should truley weaken a mob and in turn get great advances for doing so. The way we weaken the moral and fighting ability of mobs is through our debuffs though and we all know the effect they have on mobs is non-existant. Shamans right now can truely weaken a mob, we just pretend to. To aleviate this the haste tap that stacks cobined with the other torrent spells in a Arch Torrent type spell would own for our class. I guess our group mates keep us alive so I can roleplay the value of buffing them and keeping them alive to serve me.<br />
<br />
I also see the knight of hate as another analogy of a SK that makes sense. These new hate spells are right up our alley in the RP value they have imo. Mobs fear us and when we attack they want nothing more then to kill us or run in fear. Think if you suddenly got attacked by a ghoul, ya got two choices, 1) run like hell (we can make mobs do this) or B) Fight like crazy against the scary beast trying to kill him before he kills you (soon we are going to be able to taunt like no other hopefully and make this a reality). We are sorta like the ghoul, we scare the hell outa mobs and cause them to choose one of the two options. Fight for their lives, run for their lives, and in the end die all the same.<br />
<br />
With the new taunt spells Verant fixed one of our major areas of concern which has existed since the DC nerf as long as those new spells are powerful enough. We need to be able to taunt better then a warrior duel weilding a Blade of Carnage and another enraging blow weapon with max haste and max dex with these new spells. I hope they test for that.<br />
<br />
I think our damage is a little weak. The mage parses in the arena section of the boards are depressing. I think a raise in weapon skills to 235 or 240 would not be out of balance in the slightest and would raise our DPS marginally. Keep warriors above us in melee damage alone, when spell damage is added though we should come out on top over warriors. Add some of the fast cast DD spells for casting in between swings that we have been talking about and our total damage with both melee and spell included would then be where it should be. The type that at 59 or 60 we can do a 400 damage shot with a 3 second unfocused cast time for maybe 200 mana. We could do alot for a short sprint (sort of like the SK going into a blood frenzy, until mana runs out) or use the damage spells sparringly over long camps with KEI slowly letting us regain mana when we have no time to med. <br />
<br />
For tanking we need a boost, but not relative to warriors. Warriors are totally gimped in their tanking abilities since they have little else. First the AC cap needs to go. Second they need to create separate defensive tables. One for warriors, one for knights (pals/SKs), One for monks (offset that insane amount of ac they get, make their defensive table reflect their leather armor only status), one for rogues/rangers, one for bards/clerics, and one for casters. I have no idea if beastlords should have their own defesive table or be put with another class, maybe monks? The AC cap is a horrible roadblock in naturally balancing EQ. They gave monks far to much ac on items but they can fix their mistake by creating seperate defensive tables and therefore make monk AC mean something different then warrior AC. A warrior at 1500ac would mitigate damage better then a monk at 1500ac, of course the monk would avoid better and block as they were always meant to.<br />
<br />
The defensive problem in EQ atm is huge not only for our class but for all classes. Warriors are broken defensively, knights are broken defensively, monks are probably perfect atm except for the fact they tank better then us and as good as a warrior, keep them where they are and leapfrog the plate wearing classes over them to where they should be at the head of the tanking order. That keeps the monks from whining as they are not nerfed and at the same time makes the tanks the true tanks again. It is really hard to RP a plate wearing knight when a mob tears through you like you are a wet piece of toilet paper. I have over 1300ac unbuffed, over 3000hps unbuffed, and an elite in Ssra can tear me to pieces in about 20 seconds fully buffed, it takes them about 30 seconds to do the same to a monk. Now understand, I dont think the SK is a defensive hybrid, I also dont think a monk is though..... Make us tank worse then the pallies and do more damage, by all means I dont think any SK's will whine and the pallies can be the #2 tanks and would be happy with that as well I am sure. We should be the third best tanks in the game behind a warrior (the best, bar none. They taunt second best), a pally (second best tank in the game, noticably worse then a warrior but they can manage most mobs, 3rd best taunters), the SK (3rd best tank, noticably worse then a pally, best taunters though), and the monk (noticeably worse tanking then a SK, no real taunting skills, but of these four classes they dish major melee damage comparatively)<br />
<br />
OK so the post kinda went to class balancing. But lets face it, it is easier to RP your class when it does what it is supposed to.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">synnoira</div><div class="date">08-24-2002, 12:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">From a role-playing viewpoint i would like to see knights differentiated from other classes as mounted cavalry.<br />
Summon Steed at 51 (got to earn your spurs after all) make it a 10k horse, upgrading to 30K horse for Revenants, and 60K horse for Gravelords, once you get to be a Duke you can be riding the best horse.<br />
The horse should confer some added ATK/AC bonus to knights when mounted since the idea is they would be specialist mounted troops.<br />
An evil spectral form would be a nice addition too. I'm thinking Nazgul out of Lord of the Rings, in fact the Nazgul were described as spreading fear and sickness amongst their foes, I think they pretty much are the roleplaying template for sk's rather than D&amp;D anti-paladins.<br />
Beyond that what our spells are fair enough for roleplay, debuffing, siphoning, DoTing, etc, they just aren't delivering decent oomph at the very endgame when it comes down to the brass tacks of game mechanics.</div></div><hr />
