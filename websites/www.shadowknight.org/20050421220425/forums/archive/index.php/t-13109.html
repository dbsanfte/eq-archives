I m a 55 SK troll of Inny, i m MAX amiable with troopers and will be going killin some explorers soon, but i am unguilded and with no friends i can rely on to make a raid party. Its pretty obvious u cannot get this sword all by yourself (although i wish !) but how much of it can be soloed ?<br />
<br />
(i m sure the lower lvl quest can be its obvious) <br />
where will i be stopped ? <br />
can i get a regular xp group for some parts of the drops ? <br />
or should i wait, do a lil faction work and do the big quest work when i have a solid guild or many friends ?<br />
<br />
thanks, i d love to handle this baby and slain some snake on the moon !<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm in pretty much the same boat exactly at this point in time, Zeixxs, and here's how I figure it.<br />
<br />
You should be able to solo up to the last khukri before the GM, or the Crusaders test of the Lord.  At that point, you'll probably need one person to watch your back as you collect those pages (nasty things can happen even with the now green mobs in CoM/MM/Kaesora).  I managed to get most of the pages while those mobs were still giving xp, so I don't have to worry about going back now, but they can be a pain in the ass if you're not very very careful, even now.  When you finally have the last khukri and want to start on the actual GM, you'd probably be best off to tag along with a Necromancer and an Enchanter who are doing the Chardok parts of their epic.  They'll have a raid force together to get their mobs, and our stuff drops on the way to those two fights. As for Drusellia, well, I've not yet figured out how I'm going to manage that bit.  Hopefully something will present itself when I get to that point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wyrdlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, you may not LIKE it, but you'll handle it the way alot of other people will:<br />
<br />
You'll get your Lord of Pain all on your own.  Then you'll go the bazaar (or auction channel) and pay about 500 to 1k for the shard and book and (I personally paid) around 2k for the mirror.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Err, Wyrdlan, what's with the attitude?  I never said anything about liking the way I may have to do this quest or not, and if I recall, I didn't suggest that I was above MQing the pieces if I can find them.<br />
<br />
Nor did the original poster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jackkal Darknite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm stuck at the CoM scrolls atm myself.<br />
<br />
kaesora was easily soloed at 55. I stayed inside the library (got the VP key piece while there also just because) and killed in there and the mobs just outside. 3rd clearing I got the scroll.<br />
<br />
MM was easy. the assistant dark librarian was up so got that first. I stuck myself in the corner in the library and that one took 4 respoawns before I got my piece.<br />
<br />
My biggest bitch so far was Dalnir's. Got the blacksmith and first kly imp easily enough. lab kly imp was a beeyach, took about 6 hours. the church killed me,.. literally.<br />
<br />
First attempt I figured I'd pull em to the &quot;safe&quot; room to kill em (I was level 53  at the time). Thankfully a guild Cleric was nearby to rez me (damn casters). Second time I went to the back of the alter. Killed the 3 kly's on the stage and didnt bother with those at the benches. then brought out my pet. BIG mistake. On the next repop I ate that death and exp loss. it took me 5 5-6 hour camp sessions to get the last piece.<br />
<br />
But so far every time I head over to CoM, the stables are camped :(<br />
<br />
I'l get it eventually.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jabbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I don't think he was giving you attitude...<br />
<br />
Anyway, you can solo all the truly time consuming parts of Greenmist.  The only parts you'd need help with are:<br />
<br />
1- The fight in OT against the Glowing Cliff Golem (one group could do it)<br />
<br />
2- The Mirror.  You can buy MQ though.<br />
<br />
3- The Book.  You can buy it in Bazaar for about 1k depending on your server.<br />
<br />
4- The Shard.  You can buy it in the Bazaar for about 1k depending on your server.<br />
<br />
The bitch of the quest (for non Iksar) is the factioning and then it's just a question of boring camps.<br />
<br />
Oh Jack?  You prolly don't have to leave when it's camped there.  Just help 'em pull and they'll prolly just give you the scroll.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wyrdlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Wasn't attitude at all.  I just said you may not like doing it that way.  That's how I did mine, and I'd have preferred to get the peices myself, but I still &quot;soloed&quot; it, with soloing defined as camping + cash.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Hydian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I solo'ed nearly everything for the lord of pain's khurki at level 50 with marginal gear at best.  The only part that I had help for was Kaesora library which I could have soloed at a cost of more time.<br />
<br />
The shard is doable with 2 groups (we did it with 9 or 10 people) and the book is probably 2 group fare as well.  The easy way to get people to help with these is to point out that both drop near epic mobs (royals and the named herbalist.)<br />
<br />
The golem took a group to kill and was pretty easy relatively.  The sarnak in LOIO took 4 people to kill and was an extremely simple fight at that.<br />
<br />
Drusella will be a sticky point, but a lot of people still kill her for the urn so you can probably tag in with one of those raids.</div></div><hr />
