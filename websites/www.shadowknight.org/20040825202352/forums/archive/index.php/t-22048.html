fuck cars...get a bicycle.  in an urban environment it's jsut as fast, cheaper, and gives you good exercise.  Quit thinking in the box....oh wait, you troll a messageboard...your incapable of thought....oh well.</div></div><hr />

Ok, now, I see this interesting. To me, and to many others I'm sure, $20 a month is absolutely shit all. I work at McDonalds, and $20 a month is shit all to me. So what you're saying to me is that you're pitifully poor white trash, you don't have a job and welfare doesn't pay enough for EQ every month, and now you're cranky. I'm 17 and I already have a fully paid-off car. You don't? I live on my own..... you still don't? I don't need to pay women for sex..... you do? I feel sorry for you, and for fuck sakes, change your name, because you're a disgrace to Canadians everywhere, and I hope your neighbour's dog (probably a scrawny pittbull named fluffy, named so by his master, Billy-Bob) finds you and rips your balls off. Fuckoff and die.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Laronx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">if $20 bucks a month is a big deal to you, you're prolbably a 12 y/o getting $5 a week allowance, which sounds about right....<br />

Holy fuck, funniest shit I've read in a while. I damn near fell out of my chair. Probably because my store has about 8 people hired atm that don't speak a word of english.... and I have to train those poor people.... it sucks. Fuck I hate people sometimes...</div></div><hr />

1. I'll give your dad A+ for being able to get a hard on when he inserted his dick into your mom 12 years ago, resulting in you<br />
<br />
2. I'll give your mom an F for not inserting firepokers into her vagina while she was pregnant with you<br />
<br />
3. I'll give you a C for the effort in really trying to come up with something inventive in the above quote. Effort and &quot;trying&quot; really goes a long way. Some day you will even be able to determine the cycle of your sisters period, from the taste of your dad's dick. Practice, practice, practice<br />
<br />
4. Finally I'll give myself an F for wasting a few minutes of my life responding to this dipshit's thread</div></div><hr />
