<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jobrill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Final Reward pretty much sucks ass. Negative to most stats and hp for +50 mana and a 2mana/2hp regen right click that doesn't stack with a lot of stuff.<br />
<br />
I might get it just so I can pretend I'm a Lich or sumpin, or maybe for the right click when soloing, but it's a dissapointing reward, especially considering a &quot;branchoff&quot; quest from it results in an ftIV Priest Tunic or Caster Robe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">According to the final write up though, it's clickable from inventory.  The stacking issues are a problem though.<br />
<br />
The jury is still out on whether or not there is some use for the mana crystals to increase the stats/effect on the final phylactery rewards.<br />
<br />
Too, the books are NOT inexpensive, so at the present level of risk/reward/effort put into it, I don't think it would be worth it for me.<br />
<br />
Like Jobrill said, might be decent inventory insta-click for soloing, but not much else makes sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>The Zenogias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It seems like what we have seen here, between the Dark Phylactory and the Phylactory are actually not the final reward, there may be another incarnation with far superior stats due to the unused Mana Crystals</div></div><hr />
