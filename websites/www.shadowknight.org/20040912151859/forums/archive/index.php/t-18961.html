<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">so got pet hold last night currently boxing 65/104aa wiz, 61 cleric 63 beastlord. Trying to get the cleric and beastlord to 65 so grinding pretty hard now i need to know what i should drop next aa's into. I heard Channeling focus would probably be better for me then combat fury anyone want to give me examples of how this aa is super vaulable :)?<br />
<br />
On a side note switched from MC to SoC for my proc lately in exp groups and it works okay for me even with ft1+ (lich+beastcrack). So im casting less now just mainly zb, aop, aoh, cd and fear. is Channeling focus still valuable? (maybe for pvp) ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I love channeling focus, then again since LDoN was released I've found myself pulling 40% of our raids (other 60% being split between our other sk/bard)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">so it owns for pulling? i dont pull that much (unguilded) besides exp groups but then i rarely use fd so, heh. Thinking worse case be good for when trying to lifetap in pvp when 3+melee or pets beating on me heh. Know if it would help water based pvp at all? where im forced to chase a gimp swimming in and out of water and i need to stop fast and cast ToI underwater? ie the movement+ water may cause me to miss channeling check normally?<br />
<br />
edit: damnit just read your statement on crits and hits brael and hmmm damnit im tempted ot go get more melee crits :) instead of cf hehe :)...those crits are always calling to me :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lynxal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have been happy with it.  Getting interrupted sucks....especially when you need your lifetaps to land, or a FD to go through.  Every little bit helps.</div></div><hr />
