<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Takhis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all<br />
<br />
I am trying to decide which race of sk would work best for my group.  The group make up will be as follows:<br />
<br />
dwarf cleric<br />
dwarf rogue<br />
barbarian beastlord<br />
human wizard<br />
high elf enchanter<br />
<br />
I included the races of the other classes but I did not know if that would help answer my question.<br />
<br />
We are unsure which races attributes would be better for us.  Non frontal stun, great strength, and stamina from the ogre.<br />
Innate AC, regen, would not need shrink from the iksar.  (An no factioning for the Greenmist :) )<br />
<br />
We would mostly do group experiencing.  We will never be part of an uber guild.   The best we would probably do is a casual raiding guild.<br />
<br />
Hopefully, I provided enough information to answer our question.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gaklaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">hmm choose whatever you want more personally for your situation id say ogre they make excellent Main tanks, but so do iksar so...ogre because the unstunnable is nice for casting</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Greggthegrmreapr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">with all those good races, it might be hard to have an evil sk in the newbie zones to begin with...  PoK will probably make it easier, but the first 10-15 levels might be a bitch...  but i would say go with ogre as they may be accepted in some placse, as where ikkys are not welcome at all...  remember... KoS guards at low level are a bad thing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kahel Everhate</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">the benefits you are talking of only really pretain to your levels 1-45ish. After that you will find the gaps between what race is better will start to close. I think its cool that you would choose Ogre or Iksar, especially with the races yur friends chose..adds a lil flavor ;). I would honestly say go with the race that interests you. The one thing that will make you character the best for your group is if you have fun playing him. I have a human sk ( quested almost all of his greenmist solo at 49 ;) , so don't choose an ikky just for that reason) . He's kos to the sk guild in his home town and max ally to the pallies and clerics of NFP.  <br />
<br />
Do what make you feel good. He may be for your group ;) but in the end he's still your character. If the class interests you so much make a character that you aren't going to end up deleting in his 30's if your group breaks up. Best of luck and remember have fun!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dakkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ogres get Slam, which is great to help keep taunt and for interrupting casters.  Frontal stun immunity is only helpful in specific situations so I wouldn't worry too much about it.<br />
<br />
Iksar can't wear most plate which is often a bad drawback.<br />
<br />
If you're twinking heavily then race is almost secondary, since your stats will come from your armour.<br />
<br />
But it sounds like you're not, in which case you'll probably find the ogre better.<br />
<br />
Incidentally, off topic I notice that your group doesn't include a secondary healer (i.e. druid).  If you're planning on mostly staying to the exp groove in Paludal, HHK DSP and DL then it doesn't matter.  If you want to spice things up a little by roaming around dungeons a lot then you might think of a druid instead of the wiz.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vuloshek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You have a cleric, so regen isn't an issue.  You have a beastlord, so you'll have shrink available to you at level 30 - so you won't be able to mess around in Solusek's Eye until 30 without buying an Ant potion, big deal.  Looks like you'll be the tank, so Ogre is a good choice there, too.<br />
<br />
However, if you think being an Iksar would be more appealing both personally, and in relation to the group (if you think it would be cooler to be an iksar hanging out with good guys than an ogre), be an Iksar.  You'll regret your min/maxing later if you ignore what you really want.<br />
<br />
I play an Erudite now, and I've never had this much fun as an SK.  Are Erudites gimps?  Well... technically, I guess.  And does this matter?  Nope.  The difference isn't even noticeable, frankly.  And I like being a black man with a mohawk and a big-ass sword.  Go figure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Twog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I would say Ogre because they have slightly less exp penalty than the Iksar. The rest of your group won't have one (the barbarian may have a 5% one) so you will slowly fall behind if everyone only plays together. Also with the Ogre having approximately 40 to 50 more str and sta than the iksar, thats a lot easier to max out. Lastly go to AllaKhazams and check the fashion tables, make sure your SK looks like what you think an SK should look like (I was never able to get into the Ogre plate armor). Best of luck.</div></div><hr />

<br />
However, I woudlnt even factor in Greenmist into your race decision at all.  The time required to do the complete series of Khurki quests, especially for all non-IKS races, doesnt yield a weapon that justtifies getting it.  Greenmist comes from an expansion that is vastly out of date and too many weapons exists nowadays that are much easier to get for the same/superior performance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>retired-Redspot-Rallos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">One of my first characters were a Ogre SK. <br />
<br />
Big assault weapons are hard to come by on rallos, i remember a wurm being 2k... Was swinging an abrahams stoic with full suited armor... part guardian and a mix of other stuff. <br />
<br />
For an example of how powerfull a Ogre SK truely is, at level 37, if you have good ac and a damage weap, you can solo the raiders room in HHK(high hold keep). You will be level 45 in less than a week, guarentee.<br />
<br />
Plus, I always opened with a weighted axe... sometimes did an opening of 400 (usualy around 900 if double atk).<br />
<br />
Cant think of more power than that, plus, you never get stunned, ever.<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
As for beastlord, i would personaly have to say ogre even tho most of the people i knew said troll.<br />
<br />
-Ogre pets will literaly rip everything in sight at high levels. Plus i always liked seeing a big monster of a pet running around rather than a alligator which you can barely catch a glimpse of in a swamp. But of course, i just gave away a pvp tactic ;)<br />
<br />
Also, at level 35, i was curious and stripped off all my buff-armor and just buffed myself with what buffs i had in my book, You will surprise yourself with your stats :) Now imagine your buff-armor on top of those stats :D /grin<br />
