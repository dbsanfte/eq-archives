<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i took the easy way out.<br />
bought: hero's khukri, history of greenmist, greenish metal shard, mirror of self loathing MQ. the guy selling hero's khukri and greenish metal shard must have taken over an SKs account or something, because he had no idea about their worth.<br />
<br />
faction: i used 5 essence of iksar potions over the quest. an erudite worshipping cazic-thule, i still had to do a little faction work to get lord of pain khukri. i handed in a few more than 600 bone chips that i had bought from vendors over a month period or so, and 32 explorer knives. i didn't check anywhere in the middle of this, so i probably could have gotten by with less.</div></div><hr />

Disappointing, but whatever.<br />
<br />
Do what you have to do, just don't come around expecting congratulations from those of us who have spent countless hours on faction and rare items to work through the quest.<br />

I'd gladly give my left nut though for a greenish metal shard to be up for sale in bazaar tonight when I log on...<br />

And yea, I'd give my left nut (if my SK were human) for a shard to pop in the bazaar too. The majority of my guild is chardok-allied and nobody ever wants to help me with herbie camp :( .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Hydian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I never understood these iksar vs non iksar posts.  How does it hurt you if my Erudite SK has a greenmist?  Does yours become less powerfull or tarnished or look like a rusty dagger or something?  If anything, non iksar have an even greater accomplishment in obtaining a Greenmist than Iksar who do not have the faction issues.  Personally, I couldn't care less who has what gear.  It doesn't impact my game at all.<br />
<br />
Iksar can use the epic even though it is dedicated to a non iksar god, but that's ok, right?  It benefits you so there's nothing wrong with that, right?  It always seems to come down to race/class envy.  Everyone wants to be equal so long as they are more equal than everyone else.<br />
<br />
In a perfect game, every race/class/diety combination would have a Greenmist type of quest exclusive to them.  It's not a perfect game however and we work within the structure that we are given.<br />
<br />
As for being a disgrace (from an RP perspective)...whiney lizards are a disgrace to shadowknights.  Shadowknights who seize a powerfull weapon from any source to further their own power are hardly a disgrace to the class.  I'm sure that most of those you call a disgrace would be more than happy to obtain their greenmist by prying it out of the cold dead fingers of it's previous owner. :)</div></div><hr />

Lets see your scaley idiot ass do the factioning I had to do to complete the greenmist and then come back to the Iksar vs.  Non-Iksar issue.  Iksars manage to level while they do this quest.  I started it at 53, when I had nothing more to gain than an 18/22 weapon with a proc.  You can start talking about commitment and honor and priveledge when you've shown me that you're worth those things yourself, you insignificant little shit.<br />

<br />
First off, I'm not talking to you, I'm talking to Window. I ask that you keep your foul Fu**ing mouth out of this. And you need to figure out the difference in saying something to someone, and role playing. If you must know, and I see it as non of your Fu**ing business to know, I am on the Drinal server. You happy now you nosey little shit. I don't care what the hell you think of me. Next time, you might want to keep your loud Fu**ing mouth out of someone elses business!!! Oh, and my level is non of your Fu**ing business, I am in the middle of the greenmist, and proud that I am doing it on my own, without buying the parts. That is all you need, not even need, to know. So go to HELL!!!!!<br />
<br />
I would like to also clear up something. I am talking to the cheater who bought nearly everything for the greenmist instead of going out there and doing it there self. I think that all Shadow Knight's deserve the Greenmist, IF THEY GET IT FAIR!!!! I'm also not talking about if you purchase like one or two items for the greenmist, but purchasing the hero's khukri, history of greenmist, greenish metal shard, and mirror of self loathing is just a pu$$y who just doesn't deserve it.<br />
<br />

only took i think maybe a week of 8 hrs a day, which isnt long in my book<br />
<br />
only item i have left to get to have my greenmist is that damn shard....<br />
<br />
one day i will get one......doesnt matter if i am 65 with untold aa's and i have to go down there and solo for it....i will have it one day<br />
<br />
to me wielding the greenmist is a honor not to just being an SK but to all of us questors out there who would rather put the hours in the get something you put untold of time in for...<br />
<br />
to me it is more rewarding to finish a quest then to kill uber mob #1 and get an item that is equal or better</div></div><hr />

I started mine at about level 5 and didn't finish until 55 or 56, but to me the fun was going after each piece at the earliest level I could (almost) survive the encounters!<br />
<br />
So whoever posted as though speaking for all Iksar in wishing ill to non-Iksar wielders, I say not all of us feel that way - if others faction and therefore show a measure of allegience (or at least respect) to the Iksar history, they have earned it!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, yeah, up yours too, Soulstar.  :)  It wasn't DIFFICULT, but it was time consuming, mind numbing slaughter.  And I don't take kindly to anyone who hasn't proven his own worth questioning mine.  Let the little shit contribute to the general knowledge of this community a bit before he starts pointing fingers and calling names to anyone, period.  <br />
<br />
In any case, we all know that the fucking faction would and does keep some people from completing the quest, and I would wager that a lot of those iksar out there so proud to be wielding their &quot;cultural&quot; weapon wouldn't have bothered if they'd had to spend three weeks alone in WW killing greenies.<br />

Point is, we all have options.  Some of us have options that suck a little more than others.  I'm just starting the actual Greenmist quest, and no one in my guild questions my resolve to wield it after the horrible camps I've suffered to get to this point.  Anyone who obtained Greenmist legitimately deserves it.  Kudos.<br />
<br />
Window, shove your head BACK up your ass and fuck yourself to death.  Seriously.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Warmaster Xsavuung Llaahh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">When did the quest area become Rants?<br />
<br />
The point about &quot;Iksars are the only true bearers of Greenmist&quot; comes from the GAME LORE of the item. It has nothing to do with camping skeletons and explorer camps. It has nothing to do with &quot;Iksar Pride&quot; or anything else so trivial. If you don't know the history of the &quot;green mist&quot;, you should go find it and read it. It's a very good story.<br />
<br />
Originally, the weapon was useable ONLY by Iksar. Back when the quest was actually fixed and completed (I think a year after the quest was STARTED, I might add.), it was Race: IKS Class: SHD. That was IT. I don't know when it was changed, but I for one think it should have been left alone. But my opinion is based on the Role-playing aspect of the quest, not the &quot;it makes you more powerful, so why can't it make me more powerful?&quot; aspect. Greenmist is the Unholy Khukri of Rile. Rile, the savior of the Iksar. <br />
<br />
Anyone arguing about the time sink involved with getting faction up needs to simply chill out. We Iksar have to do factoin with almost EVERY quest we do simply because everyone hates us. And yes, including Innoruuk's Curse. I spent a week (I think) slaughtering kobolds just so I could enter Paineel. And you can't say &quot;well, you have to deal with that because of your race choice when you started!&quot; BS. I live by my choices. My Iksar Shadow Knight is level 65, and I worked damn hard for that. I have had my SK since the double XP penalty, and had to find armor back when all the really NICE armor was all NON-Iksar useable. Having ALL those things unavailable to us, on top of having the grand-master smithed Iksar racial armor be total CRAP, I think having Greenmist and the shaman cudgel quests is a small thing to have exclusive to the Iksar race.<br />
Also about the SK epic; The epic quests history is based on and around the CLASS. Again, this is probably all just semantics, but the LORE behind the iksar quest weapons is based on and around the iksar RACE.<br />
Anyway, my opinion doesn't mean crap. The weapon(s) are usuable by any SK/shaman race, and if you have it, then you worked for it. <br />
<br />
BTW, to whoever cares. My in game name is Xsavuung Llaahh, I am a level 65 Iksar Shadow Knight with 51 AAs, and I play on Innoruuk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Xsavuung,<br />
<br />
Please shut up with that load of crap.  Everyone has bad faction with Paineel to start except Paineelians.  If you weren't born there, you can't get into the city.  Period.  As for the lore behind Greenmist, I have read it, and though it does mention being the blade of Rile, son of Venril Sathir, saviour of the Iksar, it doesn't mention anything about being made to fit only an Iksar's hand.  The factioning I have no problem with.  It's a matter of pride for me to be able to walk through the canals and streets of Cabilis unmolested.  It's a matter of pride to be able to go afk next to Arch Duke Xogg and not come back to a corpse run.  And it's a matter of pride that I was able to prove my worth to that most insular of races, the Iksar, those who hate everyone and trust no one.<br />
<br />
What I don't like is when people who have never given anything to the community complain about what was taken away from them.  &quot;Oh, they gave Greenmist to the softskins, that's horrible, it doesn't fit the lore and our strong tradition of being isolationist.  It's Riles blade, it should be Iksar only!&quot;  Greenmist has more to do with the divine retribution Cazic rained down on the Shissar than it does anything that Rile did.  He simply had a blade crafted for him that harnessed the power of Cazic.  <br />
<br />
Implying that just because Rile was an Iksar hero, the blade's use should be limited to Iksar is a crock of shit.  First and foremost, he was a Crusader.  Every blade in the chain up to Greenmist were the Crusader's blade of something-or-other.  They made no reference to Rile in any of the previous blades.  Second, from the responses I've recieved from several Ikky NPCs and from what I've read in quite a few in game texts, Ikkys value strength more than they do reputation.  So saying that it matters that the blade was Riles is going against other evidence.  Third, there is a shaman quest similar to Greenmist which starts in Cabilis.  Just because they are retrieving Iksar skulls and dealing with Iksar spirits doesn't make it any less an &quot;all-race shaman&quot; item.<br />
<br />
So then we're left with the story of the Iksar to validate your point.  The Ikkys were enslaved and then set free by the divine retribution of Cazic Thule in the form of a Green Mist.  Iksar are not the only SKs who can worship CT, and they sure as shit aren't the only race who got shit on.  I have frogs living in my home;  I have to bunk up with Inkies. Besides which, Greenmist is NOT an Ikky epic.  It's a reward for a very long quest with long camps that by right belongs to anyone with the fortitude (or bloody-mindedness) to complete it.  And regardless of what the Ikky SKs out there think,  I'm not going to give the fucker back, even if I could so the discussion is moot, in any case.  I'm sure that most of the other non-Ikkys feel the same way.  We (for the most part) worked for this.  Why does everyone always have to be shitting in people's wheaties?  Just be glad for another SK getting something that was a lot of work and time, or keep your stupid yap shut.  It's not like you and I (or Xaksorsis and I, for that matter) even play on the same server.  You can just pretend that I don't run around with it equipped wherever I go.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>cft2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Well, Tamuk, my ogre didn't cheat for Greenmist<br />
<br />
As a follower of the Warlord, he can respect an enemy's warriors.  With the lure of a weapon of power, he set out to prove himself to the Legion of Cabilis by laying waste to their enemies.  It took time and blood but the Legion eventually considered him to be of some use to Cabilis.<br />
<br />
Then battling in Kurns and againsts the goodie invaders in LOIO, he sought to make himself useful in the eyes of the Iksar.  Swifttails, Residents of Cabilis, Brood, and even Crusaders of Greenmist eventually saw him as worthy.<br />
<br />
After time and blood, now ready to claim the rewards, Tamuk studied the speach of the iksar, and performed the Ritual of Exoneration.<br />
<br />
Next, to seek out the elders to learn of the Khurkris.<br />
<br />
The Iksar would have none of it.  Useful to Cabilis or not, an Ogre who follows Rallos Zek was not deemed worthy of their prize.<br />
<br />
Hatred seethed in Tamuk at being thwarted, bringing him closer than ever before to Innoruuk.<br />
<br />
Tamuk left Cabilis, vowing never to return<br />
<br />
<br />
But Grenndel Mindwalker needed a kill in the sewers of Cabilis.  Tamuk returned to help, and noticing his companion's illusion of iksar form, a new plan was formed.<br />
<br />
Tamuk returned to Cabilis, with his phantomist friend.  This time both wore the illusion of iksar form.   Presenting his deeds to the eldars as an Iksar, he was deemed worth of the Khukri, advancing to a Lord of Pain.<br />
<br />
The lump of Tymonnium ore sits ready to be forged, waiting for a way to be found to contact the old Haggle Baron of Dalnir.<br />
<br />
Soon, Tamuk will have his blade.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, as a matter of fact I did.  Did you?  Have you read the lore?  Have you been through all of the Iksar lore?  Have you read the quest for the Iksar Shaman Cudgel?  Specifically the part about finding Rile's skull and putting him to rest from the torments rained down upon him by the Emperor, his father?  I won't presume you've done those quests, but being such an afficianado of Iksar lore, I'm sure you've read them.<br />
<br />
Please.  I don't know what in particular offended you, Kenshin.  I don't even care.  But if you're going to attack me and suggest that I'm not playing the game right, at least get your facts straight.  I bought the Mirror MQ.  I bought the Greenish Metal Shard.  The two pieces that absolutely had to be raided, I paid plat for.  Are you happy?  Does it make you feel better to know that I didn't loot those pieces off of the corpse of a dead enemy, thus proving in some way that I don't &quot;deserve&quot; Greenmist?  <br />
<br />
/gofuk, you idiot.  First and foremost, how I play my game is none of your concern.  You don't even play on my server.  The fact is, I spent the time working the faction up.  I didn't use Ikky illusion potions, I didn't use hide tricks, I worked the faction up over a long time until I was able to do the quest.  Then I went around and solo'd every piece up to the 8th.<br />
<br />
I'm not guilded, I don't have the best of equipment nor the resources to camp the last two no drop pieces for the combine, so I purchased them.  Not before I went on several necro epic raids to try and get the shard, might I add.  I did what I had to do.  And you know what?  No one cares.  Few care about the origninal poster buying his outright except for those rare &quot;hardcore RP'ers&quot; and morons who feel affronted that someone didn't play this game in accordance with their arbitrary rules.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Korekil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I would be happy to see all the races get a weapon or quest similar to the greenmist. I don't agree with it being useable by non-iksar from a purely RP point of view, but if you did the time u deserve the reward :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Jabbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">From a purely RP standpoint, I can see anyone weilding Greenmist.  How often in fantasy settings is the 'fish out of water' guy awarded the highest honors of a race or society not his own because of his bravery and service?  Happens all the time!  <br />
<br />
If a drow were to reject his heritage and embrace another, couldn't he rise to a position of high honor within that society?  Drizzt Do'Urden did it, even though it's a guarded respect he's given by many.<br />
<br />
Frodo Baggins is greatly respected by the elves of middle earth (some anyway), who normally wouldn't have anything to do with lesser beings like the hobbits.  Sam and Pippin gain similar standing with humans, all because of service to their various causes.<br />
<br />
If a dark elf embraces the iksar culture and strives to defeat the enemies of the Iksar, couldn't he be rewarded with the honor of the Greenmist?  Wouldn't it also be within the RP of it for that same dark elf to turn around and use Greenmist to slaughter the Iksar, as he'd simply tricked them to further some obscure goal of his?<br />

<br />
not nearly as xenophobic as the Iksar... Dark elves don't mind trolls, hll you're living with them... and even I as an Iksar wasn't hated by the Heretics.<br />
<br />
Iksars kill their OWN for blasphemy, let alone anyone outside of their race... so in conclusion, RP is dead... the Vision is gone... but is it so wrong for us to want it back... LONG LIVE THE IKSAR!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Darknyss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">oh and by the way... If you stopped to read the texts when you were handing in all those 'bought' items... you'd notice about a hundred times that they mention, the &quot;rightful hands of the Iksar&quot; and that the sarnak do not deserve it, it belongs to the Iksar... and<br />
<br />
CAZIC THULE did NOT create the Green mist... it was &quot;ungodly&quot; as the Shissar were becoming more powerful than the gods themselves...<br />
<br />
deity restriction MAY be plausible, but for a TRUE RP aspect, and for the text the quest gives and the background behind these weapons, it SHOULD be Iksar only...<br />
<br />
unfortunately, Sony got rid of all RP aspects and focuses on pleasing those that pay their fee, so stop bitching that Iksars are roleplaying their anger... it's probably the only RP that's left in this game...</div></div><hr />

Gratz to Shadowknights of ANY race who actually did the work for your Greenmist........and BAH to anyone too lazy to either faction or actually hunt for your drops. <br />
<br />
it's not a matter of being lazy. it's a matter of being bored to hell with faction. i've done that before. my first serious character has /played 5x longer than my SK because of tradeskills/questing/general fooling around and is 7 levels lower. i also have an enchanter who i'm working on every faction with... so eventually i will be doing cab with her.<br />
<br />
if i could do it all again... i'd definitely pay someone to MQ the stupendous tome to me. hehe</div></div><hr />

<br />
Crazycajun you must not have noticed that Iksar have suited their scaley asses into Velious armor plate quests ~Smite~.  Sorry you couldnt twink yourself with the best plate the bazaar had to offer.<br />
<br />
Also last i checked Iksar could use Innoruuks Curse, so should they have limited that to all sk classes besides iksar, since you guys should be the only to get greenmist??  Or maybe made it Deity Based?? pls pls fill me in on your RP logic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Ziagwa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">grats on greenmist<br />

i dont really see that as cheating though you used in-game items to get</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Darknyss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Kind of curious... why do people bring up Innoruuk's Curse when talking about the Greenmist... just because it's NAME has Innoruuk in it?<br />
<br />
what lore/history/deity restriction does Innoruuk's Curse have?... the quest doesn't say the it belongs to a Dark Elf, or that it was made for only CERTAIN ShadowKnights....  in fact, the Greenmist has a MUCH deeper LORE concerning it's history towards a particular RACE... as the creator of Innoruuk's Curse was trying to make the most powerful corrupted sword for the greatest of ShadowKnight... not greatest Dark Elf... or greatest Ogre....<br />
<br />
there's some real History behind the Greenmist in who it belongs to... and to a very xenophobic race, it almost seems implausible to give out our secrets and most powerful weapon creations to those outside of our race....<br />
<br />
so yes... we hold a grudge... but we're not trying to force ALL other weapons to become highly specified.... I mean... was there a HUGE discussion on not letting Iksar's use Innoruuk's Curse?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Theres history behind Innoruuks Curse also.  If you had the smallest idea of what you are talking about then you would know that.   If iksar are as xenophobic as you say they are then they would have nothing to do with Paineel.  In fact WTF are they doing leaving Kunark.  There's no problem with Iksar using Innoruuks Curse,  however based on the Iksar logic there should be.  If your gonna rp and discuss in an rp manner then do it right,  dont just half ass it.  You say your a xenophobic race then dont do our quests either.  If not then stop complaining and play the fuckin game, theres quests we do them we earn the faction to do them.  God damn the way your going id have thought you were a fuckin monk whining on an allakhazam board.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Braugh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">The Iksar are insular and zenophobic, yes. That is why the non-Iksar must work so hard to prove themselves before the Iksar accept them. Once they have proven themselves, then they may recieve Greenmist. I guess you could think of it as being an honorary Iksar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>agonisti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Any Shadowknight that goes through the effort of factioning and the damn subquests for the Greenmist deserves to have it, no matter race - plane and simple - screw RP, it's doesn't really even exist in EQ anymore anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Grotar Von Smash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">I think this is getting off topic, I think what everyone objected to was the fact that WIndows cheated his way to getting Greenmist.  Well if he was an innoruuk worshipper he would be blessed because he has gotten everyone to hate him.  As far as a Shadowknight goes, I think he has shown that he has borne the darkside well, cheating to win or aquire something is a very evil and dark thing.  He has done this and deserves applause for RPing an evil race as is.<br />
<br />
THere are some of us, like the iksar heritage, that demans evil, and absolute tyranny and law.  That is the legacy of Greenmist, to bring terror to the iksar enemies, which was the shissar, in the name of Cazic Thule.  Lawful Iksar would have been pissed at what he had done, like High Scale Kirn.  Dark Elf Shadowknights would have laughed with glee that someone acquired a sacred weapon through subterfuge and guile.<br />
<br />
Trolls...we dont care, the iksar told me to kill these stupid explorers and I did.  Then they told me that the necros still didnt trust me and so made me kill the stupid outcasts in those caves on the beach of Field of Bone, so I did.  After all, we like killing.<br />
<br />
THen they told me that to get one of their sacred kukhris I had to smash enemies to bone fragments with a sacred hammer, so I did that to those ugly alien things in the Netherbian Lair.  <br />
<br />
Later they told me to sit and wait 25 hours for the kly to show up to be killed.  Now the IKSAR know the meaning of Fear and Pain.<br />
<br />
So Trolls now know Iksar pain.</div></div><hr />

If you haven't noticed the dripping sarcasim yet, you need some serious help. Which reminds me, I think we should all petition and bug report to get hero's khurki changed to no drop to keep asshats like this guy from getting a great lore style weapon so easily.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>LoganHex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">My two cents (which means nothing to anyone except me).<br />
<br />
From a roleplaying point of view I believe that only an Iksar should be able to wield the Greenmist. Outside of roleplaying I do not really care. I am an Erudite and I have begun working on this quest because it is an incredible weapon that I would like to wield. I am playing my character in a manner that I believe this game was originally meant to be played. Every single item I own has either been quested for or obtained from the corpse of an enemy that I have slain. That is the style of play I prefer. That is the style of play I respect.<br />
<br />
Having said that anyone who has completed the quest for the Greenmist deserves it. The faction work alone (which is what I am working on at the moment) is extremely tedious. Some may think it is easy. Those who do are probably not limited to two hours of play time a night like I am (work and family prevent me from playing longer).<br />
<br />
If you own the Greenmist I congratulate you. If you earned it I respect you. However everyone pays the same amount of money to play this game so if you bought it than you deserve it just as much as the next guy. If you resent those who did not put as much work into it as you did all you are going to do is become a bitter person. I learned that myself the hard way. So now I go about playing the game the way that I like and do not begrudge those who play the game the way they like. Of course I do not understand why they like to play it that way. In my opinion it is kind of like winning at Monopoly when you allow yourself to take out loans from the bank without having to pay them back. Sure you win but you have not really accomplished anything. If that gives you a sense of satisfaction though than so be it. Far be it from me to rain on your parade.<br />
<br />
I like to do it the hard way though. At the end of the day I like being able to look at my character and know that I have earned everything that he has. Truly earned. No farming for platinum to purchase something in the bazaar. <br />
<br />
That is just me though. If you are different I say more power to you.</div></div><hr />
