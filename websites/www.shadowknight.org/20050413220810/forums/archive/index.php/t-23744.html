<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Use search.<br />

Best. Tip. Ever.</div></div><hr />

Also tactics depend on the level, equip, group and role.<br />
<br />
Start out in the Armory and follow the stickied guidelines.  You can list all that info there, and then ask, where and what.</div></div><hr />

and content you are doing<br />

No, we don't mind but the question is a bit broad.  <br />
<br />
Here is some good starting advice:<br />
<br />
2 handers from 30-60+ (one hander plus shield for some content)<br />
<br />
You should learn how to pull and control agro (not just get or have snap, though those are important, a good sk knows how to keep where he wants to be on the list in case the MT goes down or is going down)<br />
<br />
You're not a warrior, use your spells<br />
<br />
AC is your most important stat followed by HP<br />
<br />
Read this board and use search, you will be a better shadowknight and cringe at half the shadowknights you meet because you will learn how to play the class here and they will get peope killed every time. (might explain our jaded attitudes)<br />
<br />
Ask specific questions when you have them after you've searched and can't find them.  Even if it's considered a question that's been answered 1000 time someone will link the thread with the answer while flaming you horribly.<br />
<br />
Start by asking general questions with specific details i.e. &quot;what is a good 2 hander at my level that I can get with X group at X level with X gear and X budget?&quot; rather than direct questions with no detail i.e. &quot;Windblade or War Marshall's Bladed Staff?&quot;<br />
<br />
Read stickies<br />
<br />
Read the armory but note the dates, some of that information may have changed slightly.<br />
<br />
Learn and know and love your roles (which could be one of many things depending on the group make up - learn how to determine it)<br />
<br />
Know that your capabilities grow as you progress (FD at 30 is life changing), different taps and procs and spells will have to be used at different times<br />
<br />
SK's are versitile, don't short yourself by not learning all your capabilities and the situations in which to use specific ones</div></div><hr />
