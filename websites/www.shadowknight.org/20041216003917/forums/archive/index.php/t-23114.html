<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kript</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have recently started working on my Faction to get the OT hammer. Where is the best place to go to find the Sarnak Zerkers?  Any help will be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>cames</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">They are in the Overthere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kript</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">HEHE I guess I should have made a little more clear.  Sorry bout that I meant to ask where in OT is the best place to find them?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you go down in all the ruins near the Fronteir Mountains zone (southern part of the zone) there are a ton of them in there, and they're all random pops, so just slaughter the whole place. After those are done, just get on your horse/sow/bard/whatever and run around spamming your cycle targets key until you find more sarnak berzerkers (I think that's the name of the mob that drops the tails, its been a while).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Oagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Most of the ruins have a bunch.  There are also a bunch around SF zone.  You'll need about 8 bags worth (80 or so, iirc) to get to amiable.  Or, kill RoS named (Kunark Dragons), which help raise it, too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Putrid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The sarnaks beserkers holding the triangle weapon have the braids.  That might make it a little faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Xiel_Lostsoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">After you get your 1st 4 braids, I suggest you go check out your current faction standing w/ Captain Rottgrime.  If your faction is bad enough, you will have to do some combo of pull, mez, mem wipe, zone, rezone, hide, sneak, etc to even hand-in braid sets, and you may have to do hundreds of these turn-ins to get the right faction.<br />
<br />
If you are good enough faction to do braid quest, ok then.  If not, or if you aren't game to farm braids, go get Puppet Strings from Bazaar or Fear and charm the Undead Foreman for the turn-in, no faction needed.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kript</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I am a RZ Ogre and ATM with 1 turn in I am Apprehensive to him.  Should I just try to charm him or keep on factioning?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bushido32</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I've always wondered whether this hammer is worth my time.  I'm apprehensive to OT outpost, but have done some killing in Kaesora so I have taken some faction hits.  <br />
<br />
1) How much time does it take to faction up via braids?<br />
2) How useful is the hammer?  I make &amp; use Thurg. gate potions and have only had to do it once in about 3 months time and it's easy enough to make more.<br />
3) How easy is the Puppet Strings charming?  Do I need a debuffer for resistences?  I'm 56th level, how reasonable would it be for me to charm him?<br />
<br />
I hear alot about this and the Crown of Deceit (and AoN), but I'm not sure what 'makes them so great'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Xiel_Lostsoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Gate potion is around 300pp per charge.  When you are farming Fear or Growth daily that adds up damn fast.<br />
<br />
Farming braids is gay and Puppet Strings are the answer.  Bring a chanter to tash (or bring a journyman tash stick) and you may still get lots of resists.  I had 3 resists and 2 early breaks before charm held long enough to do turn-in (my charisma suxxors, this probably played a part).<br />
<br />
My only regret is doing the quest last week instead of last year.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Marruk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'm a CT worshipping ogre.  I soloed the OT faction braid quest in about 2-3 hours at level 50-something.<br />
<br />
The hammer is worth it, imo.  I've saved thousands of plats on gate potions by using it.  <br />
<br />
Puppet strings can be quite expensive, and lowers the overall savings on gate potions by a bit.<br />
<br />
Not to mention that, with the Puppet Strings method, it is much easier to slip back to being KoS in the fort, which can be an inconvenience when you zone in low on health from waiting for your hammer to proc on a mob (I usually /duel someone to proc it, but sometimes I do beat a mob silly with it waiting for a proc).</div></div><hr />

This is not a problem, you won't be aggro'd on zonein and you can slip off the boat and to the book without any aggro at all usually. This is true at 65+ with unholy steed and invis at least, but I also have the hammer on lower level alts that have never had a problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>grinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">if u are not KoS just hand braids in, only takes a short time really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">If you are KoS to hand them in, then just get off your lazy ass and get your VP key. It's a decent zone to XP in, fun to fuck around in, and you can go from max KoS (Human Cleric worshipping who knows what) to max faction (amiable for the cleric, if I remember right) in about two afternoons of xp'ing. All done.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It can happen if you're a lazy fuck like me.  My 51 Vah Shir Bst was on a Fear break where, despite the MT repeatedly spamming &quot;STOP ATTACKING&quot;, several people decided to kill the Ireblind Imp's PH (this was a 2 group fear raid, with only a couple of 65's).<br />
When IB mezzed the whole raid, and I was the first to break mez (and therefore gain aggro), I loaded up my OT hammer and started swinging for dear life.  Proc'ed at about 25% health, jumped off the boat, dove into the water, and swam just a little too close to one of the dragoons on the docks.<br />
<br />
Stupid and lazy of me, yes, but it wouldn't have happened at all if I wasn't KoS.<br />
<br />
Of course, a SK shouldn't have the same problems, but then, a SK should have much less difficulty getting decent faction in the first place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Bushido32</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Ok, you've convinced me that it's worth it.  I started farming braids last night and it's is going faster than expected.  Very fast respawn timer on the Sarnak at the large ruins.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Shadon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Took me about 50 braids to get to amiably as a human SK of Innoruuk  :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Bushido32</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I had killed a fair bit in Kaesora before I embarked on this, but two big batches of braids (about 120 braids total) got me the required faction.  I now have the hammer.  I love new toys.  Total time invested was about 6 hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Shaithiss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Being an Ikky SK, starting way KOS there to begin with, I had to use a DE illusion just to hand braids in. It took almost 1,000 braids for me to get amiable. I camped the ruins near Warslik's, and then rode my horse over to the southern end of the chasm where there's more ruins. Unless you've got a tracker don't bother with wanderers, just camp the 2 ruins. Since I got the hammer I've soloed Charasis a few times and am max KOS to VS, so when I hammer gate I just jump off the left side of the boat and swim around the wall, or if I'm in a hurry I'll just pull up my horse and run right out the south gate and around to the book, hardly anything aggroes running that fast and if they do, they never get close to the book unless you stand around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Belyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">If your kos in OT there is a time of day(eq time) that the guards are all out on patroll, dont remember the time but it would be easy to find out.  Then you only have to worry about the skels on the ship when ya gate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Shawee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">It is really easy to avoid OT mobs when you first zone in from Proc.   I have done it many times without agro. Since I received my hammer a couple of years back, I have become KOS to OT outpost.<br />
<br />
 When you first zone in, the skelly on the boat will not agro, if you stay in your zone spot.Cast invis vs undead, run to the top of the hill where you see the first building and the golem on your right. That first building, most of the time during the day, will have a goon standing on top of it.Why? I don't know. Than cast shadow or invis and simply go to the POK book.  <br />
<br />
As you are moving to POK, you will see rotgrime and his gang.  I just move to the left where I brush against the iron sentinal near the bank.  I have never had agro from Rott.  One time I wasn't really paying attention and passed closer than i would like, and he still didn't agro. Maybe it was Lag.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Shadon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Just simple warning:<br />
When you zone in to OT you land upon a boat. Just infront of you there are is a hole in to the cargo area and there is no direct way out of the cargo hold. Yesterday lag hit me right after I zone in and all of a sudden I have fallen into the hole. After a few minutes running around trying to squeeze myself out and shadowstepping, I give up and target the skelly worker just above my head. I pull him and noone adds so I start blundgeing him silly with the hammer. At around 40% it procs and Im free but the skelly have no problem escaping the pit and starts wacking on me, so feign dead. Skelly returns to spawn point and think that everything is ok, so I stand up and he doesn't aggro. So I start running straight through the building area and is running through the broken wall heading for the PoK book when I hear General Something starts to cast, and a thought pops in my head, &quot;I hope he is only refreshing his buffs and isn't agroed on me....&quot;, so I stupidly turn around to check real quick, and see the whole outpost comming at me. BLAM, fear hits me for 1-2 secs and then all of the sudden my health drops from 70% to 25%. Luckely the General has HT me before he and his goons has reached me and broke the fear, so I decided to leave the area before they got even more freindly...<br />
<br />
If I didn't have virtue that day, I would have been toast thanks to stupidity.<br />
So watch out for the pit and if fallin, be sure to clear agro before running through the inner part of the outpost!  :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Marruk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Yeah, that pit in the boat sucks ass.  WTG Sony. <br />
I finally got out by using bobbing corpse to get caught halfway in the deck, at which point I clicked it off, and managed to jump the rest of the way out.</div></div><hr />
