<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>sofa_king_we_todd_it</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">quick question on factions<br />
<br />
Is there any reason to keep Venril Sathir faction good, after doing the Workers Sledge quest?<br />
<br />
Just asking cuz I planned on hunting in Karnors, and I dont want to shit the bed on any future quests concerning Sathir faction.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Oagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Depends on how much time you spend in Kunark.  There's one mob near the zone-in after you gate.  My faction's fine, so I don't know what his aggro proximity is.<br />
<br />
My question would be why would you hang around KC if you're 56.  Get to PoP.  KC just plain sucks.  What's there that you want/need?  Velks is better, Droga is better.  Veksar is better.  Nadox is better, especially since it's now a &quot;hotzone.&quot;  <br />
<br />
If you're helping with epics, that's one reason to go to KC.  But, I wouldn't let my faction go below dubious. <br />
<br />
Just my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">No reason to keep the faciton.  Note that you'll need to have lev up so you can run across the water to get to the book.  I wouldn't even bother killing the only green skellie that'll agro you while you're there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Oberyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">...part of the ongoing dumbing down process...<br />
<br />
The green skellie doesn't agro anymore when you port in, provided you are of a level that he IS green, and you dont move.<br />
<br />
<br />
No need to keep faction, unless you have something you like to do in the outpost  *shrug*<br />
