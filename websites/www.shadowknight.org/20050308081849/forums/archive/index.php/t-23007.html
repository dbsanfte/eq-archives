<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sallar909</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">In the last 48 hours I have been able to kill the Murkglider Breeder 2x and he has poped a third on Xev.  The spawn point is correct in all the other posts <br />
(-768, +889), but it seems that the mob has changed a bit.  Once engaged MB does spawn 6 mobs, called Murkglider Spawn.  They can be mez'd, or you can just train em away and FD.  The MB will reset, but the babies will not.  Now you can easy single pull the MB to your group, however, he needs to be burned down FAST, cus after about 2-3 min it will start poping the Murkglider Spawns again.  Made the fight a bit more difficult, but not impossible. <br />
<br />
We did try to kill the 6 babies hoping the MB would not re-spawn them, but that didnt work.  Just bring a couple healers, a back up tank, and dps.  Then you will get your egg.  Enjoy your omlet!<br />

Hollar at me on Xev if you have any questions.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>nightjackal77</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">they Spawn at random time once he is aggro'd<br />
<br />
I have Verified this and you can take my word on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ahlana DaFosse</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Did this on Torv a couple times. He does not re-spawn the Murkglider Spawns after 3-4mins. I haven't time it but they stay up for a good 15-20mins. Plenty of time to do this mob. <br />
<br />
Did this mob with 11 people was overkill. What we did was, I tagged the breeder and ran to zone... All 6 spawned as he was chasing me.. Now all the Spawns are at zone :) Then the Breeder reset.. We tagged and killed. Spawns stay up even after breeder dies. Which unfortunately did not make the zone in very safe :( But none the less got mah egg.<br />
<br />
Makeup of People we had:<br />
<br />
2 SKs<br />
2 Pallies<br />
2 Clerics<br />
2 Druids<br />
1 Beastlor<br />
1 Enchanter<br />
1 Wizard<br />
<br />
Of those only 9 were there for Kill. Running the breeder to zone almost killed me. Had a druid succor to zone to heal me but a one of the Spawns killed him before he was even fully zoned. So he was out for fight. I ran back to group but breeder was alerady almost dead heh. And that is it... Took us no time at all kill was probably 2 minutes at most with all those people. Could've done it with one group but better to be safe then sorry :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Easily 1 groupable with an elemental level group.  A chanter is insurance in case you do get spawns.<br />
<br />
The 'spawns repopping in 2-3 min' could be this:  They don't stay up forever.  If it took a while to split him and pull him after adds initially popped, they could have started depopping on their own- in that case, the breeder would start popping more.<br />
<br />
He's got pretty fair hp, ain't that rough to tank, but an additional healer to help out with the AE dot is a plus.<br />
<br />
Unfortuantely the time I did him was for another SK that already had popped him, and the fucker hasn't spawned again for me in about 6 hours of camping the spot with a group.<br />

We had:  SK, SK, Cleric, Druid, Chanter, Wizard.</div></div><hr />

So is the &quot;a murglider creeper&quot; the PH? Or is the Breeder a separate spawn?<br />

All of this is available if you *USE THE SEARCH FUNCTION*.<br />
<br />
However cos im a nice guy...<br />
<br />
&quot;a murglider creeper&quot; &amp; &quot;a murglider swarmer&quot; seem to be the ph's. Its always the same spot. &quot;Murglider Deathsting&quot; spawns in the point right next to the breeder.<br />
<br />
It is slowable - partial i think. It Flurries, hits for 900 ish. It has an AE, Tentacle Sting or something - look it up on lucy but i think its a DD, followed by HP+Mana dot. I seem to remember it proc'd the same effects as normal murkgliders - but i could be wrong it was very late.<br />
<br />
You really don't need to know more about the &quot;Murglider Spawn&quot; as you just train them to zone in (get levitate + sow and click that Rule #1 before you run like hell) and they corpse camp anyway.<br />
<br />
If you really feel you need to know more about any of this *USE THE SEARCH FUNCTION*.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Uvaavu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I'm guessing because CoH after you run the (potential) adds to the zone means you can pull him instantly and solo (he warps back, the other mobs all walk / corpse camp).<br />
<br />
Having another tank along actually serves the same purpose anyway - have them pull when you FD. Just make sure you've not got aggro when you run back.<br />
<br />
Can't think of any other reason having a mage would have mage things easier for me.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Shadoh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Yes a shaman, SK can kill the PH.  The problem is all the roamers.  I did this with my Shaman, SK and druid.  I set up camp up the stairs and at the end of the tunnel.  This cut down on roamer adds but every now and then one of them still makes it up there.  It still wasnt easy.  I could kill the two static spawns that were in my way and then snare/FD the PH out of his hole and barely beat respawn on the static mob at the top of the stairs.  <br />
<br />
My Shammy actually did the healing with my druid just there as back up.  It would take to long for my druid to recover mana in between each kill.  If I got a roamer add I would just succor to zone and come back and start over.  Over the course of a week I killed a ton o PHs and never got the Breeder to spawn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">You could easily 2 box the PH.<br />
<br />
Problem is, you won't have the dps to keep the camp clear enough to safely pull the PH.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Krassus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">2 boxed the PH last night and every fight i was getting adds, around the 4th PH he popped called a guild monk, druid, warrior to come help. Monk was mid GoD equipped and Tank was 13kish buffed. Monk pulled him right to the zone in alone, with 5 people had 0 problems until the end where the tank attacked through enrage cause he AFK'd . Most of us except me were full time , with some GoD equip thrown in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Elkar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">More details on spawning the babies:<br />
<br />
They don't all spawn immediately.  It takes 2-3 ticks of agro per baby to spawn them.  They way we did this was to set up camp on top of the exit of the tunnel.  There is a nice flat area with no mobs around to set up and buff (this is assuming Breeder is up and you are assembling for a kill).  Cleared our way down, set up in the first cubby to the left inside the tunnel.  Cleared the wanderers.<br />
<br />
Then had an SK with harmshield (suppose a bard would work best here) agro the breeder, HS and run back toward the zone.  Rule #1 helps for after HS wears off, but if you get far enough on HS, you'll make it past the heaviest concentration of adds.  Once out in the open near the bridge you can run toward zoneline, but by this point all 6 babies will spawn.  Mage CoH at this point is best.<br />
<br />
Once breeder reset, we singled him (easily) to the cubby where he was tanked.<br />
<br />
Took us a while to get this all done, it's a laggy zone and many folks were struggling with it.  The spawns stay up for a good 15-20 minutes like said above.  Once they depop or are killed, breeder will spawn them again if agro'd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Slithinknott</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I heard ph i thought he could spawn from a number of the mobs there if he got a ph what is the exact loc of them please.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Elkar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">The first post in this thread gives the EXACT location of the PH.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Hemlocc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">would you have to train the spawns all the way to zone? i was thinking about taking them over that first bridge and fding them off too the left of it where there is a little open space...<br />
<br />
also the guild i am in is pre-ep think i would need 2 groups to pull this off? oh and 1 last thing...<br />
<br />
i was confused about everyone saying once the adds are trained off he is easily singled. i assumed this meant that the room he pops in that is full of murkgliders is empty when pulled? or do the other murkgliders not assist him?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Elkar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">It probably only take until about when you are over the bridge to pop all the spawns, so yes you could then FD, assuming you had time to cast.<br />
<br />
He is easily singled even if in a full spawn room.  Only 1 or 2 adds come with him, and they tend to reset faster than the Breeder, so any decent FD puller can split him old school.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Lynxal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Everyone that says this is an easy single group camp and a gimp enoucnter is full of it.  The area you are camping is an easy single group camp.  So you drag a group there for crud experience and the potential of a named wasting a lot of people's time for an epic that they won't consider necessary....and then get creamed by the breeder.<br />
<br />
Even single he's way harder for a 6 person group than everyone makes it sound.  You will be either short healing, or short DPS with just 6 and an SK tanking for the large majority of SKs.<br />
<br />
With 1 cleric and 1 shaman, they couldn't keep me up long enough...the cleric was oom at 50%.  With another cleric maybe but I think it would have taken 1 more cleric and one more DPS class to squeek it out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Elkar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Well, I think you have to consider the groups.  For those like yours or mine, sure its 2-3 groups.  For others, Time or GoD geared, its a lot less.  Nothing new there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Cryptia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">This camp is bullshit.<br />
<br />
I feel bad for the guildies that help me, and after last night I doubt anyone will again. Crap exp, too long of a run. The majority of people on EQ nowadays aren't used to running through a few zones to get somewhere. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Nasiir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I felt really lucky when my exp group moved into RC to help me clear the PH. Actually, I found that the exp wasn't horrid, although it is all relative. I managed to get the Breeder to pop, then rallied enough guildies to help me drop him.<br />
<br />
We set up near the back of the tunnel. Cleared everything, including the entire Breeder room. Got the named to pop for extra goodies. We aggroed the Breeder during the clear a few times and had to clear a few babies. Once dead, the Breeder must immediately able to pop out more spawn, because when it was kited, shortly after having killed a spawn, we were able to get 6 to pop out. We had a monk kite the Breeder around the room until all 6 spawns had popped, then ran into the far hall and FD (fd wasn't working so well, so he just took the death). Then waited for the Breeder to wander back into the room (first try got a roamer and healers weren't set to heal MA, only had 1 tank, so we wiped, second time it went super smooth), pulled it to the hallway, burnt it down. We had roughly 3 groups of people (3 healers, 2 knights, 2 bards, a chanter, etc), many of which were boxed, all 65+.<br />
<br />
Now, on to the next steps...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Lynxal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Well, I think you have to consider the groups.  For those like yours or mine, sure its 2-3 groups.  For others, Time or GoD geared, its a lot less.  Nothing new there.<br />
<br />
That's fine if you want to make it a 3 group encounter for the people the 1.5 is actually intended to be an upgrade for.  However, when it's a trivial exp camp for 6 people for sub standard experience but then you need to call in reinforcements...that is not right.  Either have it on a spawn time and or make it single groupable by the people that can handle the camp area.<br />
<br />
The named in that zone are a dirty dirty trick.  They spawn without killing PHs and patrol the farking bridge and path.  The ukun fleshhunter sees through everything (rogues should be pissed), casts an AE on agro and knocks the invis off everyone  within 100 yards, then proceeds to rape everyone for 2500/hit.  All of a sudden there is a named on the path to murkgliders and it won't leave the bridge.  Then to make it worse the LoS on the run sucks cause you are either running up hill or down hill and the farking thing is in a blindspot over or at the base of a ridge.  You can't send anyone to scout because the majority of the time if they see it you are agro.  Escape won't work for a rogue unless you are at max agro range and escaped and backed up out of range, or right after you escape it reacquires you and attacks.<br />
<br />
Then after all your work an uber group just walks in and runs by to take the spawn from you after you do all the work because you are struggling with fewer numbers and working on creative solutions...it's a poorly handled camp when the people camping to spawn it can't handle the named.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Lynxal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">aye:) I just think the roaming named in the zone are mean.  There is that murk named (soulsipper I think) that sits along the main path up to statue too that also sees through everything and procs to break your invis.<br />
<br />
The ukun is an issue if you are trying to kite outside or run to zone though...it wanders into the clearing outside murk tunnel and the first time I went to kite outside he ganked me.<br />

We ended up kiting inside and it worked better not having to worry about him.</div></div><hr />

The other two in the group are a rogue and a bard, equally geared.  And I suck at botting no less.<br />
<br />
It wasn't an easy fight by any means, but I trained the 6 babies away just like everyone says to do (took two runs to zone), died once when babies warped on me, and then pulled the Breeder single.  We have no gear higher than elemental level except for Pradera's newly acquired epic, which she didn't have at the time.  So it definitely doesn't require Time+ gear for a single group to be able to do it.  Oh, and we were all 66 at the time.</div></div><hr />

Ended up running through the caves backwards, west to east, aggroing the Breeder first. We had previously cleared a spot at the bottom of the last set of steps to use as the fight spot. Anyways, I stopped running at the opening by the bridge and FD'd. This got rid of 3 of the 6 spawns. Breeder repopped alone, group pulled and engaged back at the fight spot. Only had to mez the other 3 while rest of group burned down the Breeder. I waited for the 2 minute marker, invis'd, and ran back to join the fun. Killed, looted, got the hell out of that miserable place.</div></div><hr />

the second time i asked if i could join i wanted to see how the fight went down ..anyway ..we wiped first try . tryed to take the breeder an the spawns toe to toe had two enchanters an bard  but it didnt work ..got a few more people an bard faded a few of the spawns an killed it pretty easy i think we had 4 spawns  during fight. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Darkmourn D`Estrellas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">It is not on any kind of timer by the way, even though I've heard all kinds of speculation, 9 hours, 24 hours, etc.  After I killed it, it respawned again.  It's just a ph mob like normal.  Makes camping Deathstinger a pain I have to say.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Tyrs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Thank you for clarifying that Darkmourn, It did not spawn on its own after those supposed 24 hours for me so it must be on a ph.!</div></div><hr />

Its pretty fast something like 15 min maybe 20 iv pulled Tons of PH's an thats one thing i like about the camp the spawns come pretty fast.  it probably wouldnt seem as fast if i had group out there but have been duoing with shammy every chance i get an it seems i barely make pull ontime on Creeper(breeder PH)  before static spawns come.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Jouen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">Its 20 minutes. And this is proving to be the worst part of the epic for me. I have camped this thing for hours(at least a full day alltoghether)...and no pop.  It sucks balls that i can go into almost any oow zone and see named mobs repop almost non-stop. But the one needed for an epic pops so rare. Not to mention that it bottle necks the other sk's on the server waiting for the drop as well.  Wish I could at least go kill the other sk's or something but they want be triggered out of order, so I am stuck  :mad:</div></div><hr />
