<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>rhintrah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all, my first character was a de sk and after a year or so of playing, i've decided to come back to the sk class.   My question is, since I split my points between str and dex as casters realm originally suggested and didn't put any into sta, should I, at level 36, reroll and put it all into sta, or will I be able to compensate for this sta deficiency with upcoming gear?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Skurrge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">castersrealm is simply brain-dead if they suggest no STA points.  I'd just keep what you have and keep plowing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Pimedus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">basically depends on how fast you can get to 36 imo, the starting points aren't really THAT important, but if you can get to 36 again in a day and get it right, why not. i personally might not bother, altho dex for sk.../sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lejina Bloodbath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I put all my starting points in str (90 str naked!).<br />
<br />
I think ive been an &quot;ok&quot; SK regardless.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh and in regard to the dex. The SKs are one of the few classes who are virtually always buffed with an imbued proc (Vampiric Embrace, Shroud of Death, Shroud of Chaos). While not being great, this is still far from being a worthless stat for a SK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Polite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Stamina is an important stat for an SK that will be tanking in groups often.<br />
<br />
 Dex is actually a very nice stat to have if you solo often because it will affect your proc rates with vampiric embrace and mental corruption spells.<br />
<br />
 If starting over would be a hassle than i wouldnt recommend it because gear will determine your stats more than anything in the long run ;)</div></div><hr />
