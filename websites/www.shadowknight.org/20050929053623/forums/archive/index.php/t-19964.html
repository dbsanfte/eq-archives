Used it on a bard while in pov. The Doppelganger raptured, tashed, rooted,  crippled, weakened, and insanity'd the bard, it also made a pet. I used it in GD and it charmed a giant that was attacking me, of course after 60sec it gated out. At the first level it has 500hp.<br />
<br />
Very effective in pvp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wonder if it will slow mobs. Might be interesting to see. The problem is though that he is also casting and landing some spells that could also wipe a raid, like root...<br />
<br />
Anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Saveaux</div><div class="date">02-13-2004, 01:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've haven't tested it yet, but I've heard that if the Enc is pulling and end's up training, lets say in an ldon, the enc can use the Doppelganger to get aggro, after the Doppelganger is killed the enc has no aggro on it. Like I said, I've only heard this.<br />
<br />
On another note, Udaeeleos used the Doppelganger on another sk(Dhantes), and Dhantes killed it with about one swing. I would definately say go for the Doppelganger first if an enc uses it while in pvp. Of course determining which one is the Doppelganger poses a partial problem....</div></div><hr />
