If you're not tanking, Shielding is kind of useless. FT is the only thing that is 99% of the time in use.</div></div><hr />

Conservation foci go above FT, all others go below it.  Tanking or pulling, it's how you survive damage that counts.  If you want DPS, reroll as a DPS class.<br />
<br />
Edit:  If pulling, Stun Resist is marginally useful when it kicks in, but you cant count on it, or even count on getting it high enough to matter more than Avoidance.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kemora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I'm surprised pretty much everyone ranked shielding as being higher then avoidance. I've always felt that avoiding a hit completely was better then being hit for less. Then again, there's not a whole lot of avoidance items out there compared to shielding, and avoidance has a pretty low cap iirc.<br />
<br />
Spell shielding is... nice to have, I guess, but I don't think I'd ever spend dkp just to get spell shielding. I can't say I really notice a difference between when I had none and what I have now... as a previous poster said, its better to just plain resist! :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
That logic always astounds me.  It comes up every time someone asks the good ole &quot;ID vs LR&quot; question...<br />
<br />
Avoidance doesn't make you avoid X% of attacks, and shielding doesn't make you take less damage on X% of attacks... Avoidance adds a number to your avoidance AC, shielding removes a percentage of the mob's Damage Bonus, lowering its max damage and DPS.  (For the record: In the case of the AA's, they both reduce damage intake by a given [equal] percentage.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Naraz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">all the good avoidance items are for leather classes hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I've always felt that avoiding a hit completely was better then being hit for less.<br />
<br />
SK's avoid the least % of attacks of all melee classes (going to count stun as avoidence there since well, you do avoid the mob attacking, if you don't count stuns though Pal's equal us in stucktacular avoidence).  While the same is true for any tank it's most true for us:  You're going to be hit... alot.  Would you rather get hit for quad 1500's and be missed 4/10 swings or make those hits not hurt and get hit for quad 1000's and be missed 3/10 swings?  Not to mention that mitigation is less streaky than avoidence and taking more steady damage is much much much more important than taking less total damage.  The more predictable your damage intake is the better you can be healed, taking a constant 500 dps is much better than taking 300-700 dps per mob.  You have the same average dps intake either way but you're a better tank with more mitigation over avoidence.<br />
<br />
Bottom line, take smaller hits not less.  You'll do 1000x better.  The few rare crazy high db low di mobs there are in the game (which are all raid mobs) you can just tank with an avoidence class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Qoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Lets take blazzax for e.g how much would be his max hit?<br />
Lets say he has a damage bonus of 100. And i have 5% shielding..so his dps would drop to 95?<br />
But i feel damage bonus is too minimal an impact to making us surive longer when tanking a 3K hitting mobs even with 10% shielding..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">You're not looking at the big picture.  Let's take a 600/75 1 groupable named mob (675 min 2100 max) which if I remember right is pretty close to what Jhiru was in his original form.  With high AC and atk debuffs you'll be taking about a DI6 as your average hit so 1050 average hit.  Since it's not unreasonable to expect 10% shielding on a tank (any Qvic+ SK should be hitting 15% without trying if they've got gear, 10% is quite doable on a Time SK).  You'll reduce that average hit to 990, this is a 5% decrease in damage intake which on it's own is good.  What happens during a spike though since afterall it's not being 1 rounded that kills a tank (usually), it's a string of bad rounds that kills a tank.  Shielding will reduce the impact of that worst case scenario because you simply can't be nailed as hard.  If a mob has a low DB (Quarm, some GoD stuff, etc...) you're not going to get as much of an impact out of shielding.  The more AC you have the more shieldings going to be helping you too since it's reducing that damage that you can't mitigate, which as the mobs average DI gets lower and lower makes up more and more of your damage intake.<br />
<br />
Like everything in EQ its all incremental upgrades, 1% shielding isn't going to turn you into the worlds best tank but its a worthwhile increase when you consider the AC/HP the item adds to you as well.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the info.<br />
<br />
I'm one of the people who think that when an aa says &quot;This ability further increases your chance of completely avoiding incoming melee damage,&quot; that it can't possibly not mean what it says. <br />
<br />
But, then it all turns my stomach when I realize I have no idea how much benefit I will gain, and can't begin to form a valid opinion about the matter without either finding someone else who's parsed returns on these abilities, or take the plunge and dump AAs or DKP on abilities or items with them.<br />
<br />
I think all &quot;immersion&quot; arguments fall apart at the point where to even KNOW what you are gaining, if anything, you have to either use outside software to analyze logs, or do the analysis painstakingly manually. <br />
<br />
This shit should be in an instruction book somewhere.</div></div><hr />

The conventional wisdom from virtually all of the EP-geared players that I know is there are only two things that matter to a melee in PoP and beyond:<br />

1. HP<br />
2. AC<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">You're going to be hit either way though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>frotty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Yes, as was succinctly said previously:<br />
<br />
If you get hit 80% of the time, reducing that to 75% *MIGHT NOT BE* as good as saying &quot;all hits are softer.&quot;<br />
<br />
This is because without the exact numbers (which have been presented above with those far more informed than most) it's easy to mistake what is better by assuming unlikely scenarios.<br />
<br />
When you have the exact numbers, it's obvious which is better: getting hit softer, since we are hit so damn frequently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Rueeliar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Shielding is an obvious, visible, and very easily computable decrease in the damage you take.  We're talking about GoD, where there are mobs coded to have ludicrously high hit rates (yellow con kyvs in KT some months back over 90 percent accuracy against me).  High DPS can be compensated for with increased healing and healthy liberality in the use of DI.  Spikes are what kill people, and have been for a long time.  Shielding guarantees the softening of spikes, dropping the ceiling on your &quot;worst case scenario&quot; rounds.  Avoidance decreases the probability of such a situation.<br />
<br />
Distance focus?  Erm... people still pull with spells?</div></div><hr />
