<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Defen Shortlittlelegs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i need some help with the Soulfiend Lance quest, does anyone have a walk- though i can use?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, I did a search, because I thought I remembered someone posting a walk through when I first started on this quest, but apparently I'm suffering from early onset senility or something, because it's not there.<br />
<br />
Here is a basic walk through from what I remember.<br />
<br />
1) Get your Paineel faction up to at least Amiable.<br />
<br />
2) Get a &quot;Grimy Lance&quot; from the spiritualist at the spawn point at the tip of the island in the Feerrott.<br />
<br />
3) Head to Stonebrunt.  Find the Kejekan city near the middle of the zone.  Facing out from the front gate of the city, turn right about 45-60 degrees and run straight out.  Not far from the city you will find a red wisp looking mob that is named &quot;a weak spirit&quot; or something like that.<br />
<br />
4) Hand your Grimy Lance to the &quot;a weak spirit&quot;.  He will despawn and respawn as an erudite model ghost, and will give you a &quot;totem of Cazic Thule&quot; or some such. He will then wander off in the direction of the Kejekan village.<br />
<br />
5) Run back to the village, head through the front gate, hang a left and run to the corner.  You will see a hut in front of you.  Drop invis and creep up on the wall of the hut until you aggro the named mob in there.  He will be Disciple something or other.  He is a shaman, so he'll be casting on you, and you'll probably aggro others as well.  Back yourself into the corner and wait for them to come.  Kill them as quickly as possible, and make sure that none of them run off to chain aggro others.  Loot the bodies and re-invis.  <br />
<br />
6) Go around to the front of the hut and go inside.  The Riddosan ghost will be standing in the center of the room.  Try and position yourself as far from the left over mobs in the hut as possible, drop invis and hand the &quot;totem of Cazic Thule&quot; back to Riddosan.  He will give you the Soulfiend Lance and despawn.  If you have managed not to aggro anything else, reinvis and head out of the village to some more civilized area.  If you did aggro something, you're probably better off to try and run out of the village and FD or take the death.  Try not to die in the village, as your Lesser Summon Corpse spell only works up to lvl 35, and it was a shocker to me when I did this quest (and died).<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.  Sorry I couldn't provide you with exact names or locations, but it's been a long time since I did this quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jackkal Darknite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Riddosan Ghost is only around for like a minute or 2.<br />
<br />
Make sure that once you kill the named one you are in the position to quickly do the turn in.<br />
<br />
I cleared the entrance while waiting for a wizzy friend to come help (both of us was in our 30's back then)<br />
Then I chain aggroed the hut bringing everything outside of town.<br />
Rooted the one I wanted then aggro kited the rest until they were dead. med &amp; healed up then took down the named. Ran back in town and did the turn in. By then they were starting to repop so I had to beat feet out and FD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Carshail Shel'rac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Disciple Okeote or similar and he's a monk.<br />
The spirit looks like a red wisp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bloodmere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Invis before you enter the village, target okarote and run outside again. From outside the pallisade cast clinging darkness to get okarote outside the village and alone. Kill him, loot, re-invis, run up to riddossan and drop invis, give him the drop and run like hell from all the adds (sow is handy here)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>LaBlade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The spirit is undead, so you can use sense undead to find him. He's not always up, but he's a short respawn. I want to say 1 or 2 hours, but it's been awhile.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Defen Shortlittlelegs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Paineel faction? what do i need to kill to raise that, i did a search to find mobs that i need but couldn't find any.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Paradox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Slaughter Kobolds in the Warrens for Paineel faction.  You'll need it for your Epic anyway, so kill two birds...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Defen Shortlittlelegs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">paineel key, is there anyway i can quest the key? or do i get acces when i become highest faction with them?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jackkal Darknite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Need faction for Paineel key</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>ZaithFV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Slaughter Kobolds for about 2 or 3 days. I got my lance and I love it dearly. Great for soloin. That leach spell is great...but I did it when I was around 25 or so. When I actually did the quest, I had a bard friend play thier faction song to get the quest started. After a few rather...rough encounters with the kejekans, we got my lance. I'd bring a group, depending on level. If your in your 40s, you shouldnt have a problem. 30 or so, bring some friends<br />
<br />
but you have to have your faction up for that. Kill the King kobold and just slaughter EVERYTHING in the Warrens for a dayish.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zeixxs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I did the quest twice, its nice and easy<br />
<br />
Get the grimy lance (in bazaar u can find it easily and its cheap)<br />
<br />
Give it to the spirit who is far from always up<br />
<br />
give the idol the spirit gave u to the ghost of riddossan<br />
<br />
before u could target the disciple invis, go outside of fort and pull him alone to u. But now i m not sure about it.<br />
Disciple was cake solo at lvl 35 (just make pet, arm him and buff yourself up)<br />
Going to the fort uninvis will get u killed, FD doesn t work all the time becaus many of the locals r druids and nuked my 55 SK for about 130HP sevearl times.<br />
I dunno if turning the idol invis would work at all<br />
<br />
Riddossan runs to kill the disciple when u give him the lance, but all he kills is a couple of mobs standing in hais way. He kills no kerrans and isn t KOS to them either (so is his ghost).<br />
<br />
Paineel faction is needed (amiable if i remember correctly)<br />
Slaughtering kobolds is VERY long and boring, 2 advice :<br />
1 - kill the highest lvl kobolds their faction hits r bigger than the low lvl kobolds (guards r like lvl 4 !) so the king and high shaman r the best bet.<br />
2 - as soon as u r non KOS to paineel (i think dubious is enough but not sure) switch to the kobold tooth quest (u ll find details in allkhazam) just give some kobold molar to a guy in the paineel city, the faction hits are very nice and u ll be amiable very quickly (also u ll gain some rigmail u can sell for a lil pp bonus !)<br />
<br />
here, u should be fine. GL brother !!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Drakang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Can actually do the molar quest as soon as you are non kos by hitting your hide hotkey as soon as you hand in the molar(old UI) or just hand in and hide (new UI).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>ZaithFV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">By the way, the kobolds swarm. All of em were greenies to me at 25 and the king was dark blue I think. But when you have 25 kobolds whacking on you, it starts to become a problem. Course, if your 30 just FD. <br />
<br />
Dirty forkin kobolds almost killed me a few times..stupid swarms</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Chozzen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Did this quest tonight. It may have been overkil at 44 but it's a neat little weapon nonetheless, and I enjoy collecting SK only weapons as well so it was worth it. <br />
<br />
A good bulk of the time was spent in outside CZ waiting for the ritualist to spawn. 3 Radients, 2 silverbacks later. Tada. Me and pet take him down. Get the lance (and a decayed BP too!) and off to Stonebrunt I went. <br />
<br />
The spirit &quot;can&quot; be found using Sense Undead. <br />
<br />
Handed the Lance in. Invised back up to the city and ran in. Entered the first building on the left and targeted the mob. <br />
<br />
Ran back outside and darknessed him from outside the city wall. He did come alone though it did take him sometime to get out. <br />
<br />
Max he hits for was 80ish. Not terrible. Dark/Tap/DoT and when he tries to run the steep hill will halt his progress.  Kill him. Loot.<br />
<br />
Reinvised. Invised. Ran back inside the city and back into the same building. If there is any confusion. Its the Erudite Ghost with the Skeleton pet you want to hand the Idol into. :P<br />
<br />
Uninvised. Handed the Idol. Got the Lance and hauled ass outta there, took me a minute to realize I didnt have any mobs after me. :)<br />
<br />
Sorry for the ramshackle nature of this post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Stugein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Thats sort of how it worked for me.  I was kind of surprised because of all the horror stories I had heard about these cats swarming.  I did the quest at L38 or 39.  They were all &quot;glowers&quot; at me so I didn't bother invis'ing.  Walked in, speared the Disciple, ran out through the front gate.  Only the Disciple came (even though him and I passed by at least a couple other blues on our way out).  When I got outside the city I think I actually feign'd just in case, but there was no need.  Pummeled the Disciple, looted.  All the cats were still glowers at me (!) so I just walked back in (not-invis) and did the turn-in for the lance.  I was happy it all went so smoothly, but kind of disappointed in the lack of...action I guess you would say, after reading other peoples' accounts of this endeavor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Defen Shortlittlelegs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">thank for the info guy, im L38 right now, so it should be pretty easy, even tho i am dubious to paineel guards can i still do the quest? im just too lazy to work faction at this point, with the darkforge armour that im questing now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Hatre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Unfortunately the &quot;a spirit&quot; will not accept the grimy lance from you at dubious, or he might but hell just eat it on you and not spawn riddosan's spirit.  Not confirmed it but i believe you need amiable or better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Defen Shortlittlelegs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">might as well do it, im going to ned the faction for my epic, might as well get the small things out of the way. thanks for the info</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>ZaithFV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">He will eat the lance if you are dubious, he did for me. I think you can do the quest at indiff..maybe not. I forget what my bard friend conned the spirit at when she handed the lance in for the idol.</div></div><hr />
