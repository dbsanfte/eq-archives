2/3rds of Neriak (SK guild will KoS you, ironically) and most of Qeynos and Freeport (avoid Pally guilds and wandering druids/rangers).<br />
<br />
Trolls and Ogres will try to eat you if I recall correctly. Erudites, I'm not too sure about as I've not gone to paineel to try my luck.<br />

  Certainly you should make sure you are correct before you correct someone.  You didn't and you were corrected for your mistake.   Look around a while and you'll be grateful for such a gentle reminder.  Klax even said please!</div></div><hr />

Now that we were forced to move to Neriak (thanks a lot, game designers, grrrr), was the faction of the trolls changed to TrollsOfNeriak (troll guards in Neriak)?<br />
If not, a lot of people have to be very carefully exploring Neriak Foreign Quarter.</div></div><hr />
