<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jastrebi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I apologize in advance if this subject has been talked about before but I didn't see anything. What I would like to know is what towns would I have the best chance of gaining faction with as an Iksar SK and how would I get good faction with them. I have never played a class that was hated most places before and so am kinda new to this aspect of the game. I would really like to get Paineel and DE faction. Please give any advice you have.

Paineel faction is *incredibly* easy to get for any race/class/religion combo. After a few hours of AOEing my TUNARE worshipping druid was able to hit amiable status (I did that for two reasons: sheer boredom and to help my SK get out of f#&amp;king Paineel because the last two teleporters don't work). On the flip side I confuse the hell out of newbies when I decide to make an appearance.<br />
<br />
I recommend gaining a few levels first (like at least get to level 30-45). If you hunt in The Warrens for a few hours one-shotting MOBs you'll be amiable in no time. You could do this before those levels, but you'll have to chase them down to land the killing blow when their hitpoints drop (everything runs). You can also collect teeth and do the molar quest in Paineel to get quicker faction boosts, but I didn't bother with it. I got to dubious in less than an hour and hit amiable rather quickly (I focused on killing the named kobolds in there instead of what I was initially doing... which was just killing everything in sight).<br />
<br />
Freeport is also fairly easy faction. There are two ways to get faction... quick and dirty or drawn out but more extensive.<br />
<br />
Quick and dirty: This will only work if wolf form still positively affects faction with the FP Militia. Have someone give you wolf form and turn in deathfist slashed belts to Captain Hazran in West Freeport. I think it takes 50-60 belts to get to amiable. This will raise faction with the Freeport Militia and some merchants, but you have to be careful and con everything, as there are a number of different factions in each zone.<br />
<br />
Drawn out version: Head to Highhold Pass and slaughter gnolls and/or orcs, amassing stack after stack of orc and/or gnoll scalps. Once you hit apprehensive or higher faction with the Highhold Pass guards you can start turning in scalps to the two different NPCs (the orc one is on the orc side, and the gnoll one on the gnoll side). This will raise factions with a *number* of factions in HHP, Qeynos, and Freeport, without lowering any. That being said, it is also time consuming. Read on...<br />
<br />
After you are done factioning in HHP you can go into the keep area and hunt goblins.. they are in your level range I think. You can also turn in goblin ears to a different NPC to get even more boosts to the above factions. You then have the option of going to East Commonlands and slaughtering orcs. This will boost your Knights of Truth (FP paladin guild) faction. You'll then have bank access in Freeport. Killing orcs there will also raise your Guardians of the Vale (halfling warrior guild) faction. However, don't ever expect to be able to safely walk through Rivervale.<br />
<br />
As far as Neriak, you may be able to raise Dark Bargainers faction, as I think they start out non-KOS to all races. There is a necro (Lokar To'biath) in Neriak 3rd Gate you can turn red wine into to get positive faction with DB, Dread Guard Inner, and Dread Guard Outer. I don't know of any easy ways to raise the SK/necro factions, and I don't know what starting faction you have with them (I assume KOS).<br />
<br />
I hope this helps.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jobrill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">A Couple more points on raising faction.<br />
<br />
In Freeport, another method of raising faction is the rogue note quests. If you make a level 1 Human Rogue Mule, you can have him go talk to one of the Guild Trainers under the docks, a female dark elf who's name I forget. She will give you a note to give to Rebby, a Halfling by the Monks guild. Give it to Rebby, He will give you a stackable &quot;Rebby's Rat Whisker&quot;<br />
<br />
Get about 2 backpacks worth of these, mule em over to your Iksar SK, and turn em in (I think Wolf Form works for that, not sure, my Iksar Monk friend used sneak to do it). This'll up faction with Rogues, Freeport Militia, and Freeport Merchants with no negatives.<br />
<br />
Also, in Rivervale, I am not completely sure if it works, But I know that on my lightie chars, I have occassional done a Misty Thicket quest wherein one can turn in a Bandage to Joogl Honeybugger and get +Faction with every Rivervale faction except Clerics. However, I am not sure if this can be done while you are KoS to Joogl, AND It does put down your Dark Elf Guard faction (Although this can be negated with red wine)<br />
<br />
In Freeport, as an Erudite I was able to turn in Muffins to Pandos Flintside (Dwarf on the second floor of Hog Caller Inn), which gave a lot of factions up to Faydwer Elves and only put down Crushbone faction, However, He was green to me (At 44) and conned threateningly and kept attacking me if I wasn't quick about handing in muffins, so it might be hard for an Iksar to accomplish.<br />
<br />
Also, one more Faction Rumor I have not had the personal time to confirm, but some people have told me you can turn in Polar Bear Skins to Cindl in Halas even at bottom faction for faction raises with most of Halas. Not had a chance to check this out tho.<br />
<br />
Also, on Raising Inkie SK faction, You can kill High Elves. For lowbies, there should be some High Elves near the Neriak wizard spires if I remember right. One of the easier ways to do it tho is to kill the High Elf Enchanter in Najena. I forget her name, she is a prisoner there somewhere tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Akeikyl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">First off your already lvl 25 so unless you can gain exp getting faction somewhere I wouldnt worry to much about faction hunting. With Luclin you can bank in the Bazaar, Shadow Haven, Echo Caverns, Fungus Grove and Shar Val. PoK also has a bank and allows you fast access to almost anywhere. In Velious all races are intially non kos to the Coldain so you can bank there and also in Crystal Caverns right away with no faction work. You can also train and buy spells in PoK and Echo Caverns. So unless you can gain exp while working on faction it's not really worth the effort.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Warmaster Xsavuung Llaahh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">For an Iksar, there is one reason to get faction; quests. If you don't need to do a quest in that particular city, DON'T GET FACTION THERE. THere are SOOOO many places where you can bank and re-supply now, that the faction issue with Iksar is a moot point. From level 1 - 30, you can stay one or two zones away from Cabilis. From 30-50 you can go to Velious and bank in Thurgadin. Thurg is apprehensive to start. But the Giants, at least outside Kael, are threateningly but don't attack you unless you kill one (just takes one) because we worship a similar god. If you decide to go to Luclin, you can go to Echo Caverns, Fungus grove, or Shadow Haven. And, like others have said, if you have PoP you can always go to PoK to bank. <br />
<br />
Part of being Iksar is having people hate you. Let them hate you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lizarde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Originally posted by jastrebi <br />
What I would like to know is what towns would I have the best chance of gaining faction with as an Iksar SK and how would I get good faction with them. <br />
The only town I worked up faction in was Neriak.  All you need is two backpacks full of red wine, and someone to invis you in and out.  You head to the zone that is furthest in (3rd gate?) and find an NPC named Lothar.  He is in a room in a library of some kind.<br />
<br />
He will /con indifferent, even to an Iksar SK.  Start turning in the wine 16 at a time (or four at a time, people are saying that you can no longer hand in four stacks of four at a time).  By the time you empty the second bag, you will be warmly/ally to the merchants and dubious to the inner and outer guards.<br />
<br />
You will still be KOS to some factions in Neriak, including the warrior and cleric guild.  I think that the guards in 3rd gate are on cleric faction, which is why I'd advise getting an invis on your way out.  The warrior guild is in the same zone as the bank, but it is out of the way and not in your path to the bank, and I've never been attacked by them even though I am KOS.<br />
<br />
There is one guard near the soul binder who is on warrior faction, but he is low level and should be green to you at 25.  If he is green he doesn't attack unless you're sitting down.  If he DOES attack, he is easily dispatched and the other guards will not assist him.<br />
<br />
However . . .<br />
<br />
With there being a PoP portal in Nektulos forest now, as well as in Freeport and Qeynos, I don't think I'd even bother getting Neriak faction.  The Qeynos/Freeport portals are out of the way of danger, and thus easy to use for an Iksar SK.  The Neriak portal would require you to get past some low level guards.  If you don't want that hassle, just wipe out the halfling camps in the zone a few times and you should be dubious/indifferent to the outer guards, and they'll leave you alone.<br />
<br />
Once you have PoP, faction concerns become almost zero.  Once you have PoP and level 30 (FD/invis), faction concerns become zero.  You have access to training, merchants, and banks in the Plane of Knowledge and Echo Caverns.  You have access to banks and merchants in Shadow Haven, the bazaar, and Shar Vahl.  Heck, with PoP you have easy access to Cabilis, as well.<br />
<br />
Faction became much less of a concern with Luclin portals, and pretty much became no concern at all with PoP.  The only exception would be as someone mentioned, if you want to do a quest or help a friend with a quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>jastrebi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thank you all for your advice. I was able to raise my faction with Paineel last night from threatening to dubious by killing kobolds (and yes they were a pain in the neck with all that running!) I now have 6 backpacks full of kobold molars. <br />
<br />
I had completely forgotten about the wine quest in neriak. One question though, does the &quot;invis before clicking ok on the give window&quot; trick still work?<br />
<br />
Last question: Is there any way to gain Overthere faction short of killing 9000 of the various mobs that give it?<br />
<br />
I run my SK with a very good friend's character and so sometimes I have time to kill until they log on. I figure faction is a good way to spend that time: be able to go into different cities, possibly get some small coin, don't have to spend hours at a forge getting &quot;tradeskill arthritis&quot; :)<br />
<br />
Thank you all once again for your input.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Akeikyl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You can no longer turn in 4 stacks of 4 on wines they (broke) fixed that. You can only turn in 1 in each slot now for 4 faction hits per turn in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jobrill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The only mobs that outright give Overthere faction are the big boss dragons of Kunark, i.e. Sevrillious, Gorenaire, etc.<br />
<br />
If you want Overthere faction, yer gonna hafta get a few Million Sarnark Berzerker braids, get an Enchanter to cast a non-kos Illussion on you (Erudite for example, Dark Elf would prolly work too, as should Earth Elemental), and turn in 4 braids at a time to Captain Rottgrime while praying thier enough to make you non KOS in Iksar form.<br />
<br />
That, or get some Puppet Strings from Fear (They have charges of Charm on em), have an Ench Tash the Undead Foreman, Charm the Foreman, turn in a jade to get your hammer, and fuggedabout Overthere faction permanently. Bunch of pansies aligning with some silly Lizard Ghost anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jounar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The only old world faction Iv ever done have been in Painell just to make the epic quest easier. Velious and Luclin and now PoP really change the way that faction is viewed by any race.<br />
<br />
As for your original request, spend a few hours killing in the Warrens to get in cosy with the Coneheads in Painell and slaughter assling's like mad in Neriak Forrest to get in nice and tight with the DE guards and then do wine quest untill you reach the faction you seek.</div></div><hr />

I had completely forgotten about the wine quest in neriak. One question though, does the &quot;invis before clicking ok on the give window&quot; trick still work? <br />
I believe it does, but it makes no difference.  The quest NPC is not KOS to you, he is indifferent from the start.  And he is alone in the room, and there is no one else close enough to aggro.  My Iksar SK went in there and dropped invis, and handed in the wine, and didn't get aggro from anyone.<br />
<br />
I just made sure to invis on the way out, in order to avoid the guards around the cleric guild.<br />
<br />
Edit- I guess I'd forgotten that I had worked up faction in paineel as well, in order to run seals in case I decided to work on my epic.  That one was even simpler than the one in Neriak- kill every kobold you find in the warrens, and after a while the paineel people like you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Chozzen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">This was posted in another thread not too long ago. I dunno if there is any faction difference between a Monk and a SK (wouldn't think so) but if you want to take on some faction challenges just to do em. This lays out what you have to accomplish. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>jastrebi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Thanks for all the advice! I am now amiable in paineel and dubious to dreadguard outer. Im going to wait until level 30 when I get gather shadows to do the wine quest. Thank you all for your help.<br />
As I was going through all the work to raise my faction I became less interested in what it could do for me and more interested in how and if I could pull it off. I dunno simple minds, simple pleasures!! :D <br />
