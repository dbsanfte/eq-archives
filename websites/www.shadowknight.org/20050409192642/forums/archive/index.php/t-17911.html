<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kromglon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I been in a few groups that freak out over smacking victims. However I ran a couple over the weekend and I stated anyone object to smacking the victims. Needless to say holy shit. Maybe at higher levels they aint worth the effort. But at lower levels  I would say a good percentage of the victims seem to be filled with goodness. Ive seen them almost regen all the mana of the entire group and heal the entire group. I hit some that gave good xp and donated themselves as a pet for a group member. In the 30's the worst Ive seen is them spawning 4 spiders which you pretty much slaughter in a minute anyways.<br />
<br />
Seem to be worth it anyways at the lower levels.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kromglon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ya, screw chests. Are those things even survivable? I seen 3 people drop in a fucken second from some poison.</div></div><hr />

 I seen 3 people drop in a fucken second from some poison.  <br />
<br />
That was my group yesterday.  Got hit by an AE rain poison spell from a chest some moron in the group hit.<br />
<br />
Funny part was, I was right about to ask the chanty to pacify my target so I could pull when I died.  I thought I got too close and ate like 12 harm touches.<br />
<br />
Then I saw the chest message...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i love chests, me and a friend have a game... if its a rogue pickable lock we open it (the trap means shit), if it isnt we smash it and 50% of the time its not trapped anyways... screw spending 10pp on opening them though if it isnt rogue, atleast in normal in hards we spend the plat</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kromglon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I need to learn more about them then. Without getting the whole group splattered. Maybe after a mission Ill screw with them. Problem is in the 20's 30, no one has the points for the spells to disarm or whatever the hell they do. Aint been a glutton of rogues LFG either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dakkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hitting all the victims at high levels means killing a couple of dozen extra mobs, in threes, which can easily make the difference between success and running out of time.<br />
<br />
I've noticed that in groups where people are firm about this, the reckless types are much less likely to start hitting victims when they get frustrated or bored with constant killing.<br />
<br />
Given they often do this without warning (and in a chain pulling high level LDoN group unless you call a break for it, hitting a victim usually means popping 3 mobs on the group in the middle of a pull or a fight), it's understandable that people rip them up about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ramgar SK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Every time someone askes to whack a victim, I veto it, unless we are half done and ahead on time.<br />
<br />
I always veto chests until after completion.  Three times now I've been killed by chests, and once we got 10 gold.  The risk to reward is not there.  If you don't want to risk a chest after completion, you have the option to zone out and take a pass on the loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kromglon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ya, at higher levels things are less forgiving time wise.  I guess it will get to the point smacking the victims wont be worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>AislinSteele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I like to screw with chests after a run. If anyone wants to stay and see what happens, they can, if not I tell them to bail and give a few mins to do so. So far, I got 2 chests. 1 I died from, the other I was blind drunk and stupid for an hour. But it was fun as Hell<br />
<br />
The victims I have a simple policy on (might make a hotkey for this)...<br />
<br />
/g NBG looting. Healer get whacked on secondary melee plays protector. Hit a victim once I call you stupid, twice and I kill you or FD. Do something excessively stupid and you're out a tank (and at my level I'm usually MT)<br />
<br />
It tends to work well. Nowadays I only fail when some dumbshit spazzes</div></div><hr />
