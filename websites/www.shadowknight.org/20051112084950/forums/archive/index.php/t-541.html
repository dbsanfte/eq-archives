I play on sullon so I'm really looking for a weapon thats a good mix of pvp/pve.  I've been leaning towards Rocksmasher, just because of the ruthless dmg/delay, and the dragon haste on it.  However, I'm still undecided, there are several other VERY nice weapons in there.  My haste item at this point is FBSS, so the haste upgrade would be a large amount, and the 47 dmg on it would be very nice for jousting.<br />
<br />
If you have any arguments for, or against, any of the weapons for any reason, please give me any input you have time for.  <br />

If you do have 41% haste at the time you get to purchase a weapon loot rights, I would aim for the Great Spear of Dawn, off Sevlak, because of the better ratio and higher damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Graznoth</div><div class="date">04-08-2002, 02:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Id probably agree with Arbaal, Rocksmasher since you only have a FBSS. I currently use the great spear, and I love it(even with 41% item haste and VoG its kinda slow). Not sure how buying the loot rights to stuff works, or how pricey it is cause Ive never heard of it being done on sol ro, but if you can afford to buy a ntov weapon, you can probably afford a nicer haste item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Soulle</div><div class="date">04-08-2002, 04:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's a pretty cheap buy for what you get honestly... lol.  Living on the lowest pop server of all times has to have some advantages.<br />
<br />
Probably going to go with the Rocksmasher it looks like.  If I do a money haul, its gonna burn me out, and saving up for a ToV wep AND a good haste item would probably make me lose my mind... lol.<br />
<br />
Plus totally forgot Rocksmasher has 100hps on it, I think thats what decided me.<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the input yall, and for narrowing it down for me between GSoD and Rocksmasher.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vachir</div><div class="date">04-08-2002, 05:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Rocksmasher  Dmg 47, Dly 41. +35 AC +25 Sta +100 HP 0.00 Wt   <br />

I'd easily go with GSoD because the difference in damage is just too much to neglect, it also has +15 MR on it which is always welcome for SZ.  Also I'd rather get a weapon I'm never going to upgrade than something that can double as a haste item until I get something better.  BTW, how much are you paying and who can I send a tell to? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Syfon</div><div class="date">04-09-2002, 07:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">at level 59 i get about 5hps per sta so the 25sta on the Rocksmasher is another 125hps. Total hps from the Rocksmasher is about 225. Also it has 10 extra ac which is 15 once equipped. Very nice indeed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Soulle</div><div class="date">04-09-2002, 11:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ya, I'd prolly quibble a little longer between the 2 of them honestly, if I ever saw dragon haste item in the foreseeable future... lol.  I'm so ghetto.  Also my 2hb is 200ish, where my peircing I dont believe I've ever worked.  So, out of sheer lazyness and ghettoness, im goin with the Rocksmasher.<br />
<br />
Ruin has that standing deal where you can pay a certain amount and arrange loot rights when they do a NTOV raid.  I'd talk to any of them that you know and try to work out a deal perhaps.  I know Grif payed 20k fer his, not sure if he got hooked up cuz hes a friend or not...<br />
<br />
Good luck yo</div></div><hr />

I just got my GSoD.. and man, I wish I had it at 53, Lguk would have been so much easier to solo.<br />

It is only the best weapon until you get 41% haste. In the end 41% haste belt and GSoD &gt; 41% haste belt and Rocksmasher. Plus soloing undead with the GSoD would be unreal. Get a GSoD and a CoF or something.</div></div><hr />

I didnt even know half of these things existed.  Guess I just have to get to lvl 55 and a suit of resist gear and get in on some ToV raids...is that how it works?</div></div><hr />
