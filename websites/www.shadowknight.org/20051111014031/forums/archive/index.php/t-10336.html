<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slanel</div><div class="date">01-17-2003, 02:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am trying to find some information about the specifics of the Terris Thule encounter.  I tend to worry about the split tanking or assiting the mezzer organization of encounters for my guild and am looking to fill in blanks in my knowledge in order to do things correctly to avoid frustrations.<br />
<br />
This is what I know about it.  Somewhere around 70% she spawns the butteryfly mobs.  I would like some information on these mobs as I am unsure what thier damage output are like or what thier HP is like.  At about 50% she AE dispells 12 buffs.  Does anyone know the range on this?  I don't think the Pillars in her room would block it so the solution would have to be to run out of range or use MGB to fill in the key buffs. Around 40% the gargoyles spawn.  These are what I am concerned with as I am pretty sure they are unmezzable and will have to be split off.  Can anyone give me information on these?  I would like to know if they can be slowed or not as the split will likely be picked up and tanked completely by SKs and Pallies. How many spawn here?<br />
<br />
Am I missing any adds in this encounter?<br />

<br />
You have the basic idea of what happens, formulate a plan based on what you know and give it a try. If you repeatedly fail on one part, come back and ask on on that specific thing.<br />
<br />
I will give you one hint that a friend of mine discovered on the last TT fight, a well timed Harm Shield is your friend.</div></div><hr />

I sincerely doubt that anyone here will give you spoiler info on the encounter, that's what Safehouse is for.<br />
<br />
You spelled out the obstacles to the encounter well enough in your initial post, so I assume that you understand what will happen and when.  Now get together with the other tacticians in your guild and figure out how to deal with the specifics of this fight. You will probably die the first time, that's ok. Once you've experienced the fight first hand, you can make plans for your next attempt, making adjustments where you think that you've fallen short.<br />
<br />
You'll be way more stoked if you beat her without having someone walk you through it. It's a really fun fight :)</div></div><hr />
