We play on Tallon Zek also. Was just wonering what would be the best place for 2 moderetly twinked toons to duo around lvl 26ish-30, maybe HHK or just LDON? We just started these toons last night and got them to 10 in PC, will get atleast 15 tonight most likely. Any help would be apreciated, just trying to look ahead</div></div><hr />

It's mostly up to date, just don't go into Droga or Nurga thinking it's what that chart says.<br />

At 25 I found Dawnshroud to be a great place.  It can easily take you to 35 too.</div></div><hr />

While at lower levels they are gonna tear stuff up (and always will have ag ood dps combo) at higher levels your gonna have downtime and such.  Adding a healer in the fray will fix that, however I like the Shaman/Sk combo.  My wife and I do this duo, and if it can be slowed I can kill it.  Best combo imo, for most things.  DPS is a little low, but you can burst damage that up if you want :eek:</div></div><hr />
