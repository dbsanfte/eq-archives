<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Krazix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A while ago I plvl'd my necro I was gonna 2 box with my 65 shaman (then I quit EQ.. but anyway) in Tower of Frozen Shadows, lots of mobs, and no competition. I tried the first floor around 16 and did fine, quickly moved to the 2nd floor, but got tired of dispellers, moved up to 3rd floor and it sucked, I've always hated 4th floor so moved to 5th (only place there is competition, and that's by velium farmers, but it was kinda rare to have them there). My necro was up there at 20, and took on the Enraged Relative (45th lvl mob) and won, it was a boring ass fight, that lasted forever, but I just had to see if I could do it.. but my strat was pretty weak; Shaman tanks the mob slowed with FoS and Regen on (and sta), and necro lifetapped and had pet attack on.<br />
<br />
Anyway TOFS is good and you don't run into any assholes, or people who see you plvling and beg to be plvled too; but you'll probably want to take your SK up there a bit higher than my necro.<br />
<br />
Paw is also good and fun..<br />
<br />
oh but about TOFS, don't pull with a low lvl character.. some weirdass bug; I tried to pull with my necro on first floor when I first got there; and pulled the pit skeletons, and everything on that floor agroed me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Lower level chars = much more agro.  Try going to AC in your 40's to test that out.<br />
<br />
I love old zones, SolA, SolB, and even the revamped nurga.<br />
<br />
Except nurga they are low HP, low ATK mobs.  Najena is fun and you can practice undead tactics.  <br />
<br />
Have a ball.</div></div><hr />
