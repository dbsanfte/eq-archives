<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xygoz Shadowreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well i was thinking about another AA skill for horses. Not like US or anything, but something like Horse Mastery, which would allow people to instantly start/stop on horses. I really havent thought this through so it might be overpowering in some cases, but i just think it would be a useful since many of the players now have mounts, also it would help those who kite on their mounts by being able to stop, cast, and go without worrying about interrupts from moving. Well just a half-baked idea from a guy whos bored at 1 in the morning...any input would be interesting...flame if you must.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Darcloakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Original idea, i like it.  Well as long as it doesnt cost that many points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>kharan_zechts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">would be nice for pulling scenarios. Could make it let you melee like normal while on a horse too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ghismonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I always thought we should get an Equestrian AA that allows us to ride horses in water, 'steer' down while levitating, and jump with a mount.  This would work too!<br />
<br />
Totally superfluous in comparison to our other needs, but still would be handy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Xygoz Shadowreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hehe, yeah this AA isn't really designed to balance out classes. But as a pre-elemental SK, i really know nothing about the true issues of class balancing but i think this AA would be good for casual players who aren't exactly up in higher GoD. Should also help those who solo during odd hours.<br />
Anyone have any ideas for AA costs? Or classes? I was thinking about it, and maybe either as a General Type ability for all classes or maybe just SK/pal req's (un)holy steed. <br />
<br />
Ability: Steed Mastery<br />
Cost: ??<br />
Effect: Allows complete control over the holy/unholy steed, allowing the player to control levitation descent, swim with a mount, jump with a mount, and start and stop on the steed instantly.<br />
<br />
Any other suggestions? Doubt it'll happen but i can always dream right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">would be nice for pulling scenarios. Could make it let you melee like normal while on a horse too.<br />

I'm just wondering about this. I've never spent any time on my horse in melee combat (other than the quick jump up on the horse to change spells), so how does being on a horse affect melee? I always figured melee would be the same; I must be wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Moonslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Another thing that would be cool for knights is some AA that gives some sort of melee bonus when fighting from horseback, slight increase to double attack or a small damage increase. After all, in a real world situation someone fighting on horseback versus a foot soldier had a huge advantage in combat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Lynxal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Referring to movement on the horse in melee Naelyan.  It's hard to fight on a horse because you can't make the necessary small compensations for push very well on a horse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Other classes would just love us having this on the PvP servers hehe :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>kharan_zechts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I think your slowed while on a horse by a bit im not really sure but I know you dont melee at full capacity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Xanathol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The slow acceleration is the only diff btw our horse and bards ( which I don't get...ever watch quarterhorse races? acceleration is almost instant :P ). Anyhow, I like the idea; something fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Xygoz Shadowreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hmmmmm, well I agree with the part about having a distinct advantage over footsoldiers if you were on a horse(i watched king aurther hehe) anyways, perhaps this AA could have high cost but be extremely useful.<br />
<br />
Name: Cavalry General<br />
Cost: 20 AAs<br />
Effective: Allows complete control of Unholy/Holy steed, allowing the rider to move instantaneously rather than having to build up speed. Additionally, this Ability allows for the Knight to have a greater chance to score a double attack, critical hit, and also improves damage mitigation slightly(3%?).<br />
Req's: Unholy/Holy Steed<br />
Restrictions: Outdoors only<br />
<br />
Okay....maybe thats a little much, but hey shoot for the moon cause if you miss, you're among the stars. /shrug<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ajrarn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'm just wondering about this.

It does not affect melee skill at all, and it does not affect mana regen as well, as long as you have atk on you're considered as &quot;standing&quot; for mana regen. It's atm just a travelling tool for us, nice but no more no less.<br />
<br />
I don't really see the point of a stop and start AA, we can already instant click it of (it's instant and total stop even for casting or interrupt casting) you can even make a /dismount hotkey (but bugged most of the time) and of course it's instant recast already for the AA horse.<br />
<br />
I'd rather like the idea of an upgrade to our horse with lev ability and graphic ugrade like nightmare with bat wings, or nazgûl's flying monster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Razs Meows</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I think that instant start/stop would make certain things too easy (ie, kiting stuff in raid encounters, PVP, etc.).<br />
<br />
Instead of making it 1 huge AA, why not scale it?<br />
<br />
Version 1 would reduce the acceleration and deceleration time to 2.5 seconds and allow lev / underwater / etc. steering.  Also, maybe double damage if you hit melee while moving at top speed and a scaled % for when accelerating? (IE if top speed = 100% and does 100% extra damage, acceleration to 33% does 33% extra damage, 50% does 50% extra damage, and so on.  Would *maybe* increase the chance to miss, but not by as much as the damage.).  This makes 'Jousting' a bit more realistic.<br />
<br />
Version 2 would reduce the acceleration and deceleration time to 2 seconds and allow you to have a 40% bonus to channelling or whatnot during deceleration.  (You're not concentrating as hard on the horse or something).<br />
<br />
Version 3 would reduce acceleration and deceleration time to 1 second, give an extra damage bonus modifier (15% of current damage bonus?), increase the chanelling % to 60%, and maybe allow sitting mana regen while meleeing.  Also would allow all skills to be used while on horse back (ie, can't kick or backstab or use archery [while moving] on horse back). <br />
<br />
Make it cost something like 8 / 16 / 24, and usable to all classes.<br />
<br />
Then SK and Pallies would get a class specific rank in it, for whatever points, that increases the % of the damage bonus, upgrades the graphics, and maybe even grants an AC bonus (it is flippin' HARD to hit some one on a horse!).<br />
<br />
<br />
That sound nice and nifty?  It would give every one more of a reason to get horses, would actually allow all classes (except maybe bards still :P) to get a benefit from a horse, prevent any SK with a horse from insta-ganking people on PVP servers, and generally increase roleplaying aspects (even if they are dead).<br />
<br />
When was the last time you saw a non-caster fight from horse back?<br />
When was the last time you saw a non-pal / non-sk melee USE a horse?<br />
Something needs to be done to make horses loved by every one.</div></div><hr />
