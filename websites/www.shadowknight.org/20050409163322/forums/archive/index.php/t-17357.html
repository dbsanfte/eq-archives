<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Duke Xerro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Calculated my DPS tonight. <br />
48.9 DPS. I used my Greater Stormwatcher Horn. Had grim aura / aura of battle for atk buffs. Had ench haste, and druid / bard ds song playing. With my gear, was just wondering if this was average DPS or sucky, or what.<br />
<br />
I parsed it without ench haste and with only cloak of luclin / banshee aura, same atk buffs, and my DPS came out to be 34.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vampiel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have parsed a 62 sk before and his dps was pretty much right smack where yours is. Keep in mind that the longer you parse over a period of time the more accurate, and when parsing on raid mobs your dps will be much lower also.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Moongarm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It depends on what you parsed it on.  Since DPS figures can vary greatly between mobs 49DPS might be exceptional on something with high AC or sub par on something with low AC.<br />
<br />
I should be picking up a greater stormwatchers horn in the near future, just waiting on the bozo to drop it for me, let me know where you're parsing and I'll give it a whirl and see what I get after I get a horn.  If it's some super secret mob that you don't want  posted in open forums just PM me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jupke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'll go parse mine on an exterminator somewhere and post the results :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>DConquest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">48 DPS... wow did you parse this in VT?   Seriously,  a 65 SK with haste and at least over 1200 atk should be getting 70 - 80 ish with a decent weapon like the Stormwatcher Horn.   Hell, I used to parse 60 ish with my Epic before I got any offensive AAs at 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Duke Xerro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Parsed it in BoT ... maybe I did something wrong in my calculations, I'll try again and see if I come up with something else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Reyortsed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">That sounds really low for dps in BoT using the Greater Stormwatcher Horn.  Are you hand calculating your dps?  Or using a program such as 'Yalp'?  If it is the former,  I would definately re-check your calculations.  If you only parsed a couple of fights,  it is possible that you just had bad 'rolls'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>GranochTonka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">At lvl 57 im hitting mid 60s DPS on mobs in tier 1 planes...using a WMBS...not sure on how you did it but i think its wrong :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shummn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Parsed 50 dps at 51, tanking golems in Veksar - with 96% total haste + Ferine Avatar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Solan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Seems very low to me too, I vary between 60 and 70 dps with my black bastard sword, that includes spellcasting but that shouldn't account for a difference that big anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>cmdrbean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Meh, at 52 I was parsing around 32-36 DPS basically anywhere I went... including Hole, PoJ, Takish, Rujarkian, Seb, prolly a couple other places. That's including dot/spear dmg and procs.<br />
<br />
Damn, and I thought I was pretty decently equipped. &gt;:P<br />
<br />
Oh, and if anyone bothers to look at my Magelo, it's basically up to date... I think the only thing that has changed is I dinged 53. And those parses were with combinations of pitchfork and tae ew 2h.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Warscout</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">were you also includeing any spell damage in the parce that may have been aplicable?<br />
<br />
I have logged myself up to 160 DPS in single mob encounters useing alot of burst spell damage but not includeing harm touch. and usaly get around 85 DPS on an avrage 4 hour grind with much less coustly gear than yours. <br />
<br />
Now if your only talking about melee DPS then i would say aye i prolly get about the same.<br />
<br />
I use yalp<br />
<br />
I only parce on outer camp in PoV i think its a standered happy mediom for mobs and thats why i chose it.<br />
<br />
My raid DPS almost always is pittiful tho im never tanking so i dont get the binifit of reposits and lag kills me some days. on raids from Vindi and up i get closer to 30 DPS<br />
<br />
<br />
Sorry if this post is not readable im drunk and cany type<br />
<br />
Warscout<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S. hey what camp in BoT were you in? if it was the brown spikey giants in south regend then you got to remember that they are like 110% disease resistant and your not gonna stick the first spear or shit even harm touch on em. go back and use a heavy dot line up, and dont be afraid to over lap yur dots.<br />
<br />
festering off the pull 50 dmg<br />
ignight blood 56 dmg<br />
boil blood 24 dmg<br />
heat blood befor it reaches camp 17 dmg<br />
blood of pain and 30 dmg<br />
blood of hate between swings of yur sword 160 dmg<br />
                             = 337 dmg per tick <br />
thats like a whole nother free swing every 6 seconds its worth it. It will never miss never be dodged you can do it even while stunned Exc....<br />
<br />
have cloak of luclin and a shaman damage shield potion up<br />
be sure to use life tap spell prock not mental curption <br />
use call of darkness (+75 attack Ldon spell)<br />
grim aura<br />
and remember that if ferine avatar is avalible it stacks with your 65th lvl 130 attack tap but ferosity does not<br />
and finaly pull out your stinking pet, invoke death in the BoT will parce for 10 DPS EASY all on his own<br />
<br />
so 337 per tick = 56 DPS and mr bones = 10 DPS = 66.16 DPS from just spell damage bro a bit less when you count in cast time and when they go off and must be replaced but still i think you shouldnt discount spell damage from your DPS equasion.<br />
<br />
all this may seem mana intensive but i can brake even dowing all this in BoT with just a shaman buddy behind me and liching so im sure you could in a full group with c5 and what not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Solan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Warscout, what you are describing is not a sustained DPS, no way anyone can sustain that non stop on an exp grind. From my understanding Xerro was wondering about DPS in exp groups, not what you can possibly burst out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">i switch between a primal axe and wmbs and i normally parse from 70-90 tanking xerro just melee on tier2-3 mobs so seems kinda low bro. Though i normally have 1450atk to 1600 atk though so maybe thats why. None tanking i shoot between 100 and 120.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Warscout</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">i can sustain that level of intensity for 4 or 5 fights in BoT at MS camp with mana reduction 3 and usring 64 lich on horseback and with flowing thought 6. I have about a 3k mana pool wich is somewhat lack luster. and after 5 fights in MS my partner usaly calls for a halt to med anyway. in that light it is sustainable. Even if you have to cut back to less mana useage the point was not to discount your mana pool in DPS. useing just blood of hate festering darkness ingnight blood and a pet you would still almost x2 your DPS count from melee alone. Partnered with a good shaman in MS i kill a critter every 120 seconds or so useing the my previously stated method. and the giants yield between 2.5 and 6% a kill depending on the type of giant kiggers for instance are 6% but i try not to screw with them they have insain damage spikes and own me 1/2 the time i try them. that 65 shaman torpor wont keep up with a duble attack for 850 and a 1500 point DD prock.<br />

I have never known these to be stackable when cast by the same character.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Solan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">They stack alright, that was changed a long time ago. i just think it's a waste of spell gems.</div></div><hr />

That sounds really low for dps in BoT using the Greater Stormwatcher Horn.  Are you hand calculating your dps?  Or using a program such as 'Yalp'?  If it is the former,  I would definately re-check your calculations.  If you only parsed a couple of fights,  it is possible that you just had bad 'rolls'.  <br />
<br />
Yes, hand calculating... anybody know the site to DL yalp or something?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Lyrith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Not sure offhand on the website, but sk's with decent weapons can parse an easy 145dps, i use Earthspined staff and have sotk and ka maxed and on a total burn have hit over 200dps~ w/o ht calc'd. 49 dps is dead wrong, but then again your not there for dps most the time =) Just be happy we can tank as well as we do <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Khat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">YALP (http://www.yalp.org)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Duke Xerro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Ok thanks, DLing it now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Duke Xerro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Ah ok , YALP says I did 77 dps, guess that sounds more accurate. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Vincente</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I parsed myself doing anywhere between 40-109DPS in LDoN the other day with chanter haste. Pet was doing a steady 20DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>lorddaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">use a log of all fights to determine your DPS, log an entire LDoN adventure. otherwise your going to get spikes high and low in a single fight. you need a large sample size to get a statistical average you can use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">i recently parsed my dps with Yalp but I just dont think it is taking into consideration all of the spell damage somehow or something.<br />
<br />
Anyways I came out to about 48 dps using the 2 hander in my magelo with SoV on.<br />
<br />
This was over 2 LDON adventures and some time spent in PoV at the caves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Khat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I have the same issues, Talliinn.<br />
<br />
Looking at my log now and the only spell info showing is from Banshee Aura.<br />
<br />
Nothing at all from CD, Spears, HT, etc.<br />
It's too bad that I can't get an accurate assessment of my DPS but I still like YALP alot, otherwise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Erodalak Souleater</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I can't believe Brael hasn't posted yet, he's like the SK DPS accountant.</div></div><hr />

This is an exported sample.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Jupke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Ps. Dont look at my dps, it sucked due to the AC of the emp and cause the fucktard is resistant to a lot of shit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Ganaith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I am getting the error Eqcompanion warns about on the website, downloaded the program that says it would solve it, and still gives error message.<br />
<br />
Yalp is showing way, way different lower dps then friends parsing me with EQcompanion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Moongarm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Well I finally got a horn and spent a few hours pasing. <br />
<br />
Green mob<br />
37% Haste<br />
1055ATK(yeah it sucks sue me)<br />
KA level 1<br />
<br />
61.54DPS<br />
69.44% Accuracy<br />
<br />
Used YALP btw- I don't parse a whole lot but is there a parser that actually includes spell damage or do I need to go back and do that on my own?</div></div><hr />
