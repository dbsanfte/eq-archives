<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rhumba_Kween</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've spent a couple of nights here now, and have to admit the XP is some of the best in the game. Initially I was surprised how few people were there.<br />
<br />
However, from what I've seen thus far, it seems like there are so few named. And the named that do spawn just drop garbage gear for the most part, even for a Pre-Time Guild. By the end, it truly felt like the only thing we were there for was an XP grind. And I'm guessing that is why we've only ever seen a soloer at Zone In while we've been there<br />
<br />
We got the zone wide Melee Ring to drop  last night, and it is nice, but certainly not as nice as some of the RS/MpG zonewide items.<br />
<br />
Anyone seen any single group type events in this zone, or any remotely descent camps? From what I've gathered the 60/60/60 aug can drop anywhere. <br />
<br />
At least from my initial impressions, I'm very disapointed. They could have done such a good job making this zone another good grouping zone, but seemed to have missed the most important part and ended up making it a mindless xp zone with one good drop.<br />
<br />
Anyone have some insight into this zone?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I found the above linked thread on The Safehouse boards very informative.<br />
Nest was just opened on e'ci, so I have not yet tried them myself.<br />
I am, however, very much looking forward to this weekend :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kaotix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Tried it for the first time last night.<br />
Mobs were similar to mpg names/RSS<br />
I tanked, bst and shm bot slowed, druid healed, ranger dps.<br />
XP was great... druid has fantastic healing aas, FT and mana pool, but couldnt really progress without a cleric.<br />
<br />
One thing we noticed right away - the mobs dont summon :)<br />
When the healer was afk, we kited a few.<br />
<br />
Its like Vxed 2.0<br />
<br />
I know a lot of people hate agro kiting, but for those that dont...have at it :)</div></div><hr />
