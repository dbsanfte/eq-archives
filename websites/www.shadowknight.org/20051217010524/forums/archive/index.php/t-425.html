The two known/famous ones are Seru and Emperor Shissar.<br />
<br />
Now Greenmist is in my opinion the ultimate weapon against the Shissar or at least it should be. it's normal 18/22 bane:6  makes it 24/22 against normal shissar, even if they are very resistent to it's dot that's a great dps.<br />
<br />
Now against the Emperor the normal damage is ignored and it becomes a 6/22 weapon. My big complaint is that there is a 10/20 sword that drops in the temple with bane:7 shissar which of course becomes 7/20 against the Emperor and beats Greenmist hands down.<br />
<br />
IMHO Greenmist should be adjusted, I don't believe there should be any other weapon with a better damage in this encounter.<br />
<br />
your views on this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xilr</div><div class="date">04-04-2002, 10:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree.  <br />
<br />
But I also think that Melee Immune mobs should have NO WAY for a warrior to tank it at all.  That means remove Hategivers, SoDs, any other megataunt weapons a warrior can use, or disable them for these encounters.  It would be so nice if just once a warrior found himself with nothing productive to do while the SKs tank the mob=P  For one or two bloody encounters!  Thats all I ask!  ..../em slips into insanity again..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rekss</div><div class="date">04-04-2002, 10:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why should it be adjusted? Greenmist is a very nice reward for the ease of it's quest. Admittedly not knowing the specifics of the Ssrae Shissarbane quest/drop, I can only assume it's more difficult based on the zone associated with it. Hence the slightly greater reward.<br />
<br />
Spare me the RP rationales in advance. :)</div></div><hr />

My view is we get to quest (easy quest) for a very nice sword that those of us who quest for it will probably use all the time.  That sword you mention, on the other hand, will probably only be used situationally at best.  <br />
<br />
Nothing to get worked up about imho.  I don't remember reading that Greenmist was the ultimate sword against Shissar =).</div></div><hr />

<br />
try doing the Greenmist string AS INTENDED..not at level 60 with 45 AAXP points, then refrase your wording</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rayne</div><div class="date">04-04-2002, 11:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kind of impossible to &quot;do the quest as intended&quot; since I've been level 60 for over a year.  Most of that time my account was cancelled to boot.<br />
<br />
However, if it will make you feel better I personally found the quest to be extremely easy at level 60.  Solo'd everything but the 2 chardok drops and will get a group to hit the golem in OT.  I think the quest is very easy when you consider the extremely nice reward for it.  Imo the reward is better than expected for the difficulty of the quest, at least by normal Verant standards.  <br />
<br />
I certainly understand that YMMV.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&lt;img src=http://fohguild.org/news/CSWSsra.jpg&gt;<br />
<br />
I am pretty sure it's smithed and the ore to make it supposedly a real pain in the ass to come by (note the nodrop so if it IS smithed whoever wants the sword probably needs a pretty high smithing skill) I don't know specifics but wouldn't be too surprised if it was actually easier to just do greenmist instead of whatever is involved for the corrupted sword<br />
<br />
As for greenmist being easy when done as intended ... well I did everything from the first khukri quest to the end of greenmist except golem / drusella / shard / book solo at 51 (also significantly before I got my hands on most of the nice stuff I have now, I was using MoSS + sarnak shield, fbss for haste, and mostly royal velium armor). And I think that for the reward you get the quest most certainly IS easy, and if that's not &quot;AS INTENDED&quot; I'd like to hear what you would consider to be as intended. But maybe I'm just bitter from doing all these #$% quests where you need tradeskills lately</div></div><hr />

<br />
Rayne, how did you mange to get that deep into HS to kill Drusella solo? I didn't think that part was soloable at all.<br />
<br />
Neq, I think Zanix meant to do them as you progress in level in a natural way. I did my quest up to and at 51st level for the most part too and while I was able to solo my way through the Lord's Khukri, I wouldn't call it easy. I did the earlier parts while the mobs needed to take down still yeilded exp for the most part and they were indeed tough. I remember having a blast exping in the Swamp to kill raiders, hunting in Dalnir, and getting my friends to help me uncover the spy in Firiona Vie. All in all, it was great fun, but it was also long and tedious. Furthermore, the golem, drusella, and the two chardok drops while not extremely tough are no walk in the park, and happen to be the toughest parts of the greenmist quest, so sure, exclude them and the rest sounds easy.<br />
<br />
Easy compared to some quests? sure. Easy in a general sense? not remotely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neq</div><div class="date">04-04-2002, 11:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah I suppose I should clarify what I meant ... easy as compared to what I have come to expect from verant quests especially ones with nice rewards such as this. NOT easy as in I just picked one up for a kick one afternoon :)<br />
<br />
And really ... I think quests would be more fun and done more often if they were all inline with this level of risk/reward so I'm not saying it as if it's a bad thing either</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm a soloing GOD, didn't you know that?  Picked my own locks and everything.  Um, I misspoke.  I forgot about that part when I wrote my reply.  Had my normal group of 6 for that.<br />
<br />
Had a group for Glowing Cliff Golem too last night even though in hindsight I could have 2-boxed it provided I make the pull safely.<br />
<br />
The quest had a few painful parts (spent 12 hours one day in Dalnir's with nothing to show for it), but for the most part was nice.  As far as I'm concerned this is one of their best quests.<br />
<br />
As for doing it as I levelled I was one of the original high level Iksar SKs and just had zero time for quests in those days.  Raiding with my Cleric and working on this character in my limited spare time was all I could do.  The fact that the quests were rather fubar'd back then was further dis-incentive.  This quest did, however, make my return rather pleasant.</div></div><hr />

<br />
personnally, when i did the raiders in SONH, It took me about 2 weeks...then again, I was like level 15....some of the raiders were even cons....<br />
<br />
whatever COULD be done solo, i did solo..<br />
Greenmist &quot;back then&quot; was only a myth and legend - therefore, not many people were inclined to waste/assist on a quest no one knew anything about</div></div><hr />
