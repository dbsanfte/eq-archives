<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sssin Sssational</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay, so I am starting an ogre SK to tank for and protect my gf's DE wizzie. My thinking is that with all the HP's, sta, str, plus a well-timed fear or HT, I could do a good job being her 'bouncer'. Also, before this turns into a 'you should be a DE, human, etc' I have made up my mind on the ogre thing. Reason? I have played casters and 'light tanks' for too long, and now just want to bust and bruise my way around (but don't want to give up the ability to use mana/gate, lol).<br />
<br />
Here are my big questions. <br />
1. Will this be an effective duo?<br />
2. where should I put my stats? I have been thinking 5 in agi, dex (to get them to 75, duh), and 10int.<br />
<br />
Is int really worth it? Does it play thatmuch of a factor. my thinking was that ogres get so darn much sta, i wouldn't need to put any there. am I wrong, and should I put the remaining 10 points all or half into sta?<br />
<br />
Thanks a ton guys. Been playing a long time, but never as an SK. I lok forward to becoming a part of the community</div></div><hr />

 int/sta/dex for a ogre is best IMO for big races(da fatties), am i a fattie no but from hunting and hearing about some of more proportionaly sized friends that is from &quot;what i heard&quot; them gripe about hehe</div></div><hr />

2. Make sure your agi is above 75 !!!  Otherwise you will get an AC penalty.  Dump the rest into int.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sssin Sssational</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">That was kinda my one great fear.  neither of us can heal and all.  I guess lots of bandaids huh?  <br />
<br />
So, the only thing I'll have to heal is LT's?  that is a lot fo hp's to LT back, lol!<br />
<br />
sounds like people are starting to come together to say 5agi, 5dex, 10int.  That sound about right?  Or am I wrong here?<br />
<br />
Also, you guys think an orge SK WOULD be a good race choice then?  I know my mind is kinda made up, but it never hurts to hear a little re-enforcement, eh?<br />
<br />
Thanks for all help so far!  Keep it comin'!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kyfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Wizzy/SK is really not a great duo though. Until the wizzy can quad, she will slow you down. Once she can quad, you will slow her down. There really is no complementary overlap. If the two of you join a group together, then yes, you would be a good bodyguard.<br />
<br />
Truthfully, groupingwise, wizzies have very low sustained dps and way too much med time. Also, they twink badly, and twink melees kill them damagewise.<br />
<br />
I understand your girlfriend already is a wizzy, but I would never seek a wizzy out for duoing. We generally fearkite to solo. You would want classes that enhance melee or add melee or in some way reduce downtime.<br />
<br />
For example, the best duo partner I have found is a Shaman. They can haste, slow, heal, nuke, dot, sow, add much stat goodness and have a nice pet starting at 34. Enchanters are nice as well for mana regen, slow, haste, cc. But the lack of heals and buffs puts them below shamans in my mind.<br />
<br />
Just my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Buliwyk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ogre int isn't that bad.  But yeah...that breakdown looks ok.  You won't get any decent taps for 50 levels, so buy lots of bandages.  If you just want to duo, maybe shaman or pali would be better?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jobrill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Aye, SK is &quot;Alright&quot; for a Wizard, but not the Optimal Duo partner, I'd lean more towards Paladin, Enchanter or maybe even another Wizard for that.<br />
<br />
However, An SK can work, just expect a lot of downtime til you get good taps, as people have said.<br />
<br />
As far as race question, honestly in the end it don't matter too much. Ogre should work. Actually, myself, I might go Erudite or some other higher-Int race just because I see you doing a lot of fear-kiting, since you have no method of healing you aren't gonna be tanking toe-to-toe much, or maybe Troll or Iksar to lessen downtime slightly due to regen. Ogre will take the most punishment tho, so you could just stick with that and count on your girl to nuke the stuff down fast if you run outta mana and get low on health (Which will happen with any race).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tdan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">My RL friend plays a wiz and we brought our chars up from lvl 1.  Not sure how effective we were but we did alot of crazy crap and sometimes it came down to how long i could stay alive while he cast evac . . . . anyway we had alot of fun in this combo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Paynreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Mana is VERY important for you as an Ogre. I am an Ogre and i often note how incredibly small my mana pool is. No, you dont need to dump more into STR/Stam.<br />
<br />
You will have no decent heals untill level 55 when you finally get a lifetap that heals worth a &amp;^%$, but with a wizzy you might be able to kill fast enough to make that negligable...might.<br />
<br />
Good luck =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kryussius T`loth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">If you want to spend the money and do the quest, we get a 280 pt lifetap at 49 (have to be 50 to do the quest though I think).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kahntun Derstand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">If you're worried about downtime but still want to be a big bruiser, start a Troll.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Cirrean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">You obviously intend to duo with your girlfriend's wizard right now, but there will surely be times when you want the ability to solo.  The advice you've already been given is right on track about needing a mana pool to keep you alive via lifetaps.  I knew I'd probably be soloing a lot, so I chose Erudite for race because of the INT, and have had to get a lot of stat gear to compensate...but I can fear-kite quite well.  As a large race, you will have some benefits in the melee stats, but you're going to want a decent mana pool to stay alive or solo effectively.<br />
<br />
Obviously, being an ogre partnered with a dark elf will work fine in that you won't be KOS to each other's starting towns, but if you are confident that you can get around safely, you might consider an Iksar.  If you aren't twinked, you might be glad for the regen and AC bonus, plus innate foraging and swimming skill.  With the Nexus and Plane of Knowledge available, getting around is extremely easy, so your KOS status isn't the roadblock it would have been in the past.  If you don't want to be a lizard, maybe a troll would be good too.  You lose the frontal stun resistance of the ogre, but still have regen.<br />
<br />
Whatever you decide, having someone to team up with will be fun.  Just realize that the wizard/SK duo isn't optimal compared to many others.  I rarely turn anyone away from the SK class, but beastlord or paladin may be a better team-up class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sssin Sssational</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Wow!  Are they really that bad a combo?  It seems like no one thinks it is a doable duo.<br />
<br />
Tell me that isn't the case.  We both knew coming in it was no monk/shammy or necro/rogue, but we figured it would be a fun, DOABLE pairing.  <br />
<br />
Is this not true?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jobrill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">No, It's DOABLE, just not OPTIMAL, is all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kyfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">It's doable because anything is doable. I don't want to depress you. But it is better to have facts now than regrets later. I just looked at a list of EQ classes. I think that wizard may be the worst possible partner to fight duo with an SK. Meaning the least overall downtime reduction. If anyone disagrees, please post who you think would be worse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Remember too, that Dex is pretty much an unknown quantity for starting stats, no one is sure exactly what it does (doesn't seem to affect AC or much other than Proc frequency).   Incedentally, unless you've twinked with a proc'ing weapon at the early stages, there are many gear opportunities to increase dexterity to a level that gives you acceptable proc frequency, and if my own experience is any indication, Vampiric Embrace is a near worthless proc spell, going off less than half as often as the next higher version (Scream of Death, I believe).  <br />
<br />
So, if you have decided to go with an Ogre (a decision which I can't really make any arguments against) then I would personally put 5 in Agi, 5 in Sta and 5 in Int, or alternatively, 5 in Agi and 15 in Int.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Zretch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Shadowknights make a good duo combo with any healing class.  The SK ability to tank compliments the priest's ability to heal nicely and their ability to snare and feign can help with runners and getting singles. <br />
<br />
Wizards, on the other hand, don't make a good duo combo with any class in the game.  :(  As soon as you add a second class to a wizard, they lose their ability to use their 10 damage per mana Pillar spells and are reduced to their 3 damage per mana DD spells.  A wizard really needs some form of external mana regeneration to perform well in a group (Clarity or Bardsong).<br />
<br />
By grouping a wizard with a shadowknight, you fail to cover either one of their weaknesses.  Sk's inability to downtime heal and the wizard's inability to quickly regen mana.  On the one hand, you're not optimal and things will be slow going.  On the other hand, it's not like there's a ton of classes that partner with a wizard any better.  No manaless damage sources and no innate enhanced mana regen make the wizard a fairly ineffective partner when fighting single mobs, even while fear kiting or agro kiting.<br />
<br />
It's one of the prices you pay for being a wizard.  They arn't twinkable, they don't duo well, they don't powerlevel well.  Sad thing is you'd both probably gain exp faster if you both just soloed seperatly while grouped and close enough to one another to get exp messages from eachother's kills.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Kanekra Soulreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I played both a Druid and SK for a long time and have a good friend that learned the game with that was a wizzard. We even had another friend that was an enchanter. The best way to make this duo work is to get wizzard get agro and you follow the mob around smacking it in the back. The problem is heals. Unless you have a nice supply of greenies around to tap, then you are going to find you need to be healed with nobody to heal you. In a pinch you can have the wizzy cast eye of zomm (or whatever it is) and tap it to heal. Expect a lot of downtime with this combo. I personally would suggest another caster type to better compliment the wizzy. I think a Mage would be a good choice as you get a pet to tank and also get good nukes. Other good options would be a necro or shaman and maybe even enchanter. If you all want to ever go in dungeons though, and go when you get xp and not when they're totally green, you'll need a tank. But if you play the tank, you'll need a healer. Therefore I would not recommend a SK/wizzy combo. I've tried it and it is doable, but not efficient at all. I'd say a mage would be the best choice overall as you get a pet to tank, strong nukes, and when the wizzy finally comes in to good aoe nukes and can quad, as a mage, you can join in with them and work together. If you really want to work together and be efficient and effective , nothing can compare to a tank/healer combo. A shaman/SK is a sweet sweet combo. I duel box a SK/cleric and other than rezzes, a shaman has a lot more to offer. Good luck in your adventures.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
/shudder<br />
<br />
Wow!  So, basically, all our logic was flawed, and we picked essentially the two worst classes to duo with (or darn close)?  <br />
<br />
See, on the wizzie boards, they said the key to being effective was to 'find a good tank, and stick to him/her like glue'.  I figured an SK is as good a tank as any, and has a few helpful spells/skills to round him out.<br />
<br />
God, I am almost regreting even asking.  This sure brought me down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Kyfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">It isn't that you &quot;picked the two worst classes&quot;. Wizzies don't pair well. Period. <br />
<br />
SK's pair very well with many classes. Healers and buffers reduce downtime and increase kill speed. Melee increase kill speed which reduces damage taken. An SK is an excellent partner to almost all classes. <br />
<br />
But not to wizards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>yuggoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Ummm... try it.  it's not like it is a lifelong commitment.  If the two of you decide it isn't fun, try something else.<br />
<br />
I have a lot of experience duoing a DE warrior with a DE wizard... no it isn't optimal, but we still have a heck of a lot of fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Trobb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I think the real question is do you want to play a SK or do you want to play that can &quot;tank&quot; or do you want to play one that works best with a wizard?<br />
<br />
If you want to play a SK, play a SK!  The most enjoyable &quot;tank&quot; class by far.  Since down time will be a factor I would recommend a troll or Iksar to greatly reduce down time.  If you can twink him with a fungi or even a cerimonial iksar chestplate then go with an ogre.  I would recommend a troll...but I'm very biased ;)<br />
<br />
If you want the best &quot;tank&quot; then chose a warrior.  I think you already know the limitations of using a warrior so I wouldn't recommend it.<br />
<br />
If you want the most efficient match I would say play a enchanter or a bard.  Both of these classes will improve the performance of the wizard.  Of these I would recommend the bard since he can &quot;tank&quot; better than the chanter.  Like the chanter he can charm, mez, slow, haste and improve the mana regen.  But the bard can also heal and give you sow (selo's).  Both the chanter and bard will be of help at higher levels since they both can aoe kill.  Wizzards like to quad kite but bards take this one step better and swarm fight.  Bards obviously cant take hits like a true tank.  But with their plate armor, slows and health regen they come close.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>synnoira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Yeah i was thinking bard would be an excellent fit for a wizard too. Trobb lists all the good reasons, plus where you can't port you can hurtle across the landscape together at high speeds.<br />
Sk is doable though and bards involve a lot of concentration and button-twiddling to play well. You might find bard/wizard more efficient in game but a less &quot;sociable&quot; combo, it's not easy getting conversation in or out of game from a twisting bard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Ufdah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Problem with bard is that they are KOS in Neriak (without DE mask).  <br />
<br />
There are worse combos for a wiz.... you could have picked a rogue.<br />
<br />
You might want to try an Ogre Beastlord if you wanta keep to the bodyguard thang.  Ogre beastlords are rare (i don't know if i have seen one over level 20).  You have healing ablities.... a pet that can hold aggro and you get a clarity type spell later.<br />
<br />
Now that would be kinda a cool combo Ogre BL and DE wiz.  You wouldnt have any compatability faction problems either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Zretch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Bard, Enchanter, and Beastlord are really the 3 classes that can help give the wizard mana back to make them more effective.  Of them, the Enchanter gets that ability the earliest by far with Breeze.  Bard would be next with manasong, and finally Beastlord with the Purity line.<br />
<br />
Enchanters probably compliment the wizard the best.  Chanters can fear, DD, have a pet, and provide mana regen.  Wizards can snare and DD.  That opens up fear kiting.<br />
<br />
I would say Beastlords pair up next best.  The wizard has the ability to snare and root, where the beastlord lacks both.  The Beastie brings slows, a very nice pet, and a pet heal.  If you want a Wizard/Tank combo, the closest you're probably going to get is Wizard/Beastlord.  As an added bonus, Ogres can be Beastlords!  :D  Yea, their bear is kinda dull, but it can get to be HUGE at higher levels.  :)<br />
<br />
IMO, a bard is the worst pairing of the 3, but still probably better than a Shadowknight.  :)  A bard kills very slowly but makes up for that fact by having no downtime, whether it's DoT kiting or Fear kiting.  Speed up the kills and the bard won't be contributing much.  Slow down the kills and the wizard really isn't bringing all that much.  Swarm kiting is absolutly out of the question in a duo situation.  In order for swarm kiting to work, the bard's pet needs to have agro.  The minute the wizard snares, roots, or DDs even one mob in the swarm, that mob will peel off and go after the wizard.<br />
<br />
I agree with the poster above.  If you're just looking for &quot;a tank that compliments a wizard&quot;, don't take a Shadowknight.  I don't think you'll be happy.  Give a Wizard/Ogre Beastlord a go and see how that works out.  :)  At low levels it should work out well as Beastlords are very good soloists and at higher levels Spiritual Radiance should help the wizard keep up some decent damage while the Beastlord plays pet cleric.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>dzenith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Any two classes can duo and level together effectively.  There are some combinations that are faster exp than others.  However, if this game is about fun to you and not always doing what is optimal, then go with whatever class you like the most.  Some of the most fun times I have had in EQ are when doing difficult things with much less than the ideal class combination.   SK's are a good solo class.  Adding any other player that can do good damage isn't going to hurt you any.   My first SK I levelled to 45(45 was actually high then), most of the time duoing with a warrior.  I then quit the game for a year and made Dzenith, who duo'd mainly with a wizard while levelling into the 50's.  I had a lot of fun doing it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Jitawa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">get his AGI to 75, dump the rest into STA if you going to play post 50....<br />
<br />
yes they start with low int, yes there are some good spells later on<br />
<br />
but if there's one thing that's plentiful for SKs it's INT gear, hp will always be better than mana for a tank..<br />
<br />
if you're really worried about running out of mana, don't forget you have several supplementary items to pick up various spells for you...shrunken gob earring for grim aura, CoS for invis, gaunts of the bloodfiend for vampiric embrace, BE boots for fear, BE gaunts for darkness</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Amphitryon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I agree with the Troll thing..their innate regen is well worth the slightly lower starting stats of an ogre and since faction sucks just as bad its no biggie<br />
<br />
and yes dump into INT ..not STR/STA..your NOT a warrior..you need your mana pool..especially if you are going to mostly duo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Reyortsed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I think that a wiz/sk combo would be good.  While the mob is snared/fear the wizzy could newk the crap outta the mob .  If you were able to get a kei off of someone this would be a very good combo imo=).  The most important thing is that you have fun! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Putrid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Your combo is doable, maybe not opitimal.  The troll sk maybe be a better idea for the duo.  I play an ogre and I think they are great but without a healer around you will have a lot of downtime.  To decrease the downtime your goal should be to get a healing item, like an Iksar ceremonial breatplate.   If you are a newbie it will take a while to get the pp, 6000pp.  <br />
You really wont need a lot of intelligence if you really are intending to primarily guard a wizard.  You will need to be able to get agro quickly.  Clinging Darkness is very effective at lower levels and is fairly low on mana.  <br />
Answering your question, Make agility 75.  I would put rest into a split of intelligence and stamina.  Stamina will be more important in the later game but for the first 30 levels the intelligence will be helpful.  Dex and strength are easially raised by many items.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My friends and I built an entire group based on what we thought would be the best group possible...<br />
<br />
you know what? 2 of us ended up remaking our characters cuz, while it was the optimal group, a couple of us just weren't enjoying the characters. So we remade our chars and now its a blast to play.<br />
<br />
Pick you char cuz you want to play that class, not cuz it will necessarily be the most effective.<br />
<br />
SK has been by far the most enjoyable class I have ever played.<br />
<br />
As for being an Ogre, I would go with the 5dex/5agi/10int.  Means you might not have to look for as much int gear if you don't want to...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Hrendra An'ei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Beastlord or Paladin = best option to duo with a wizard.<br />
<br />
Actually, Beastlord might be best, once they get their mana regen spells. Paladins can cover the tanking, taunting, crowd control, and healing for both of them. <br />
<br />
The reason Beastlord is a great partner is 1) disposable tankage, 2) decent hybrid healing, 3) slows, 4) higher level regen spells, 5) very solid damage output. <br />
<br />
In my mind, the trick to doing is to find each person's greatest weakness, and then to find each duo's greatest weakness. What is going to slow you down the most? Find out if that's liveable for you. <br />
<br />
My regular partner is a cleric. We have a big lack of mana regen (at least, pre-MC), and are typically limited to a certain style of play. A battle taking one CH is more effective than fearkiting, and other than that there's little diversity. :) However, this isn't enough of a turnoff for us not to duo or to switch classes.</div></div><hr />
