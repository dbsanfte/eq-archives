<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Covi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can the eye come from any of the Amys? I noticed a difference between the Amy Knights that some had pets and HT'd and some didn't. Does the eye only come off the SK class Amys Knights?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Eye of the Dark God can drop from Amygdalan Knights (the SK ones with the little skeleton pets) or it can drop from the Amygdalan Warriors (warrior mobs with no pet and no HT).  The first time a bunch of my guild went to Fear in the past few weeks, to finish up Wizard epic 1.0 and Shaman epic 1.0, and try for a Ball of Everliving Golem for Warrior epic 1.0, we got two drops, one from a Knight and one from a Warrior that nearly rotted because nobody was checking the Warriors.<br />
<br />
Not sure why these people didn't just do the quest to skip the epic 1.0, but whatever, I got my Eye of the Dark God out of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>uannayven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I got my Eye off of a warrior that was roaming. I solo'd it np at all. Only hard part is getting it solo. I had 3 adds on me when I finished killing it. I feigned waited for a few seconds. looted, then gated my ass out of there.</div></div><hr />
