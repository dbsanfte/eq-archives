<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Darko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I realize this topic has been discussed before, however I think its time to resurrect it once again.<br />
<br />
After the utter disgust of watching my toon run like a special olympic’s marathon runner I have decided to give the old models a try.  The original reason I switched to the luclin char models is due to the fact that my unholy steed does not work on the old models.  <br />
<br />
I spent 1day so far using the old models and the change is huge.  The animations are smooth and life like, emotes are visible, armor textures look better and are far more plentiful allowing for a more unique look, the old armor textures look even better now with the dye system in place, and I just prefer the art style.  The biggest change was the reduced lag, I run a very decent PC, 2400 p4 512pc2700 ram gf4ti4200, yet in quite a few zones on raids I still get lag.  TimeA is especially bad, even with particles and spell effects completely off, with the old models however, with full spell effects/particles I was getting basically no lag.  <br />
<br />
 I know for fact that the majority of my guild either uses all old models, or only has enough models turned on to use a horse, horses are the only thing keeping people from enjoying the old models.  I for 1 spend 5aa, and this was in luclin, for my horse, and for it not be usable is a crime.  I don’t care what the horse looks like while using the old model, I only use horses to get from point A to point B which doesn’t take much time, infact make the horse invisible if that is easiest, but I would want the horses to be available when using old models.  I am sure this is not a difficult bug to fix, so it NEEDS to be done.<br />
<br />
At the very least I would like my 5AA back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>deddboy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I AGREE, I ALSO LIKE THE OLD SKINS BETTER. THERE IS MUCH LESS LAG, I ZONE QUICKER THAN FRIENDS WITH COMPS TWICE THE SPEED.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Drakonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I prefer the old model animations, but I still think the new models look physically better...  they do need more unique graphics on the armor though.<br />
<br />
Theres actually an option in an INI file to switch on Velious Textures with Luclin models, however its bugged as far as I know (or was last time I tried it), just screws up the graphics instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Malheur VonRane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have always disliked the new models. They look bad, they animate poorly, and they cause an inordinate amount of lag. I had human and erudite models for my horse also. I had had them on for a long time and hated every minute of it. I turned them off for an important raid recently and was surprised how much of a savings it was and have decided to leave them off. If I want to ride my horse I just turn on pact of hate and go. It is less convenient but I hardly use my horse anymore except to run to Plane of Earth from the book.<br />
<br />
Now I wish I could get my old erudite face back. Change face doesnt work for the old erudite model even though it works for others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jobrill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Actually,  face change worked for the old erudite models a few patches ago, It seems they disabled face change for all old models again last patch.<br />
<br />
Also, I'm weird. I prefer new models in about 75% of all cases. Animations aside, the facial expressions and overall build of the chars is more lifelike and just plain more badass than the blocky cartoonish old models.<br />
<br />
Also, since all skeletons are &quot;new&quot; model, you could get a Skeleton-Illussion and turn on horse models, and be able to use your horse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>retired-Redspot-Rallos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">When luclin came out and everybody started running to the stables for horse's, they were soon displeased. I just watched and was like dang...soon i found out why everybody was displeased.<br />
<br />
Thats why i keep my journey man boots, not as fast, but i can keep my old model...never went after the unholy steed either, basically because its common knowledge that if store bought horse's would make lag.. a steed would do the same thing...<br />
<br />
which i prefer to a model that slumps to its side and cause's lag.</div></div><hr />
