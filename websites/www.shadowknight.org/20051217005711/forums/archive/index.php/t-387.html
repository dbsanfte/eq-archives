<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mystina</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 01:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It sucks for soloing because as hybrids we need to med mana back, and you don't med while binding wounds :)<br />
In group or raid its totally useless for obvious reasons.<br />
Add on this that you loose sitting hp regen, wich is a +3 regen per tick bonus at 60 for a DE.<br />
Putting 3 points in regen is much much much better, since it doesnt require to carry 50 stacks of bandages and works while you med, while you fight, while you pull, while you cyber :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Being a shaman myself and an SK.... I could see maybe using it to build back shaman mana with canabalize4...<br />
<br />
That being said I probably won't bother...<br />

With a bandage dagger its semi viable, but you're usually better off medding/regenning hp, unless FM, in which case its best to tap another group's nearby mob, or an eye. <br />
<br />
Botom line: Very few situations where its useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Muggly</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 03:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">roger.  was just thinking it would be a bit more viable as an ogre with a hp pool, lower mana pool, and no natural regen.  i usually regen mana about 3x faster than health as a guestimate shrug.<br />
<br />
ps: yes i would have an embalmers skinning knife to make it more viable.<br />
<br />
pps: does aa regen only work while you are sitting?  or is it always on?  so with the first 3 points, would i now regen at 4 hp standing and 5 hp sitting?  or would it be 1 hp standing and 5 hp sitting?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CanizMortem</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 04:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">AAXP regen works for both standing and sitting.  As an iksar, each point is worth 2/tick, so an additional +6 standing and sitting at 55 is awesome (12 standing/18 sitting)  Oh yeah!<br />
Fungi tunic, what's that? :D</div></div><hr />
