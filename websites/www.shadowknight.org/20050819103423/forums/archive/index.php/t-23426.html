<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keevel</div><div class="date">11-01-2004, 04:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anyone on test try the mistmoore revamp yet?<br />
What levels is it?  40-50? 50-60? 60+?<br />
This was a fun fun zone ( and scary as hell, back in the day).<br />
Would be fun to go there again and see trains, especially if they keep in mobs that run when they first get hit and everything they pass trains you.<br />
Are all the mistmoore named in LFAY now or just the ones for epics and such?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lynxal</div><div class="date">11-01-2004, 04:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This was on the Shammie boards.....................<br />
<br />
<br />
Black Dire is in LFay now, along with just about every other old named in<br />
MM. He is unchanged. Hes actually an easier encounter now.<br />
<br />
MM is indeed revamped. Mobs are dark blue to a level 70. Nothing can be<br />
DC'd. They hit from 400-700. There are red conned named that hit from<br />
2000-3000 and had massive AE's. Few if any mid level named (ie Dark Blues).<br />
<br />
I did manage to 3 box a single Dark Blue named but it had 0 loot. Probably<br />
not itemized yet. Overall the zone is a heck of alot harder, but te aggro is<br />
still just as huge. The zone geometry makes MM a terrible candidate for a<br />
revamp. Pull one mob, always get 2-3. If you dont have PAC/Hamo/Lull,<br />
prepare for a CC/multiple mob fight every single time. <br />
<br />
As for invis to a camp, forget it, you have to fight in and fight out<br />
everytime. Some require ITU, some are regular invis. They are all mixed, you<br />
cant just run past 15 mobs invis since every other mob is every other type<br />
of invis.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bastards!<br />
<br />
I loved mistmoore, still go there. <br />
I loved droga and nurga too, before the revamps. <br />
That kinda sucks that they did that to mistmoore. /not happy<br />
<br />
dang, what about running through lesser fay as a wee little one doing an adventure? Are all those mobs outside going to agro? They had large agro ranges.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Naelyan</div><div class="date">11-03-2004, 12:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">On the chanter boards, they were saying a good idea would be to have an offshoot zone (like SolC, or ChardokB) that goes to the new, higher-end zone... the one idea I read even kinda made sense, go deep in the castle, click somewhere, and you're transported to an alternate plane made by Mistmoore himself (think that's what it was)... it would be a much better idea than wiping out a zone so many people like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eggborn</div><div class="date">11-03-2004, 01:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What about Ring of Scale faction?  Can it still be easily obtained within a week or two?<br />
<br />
I hope they don't get their paws on Kurns Tower.</div></div><hr />

We have a winner.</div></div><hr />

So now CC, Dalnir's and where for 20's to 30's without the asshats on the moon?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kahntun Derstand</div><div class="date">11-04-2004, 07:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Geez, they already revamped Paw once.</div></div><hr />

Time to work on faction if you dont have VP key and pile up the bone chips  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cames</div><div class="date">11-04-2004, 09:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I kill the King in Kaladim when I am bored.  He is easy and the faction has been nerfed, but dorf killing satisfies in a way that killing in MM does not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arikash</div><div class="date">11-05-2004, 10:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So does that mean that my shield(see invis one from MM) will be worth a shit load of plat cuz it won't drop?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnar Gnar</div><div class="date">11-05-2004, 11:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nope, its not from MM its from City of Mist :) . (unless dropped during a gm event in MM or was added to drop tables). <br />
<br />
That shield was my biggest wish item during Kunark and was so damn rare to see. I never got one had to suffer with a sarnak battle shield and in keeping with the MM thread the sbs replaced my crested mistmoore shield :).<br />
<br />
Splitpaw revamped again  :confused: A few years ago there was talk about a Permafrost revamp and it never happened. I would rather see these revamps done like the sol c and chardok b.</div></div><hr />
