I&lt;3 Race discussion.  It's fun watching people get offended over what imaginary race they should be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>shadowX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I agree about the race discussion being fun.  As an intellectually superior Erudian, I often laugh at my troll and ogre brethren in their struggles to comprehend....much of anything.<br />

I hate race discussions as well, don't ask someone else to make your mind up for you. <br />
<br />
So should race discussion be about which race has the most talented women in matters of marital relations?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Meneltel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">No, it should be about who runs the fastest without SoW on, and i dont think its the ogres, they are too busy scratching their butts and waddle too much to win the race.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Chayde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Race discussions should be more along the lines of:<br />
<br />
&quot;Ogres have big feet, and big hands, enough said&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Trolls are a bit green and lumpy, but hey the more bumps the better&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Iksar have that tongue thing going for them&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Haflings, Dwarves, and Gnomes are just the right sizes to walk right up and get into it&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;High elves have ears to hold on to&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wood elves prance around trees holding hands wishing the world would just get along&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Humans sit around and watch, cause they only wish they had more qualities&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dark elves perform all the sneaky back door tricks&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Barbarians like to slam things&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Frogloks are the over active bouncy sort.....&quot;<br />
<br />
and &quot;Erudites have read every book on the subject, so they know what they are doing........ in theory.... &quot;<br />
