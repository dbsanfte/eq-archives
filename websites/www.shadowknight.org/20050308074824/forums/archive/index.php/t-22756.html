Or they might have put him in for me so I can get faction and hang out with the tavern wenches. Doubt it though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Azzyenya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">can confirm this. Also at the bottom of the luggald caves is the captain he talks about. He hits for 631 at tops for me and hit me with a 500dd right in the begining. not perma rooted, summons at 96 % health, also procs Nightmare Stasis-a snare. and Reckless mutterings, some kind of dot</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>GorranVZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I just duo boxed me(SK) and a shaman and tried out the captain.  Was really easy, he has like 2 ae's the only thing I could tell was that they affect the cast time and slow your attack speed.  I'm sorry I didn't pay to much attention to the AE's I was more worried about keeping alive and stuff becuase I had no idea what the mob might do.  Heals were landing for full and mana was never an issue on the fight.  He does hit for 600's but not very often, he usually hits for around 100ish.  He's a runner at like 19% and is unsnareable so keep your HT until the end.  He dropped the Ancient Flamberge or whatever its called that the guy asks for AND after you loot the corpse a chest will pop up.  Do the usual /open and a loot is inside.  I got this belt from it. http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v178/gorranvz/dcbod.jpg<br />
<br />
Edit: its 115 mana on the belt.  Sorry should've expanded my loot window.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Marruk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">We killed Captain Varns last night.  His AE(s) do snare/slow and also slows spell casting times.  He also rampages<br />
<br />
He dropped a No Drop Ancient Flamberge of Hate; class: none, race: none.  No stats.  Looks very much like an epic-drop.  I'm hoping,that it is one of ours.<br />
<br />
After I looted the no drop, his corpse dissolved, leaving a chest.  Very cool feature, that (even though the chest had a Human graphic!), especially since we were very disappointed with the lack of equippable drops for a rather tough fight.<br />
<br />
In the chest was an attuneable belt.  Unfortunately, my screen shots are all black, so I don't have the name or exact stats here at work (I won the roll again, though, yay me!).<br />
Stats were very close to: <br />
18ac, 15dex, 15sta, 13cha, 12wis, 12int, 115hp, 90m, 18cold,17fire, 10poison, 10disease, +10 attack.  I was too busy celebrating to notice the aug slot type.<br />
<br />
Edit- definitely a different belt from the one posted above; classes were Pal/Shd/Brd/Rng (no warrior!), iirc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ritald says 'Greetings, dark one.  Do you feel it?  I am sure you do.  Innoruuk's voice is so distant now.  His voice is merely a whisper.  This disturbs me greatly.  How will the evil ones do their master's bidding without his dark guidance?  I fear the end is almost near for true champions of darkness such as yourself.  We cannot let that happen!  I believe I know of a way to slow down the diminishing of our master's voice.  There is a sword of great evil.  It is however not of this world.  I believe I can summon it to this plane of existence, but I will need several items first.  Will you [take on this task]?  Your future and the future of all our dark brethren depends on obtaining this sword!'<br />
<br />
You say, 'i will take on this task'<br />
<br />
Ritald says 'Excellent.  There is no time to waste.  The first item I need is an ancient flamberge of hatred.  I believe a trollish pirate named, Captain Varns, here in Dulak's Harbor is in possession of one. Destroy him and return this item to me.  The second item is an essence of hate.  You should be able to find such an essence in the Plane of Hate.  The last item I need is a stormborn phylactery.  You should be able to find one in the Plane of Storms.  When you have all these items, hand them to me so that I may begin the summoning of the sword.'<br />
<br />
Dude wasn't up on inny, so I couldnt kill him~  farming in hate now, but the drop is probably off the deeper mobs, or as rare as hide used to be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Marruk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Very nice!  Thanks, Kalendrox.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kalendrox Grimblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">depending on those AEs and the proc rate on the 500DD, dude in dulak might be soloable.  Probably like trakanon minus the 1500 lifetap, but probablyn with more HPs.  i'll parse it when I find him up.<br />
<br />
As this is epic 2.0 (or 1.5, whatever) it wouldnt suprise me if the Essence of Hate dropped from Innoruuk.  Drop from Storm might come from named (that would be nice) or Lords (not as nice) or Final boss (who the hell kills him anyways, only drops 1 thing)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>GorranVZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">For the stormborn phylactery there is a mob named Olidan in PoStorms.  I read this off of Allah's section in the PoStorms info area.  So I went to check it out yesterday and found him located in the same Building as Faurek the Bold.  I dunno if he drops it, but could be a good start.  He was red to me at 66, it was late and I didn't have the kahuna's to go give his melee/possible AE a test drive.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is a named (Incantator Cawrolis) who spawns in there as well, but all can be single pulled.  Cawrolis is somewhat tougher, and I'm not 100% sure I could solo him, but he's pretty much fodder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Zugbuzz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Killed Olidan in PoS with 2 groups and he dropped nothing. Was a fairly easy fight, same thing as was said above but he didn't drop anything for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Kruggan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Okay I'll lend my experience to the fight with Captain Varns.  I've tried him twice today and failed both times.  The first time I was 2-boxing my lvl 65 shaman and the second time I was 3-boxing my 65 Shaman and 65 Cleric with me (65 SK, 45 AAs, about 8k HP buffed).  <br />
<br />
The first time was just a nightmare, as he resisted my slows.  He chewed us down in about 30 seconds.  I also underestimated him.<br />
<br />
The second time went much better but still was no picnic.  I got him to 20% before coughing up a lung.  This time I got him slowed immediately.  The cleric and shaman both took AE dmg (500 if i remember correctly) and had their casting times slowed by the Nightmare Stasis AE.  I was swinging my Cudgel of Venemous Hatred about as fast as a gnome in molasses.  I hit him with a few DoT's and shortly after the battle began, I realized 2 things:  First, the shaman pet was dead due to the AE dmg.  Secondly, I had forgotten to memorize Zevfeer's Bite (nice job Kruggan).  Varns rampages pretty often.  His hit points aren't the problem.  The AE slow is the problem.  The battle was pretty much a heal fest up until around 50% life for him.  Around that time I realized that it was a lost cause, as my cleric and shaman were around 30% mana.  I think the delayed casting made me waste a lot of mana.  Plus, the simple fact is, that a 50% slowed SK and no pets is pretty bad DPS, even with some DoTs from the shammy.  So at 50% life, I figured, what the heck, and burned my HT (around 9k) which put him at 27% health.  At this point, everyone was hovering around 25% health and almost no mana.  I gated the shaman and cleric and bit the dust with him around 20%.<br />
<br />
I don't have Radiant Cure 3, so I'm not sure if Nightmare Stasis is curable or not.  However, his AE seems to go off roughly every 60 seconds, so even if I could get it cured once, it's pretty moot.  It's also unresistable per Lucy.  Next time I'm gonna add a 61 BST and 62 Druid to the mix and see if I can pull it off.<br />
<br />
Any input is appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Uvaavu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Interesting. My fight went slightly different - Just me and my 65 cleric. <br />
<br />
I did a trial run to test if it was gonna be possible (and it looked like it was) so I buffed up (I'm about 8-8.5k without shaman buffs) and memmed a tap, a spear, BoH, AoP and ZBite. Pulled with AoP and unloaded mana basically.<br />
<br />
Timing the CH's carefully (the AE slow is also a cast time increaser - seems to be about 50% or so) definately helped as its a long fight with our crappy slowed dps.<br />
<br />
I was running low on Mana (on the SK not Cleric) once he hit 30% so hit the HT and took him to 9%. At which point he ran and i ended up with 7/8 luggalds beating on me (not that thats a problem as they're mostly light blue).<br />
<br />
He died on the stairs of the next room. Et voila.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Krushum Gudended</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">did it with shaman and sk, pulled with malos, slowed easy, sham never dropped below 75% mana and i was burning with the sk</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Marruk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">His AE seemed to go off a lot more often that once every 60 seconds (the one with the snare icon, that is; the other AE seemed to be less frequent, but I was too busy spamming spells on him to check which effect was which).<br />
<br />
I can't imagine much else in the epic is as easy as this guy was (not that we had a particularly easy time of it).<br />
<br />
Oh, and for what its worth, the Luggalds in the room are not dire charmable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Xanathol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Tried this guy late last night, just me and my boxed druid, just to test it out. Easy solo harmony pull. Willsapper wouldn't proc for me for shit, so no slow. I put the pet on page duty, but when combined with the AE, it proved too much for his skinny ass. Since I had no idea what to expect at the time, the casting time increase hurt me, so had to result to burning quick heals. Eventually, with that #@$ AE, I couldn't channel a spell to build aggro with, so the druid got summoned and ate. Still, with the attack decrease, etc, I got him to 84%, and I only used AoP, ZB, AoH, ToI, &amp; aggro spells ( neglected to BoH or SoD since I was trying to tap to patch heal ). Really not bad, but not a walk in the park for the unsuspecting.</div></div><hr />

I ran out to COM and found a human Lhranc looking guy laying on the ground near the Lhranc house/goo house. I believe his name was Kilinda, or something similar.  He's not in Alla's beastiary yet.  I'm told he's a level 60 shadowknight mob.<br />
<br />
When I hailed him, he groaned in pain.  I tried a few key phrases, &quot;What pain&quot; &quot;what sword&quot; &quot;I have the will of innoruuk&quot; &quot;get off the ground you pussy paladin&quot; etc and no further response.<br />
<br />
I went out to Kerra Isle, remembering that Marl was our final turn in NPC in COM, but he wasn't up yet.  IIRC, he should spawn some time tomorrow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Kalendrox Grimblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Here's what ive found so far~<br />
<br />
I havent finished 1.0, Sienn KAstane will not talk to me.<br />
<br />
Dude in Dulak will talk to me (and apparently every SK).<br />
<br />
Current working theory is that the quest given by the guy in Dulak is if you have not completed epic 1.0. (Side note, essence of hate is random off any named, like SEoC)<br />
<br />
Following that logic, Sienn Kastane starts epic 1.5 and/or 2.0</div></div><hr />

What are you smoking, sir? Did you bring enough for the whole class?<br />

<br />
So. I posted about Olidan. You're talking about Captain Varns. <br />
<br />
Varns drops the piece seemingly every time, and a nice, Attuneable 110ish hp drop (in my case, an Ancient Champion's Girdle).<br />
<br />
Olidan drops an epic piece. Sometimes. Not always. That's all he drops. I think it's silly that he'd drop it only sometimes, given that's the only reason anyone would ever kill him.<br />
<br />
Hope that makes things perfectly clear.</div></div><hr />

Here's your quest text from POK:<br />
<br />
[Wed Sep 15 21:54:21 2004] You say, 'Hail, Sienn Kastane'<br />
[Wed Sep 15 21:54:22 2004] Sienn Kastane says 'You.  You are the one I have seen in my visions.'  Sienn removes a dark blade from a scabbard.  I have just obtained this sword from one of my apprentices.  This blade may be the key to the very existence of the shadowknight.  Are you familiar with what has [been transpiring]?'<br />
[Wed Sep 15 21:54:37 2004] You say, 'What has been transpiring?'<br />
[Wed Sep 15 21:54:37 2004] Sienn Kastane places her hands upon your forehead.  A gravelly voice that is clearly not Sienn's fills your mind.  'Do you feel it?  I am sure you do.  Innoruuk's voice is so distant now.  His voice is merely a whisper.  This disturbs me greatly.  How will the evil ones do their master's bidding without his dark guidance?

'That was the voice of [Ritald], a luggald in the service of the dark lord, Innoruuk.<br />
[Wed Sep 15 21:55:07 2004] You say, 'What items?'<br />
[Wed Sep 15 21:55:07 2004] Sienn Kastane says 'Your first task is to find a tome.  The sword has told me of a tome that details its history.  I do not know where this tome might be, but I suggest you talk to Grand Librarian Maelin here in the Plane of Knowledge.  He may have more information on this tome.  When you find it, return it to me.'<br />
[Wed Sep 15 21:55:10 2004] You say, 'Who is Ritald?'<br />
[Wed Sep 15 21:55:11 2004] Sienn Kastane says 'Ritald is a luggald in the service of Innoruuk.  He is concerned about the future of the shadowknight now that the gods no longer answer our prayers.'<br />

[Wed Sep 15 21:58:21 2004] You say, 'What tome'<br />
[Wed Sep 15 21:58:22 2004] Grand Librarian Maelin says 'Yes, I seem to recall having such a tome.  But evil it is.  I don't hand out such dangerous knowledge to just anyone.  However. . . I am curious about something and perhaps you can help me.  A prominent professor of biology and I have a bet as to how a certain creature from the Realm of Discord, known as a murkglider breeds.  He believes they give live birth, and I believe they are egg layers.  Unfortunately, I have been so busy here, that I have not been able to make arrangements to travel there and observe the creatures more.  If you could travel to the Realm of Discord and [find an egg] for me, I will give you the book you seek.'<br />
[Wed Sep 15 21:58:48 2004] You say, 'Where can I find an egg?'<br />
[Wed Sep 15 21:58:48 2004] Grand Librarian Maelin says 'I appreciate your help with this!  The creature I was supposed to study are most commonly known as murkgliders.  The easiest way to describe them is that they look like large, floating octopuses. See if you can hunt down any breeding murkgliders and return an egg to me that I can study.  You might want to bring some companions along, as this might be a dangerous task.'<br />

You could miss it easy, as the entrance to the area is up the wall a bit. I got AE'd while mapping during Beta, its surrounded by smaller reg murkgliders. Ae was, 800ish Dot in causeway. I died for sure, will have to check my logs to see what happened. The WoS one sounds very probable as well. These are the only big ones I know of from Beta.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Tumnayar DiSalvo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Nobody knows, but there is a REASON why Sienn Kastane will only talk to those WITH epic 1.0 and she also mentions speaking with Ritald. So her mentioning his name and only speaking to those with epic 1.0 would mean that part is also required.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Talonmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Unless of course, the parts you get to skip for having 1.0 are the three parts Ritald sends you out to collect.  Im betting when you turn the 3 items in to him he tells you to talk to this chick.<br />
<br />
In any event, it should be easy enough to figure out...<br />
<br />
As for the Muckgliders, I spend a good bit of time killing them yesterday in Noble's Causeway.  Group was me, 65 Bard, 66 Shaman, 66 Druid, had no problem killing them.  Druids in my guild were quadding them for a bit.  I saw no eggs there though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Ahlana DaFosse</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">Ahh well better to have it down then not I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Ahlana DaFosse</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">My best shot is this based on who I talked to and the items i have colelcted.<br />
<br />
The three items requested will be turned into A filler for Inny's Curse(if not the weapo as it is, I have heard there are new alternative ways to get 1.0 and beting this first part is it)<br />
<br />
After you have given the 3 parts and recieved your sword you may then talk to the SK Gm in PoK for the next part. (Notice how she says that the sword has told her about the tome)<br />
<br />
This is my prediction and as I already have 1.0 , I will know if it is true in a day or so . Olidan was stingy and didnt give it up tonight.. But as soon as I get it $$<br />
<br />
Like I said based on everything I have read here, done in game myself, and seen about other quest. This is the best educated decision on what the first part of the quest is about.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Darkmourn D`Estrellas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">When I was running around checking out the new zones Tuesday night I specifically remember seeing a Murkglider Breeder.  It was in a room filled with other Murkgliders and I almost ran right into and was totally worried that it would see invis.  It did not.  I checked my logs, and it was in the Ruined City of Dranik zone.  If you pull up the map to that zone, you'll notice 2 areas in the north (one NE and one NW) where hallways are broken up by squarish rooms.  It was in one of those squarish rooms, I am positive of it, because I was running through looking to get to whatever named might be at the end.  I *think* it was in the NE one, as I went to the NW one first and looked at the Battlemaster guy, and came to the NE one last.<br />

Would you by any chance have a loc on that mob, or some info on how tough he is.<br />
<br />
Also, we took down Captain Varns at the end of the Luggard caves last night...we had a group of 6 (65s-66's) and were never in any real trouble. He has an AE melee slow and an AE casting slow, so it may be prudent to keep your casters / healers further back and attack the mob at his spawn point.<br />
<br />
He hits max of 550 (I am a LDON / bazaar geared toon) and tripled on occasion...never saw an quad hits from him. He does RAMPAGE alot though.<br />
<br />
He dropped a nice FT2 / stat cloak for DRU / WIZ / ENC / NEC for us along with the sword.</div></div><hr />

I have to apologize, I was way off on it's location.  It is in the SW corner of the map, where 2 circular rooms are joined by hallways cutting through a mountain.  The location for one of the rooms is -730, 870.  That is the room where I saw the Breeder, however both rooms and the halls are filled with murkgliders, so I wouldn't be surprised if any of them could spawn it.  If it's a designated spawn in one spot, I am 90% certain I saw it in that room I gave the loc for, so concentrate on clearing out that room first.  <br />
<br />
I won't be able to make the attempt at it until some time next week, so hopefully someone will take a group there and get it to spawn so we can see if it drops an egg.  I would bet money that is the mob we want.  Good luck :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u87"><b>Furiousgeorge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p87">ok did turn in here is a log of what happend and a link to Innoruks Voice:<br />
<br />
        <br />
Ritald says 'Greetings, dark one.  Do you feel it?  I am sure you do.  Innoruuk's voice is so distant now.  His voice is merely a whisper.  This disturbs me greatly.  How will the evil ones do their master's bidding without his dark guidance?  I fear the end is almost near for true champions of darkness such as yourself.  We cannot let that happen!  I believe I know of a way to slow down the diminishing of our master's voice.  There is a sword of great evil.  It is however not of this world.  I believe I can summon it to this plane of existence, but I will need several items first.  Will you [take on this task]?  Your future and the future of all our dark brethren depends on obtaining this sword!''<br />
	<br />
You say, 'i will take on this task'<br />
	<br />
Ritald says 'Excellent.  There is no time to waste.  The first item I need is an ancient flamberge of hatred.  I believe a trollish pirate named, Captain Varns, here in Dulak's Harbor is in possession of one. Destroy him and return this item to me.  The second item is an essence of hate.  You should be able to find such an essence in the Plane of Hate.  The last item I need is a stormborn phylactery.  You should be able to find one in the Plane of Storms.  When you have all these items, hand them to me so that I may begin the summoning of the sword.'	<br />
<br />
Hand in the the 3 items and voila: <br />
      <br />
Ritald says 'You have done well.  The flamberge you have brought to me will act as a vessel for the summoning of the sword.  The essence of hate will help generate hatred needed to fuel the summoning, and the phylactery should hopefully help contain that hate to be used in the summoning.'  Ritald holds the flamberge above his head with both hands and begins to chant.  Dark storm clouds gather overhead as a flash of lightning momentarily blinds you.  When you regain your sight, Ritald holds the summoned sword of Innoruuk's Voice.  'I [have done it]!''	<br />
	<br />
You say, 'have done it'<br />
	<br />
Ritald says 'This sword known as Innoruuk's Voice emanates great evil.  It should help to generate enough evil to sustain the mysterious powers that make one a shadowknight.  It is not at full power yet however.  I am now trusting you to take this sword and help to recover its full power.  You will be its new champion.  Take it to Sieen Kastane in the Plane of Knowledge.  I believe she should be able to help you with returning the sword to its full power.'<br />

There's a murkglider with a different name then all the other ones, I dont remember offhand, but he was also smaller.  Perhaps this is the PH for the breeder.

<br />
Doubt he would tell you to take friends if it were for a ground spawn.  It's pretty hard to waste time looking for ground spawns too. It's a very dangerous area to hang around in just for kicks, if invis pops you'll find yourself in a lot of trouble.  Things move fast for jellyfish, &amp; they have snare capabilities.

Sienn Kastane says 'What is this?! This sword contains great power! I can feel its hate.' Sienn runs her hand down the flat of the blade and closes her eyes. She appears to have gone into a trance. 'These are the times of prophecy when gods fall silent and a champion of evil must be found. The very existence of the shadowknight may become yet a legend if champion is not found.' Sienn opens her eyes. 'I beleive you are to become that champion. Your fist task is to find a tome.  The sword has told me of a tome that details its history. I do not know where this tome might be, but I suggest you talk to grand Librarian Maelin here in the plane of knowledge.He may have more information on this tome.

Im new to the SK boards, have spent alot of time reading over stuff but never really felt the need to post myself, but with the introduction of new content that I can actually help on i felt the need to. So anyway, Took down the Captain guy tonight,  First time we tried it we had a bst slowing and a druid healer, and 3 tanks dpsing.... We were doing great, mob is cake, just we were short of dps, ran the druid oom and we wiped shortly after. Second time was great, brought plenty of backup, really overkill, but was fun nonetheless. I cant remember exactly what was in the chest, but was a priest neck item with IH 4 and some nice stats. Anyway, just posting to say that this guy is a pushover, and I am glad they have this alternative to epic 1.0, because this seems to be much easier than completing the original would be.</div></div><hr />

Spawned 6 adds in top hallway on 3rd try, killed us, I ran back from time dial and babies were still up in hallway, and Mommy was at her spawn. So the evac thing should work well.  If no Evac, clear everything around her and run her off away from group. Then HS and get as many adds to spawn as you can.  Have someone then drag you back to group and rez you and she should be back at spawn point emptied.  May even be able to get an FD off  as HS fades.  I invented this.</div></div><hr />

The trick is to first agro him and train him around to make all 6 adds pop. You can kite him multiple times or do all 6 in one run. The problem is that him or one of his buddies can snare. Then Zone/fd/CoH and single pull him. The best single pull method is Bestow DA + Pet pull. If he comes solo he isnt all that bad, I did him with sk clr enc wiz mag pal.<br />

He spawns in the northmost of the 2 murkglider rooms. He was up when i got there so i dont know what the camp is like.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A nice tangent, but does it have anything to do with your original question? not really.<br />
<br />
Your original question asked about some 50k + Original epic nonsense, of which the &quot;nice map&quot; shows nothing. Since the nice map doesn't show it, it does, in fact, answer your question. No, you cannot do that.<br />
<br />
Your next concerns are as yet unanswered - I've heard of noone that has confirmed no other intermediate steps based on their not having done the Epic 1.0. I highly doubt it.<br />
<br />
Your final statement of disbelief is also irrational: you state it as though doing 3 things equals doing the original epic. As far as I can tell, nobody originally did the epic 1.0 with the thought that one day it would let them skip a few parts of epic 1.5. A few people worked on the epics more recently, now utterly trivial to do for most, in hopes of huge chunks of skipped content when hearing of the promise of having 1.0 letting you skip &quot;some parts.&quot;<br />
<br />
The correct demeanor is that having the Epic, long banked/bagged, is merely a bonus - a tip of the hat to those who went through it. Forcing someone to do a quest as irrelevant in reward as the original Epic just to be able to get the new one is ridiculous.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I can't agree with this more. Shield block firmly dumps us into the &quot;it's way better if you have a great 1h/shield most of the time&quot; category.<br />
<br />
I was always torn between what, if any, melee AAs to get: those that let me do more with a 2hander? But I ought to be tanking with a 1h/shield! The bashing increases (mostly relevant to 1h/shield?)? Not all that great if I'm using a 2hander!<br />
<br />
So I went with neither and suck at both. The obvious answer is to get both, and sort it out with the gear as it presents itself... well, now we have the &quot;EPIC!&quot; suddenly somewhat relevant again. But what the hell? It's a 2hander, and it doesn't appear to swap back and forth a la the warrior epic 1.0.......<br />
<br />
It's got this sweet lifetap focus on it.... but what the hell, if it's *better than* shield blocking, it renders that aa line useless. If it's not, it renders the epic a dps only (if that) inventory swap out click.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u124"><b>Krazaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p124">Devs said having epic 1.0 would let you bypass a few early steps in the new epic quest.<br />

I seriously doubt there will be any other steps skipped.<br />
<br />
It's not that raw of a deal, I've had IC for over 3 years, skipping a few annoying steps at the beginning was a nice reward.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u125"><b>Chania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p125">Look at it this way... If the Epic was good for full bore damage AND tanking, you'd never need to loot another weapon for a long time... thats kinda anti-climactic. This way, you'll still want to loot 1h's and good shields to tank the really tough stuff, all other duties the Epic: DPS duty and easier hitting mobs. Oh, and clicky group leechcurse :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u126"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p126">So? Wizard, druid, clr, mage, necro, etc  would pick up their epic and use it 100% of the time and won't loot any other piece for long time. Why should we be any difference?

That being said I would assume epic 2.0 will be enhanced to the point of where it will ake us shit a brick. why because it will make you forget 1h/shield or give you the option to make it a 1her.<br />
<br />
just my 2 cp.<br />
<br />
now as far as the 'annoying' step you get to skip with epic 1.0. I have to agree you did epic 1.0 congrats yet again. you get to skip 3 moderate difficulty steps and get epic 1.5. now if you were like me you get to go kill 3 more mobs(if your lucky) and skip that long ass worthless 1.0 quest. <br />
<br />
As a side note I think the devs decided to give the 1.0'ers the ability to skip a few steps simply to make it as a reward for thoose that have played EQ longer. As thoose that have played longer would most likely have their epics. Kinda moote to do that and then advertise it widely though...../sigh stupid EQ PR men...</div></div><hr />

<br />
PRE EP... what are you talking about?<br />
<br />
The 1.5. epic is superior to time weapons. Better ratio, better effects, more ac, more hp. It's so much more than you would ever need for PoP content. For someone without higher end GoD gear the 1.5 epic will be their best item far and away.<br />
<br />
You may get a tiny rise in tankability doing EP stuff with a basalt bulwark and some crap pre-time 1h but it I would never take it over the gigantic dps upgrade of using the 1.5 epic. <br />
<br />
When I finally get the 1.5 I plan on using it most of the time (and not just because it looks cool) because where I am now (reflagging a broken guild for EP) a shield is kinda overkill. And because Vanazir is kind of a non-option for a DPS weapon when of your Warrior tanks theres only two left with DBoTW.<br />
<br />
A shield is never going to be like a warrior doing /disc defensive... it's something you wear on meaner stuff to give a small % margin in favour of your healers vs the 'oh crap' factor.</div></div><hr />

Getting to the glooms in PoN...Get buffed up real good get sow  not SoE ofcorse b/c you gotta swin into the entrance to cave this is optional but i hit my resist Disc the second time i ran b/c i found the nukes are what was getting me the first time but as soon as your on dry land summon up your AA steed an hall ass make the first right.<br />
<br />
 when you get to the platform go left youll see three rocks head to them its inbetween the 2 glooms on that side, F/D an then your set let the mobs forget about you stand up an solo them s.o.b's have your 2 highest life taps up they cant be snared i used the A/C tap to pull then used Attack Tap threw a Blood of pain on it an Bond of death by that time the A/C tap will be fadeing RUN i got on horse an made small circles let the dots do there thing then get a litle bit of a lead on him stop an Cast A/C tap again an then Chain Life tap an beat him down.<br />

Just bring a cleric with you, have him stay below the ledge he dont need to join you upstairs, his heals reach you...<br />
If you have a horse just run up on the ledge and FD.<br />
Horses are on a 90 min respawn. Got mine off the first horse in the second round.<br />
<br />
a rolling plain steed - 10-15 kills and I got 2 to drop.<br />
<br />
Amydgalan Knight - Run into fear solo, make sure that golems and CT aint up.<br />
Run to the back of the temple have all the shit agro you bring em outside the fire ring , snare one of them FD, wait for the message that your enemies forgot about you, kill mob. Repeat.</div></div><hr />

Have not heard much discussion except that it drops from Mistress of Malevolence and Overlord R'Gahbsa in POH. <br />
<br />
Question is: Do people get a tracker to find these mobs. Is one mob or the other easier? Read that the mistress, lvl 61 mob,could be a 6 hr camp, to get her to show up. This means that there is a ph for the mistress? Although is an easy mob, is finding, camping her a pain?<br />
<br />
On the other hand seems there is no ph for the Overlord of R'Gahbsa so it would be easier to do this one, as he is just there waiting for the Sk to come and get her. The Overlord is a lvl 65 mob. I think possible an Sk can do with a healer. <br />

Had a ranger friend come add dps for part of it.  Respawn in Hate is 30 mins.  Can pet pull PH with np (especially now that they don't die on invis; can bypass the downstairs mob).<br />
<br />
Camped him for 8 hours one day with no named spawn (was actually camping all 6 or so T4 named).  Camped Mistress for about 4 hours with no named spawn another day (got a couple of other named to spawn, but they didn't drop the essence).  Camped Overlord again for about 3 hours, and he finally spawned.</div></div><hr />

Seems like a lot of sitting around. What mob do you kill for the spams?<br />
<br />
Any mob?<br />
<br />
<br />
Is there any exp gained during this waiting time that makes this camping good, so it not all lost in the waiting?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
For this long wait I would say prolly 2 boxing my cleric would be a better idea than take a whole group of people and make them wait for this long of a time.<br />
<br />
Seems is sort of a road block to get this piece, time wise, I mean.<br />
<br />
Many other things I could be doing rather than just sit and wait this long to see if the mob shows up.<br />
<br />
I think for some reason SOE finds a way to screw things up and make me just not do this epic. Part of the reason why I did not finish epic one was the long camping/ drop situation. This waiting long hours non end is just not very palatable to me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u156"><b>Ganodoar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p156">Hey there Kritr. I do recommend you bring a group up to hate personally. However, you should xp in tier 4 and camp the overlord and other tier 4 named. From what I read before the Dread Lord in tier 4 has been reported to have been dropping the essence of hate as well.<br />
<br />
The exp isn't too shabby personally and only gates, oow, tactics and elemental planes surpass tier 4 hate in terms of xp. I was getting 1 percent every 6 kills from the trash in tier 4 and named in tier 4 gave 1 percent. In terms of aaxp at 65 group mates were reporting 2-2.5 percent aa per kill and the mobs themselves are jokes. The trash only hit for 600ish max and named only hit 800ish max. Their low hp values are really what makes them truly easy, especially the casters.<br />
<br />
Also don't forget kritr that camping the tier 4 named is also good to collect marsinger gem quest pieces if anyone you know is doing the quest. You can collect 4 birds with 1 stone by having a group slaughtering the tier 4 area (crests from gravelords for gem 2, books for gem 3 and 4 and the essence of hate). I just need compendium of classic torture and writ of agony and will finally have marsinger's glimmering gem.<br />
<br />
Good luck on the quest and hopefully you get the drops. It made me feel bad when I killed overlord twice and mistress once and all the essences rotted since there weren't any sks around who needed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u157"><b>Bumluk Rayrspaun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p157">T4 xp really is pretty good, and it obviously gets better as you add dps (you and your boxed cleric could likely handle it alone, but who doesn't like dps?).  The more dps you add, the more named/ph's you can keep up with.  Mobs drop decent pp, too (like in the range of 10pp per mob).<br />
<br />
There is a map with the locations of named somewhere in this forum, and it lists which mob is the PH.</div></div><hr />

Mob pops randomly, is dark blue to 63, and has no special attacks or defenses.

You can now access the Plane of Hate by talking to Relm M'Loch in the Plane of Tranquility and handing her a Fuligan Soulstone. * <br />

The stones are sold in the Neriak Cleric guild from Dvis Zexus. He is all the way in Neriak 3rd gate.<br />

Read that you can buy from a wizard channeler in the POK library but seems this may not be correct. <br />

Kritr<br />
<br />
 :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok Its simple, Really it is i felt the same way as you kinda lost an confused as to what exactlyi should be killing as far as PH's an or what camps spawn what named mob.<br />
<br />
((Hint)) All the Named pretty much spawn on the 2nd floor of buildings.<br />
<br />
The mistress Camp is VERY close to the overlord camp, i had a Bstl, Chanter helping me an we went from camp to camp clearing PH's for mistress an the overlord, clear the area for the Overlord includeing the buildign across from it for a named spawns there as well doesnt drop the essence but its xp an loot then invis an hall ass to the Mistress camp it is literaly 5 secs away from overlord, clear that area i ussually ran down a ways an cleared the Golem PH just to see if i can get named to spawn so at this time you have 4 PH's cleared an the spawns take 30 min so after you clear Mistress an Golem PH's invis an go back to the overlord camp, Rinse an repeat till you get your drop or get so pissed at the drop rate you give up an decide to do your orriginal epic. <br />
<br />
i did this for 9 hours straight, i was not being slow about it either i was pulling fullspeed keeping PH's dead for both the mistress an the overlord an got mistress to spawn  ONE time in that 9 hour camp an the overlord ZERO, an i got the dreadlord to spawn TWICE an he is the one that is across from overlord.<br />
<br />
PH for mistress is a Malevolent Banshee, 2nd floor of building with ONE other mob witch makes the split easy the overlord PH is a Warlord of Hate, 2nd floor with 2 other mobs ussually an Assasin of Hate an a Sorcerer of Hate pretty easy split but with enchanter i was pulling all 3 she would charm one an mezz other an i would be smacking the shit out of the third i sujjest you go to the Walkthrough Webpage thats in this forum like {Page} 2 of the epic forum its got a Really nice map with Both PH's Clearly marked an made this camp really easy for me to find.<br />
<br />
An as far as being spoon fed this drop it wont happen Bro its a long Shitty camp with no real rewards worth the time exept actually obtaining the essence so good luck an hope you get your essence of hate soon  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
 I was going to go to poh last night after our daily raid but got too late and   instead went to do some exp in mpg. I love those good AA camps there.<br />
<br />
Anyways I was getting the impression from the little info I read before your post that this was going to be one of those cumbersome SOE ideas of what an epic would be. Camp the hell out of you and bore you to death.<br />
<br />
Sort of reminds me of when I did the Crown of Deceit quest. It was long and cumbersome.<br />
<br />
This is a good post from you, thanks man. Now I need to get there and see for how long I can stand this. This may be the part that I may decide just to stop this epic. <br />
<br />
Addendum: someone suggested to take a group of people there to hunt with you. It makes sense the more dps the more chances of getting the spawn. <br />
<br />
But my concern is: Who would put their friends to do a 6-9 hour camp?<br />
Wow... SOE has a nice way to see friendships, or break them....hmmm...<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u169"><b>Kritr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p169">Yikes... where do I start.<br />
<br />
As I already mentioned I have only been in poh for someone else's raids or affairs, never for anything I wanted. Had no real reason to go there, so never had a real desire to TL there or find a stone.<br />
Now with the epic is a different story as this is sort of a road block, in a way.<br />
<br />
So finally last night after raiding I decided to box my cleric and just explore a bit. I went there and there is no map I can use, except the printed one I had. Mapfiend does not have an ingame map.<br />
<br />
Did explore some but invis did not work too well as the undead kept me on my toes. Actually had 5 mobs hitting me at one time, had to be sure I got the aggro off the cleric and at one point I thought I was not going to make it. Five mobs on me and my cleric was 1/2 dead. Well, I  finally made it and killed them all but it was a very energizing situation to say the least. <br />
<br />
As it was late I just gated out of there and will give it another shot when I can have more time to study the map and see which is the easiest way to get to these mobs. It appears to be that these mobs I need are deep into the zone. <br />
<br />
Question that I have for those that have already done this or have been to poh regularly: Is there a safe, easier way to get to the overlord or the mistress? Invis is not that great as undead make it hard and have to fight them anyways. <br />
<br />
So far what I learned is I will have to use the map that I copied to get there and will have to fight my way there as invis is mostly of no use.<br />
<br />
Any comments?<br />

NONE of the NPC's respond to hailing, whether you are flagged or not.  Once you get 1.0 prequest sword thing.  Just give it to the NPC.  She will spit out some text blah blah blah go to library in POK and find about an egg.<br />

thats it, no other text no response to another hail nothing.  Its kinda like a char flag without any yellow text.  This continues for all the npcs.  Just make sure you hand in everything that you need to and make sure you see the message and you are in the clear.<br />

As for camping the essence, here's what I did:<br />
<br />
Use this map as a reference: (( Kudos to the mapmaker, by the way.))<br />
http://www.davealvarado.com/eq/images/skepic/hateb.jpg<br />
<br />
Look at the bottom left corner, ignoring Inny's section. Look for the Tier 4 number 6. That's Archon G'uvin's spawn, clear it. Start there.Head west up and around Overlord R'Gahbsha's building ((number 3)), and take out that named/PH camp, then Dread Lord M'Noxin ((4)) right next to it. I HAVE seen the essence drop from him. <br />
<br />
Here there is a deviation of the path into three routes:<br />
<br />
Route A) This is if you want to camp Marsinger pieces as well. This is the longest and most DPS heavy route. <br />
Head North to the number 6 from Tier three, Evangelist W'Rixxus. North of that building is Tier 2's number 8, Master D'Samni ((lich model)). Head South to Tier 3's number 4 Dread Knight T'Kamax. Southeast to the Spy master I'Kavin camp ((Tier 4's number 2)). Then east to the last Tier 4 mob of the route, Arch Lich T'Vaxok ((5)). Then head down to the Archon spawn and start again.<br />
<br />
Route B) This also includes some Tier 3 named that drop marsinger items, but is slightly shorter and less DPS heavy.  <br />
Starting this from M'Noxin's spawn, Head North to the Evangelist. Then South to T'Kamax. South east to the Spy master, and back to the Archon.<br />
<br />
Route C) This is all Tier 4 named. This route may or may not be useful. I personally think the Essence may drop from any Tier 4 named, and so this route was designed to camp them all. Since I and my groups were also after Marsinger drops from varying Tier's, I used Route B or A mostly.<br />
Starting from M'Noxin, you go Northwest to the Spy Master. Then west to the Arch Lich. Then Southeast to the Arcanist V'Gimis spawn ((Tier 4, # 1)). Then back to the Archon. Likely, however, the Archon/ph may not have respawned. If this happens along any of the route, adjust accordingly.</div></div><hr />
