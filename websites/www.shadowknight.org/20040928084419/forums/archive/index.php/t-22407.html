<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Turrosh Mak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">This (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/qsearch.html?zone=69) is the link to all of the quests given in Paineel (the evil Erudite starting city).  Some of the rewards are kind of dated and you can get better in the bazzar but look through all the quests listed for shadowknights and decide for yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>scaledge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">That thread was an amazing suggestion made by someone who has too much time on his hands one hell of an imagination and really knows how to write quests.<br />
