<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Keudivenipo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been looking for a new spot to duo with my 65 shammy, but havn't had much luck finding a fun spot. Played around in DoN a little, but not really had good experiances there. Both Magelo's in my sig. Thanks in advance for any comments, flames or no  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Udekar Stryfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'd suggest the first bridge in NC coming from Dranik's Scar, but looking at your shammy's magelo, he'd be eaten quickly.  Keep him out of harms way, pull only singles, and you should be fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fallgore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Mmm, WoS isn't too bad if you're taking on Nameds or whatever, then NC is pretty nice itself, you can always take on mobs near the zoneline like Murkgliders if you can get them single pulled.<br />
<br />
But the first thing you must do is get your shammy some new gear.<br />
<br />
I'd suggest getting him some AAs for healing and Mana Regen, as well as getting some Mana regen items, augs, and just armor that provides more than 30-40 mana.<br />
<br />
There is a nice Ring that does about 20 Wisdom, not sure about manas or hps check, but it's nice.<br />
<br />
DoN is always cool, you can always go to Riwwi and take on mobs there, my friend had ahis wife's 68 Bst and his 69 Sk duo there, he took on adds not to shabby (adds of 2, no more, he would lure them out and kill himself then Log his Clr on Shammy acocunt to 96% res his him heh).<br />
<br />
Anyways, just get some aas and new gear, afterwards you should easily be able to solo so much better since it's just pretty hard IMO to solo like that; I am 63 and I got about 3k with Kei (Use to have 3600-3700 mana b4 I was robbed/hacked).<br />
<br />
So AAs and gear, if you're not into leveling heh. - But getting 66 is REALLY helpful since a-lot of OoW stuff is about level 66 req or recom. might as well get the nice lvl for better armors heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm gonna focus on the Shaman gear for the simple reason that you'll be able to do much better if the shaman is better off.  OoW and DoN have a ton of SK/Shaman duoable things.<br />
<br />
1st rule of shaman gear is that HP&gt;all, especially with Cann 5. HP = living and HP = Mana.<br />
<br />
Strategy:  Look at all the shaman peice and replace everything with NO direct HP, then replace everything under 25HP, then raise the bar to 40 HP and so on until all items have good HP.  <br />
<br />
Sta doesn't matter too much, because he should be able to max sta with self buffs (PE + FoS or, worse case scenarios Altuna + IoS + Boar + PE) <br />
<br />
You're good on wis and should hit max easy in bear form with or without crack(bear form also gives good regen and again since HP = Mana for a shaman both HP regen and Mana regen help).<br />
<br />
Problems:<br />
Back: that lodi has no HP, moss covered (cape or cloak) OR Iksar would be better back item.<br />
Range: What you have is good for buffing but needs to be switched out when not buffing - Engraved War Totem is about what you'll need<br />
Wrists: Rust Encrusted has NO HP, ans Spiritcharmer is really low HP, get pre-DoN cultural (Artificer's ringmail for Barb's) for both slots<br />
Neck: No HP, Watchman's Wrought-Iron Neckband should be cheap<br />
<br />
Another thing that would help:<br />
Head: get a Wallwalker's helm (should be about 1K)<br />
<br />
You'll be surprised at how much more effective this makes the shaman and opens up your possibilities for exping.</div></div><hr />
