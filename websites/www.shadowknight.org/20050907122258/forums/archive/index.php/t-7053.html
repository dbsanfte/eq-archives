<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darksiege</div><div class="date">10-18-2002, 01:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I created my SK (Now 30) I put 10 into Strength and 10 into Intelligence.<br />
<br />
Now, I've read alot of posts and get more and more confused by the Troll, Ogre, Ikky rants about how Erudites aren't tanks and blah blah blah.<br />
<br />
I am and will be an Erudite SK.  BUT I am having trouble and doubts on how I created my SK.  I see posts about put into Stamina; put into Agility (make 75 min) and all kinds of other advice.<br />
<br />
What I really want to know and seek a fellow SK's advice (Especially Erudites) on is this:<br />
<br />
I am a soloist Erudite SK, period.  I've heard INT and STR are important in this aspect.  But I am very confused and doubting my character because of the posts about making sure agility is at a minimum of 75 and that Stamina is critical for the 'tanking' SK's.  I'm not going to pretend I'm a tank or want to be a tank.  <br />
<br />
What I am saying is, I want to be able to solo effectively and want expert advice on what would be the best way to go on where to put creation points.<br />
<br />
My SK's base stats after creation of this one is:<br />
<br />
Str   80 (10 were put here)<br />
Sta  75<br />
Agi  70<br />
Dex 70<br />
Wis 83 (LOL!)<br />
Int   127 (10 were put here)<br />
Cha 75<br />
<br />
Please advise me on this and I'm sorry if I come across as rude.  I'm just a little upset by every other SK telling me how bad I screwed up by where I put my Creation Points and being an Erudite in the first place :(<br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Belyle</div><div class="date">10-18-2002, 02:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, most melee i know including myself are kicking themselves for not putting every point they could into stamina when they created the char.  This wont help ya out much in the early levels but at level 60 5 hps for every point of stamina; about 6 with nd3 and pe.<br />
<br />
As far as where to put the rest of the points dont know.  All i can say is i wouldnt have put em into int if i was making an erudite or DE sk.  STR or DEX would most likely be the best spot to spend em(at lvl 60 i personally wish i had alittle more dex).  Keep in mind str is about the easiest stat to increase with equipment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Belyle</div><div class="date">10-18-2002, 02:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another thing....at your level direct mana gear is the way to go.  Dont know how well your twinked, but dark mail guantlets are a good place to start (25-50 pp ).  Also there is some big int on a few peices of sentient armor (very cheap on my server).</div></div><hr />

Hell, you don't have to put the 5 into Agi, Just realize that'll cost you as much as 40-50 AC post-50.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lzert</div><div class="date">10-18-2002, 03:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I made the same stat choiced you did way back when before I knew about the 75agi ...  if you reroll, put 5 into agi so you have 75 agi... anything below 75 and you take a big AC hit.  You can make up for it with gear, but there isn't much AGI gear for SKs out there, and you will be forced to compromise on gear if you do that :)<br />
<br />
STA is very good to have.  I'm decently equipped at 60 and can't come near 255 sta yet even buffed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Korekil</div><div class="date">10-18-2002, 03:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not an Erudite, but; it's been said thousands of times, at the end of the game the starting points distribution doesn't really matter. ALl it means is you will prize agi and sta items above str and int, nothing more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Belyle</div><div class="date">10-18-2002, 03:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Have to disagree about the 5 points in agility.  Its almost a given that one peice of your equipment will have 5 agi on it.  Even if you are stuck with a sub par peice of equipment to fill that 5 agi, at level 51 3 aa points will fix that.<br />
Once you reach higher levels and start raiding you want 255 sta with sham buff.  Ideally 255 sta without buffs, this will free up a buff slot (max number of buffs = 15).  Having 255 agi isnt that special, far as maxing str and dex unbuffed well you will always use HoS or Focus as they are hp buffs (that also give a good amount of str and dex).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DaginSK</div><div class="date">10-18-2002, 03:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is really no reason to re-roll your character.  I am Erudite, and I have the highest hps of any SK on the server...which just goes to show that race means nothing really in this game.  Equipment is so much more important than race, that it really isn't even worth worrying about what race you choose.<br />
<br />
If you are ONLY worried about soloing, go with int/str, and sta when you can.  You will be fear kiting most of your soloing career (or should be), and so you aren't getting hit all that much..(which means agi really isn't all that important for you).  Mana pool is your primary concern, with regen effects secondary.  Get as much int as you can, and try to find some hp/mana regen items along the way.  Always look for chanters in the zone where are you soloing, and throw a few plat their way for C1/C2/C3.  Clarity3 will double (or more) your xp output easily while fear kiting.<br />
<br />
Strength is also semi-important, because it is directly linked to attack.  Str. equipment is pretty easy to come by, so I wouldn't really worry too much about it.  Also, the effect of high attk at your level isn't all that noticable. <br />
<br />
Again, there is no need to re-roll.  The people who talk shit to others about what race they chose are UNIVERSALLY ignorant about this game.  VI made this game to be idiot proof..you CANNOT ruin your character at the start screen, no matter how hard you try.  Missing a few points in a stat is so completely irrelevant that it really shouldn't even cross your mind.  <br />
What IS important?<br />
-Level-  : By far the most important stat in this game.  It overshadows everything else by a large margin.<br />
-equipment- : The second most influential aspect of the game is your characters equipment setup.  It only takes a few decent pieces of equipment to erase any racial benefits or penalties among members of a class.  <br />
<br />
Get higher level, get better equipment, and you will perform as well as any other SK.  Probably better since mana pool is becoming so important for a SK.  If I was forced to re-roll today, I would not hesitate to choose Erud again.  I like having a large mana pool at early levels, and equipment at later levels easily makes up for the lower starting stats.<br />
<br />
Play to have fun.  If you enjoy playing an ESK, then that is the best race to choose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Belyle</div><div class="date">10-18-2002, 04:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Last peice of advice =)<br />
Getting pickup groups in overthere (your ready for that now) and dreadlands( at about 40) is very easy and depending on group balence will most likely be better xp than solo for your level.  As a bonus you can always solo (low risk) while waiting for a group there.<br />
The best spot for evils to solo in OT is right infront of the outpost, if its not going well just train the mob on the guards(2 gargoyle looking guys) as they will kill it in seconds.  Twice an eq day you will potentially get ksed by the patrolling guards as the leave and return the outpost.  This happens at the same time every day and can be avoided with good timing.  <br />
<br />
'you ability to solo is only limited by the number of times you can land fear'<br />
<br />
'no matter what anyone says, fear works great indoors'</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I put some INT into my Erud, and some into STR...i'm doing good :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mordeth</div><div class="date">10-18-2002, 07:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't re-roll... The extra 20 points that get put in on creation are pretty inconsequential by the end... <br />
<br />
Had I rolled an Erudite, I WOULD have put 5 into agi and 15 into sta... but all is correctable by gear... My frist character was a dr00d (now relegated to my pocket porter :D) and I didn't put a single point into wis... he is strong for a dr00d let me tell you :rolleyes:  But now also happens to have 217 WIS...<br />
<br />
Kick back, relax, make sure you have 75 AGI and enjoy your MASSIVE mana pool :D<br />
<br />
Peace</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ghob Owar</div><div class="date">10-18-2002, 07:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Erudite w/ 255 STA at level 60 = Same Nekked HP as a Level 60 Ogre w/ 255 STA.<br />
<br />
It's just easier for the Ogre to get there, and as such might have an easier time increasing other stats as well. The &quot;end game&quot; stats though are relative, it's all a matter of how easy it is to max out for your particular character.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RandomKayan</div><div class="date">10-18-2002, 08:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Are you a casual player ? <br />
Is this your main toon ? <br />
How far do you intend to get the shadowknight ?<br />
Will you try and make it into high end guilds ?<br />
<br />
Those are the questions that need to be answered to assign stats at start up.<br />
<br />
Going all sta is the safest quickest answer for starting stats but it's only really if you intend to get to the end game but fall short of the high end game.<br />
<br />
If you are just casual or trying to get into uber game, don't bother about starting stats.<br />
If you are casual level 30 doesn't justify rerolling.<br />
I don't know of any uber shadowknight that hasn't maxed sta on raids no matter how hard they tried to avoid it.<br />
<br />
Honestly, start stats aren't that important, probably 100% of old school Shadowknights had screwed starting stats because at the time, we didn't know better than not to trust Verant's player guide. (Remember that first version guys ?:mad: ).<br />
<br />
Any stat that feels unbalanced to you can easily corrected by one or 2 pieces of gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azgul</div><div class="date">10-18-2002, 08:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally I did 5 into dex/agi/str and int. All the base melee stats are 75 for me, and int is 122. I'm very happy with the way it has worked out, as I solo almost exclusively.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">daarth</div><div class="date">10-18-2002, 08:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">57 Erudite Reaver I be.<br />
<br />
For soloing my gear is totally different than in group.  Believe it or not, STEELSILK is a great way to equip for soloing.  My biggest problem in soloing is always always always lack of mana.  I have 2 packs dedicated to gear swapping for situations.<br />
<br />
STEELSILK has a bunch of int and str.  With our strength tap and wielding a Strength of Grodan my str is over 255 cap.  I had put nothing in INT when I made him 3 years ago.  Still, my int is almost 200 now when equipped this way.  If I remember right getting over 200 helps fizzle tremendously.  You may get over 200 since you did put some original into INT.  Get some cazic thule deity jewelery, imbued amber ears and rings, they add 14 int and 14 str.  You have to find a lizzie shaman to imbue them.  On your waste find a FBSS or better for some haste and you are gonna rip-kite stuff :)<br />
<br />
For group play its AC and hitpoints hitpoints hitpoints.<br />
<br />
My only regret is not having the additional 5 agi.  It plagued me for gear choices for many levels because of the AC hit.  I have been able to keep it geared above 75 but it is a pain in the butt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Runeswyrd</div><div class="date">10-18-2002, 09:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Have to agree with everything here.  Im a 57th Erudite Revenant and I put all my initial startup points into INT.  But, Ive made it to 57 and have soloed some levels, I usually group so Im not a solo expert.<br />
<br />
However, if I rerolled I would definitely put 5 STA, cause I too had that early anguish over what gear to upgrade.<br />
<br />
But as is you will find you can play what you have very well...don't reroll.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daikoku</div><div class="date">10-18-2002, 09:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If not twinked I would go with 5 str/5 agi/ 10 sta.<br />
<br />
if you have gear now to keep you over 75 agi, don't worry about it, Sta over 100 is a more critical goal lower levels.  Extra str will help mitigate marginal agi and  will let you carry more loot.<br />
<br />
If you have access to outside gear assistance, there are no worries, soon enough your gear will be able to over come and deficancies<br />

My erudite SK, I think I maxed int, as I was thinking him as an alternate Tradeskiller, the steelsilk boots are nice, and take care of the agility issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Andred Dnocte</div><div class="date">10-18-2002, 10:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've advised STA/DEX in the past but STA has gotten so important with AA ability bonuses that's I'd consider all 20 in STA nowdays.  AGI +5 is not a bad idea.  <br />
<br />
Since you're level 30 I'll just say smart gear choices can mostly compensate for your poor attribute points distribution.  The game's still fun, most grave lords you ask will say they'd change their selection knowing what they do now, so join the club.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Izen</div><div class="date">10-18-2002, 11:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bah just leave the char be there's no way in hell I'd contemplate recreating a char and spending days of re-leveling just to compensate for a miscue on starting stats (not like you went +20 Wis or +20 cha ..) <br />
Erud SK here, as far as Erudites not tanking I've tanked several NtoV dragons as it was easier for me to control aggro and other high end mobs, makes no difference. I've also got a base 70 agi, and with gear its well above the 75 cutoff without even trying. Don't worry about it, you made a decent choice.</div></div><hr />
