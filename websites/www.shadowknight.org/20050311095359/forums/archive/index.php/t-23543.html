<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Krazix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have not enjoyed SNL (or madTV) for years now, and it's not the changing cast.. it's just that they do the same fucking jokes over and over.. and most of them aren't even funny the first time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Khat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think it has to do with most of the original cast dying and stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The old SNL's they show on comedy central sometimes aren't bad though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Velnarin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The problem with SNL is simple.  They repeat a lame punchline over and over again for about 5 min after it stopped being funny (I'm being generous in assuming it's even funny to begin with).  The writing sucks.  Most of the newer cast members (out of the last 10 yrs or so) couldn't deliver even if the material WAS good... which isn't a problem since it's not.<br />
<br />
Kids in the Hall reruns are better anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Khat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">They need Larry David as a writer.  His Curb Your Enthusiasm show is really funny.<br />
I realize they are two totally different kinds of skits, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kebsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">'Settle down nah!'<br />
<br />
Who the fuck thought that shit would be funny at all, let alone for five minutes straight?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Lirial Toko`Ryoshuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I remember watching SNL when i was a kid, those were the good ones... Eddie Murphey, Dan Akroyd, Chevy Chase, Steve Martin.. now I havent the slightest clue whos on the show...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Arikash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Mike Myers, David Spade, Chris Farley, Adam Sandler, Norm MacDonald, etc.  That's where it's at.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Culdahl1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I liked most skits by chris farley &quot;in a van down by the river&quot;, &quot;for the love of god, won't you let the boy sleep in your bed&quot;.....and those with will farel, especially the blue oyster cult skit about &quot;more cowbell&quot; with christopher walken.  The problem with SNL is that every time one of the characters becomes slightly interesting they leave for sitcoms or movies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Daywalka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Will Ferrell was the funniest thing on that show in the past 8 years. When he left, the show just turned to a pile of suck. Though, that thing a few weeks ago with Ashley Simpson was kinda funny.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Derraj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">LAY OFF I'M STARVING</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Yutani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Funniest thing to come out of SNL in a while is Robert Dinero doing the White house press release. Anouncing the names of the suspected terriost.... Whoosben Farteen....Isheet Madrawers...and many others...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Marruk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Ashley Simpson getting caught lipsynching was the only thing remotely funny on SNL in years.<br />
<br />
Its a shame... there used to be tons of funny bits on that show.  Original cast &gt; all, but still Steve Martin, Chris Farrley, Eddie Murphy, Mike Myers, David Spade, Adam Sandler, Chris Rock, Chevy Chase and a bunch others were great on that show.<br />
<br />
In the past couple of years it had been Will Farrel Night Live, and that just didn't cut it.<br />
<br />
Now they have nothin'.</div></div><hr />

/agree &lt;asdf&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Mr. Show is really great, but i dont think its on tv anymore.  you can get the dvd's tho</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Mr. Show rocked<br />
<br />
One of the summer part time Temps I hired to do some filing around the school a couple years back and I used to growl &quot;TRY AGAIN&quot; whenever we both saw this guy who we thought should kill himself.  <br />
<br />
Those &quot;Satanica&quot; skits made me laugh in my pants.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>senor sperro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Kids in the Hall reruns are better anyway.<br />
