<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Warscout</div><div class="date">05-14-2003, 01:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Every time i log on EQ I do a /who all shadow 50 65 and compare SKs i am just competitive like that. I also go ninja inspect people when they are avalible so i can compare equipment. The trend i have noticed is there are anywhere between 10 and 20 SK at any given point online and half are ALWAYS DEs the other half are spread between all other races and im usaly the only erudite. So i think to myself warscout bud maybe your a moron and DE has a signifagant bonus over you. So i got to the char creation screen and i make a DE SK to look at stats.......they are gimp......thats right flame me i said GIMP.  I have had DEs in groups tell me not to agro becouse i dont have the STR and STA to tank but now i see that DE start with the same STR and STA i did with 15 less intelegence. someone explain to me why be a darkelf SK its the single worst race / SK combo i could find. Hell gnomes are better...well thats a strech....but close! I went back to char creation and used this formula on every race / SK combo and came out with disturbing results.<br />
<br />
    I went through and made a nekked newbie of every race useing points to get all 4 melee stats to 75 and dumping extra points into STA if any left over. I think this is a fairly standered method and i didnt want to be bias on behalf of my erudite and put extra into INT.<br />
<br />
RESULTS....<br />
<br />
If you want a SK that has natural regen iksar better than toll<br />
If you want a mana pool rather than a kiddy pool Erudite only <br />
If you want a attack boost be an oger or troll i would prefer troll<br />
If you want to be joe avrage be a human.<br />
if you want to be hated be a gnome<br />
If you want to be a gimp DE go on i cant stop you but please explain why for gods sake.<br />

Trolls have better starting combat stats.  Please elaborate on you choices.<br />
<br />
Oh, and be prepared to be flamed by all the DEs and their friends, can't be helped you've set yourself up for it.<br />
<br />
On the plus side, g'noams might light you a bit more.<br />

Oger = Highest starting str, sta, unstunable from front<br />
Troll = regan, lowest starting int, decent str &amp; sta<br />
Iksar = regen, forage, well balanced stats nothing wow.<br />
Human = average stats across board, night blind.<br />
Gnome = Good starting int, decent other stats<br />
DE = Good starting int, decent other stats<br />
<br />
Each race has there own str's and weekness's. Its really up to personal prefrance. Which race fits your style the most.<br />
<br />
Its been a while since I toyed around with creating another race sk ... but from what I remember:<br />
<br />
Oger #1 ... I like the stats, lol but mainly because of the look. Luclin modles on!!!! They just fit in my mind, what a SK should look like.<br />
<br />
Euridite, Gnome, DE ... Mix and match the stats and theres not much difference stat-wize (cept for the Euridites slightly higher int). <br />
So between these 3 it kind of boils down too: <br />
<br />
Do you want to be blind, have a huge forhead, for the most part have a perma dress on, and be the smartest SK?<br />
<br />
Do you want to be Tiny, able to tink, look cool when you duckwalk, and be the master of hide&amp;seek games?<br />
<br />
Do you want to uhh, hmmm , be a DE cause you think they look cool, and you have read every book that even makes a passing refrence to Drizzit and he is your hero.<br />
<br />
(I would pick a Gnome out of those 3)<br />
<br />
<br />
Iksar or Troll ... Ok stats their aren't close but they both have regen. You either like haveing a tail or you like haveing a potbelly.<br />
<br />
(I would Pick a Troll, they are just a fun race to play ... nothing aginst Iksar's though ... they are fun also)<br />
<br />
Human (never even considered it ... no offense guys)<br />
<br />
<br />
So Why you ask are most SK's DE?<br />
<br />
1. Take away the races with an exp penility. (some peeps are whimps when it comes to the exp penility)<br />
2. Take away the races that are blind.<br />
<br />
You only have DE and Gnome left. <br />
<br />
Gnomes have only been playable as an SK race for what? ... a little over a year or somthing?<br />
<br />
So DE's have a time in service advantage in numbers.<br />
Plus for some reason lots of peeps hate Gnomes ... peeps buy into groupthink and peeps are afraid to play a gnome.<br />
<br />
So in sumation DE's are the most populus SK race because.<br />
<br />
1. no exp penility<br />
2. not blind<br />
3. been around longer than Gnomes.<br />
4. Peeps are afraid of Gnomes.<br />
<br />
Combine all 4 of those and you have your reason.<br />
<br />
<br />
All SK races are only as good as the peeps who play them and how well you play them in large part is dictated by how much you like them.<br />
<br />
Lol ... If I couln't be an Ogre ... I'd be a Gnome.<br />
<br />
I hope this helped clear up your question man ... take care ... and don't worry to much about what race others play.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Edit: A possible reason could be that in the end, race and starting stats has very little impact on your performance. Thus, people just choose what they think looks cool... DE comes out on top for most peeps.<br />
<br />
I would chose Gnomie or Erudite any day of the week just to be different.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because it makes no fucking difference what race you pick in the end. Furor plaindefiler is a HUMAN warrior, and so far he is the only person to have made it past the 10k HP mark. Why didn't he pick Ogre, Troll, Barbarian??? <br />
Because it makes no difference. By the time you are 65, you can have all of your stats and skills maxed out, and everyond can have the same everything, so when you see 50% of the SK's as dark elves, shut up and get over it.<br />
<br />
Why I chose DE over other:<br />
1) Looks. I'm keeping this character, so it's not going to look like shit.<br />
2) High starting INT. Useful from level 9 onward<br />
3) Ultravision. Why I chose DE over Erudite for mana. <br />
4) Because this way I won't be the profusly fat Ogre or Troll<br />
5) Because in the end I will have equal HP/Mana/whatever to every other SK in the game.<br />
<br />
Again, get over it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But back to topic: Shadow Knights are jacks-of-all-trades, we can do almost everything - why shouldn't we be a race then that excels at nothing but neither really sucks?<br />
<br />
Who's more evil and why: Jabba or Palpatine?<br />
<br />
Shadow Knights are an intelligent evil breed and Inkies suit that role best.<br />
Others want to be death machines wreaking havoc... there are many ways to spread hate.<br />

It was troll, ogre, human, or dark elf.  <br />
<br />
I didn't want to be the size of a refrigerator and have movement issues in tight quarters, and I didn't want to be blind, so I chose dark elf.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Play whatever race you'll be proud to play. In the high end the gear makes the difference; you could be a goddamn half elf and still break 7k hp 1700ac if they allowed SK.<br />
<br />
Every race has an advantage. I lean towards Ogres for no frontal stun, and trolls cos I love the goofy bastards. Hence I have a troll. <br />
<br />
There are also no racial xp penalties for DE's.  Iksar/ogre/troll have them, and it hurts a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chaodec</div><div class="date">05-18-2003, 12:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i think everyone has there own reason as to why they play what race they do other then stats... i play a de i didnt care bout str/sta/hp when i started.. i did for the fun factor of playing a de.. as one would have fun playing a human/gnome/troll/ogre/iksar... (my sham is iksar )for what ever there personal pref is ) justa my thoughts on this ...) it all boils down to gear at the end game imho think everyone has there own reason as to why they play what race they do other then stats...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Warscout</div><div class="date">05-19-2003, 06:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Come on now, roll playing died in EQ about the time kunark was released and the old world blindness was fixed in the velious era, not that it matters anyway once we get dead eye. Out of the reasons I would have accepted for playing a darkelf those are the worst two for gods sake if you want to roll play join the roll play server and i MAY accept that argument and as for blindness thats only a valid reason if you began your SK befor they upgraded natural vision like Mathas. As for &quot;end game&quot; stats dont matter BLAH n00b i looked at most of your mangalo's and NONE of you have all 4 melee stats maxed + INT so dont give me that bs PoP has changed that and even if thats true for a warrior we my simple minded friends are Shadow knights not warriors so stop thinking like one. <br />
<br />
Chaodec, I agree there is a reason everyone plays what they play. I just want to know what that reason is.<br />
<br />
Makkon your a moron, how much have you experimented with XP penltys? a 65th lvl DE who only ever EXed with a troll the troll is 64 and a half. yup only half a lvl diffrence between them.<br />
<br />
Mathas for no other reason than you have played sence this was a blue server i have much respect for what you said but i think your also correct DE was a much better choice pre-kunark.<br />
<br />
Incurus.......im glad you enjoy it.<br />
<br />
Kormus buddy your confuseing us with bards or shaman but i can understand your reasoning.<br />
<br />
Magus.....just get off my thread you dumb ass, i lost 30 seconds of my life that i can never get back reading that useless dribble you posted and i feel like your ignorance may rub off on me.<br />
<br />
Banuk heh yeh ok troll are the last of the roll players as a whole and yeh hahaha it is a state of mind.<br />
<br />
Nixpus you win the prize for most constructive post bud I agree there isnt one single correct way to build a shadowknight, its about how you want to be that matters most. I just cant figure out why people are confused that DEs are the best at anything....<br />
<br />
Sep, I cannot find any falts in anything you said except drizzit was a duel wielding ranger....if you want to be him play a DE warror at least its closer.<br />
<br />
Hsy, I pick iksar over troll as the &quot;regen&quot; SK becouse they have a better stat spread and i realy do like lizzards. Dont get me wrong if you want regen AND mana go iksar if you want regen AND attack rateing / stamana go troll. it is symatics at that point.<br />
<br />
Vyrion LoL i have some work to do on my equipment but at 51 when i started this post i had same HPs more AC and x2 the mana of any other SK i ever grouped with on my server, =) wait till im 63 i will out shine you as well smerf boy.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, With the exception of the those select few of you who are not absolute morons (the list shrinks every day) It is my observation that the VAST magority of shadowknights are 14 year old, pimple poping, gangaly, awkward children who wanna be k00L. As a whole i am SO disapointed in the shadowknight comunity it makes me sick. The top 1% of shadowknights are near invincable and share there views and tricks with us all but the rest of you are just gimped warriors who would be better served deleeting your SK and re rolling a warrior or monk. You know i would have excepted that you play a dark elf becouse you have a weapon that procks and wanted 20 extra dex to help it. Or that you wanted enough mana to get by but wanted your SK to focus on something elts. No all you did was bitch and complain about how Kool DEs look and how they were not blind and how much you rollplay being a darkelf, HAH your gonna give SKs a bad name and i dont want your failures darkening my tanking ability ever again do you hear me.<br />

I didn't pick him cause he looked cool, I picked him cause he had nice overall stats.  Not great, but they aren't horrible.  You say Erudites are better because they have a larger mana pool?  No offense to any Erudite out there, but doesn't KEI take away the need for a lot of int?  With KEI, my int is around 235.  I can usually max out my str with buffs, and my HP with Aego is around 4100 or so.  I dont need a shrink when I go into a dungeon, and I'm not blind when I am on a CR.  Am I saying I am not better then any other SK race? No, they all have thier disadvantages and thier advantages.  Oh, and adding petty insults doesn't make your argurment any better, sorry :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FrostDoom</div><div class="date">05-21-2003, 11:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well i Agree with Uuk there. It dont matter what race you are. in the end they are all pretty much equal and it all comes down to buff's and gear. I chose Dark Elf cus i think elves are awsome and would rather play an elf character then any other. who cares if they dont START OFF with better stats then other races. its all about personal preference. cus in the beggining that little bit of stats dont mean a thing because its so frickin easy to level up, you aint gotta have extra starting stats. And Warscout all of the comments you made about other people just show how much of an ignorant idiot you are cuttin ppl down on post givin that are all related in some way to the original post... mabye you should read more carefully be for you start shit talking ppl. everyone has given their insight about this topic and dont need other ppl criticizing others about stuff they right... isnt this what a forum is for; people to put down their ideas and share with public on what they think. mabye you should grow up before you start responding to others the way you do.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Warscout</div><div class="date">05-22-2003, 05:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Uukeral, My only reply to you would be to re-read my previous post, I do feel stats matter especaly Int becouse haveing a Deep mana pool even with KIE on is the diffrence between being able to fall into a secondary assist position on a raid and build the kind of burst agro needed to tank OR when the crap truely hits the fan and a claric has camped out everyone is gonna die anyway it will alow you to spend the additional 200 mana nesosary to Harm shield, get a head start on the mob and Fain Death so you will be able to drag corpses. Of all the starting stats I would rank Int and Stamana at the very top. You do not have to agree with me but you cannot discount my statement. As a darkelf you traided 15 starting higher Dex for 15 less starting INT other than that DDEs and erudites are identical. .........and I dont know about you at 59 but I got dead eye along time ago for CR.<br />
<br />
Frostdoom, ok buddy very first thing......This was my post.....I started it......you dont need to tell me i wasnt adding a post relevent to the starting thread becouse I know what the starting thread was. As for me being too hard on some of the replys, well i thought you people were Shadowknights and could take it....obvously I was wrong you paladin reject, not only can you not read but your touchy feely reply on my thread as given me the urge to deficate. I would like nothing more than to hold you down and squat over your face after last weeks chilly cook off at the fire station. You are a discredit you yourself your Race and your class please find somewhere to hide from the world, a rock, a bridge anywhere will do as long as your not in the genoral population causeing any more harm or breeding. And as a point in view as bad as my critisism was for 13 year old drizzit wanna be's my praise of the others balences. Please die.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FrostDoom</div><div class="date">05-22-2003, 08:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello Everyone, this is the REAL Frosty here. i was lookin thru and saw my name on this post so i read it and discovered this load of horse shit my friend or brother whoever the fuck was on my computer wrote in here under my name... sorry for the Problems or whatever he put in here under your post. AnyWay since im here now i guess il post on my opinion about the subject of why a darkelf... i chose Dark Elf because 1) i like being elf character. i play alot of Warcraft and older rpg and neverwinter where i was always an elf or had an elf character in party and never really heard of any of the other SK beaing anything other then things i kill untill i started EQ... so i pretty much stuck with what i always had...  When i started EQ about 6-7 months ago i didnt know hardly anything about game so them points really didnt mean much to me and i bassicaly put the Start off points in lower skills to basicaly round everything out so all my startoff skills where pretty much even... thru the first 20 or so lvls the stats of some of the other races may make a difference but now in my mid 50's its all about gear... which im trying to upgrade slowly but surly as you can c in my magelo http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=685842 <br />
it isnt fully completed cus i havnt takin the time to write down all my skills and filled them in. another reason i am happy to be DE is becaus some of the race only armor that takes race only smithing like the dark prince gear. which i have non of. and i dont have money to buy. I also like the Dark Elf look over some of the other not that any of the others are not good ( that erudite in the hole for some epic quest did look pretty bad ass as he was tearin me to peices =D ) . i also agree with what uukeral said. not because he is my guild member but cus i fell the same about stats... altho i didnt kno KEI increased intelligence. i thought it was just the same thing as chloroplast cept for mana. didnt know it increased stats. anyway thats about all i got to say.lets keep this post going and see what others have to say about Dark Elf SK's</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Uukeral</div><div class="date">05-22-2003, 04:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">With KEI, my int is probably about 220 or so.  So my base int is currently higher then yours is, even with your 15 starting int. Gear makes up for my lower int.  I won't deny that 15 extra int might have helped you when you were a lower level, but with c3-c5 I regen mana faster then I use it, so it doesn't my lower int doesn't make much of a difference to me.  You will find out soon enough that gear more then makes up for lower stats. I like my 15 higher dex though.  Higher dex = more procs on my Inny's Curse or Mental Corruption, which means I have to be healed less and I gain more mana.  If I am tanking in a normal exp group, it takes me 2 spells to have aggro for the fight, Dooming Darkness and Boil Blood.  I don't tank raids often, but when I do, I only need to have my aggro buff on me and cast a few of my spears/hate increaser to get aggro.  That 15 extra int won't do much for me if my Int is almost capped.  Sure, 200 mana will let me cast my 260  spear one more time, but on stuff that I raid, 260 hp doesn't make a whole lot of difference.  You wonder why there are so many Dark Elves? Maybe it is because they are a good rounded race to play.  I doubt that there are a lot of power gamers out there that pick one race because it looks cool.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, and I forgot to add....some people don't play this game to be the best.  I am not a hardcore player, I maybe play 15-16 hours a week.  Personally, I picked this char because I liked the role-playing aspect of him, as well as his decent starting stats.  I play to have fun, not to be &quot;uber&quot;.</div></div><hr />

My first character of any RP game was an evil wood elf cleric. In EQ I did not get that choice, I had to settle with the High Elf role.. And since I already had a cleric, and so badly wanted a dark elf SK was the next choice, and talk about a fun class!<br />
<br />
 <br />
And big woopdie doo on INT. There are so many INT items out there that suit the HP and AC and other needs of an SK that the stats made no difference. (heck, when I knew nothing about the game, and was making a character for the first time, I put a lot of points into CHA, and INT, and even STR.. And that was with a cleric.. but by time she was 60, it made no difference on her stats.... wis was higher than 255 (without KEI) her FR and CR and MR were above 100, and her STR  130, with hitpoints to boot! I was the ideal battle cleric...until I grew bored of the monotonenis of playing a cleric) My point is, people pick what they pick, because they want to. Why does there have to be a reason?<br />
<br />
&lt;LI&gt;Ogres remind me of Shrek, even if they aren't green, they just don't seem scary anymore.<br />
&lt;LI&gt;Trolls remind me of Three Billy Goats Gruff, and well, lets face it, I don't want to be though of as the stupid troll under the bridge.<br />
&lt;LI&gt;Iksar remind me of The Land of The Lost. Heh, everyone says it, but even when playing side by side with my husband, (who plays a SK Iksar)  I still see scenes from that tv show run through my head.<br />
&lt;LI&gt;Gnomes... well all the female gnomes look stupid!<br />
&lt;LI&gt;Humans are okay, but kind of dull (Imo)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Okay, I posted enough stupid crap about this. My main reason is because I wanted too! <br />

*Edit Note:  down a few posts is a poll on what race people play, 25% are Dark Elves. The other 75% just happend to be spread over 5 different races. Obviously not everyone wants to be a DE, only 1/4 of the Shadow Knights.</div></div><hr />

Simplistic, but it works for me.<br />
<br />
My SK is a DE because I had never played one before (SK or DE, actually).  The only time I regretted that decision is when I saw how good Erudites look in plate; I fixed that by starting a newb Eru SK on Stromm.<br />
<br />
The way I look at it, it's a game I play and pay to amuse myself.  If running around as a blue elf amuses me, that's what I'm gonna do.</div></div><hr />

Actually, wouldn't that be the opposite way around?  Since DEs have natural Ultravision, the Erudite would have Deadeye (or my fav: Shadow Sight for Ultravision and SEE INVIS)  on as a buff-- whereas the DE doesn't need it.  Therefore, the Erudite would click his circlet/hide and the DE would then be at a disadvantage :p   Just thought I'd point that out as I always have see invis up due to my sight :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
This was 2 years ago, if I could re-roll I would make an iksar SK. Why? Because IMHO Iksars look cooler than any DE especially in a robe. <br />
<br />
And since stats wont matter in the end game I can have an uber iksar with maxed stats plus 40 extra ac than anyother SK with similar agi/equipment and still regen like a mofo.<br />
<br />
And dont give me that crap that regen can be bought, yeah I know it can be bought. But I look at it this way.<br />
<br />
My troll regens 20hp/tick sitting down without regen items/buffs. A non regen race would regen like 7 or so. this gives my troll a 13hp/tick advantage...<br />
<br />
Say the non regen race bought a fungi tunic because they wish they were trolls/iksars and started regening 22/tick sitting down...<br />
<br />
I can just buy a tunic myself and regen 35 a tick and still have the 13hp/tick advantage...so yeah regen can be bought but youll never have troll/iksar regen.</div></div><hr />

Had you tried talking (strange idea I know) to some of those characters... they might have told you that race choice was more limited when they began playing...<br />
<br />
The options were Ogre/Troll/Human/Teir'dal for many.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vilesoul</div><div class="date">05-28-2003, 07:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My choice was based on this:<br />
<br />
An SK is. in essence a hybrid of warrior and Necro.  Therfore I should look for a race that can do both to some degree of effectiveness. Ruling trolls out since they have very low int.<br />
<br />
Ogres went too, based on the low int as well, but I did spend some though on this one, the str/sta combo is awesome.<br />
<br />
Iksar, I would love to be one, I just don't have the patience to faction like hell to sell anywhere outside of Luclin or cabilis (this was pre-PoP).<br />
<br />
Gnomes.....BAH!....sorry guys who like em, but I hated trying dwarves out, last thing I need is to be even shorter.<br />
<br />
That left me with human, erudite, and dark elf.<br />
<br />
Erudites have superior intellect, but the very low str/sta left me questioning the choice.  He is in part a warrior ,after all. <br />
<br />
So now all that were left was human and dark elf.  I figured that starting out with more int would be better until the mid-levels, along with the advantages of night sight, and having a starting city that's not too overly aggressive about your choice of profession.<br />
<br />
Basically the DE is a fairly balanced race, makes up for the below-average str/sta with above average int.<br />
<br />
But again races only are of the most importance until the higher end of the mid-level game, then stats start to even out as equipment and variety of equipment go up.<br />
<br />
If I were to know now what I do, I might have been an Iksar.  That is, if I had the patience to faction like a mofo and deal with chain armor for most of my life (I know, I know...natural AC makes up, blah blah).<br />
<br />
Either way, it's all preference.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Erudites have the same str and more sta than dark elves, and the same str/sta as a gnome (I think of it more as &quot;gnomes are pretty tough for their size&quot; than &quot;wow, erudites are schoolgirls&quot;).<br />
<br />
Dark elves are physically the weakest SK race.<br />
<br />
The thing is, if you start an erudite, you might want to put 5 points into AGI to make up for that pretty rough penalty, giving you the same STA, but less AGI/DEX than an dark elf.  <br />
<br />
So that statement end up being true, unless you ignore AGI.<br />
<br />
However, gnomes don't lack DEX/AGI, so they end up being the toughest of the three.  Ain't that some shit?<br />
<br />
But you're right, it's all preference.  You know why I don't want to be a dark elf?  Really simple - they have stupid haircuts.  You can call that silly, but it makes more sense than worrying about stats.  <br />
<br />
Around 30, I've never found myself thinking &quot;I wish I had more (some stat)&quot; without immediately curing the problem with a ring or something.  <br />
<br />
I have found myself thinking &quot;man, my character looks like a douchebag&quot;, and that can't be fixed.<br />
<br />
Most people don't think dark elves look like douchebags.</div></div><hr />

I aprecate people posting there view. Still tho the most common reason seems to be a rollplaying aspect and night vission. I guess i will have to deal with that as an awnser. My main reason for creating this thread in the begining was becouse I was angry. At least once a week i get some random jackass in a pick up group who sends me a tell asking hey warscout why did you choose erudite, did you just want to be diffrent or rare or something? Well NO i wanted to have MANA. And so then they conversationaly tell me how weak I am and how i do very well as a tank dispite my handycap. Well for those of you out there who think i was hanycaped by my gigantus erudite protrusions listen up. I have a 1200 ac unbuffed (mangalo seems to be off a little) I have a 2500 mana pool (I checked and thats above avrage for most clerics my level) I have 2450 HPs (par for warriors my level) and if i am grouped with a 49th lvl shaman I have a maxed STR. Now i dont think DEs are so gimp as i been saying, i was just angry when i started this thread, but never confuse the facts that you and I mr darkelf, mr gnome and mr iksar have the same starting STR and STA. I am not a lesser tank than you. Im not the biggest or the best but i REFUSE to play second string becouse there is a MITH about my race that sugests i am weak.

How does that make you feel? I wouldnt be happy if a 2 and a half month old SK (non-twinked) kicked the crap out of me like that. Oh yes non-twinked, all my cultural came from killing paineel guards till i could buy blue diamnds and paying an erudite grand master tailor 300p per combine sucsess or failure and getting my own skills to the point i could do the sub combines. I may be kos in my home city of paineel but its worth it to laugh at you. not only did my stats own you for out and out tanking but my magalo is more truthful in the fact im not counting food drink and i know for a fact buddy that you sir have that windblade equiped perma not that 1hs and shield, you use used it to bump your stats for the profile. /wiggle /dance /point /laugh. you may now feel free to worship me as your god Vyrion, i am tyranical and iron fisted but fair.<br />

<br />
<br />
*First and foremost, I don't believe any race should be allowed to be a hybrid if that race can't be one of the two classes that form that hybrid. Thats just stupid. Thats like an artist with only blue on his palette then being able to 'magically' paint green without the yellow. How can a Erudite be an Anything-Knight when they can't even be the basic, a warrior. How can an Ogre be a Knight that casts spells if its base int is like 60 and it can't even be a necro? So TECHNICALLY, in my opinion, Humans, Iksar, Gnomes, Dark-Elves should be the only legit choices, But I'll Analyze All Races Equally.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Ogre - On my server, Ogres are actually the most common ShadowKnights that I see. Ogres lack uniqueness. In my eyes they are basically just a Warrior with HarmTouch. For Warriors, yes you go the extreme and pick the biggest fattest strongest race, but ShadowKnight is more subtle than that. Its not all just bash and slash. Also annoying XP Penalty.<br />
<br />
Troll - Mainly the same reasons, although I'd pick a Troll over an Ogre, just because Trolls have regen, and as I said, I think its gay to have an overtly massive base Strength as a SK. <br />
<br />
Iksar - The only other decent choice I was considering besides DE. Good AC, Regen, Swimming, etc. The problem was, I didn't want to look like a lizard, and since im not a major twink, it would be hard to get decent lowbie armor. Most good low SK armors are plate, such as DarkForge and others. Even the higher ones are plate too, although the choices are broader then. Also Iksar have an annoying XP penalty I was too familiar with on my Monk.<br />
<br />
Gnome - What. Are you Fucking Kidding Me? A Balding, Weak, Midget? I mean if you're going to be a Pro-Intelligence SK, you might as well be a decent looking one.<br />
<br />
Human - Stat wise, wasn't that bad looking in my opinion, but humans are boring, have no real strengths, are nightblind, and there are already plenty of humans of all classes walking around.<br />
<br />
Erudite - This isn't racist, but I'm not going to play a black man with a huge forehead. Besides that, they're too weak, and have no Strengths except Int. Save your Erudites for Int-Casters.<br />
<br />
DARK ELF -  Ah, the race I picked. Dark-Elves don't have great Strength or Stamina like Trolls/Ogre, or the Highest Int, like Erudites, Or Highest Dex like Gnomes and Iksar. But Dark Elves are good in these Traits all around, but in a different sense than humans. They have actually very good Int, Agi and Dex, which are good secondary SK traits. Then you only need to worry about Str and Sta which isn't that extremely horrible. I mean 5 in strength and 15 in sta, and you're Str 75 Sta 85 which is better than a humans base. Plus humans can't make up for their low dex, agi, and int with the limited 20 bonus points SK's are Given. Also Dark-Elves are the coolest looking, and fit the role the best. I mean Humans, sure can be anything. Iksar, yeah they're evil enough but.....a LIZARD Knight? If im not mistaken, the lizards are what the Knights RIDE. What are they called? Dromars? Anyway. Gnomes are too short and weak, Erudites are too frail and too smart (Should just be int casters), Trolls/Ogres too dumb to be a class who has Int as primary stat. Dark-Elves are just right. Maelvolent, Intelligent Knights who control dark magic and can hold their own in battle through their quickness, agility, and cunning if not their Strength. (Good For RP in other words)<br />
<br />
Now a Comparative. (Based on Bests and Worsts, Wis Excluded)<br />
(Ties count as rank. Ex: If Gnm and Eru are tied for worst Str, it will just say Worst Str, not tied)<br />
<br />
OGRE - Best Str, Best Sta, Worst Agi, Worst Dex, Second Worst Int, Worst Charisma<br />
<br />
TROLL - Second Best Str, Second Best Sta, Second Worst Agi, Second Best/Worst Dex,  Worst Int, Second Worst Charisma<br />
<br />
IKSAR - Second Worst Str, Second Worst Sta, Best Agi, Best Dex, Middle Int (3rd Worst/Best), Third Worst Charisma<br />
<br />
GNOME - Worst Str, Second Worst Sta, Second Best Agi, Best Dex, Third Best Int, Third Best Charisma<br />
<br />
HUMAN - Middle Str, Middle Sta, Second Worst Agi, Middle Dex, Third Worst Int, Best Charisma <br />
<br />
ERUDITE - Worst Str, Second Worst Sta, Worst Agi, Worst Dex, Best Int, Second Best Charisma.<br />
<br />
DARK ELF - Worst Str, Worst Sta, Best Agi, Second Best Dex, Second Best Int, Middle Charisma.<br />
<br />
Now, I know, my Dark-Elf has the Worst Str and Sta, but two other races tie for lowest Str, and Sta is only lowest by 5. Erudite has ONLY the best Int and decent Charisma which isn't that important. Humans aren't actually that great because of middle stats, and Worst Int/Agi both of which are important. Gnome, has not that bad stats, but as I said, appearance is gay. Iksar is decent minus Charisma, but again, appearance. Ogres have Horrible Everything cept Str and Sta. Same with Troll Basically. So In Theory, Dark-Elf, Gnome, And Iksar are best races, but I simply don't like the latter two because of appearance and RolePlay.<br />
<br />

<br />
Dracion, you seem like a fairly intelligent person so I can only assume you wrote the above to either vent frustration or mislead less knowledgeable people about Ogre SKs. <br />
<br />
I must say you made a good arguement for playing DE SKs from a role playing perspective. Ultimately, however, those points are meaningless in real terms because, as I am sure you already know, 'role playing' is a very subjective matter which depends entirely on the preference/imagination of the individual. I could make an equally convincing case for why Ogres could be SKs, but as this is a personal view and not reliant on any hard facts it would be a pointless exercise. In simple terms, Verant allowed Ogres to be SKs....thus Ogres are SKs so live with it :)<br />
 <br />
Your view that Ogre SKs are somehow handicapped by having a lower mana pool than their DE counterparts is nonsensical, not to mention completely misinformed. Now if KEI or any other type of mana regeneration did not exist there would definitely be some credence to your arguement. However, in the vast majority of 60+ xp groups and 100% of all raids I will have KEI. Therefore, I NEVER run out of mana regardless of whether I am acting as MT or not. Anyone with even a cursory understanding of the high end game knows that the rate mana regeneration is much, much more important than mana pool. You may be able to solo more mobs without having to med, but is that such a big deal? I comfortably soloed most of the way through 35-45 in OT (without KEI) and never ran out of mana because I was patient and always medded for the appropriate amount of time. The only circumstance where having a larger mana pool would be actually really useful for an SK is an emergency situation. For example, lets say you are fear kiting and unexpectedly get an add. In this scenario a larger mana pool may enable you to fear the add and escape or perhaps kite both mobs.     <br />
<br />
The outcome of these facts is that as an Ogre not only do I have the benefit of excellent tank stats, but also a virtually inexhaustable supply of mana (through KEI). Furthermore, even without KEI I am still perfectly capable of holding agro and casting my SK debuffs/DDs without too much trouble. Sure DEs will be able to cast a few more spells than me, but does that really warrant calling Ogre SKs 'warriors with harm touch' ? Errr maybe I am missing something here, but I think not. <br />
<br />
Dracion, another point you conveniently failed to mention is an Ogre's frontal unstunability. The general consensus and indeed from my own experience is that SKs are the best xp group tanks because of our unparalleled ability to hold agro. As keeping agro relies heavily on certain spells (e.g. the the darkness/terror lines) it is extemely important that we are able to cast and tank (i.e. take hits from the mob) simultaneously. It does not take a person of particularly high intellect (or mana pool? :) ), to work out that frontal unstunability is absolutely invaluable in these situations. While stunned you will not be able to pull off that crucial agro/hate list increasing spell to save a caster from being mashed to a pulp. Anyone who has hunted in PoP will know that it only takes a few hits and a matter of seconds for a mob to kill a caster in this manner. Although I am not saying that Ogre SKs are 'superior' to other races, we certainly have an advantage in this respect. <br />
<br />
I hope my post helps clear up some commonly held misconceptions about Ogre SKs and I would appreciate any feed back on the points I mentioned.<br />
<br />

<br />
I know alot of ppl praise the frontal stun thing about Ogres....but, as an Erudite...I've never been stunned and had someone die to it.  It's fairly rare that someone is close to me in aggro, and muchless for over-aggro to happen when I'm stunned for a few seconds.  ;) Plus, I don't seem to get stunned all that often....sure, maybe as an Ogre, I'd realize how much an Erud SK does get stunned in comparison...but if you were an Erudite, you might realize, it's not so bad as you think :) <br />
<br />
Sure, being stunned does suck...don't get me wrong, but putting up with the EXP penalty for it...I didn't think it was worth it.  Now, if the unstunnablity was from behind as well, i'd be jealous.  THe only time that stunning for me truly matters is when I'm running from an uber train...trying to distance myself from the mobs to FD...but keep getting stunned non-stop.  (See UP aggro issues being summoned into 30 mobs from across the zone or something of the like, like a huge NOOB train in BOT.)  Now, in this case...Ogre unstunnability from BEHIND would be an awesome trait...but, since it doesn't exist....  :p <br />
<br />
Although, the arguement about DEs being a good RP SK...well...if ya think about it:  Erudites split into two towns....the evil Paineelians cling to their evil magicks....why, just because you are going to be a bit more physical in your damage would you give up your evil magicks?  Every Erudite is imbued with magicks...this is why they split from the Humans-- forgetting your magicks and becoming a warrior...pfft, who'd do it? :D  So, just because some Eruds like to kick alittle ass doesn't mean they have to give up magic to do it ;)  <br />
<br />
Eruds just didn't evolve &quot;pure fighting&quot; without magic....personally, it'd be a mistake in my opinion if the race actually evolved it.  Tho, it could be my opinion-- pure tanking is purely boring :D   No magic usage, I'd go nuts :)  Besides, the Erud culture abhors (and split from humans) because they didn't believe in being physical.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shoggoth</div><div class="date">06-07-2003, 06:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some very valid points Rykor.<br />
<br />
You are probably correct about the lack of frontal stun not being quite as disadvantageous as I described. I have not played an Erudite SK above level 25 so I guess I will give you the benefit of the doubt :). Nevertheless, no one can deny that frontal unstunability can be nothing but a positive factor when tanking.<br />
<br />
I still stand by what I said about Ogre SKs being more than just 'warriors with harmtouch'. The thought of playing a warrior seems utterly mind numbing to me. Despite being an Ogre with a less than uber mana pool I am still able to fully appreciate the intricacies of the wonderful SK class :p <br />
<br />
This is a little off topic, but in my opinion Erudite SKs definitely make the finest looking SKs and capture the essence of the class perfectly. Had I not chosen to devote all my attention to the football hooligan of the SK class (i.e. Ogre), I think I would have been an Erudite.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Warscout</div><div class="date">06-08-2003, 03:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First,, let me praise the last two pages of posts on the forum, they have been not only relevent but insightful, as opposed to the magority of the first two pages. <br />
<br />
Second I want to take this oppertunity to fully 100% agree with oger as a valid choice as Shadow Knight. The fit the criteria in ALL catagorys of a valid race / class combonation. 1) they are the best race at something (melee stats). 2) they have a disirable uniqe abillity (non-stunable from front). 3) They have a strong basis for a roll playing aspect (big strong dumb SOBs). 4) They look asteticly pleaseing (at least with new modles). <br />
<br />
Now, haveing said that lets get back on topic a moment.<br />
<br />
Third, let us explore the same 4 reasons for being a Darkelf and see how they stand up to Ogers as a new perspective than VS erudites. Are Dark Elves a valid race / class combonation for a new player just opening the EQ box to make as his very first Charitor in todays everquest? 1) Are Darkelves the best race at ANYTHING (no sir they are not the best at anything, lowest STR and STA, middle dex and agl, 3rd best int). 2) Do Darkelves Have a disirable uniqe ability? (no, not regen not un-stunable not even slam,, DEs have nothing). 3) Do they have a strong basis for Roll playing aspect? (yes, they are crafty, slippery, evil and sinister). 4) Do they look good? (this segment gets somewhat convaluted with personal prefrence and bias. They just dont look like I picture Shadowknights in my head but most people seem to like them so lets awnser yes they look good). now what have we learned using this comparison? Darkelves excell at the non-material parts of everquest, they have a good rollplayability and look nice, HOWEVER have you ever survived a train becouse you prittyer than the guy next to you? Has Rollplaying ever boosted your HPs evough for a slacker healer to get the last 2 seconds of a C heal off just in time? No sir it has not! <br />
-------------------------------------<br />
If you were just begining EQ as a nekked level 1 Shadowknight without friends or any resosrces of any kind to pool from IS DARK ELF A VIABLE CHOICE TO BEGIN YOUR CAREAR AS? No sir it is not.<br />
-------------------------------------<br />
all things being = at end game all races have the same stats with with avrage gear for the level BUT would it be worth struggeling through the low levels withoout one single advantage? No sir. Any other race would be better.<br />
<br />
Now to get back off topic again, I would like to briefly discuss deep mana pools and the advantages inherant in them. shoggoth, while i agree that C3 is the great equilizer in everyday circumstances I would hate to discount a deep mana pool. I have never been in a pick up group in all my 3 years of eq where at the least one emergency did not arise from a healer Faak or a monks FD failing at a crusal moment or a nuker over agroing and running around like a dog on fire scraching its ass on the ground trying to put it out. now if i get in a pick up group once a day and see this type of emergency once a day and a deep mana pool alows me to save myself or a group member just once per day then its every bit worth haveing. Simple as that. n00b pick up groups withstanding a deep mana pool has aloud me very quickly finish off mobs in sircumstances where i saw a wandering critter heading my way and avioded an add by boosting my DPS via magic, Aloud me to corpse run for a raid easly by scrapeing up JUST enough mana to FD seconds befor a raid whipe, and also (alittle vanity here) alows me to be Flashy in most every day circumstances by hitting the killing blow 9 out of 10 times so people think i add even more DPS than i actualy do, thus makeing me get repeat pick up groups more often. C3 may make us = but a deep mana pool is advantageous non the less.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sepcieulus</div><div class="date">06-09-2003, 05:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I strongly object to Ogres being refered to as &quot;Warriors with Harm-Touch&quot;<br />
<br />
In the end game I honeltly believe that, stat wize. everything balances out with buffs and equiptment.<br />
<br />
Take a look at these 2 magelo profiles (just based on stats and lvl ... no AA's and skills left at 0)<br />
<br />
Lvl 65 neked DE (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=712195)<br />
<br />
Lvl 65 neked Ogre (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=712194)<br />
<br />
The Ogre has 208 more hp and 247 less mana.<br />
That is a very tiny tiny difference at those lvls and would virtually equal out with equiptment choices and buffs.<br />
<br />
247 less mana turns you from a SK into a &quot;Warrior with Harm-Touch&quot; ?!?! Come on now.<br />
<br />
Each race has advantages and disadvantages.<br />
<br />
1. Exp penalty ... if taken over a carrer (1 to 65) it is a lot of exp. If taken by lvl its not that bad (oh no ... I've got to spend a little more time to lvl ... lol ... its not bad)<br />
<br />
2. Regen ... from my experience at lower lvls it rocks. At higher lvls ... its nice but not a game breaker.<br />
<br />
3. Blindness ... At lower lvls get yourself a lightstone from a wisp or a fire beetle eye and your good to go. Alot of equiptment has a lighting effect (gives off light like a lightstone or better), there is equiptment with infravision/ultravision, not to mention see in dark spells (ie: deadeye) ... so not really a game greaker here either.<br />
<br />
4. 2 handed slam/bash ... great when fighting casters. Can be replicated at higher lvls with AA's or equiptment choice. ... its nice but not a game breaker.<br />
<br />
5. Unstunable from front. Its awesome. The feeling of helplessness when ... Uhhhhhg ... and you stand there while the mob whacks on you sux. ... its super nice but not a game breaker.<br />
<br />
6. Size .... small/medium/large. From my experience most peeps at a raid (especially if its indoors) get shrunk anyway (lol ... cept for the MT, gnomes, dwarves, and halflings). Being real large or real small may be cumbersom at times but .... its not a game breaker.<br />
<br />
It all comes down to what race you like the looks of and which one fits your Idea of how a shadowkinght should be.<br />
<br />
If its your first character, untwinked, and no friends to help you out ... regen and a good newbie area are the only decent advantages you could have to make your first time in the game easier.<br />
<br />
<br />
Why the Majority seem to play DE's ?<br />
<br />
I think its mostly popular culture and &quot;Group Think&quot;<br />
<br />
If you look at how the different races are protraied in popular fantasy books ... DE's come out on top. Even if all a DE's starting stats were 50 and below, were blind, and had a 50% exp penality .... because of &quot;Group Think&quot; I feel they would still win the race for popularity as an SK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dracion</div><div class="date">06-09-2003, 08:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, kind of as I feared, that got out of hand. Shoggoth was the  only one who truly responed to me. Yes I admit people's views vary in RP, and I guess Ogres are a decent choice if Int is buffed up. Its just that AS I SAID, Clamity, Rycor and Speculius, (Sorry for Spelling) I WAS MERELY DEFENDING MY reasons for playing a Dark Elf, because someone on the first page said &quot;If you're going to be a DE I can't stop you from being a gimp&quot; And thats pretty gay, because generally, the people on my server who say those kind of things ARE Ogres, and they say the reason they are so superior to all the Pro-Int SK Races is because they are so strong and that mana doesn't really matter to a SK. Yeah. I guess Ogres being a Warrior with Harmtouch is kinda an Exaggeration, and about 4 People Tried to kill me for it. OF course exaggerated that. You weren't supposed to take that seriously people, Im just saying as you get higher and higher, your mana becomes more and more important, and Ogres mana pools are generally weaker. If a Erudite, and a Ogre, both level 65, wearing same gear (Preferably decent gear), and if the Erudite wasn't retarded, he would probably win. Sheerly because he would have enough mana to out Shadowstep out lifetap and out anything else the ogre, UNLESS the ogre managed to get up close, which is where Ogres strenghts shine.....their Strength. But thats in effect why I picked DE. Erudites have bad Agi for dodging, bad Dex and DE have higher of such combat skills, AND Goot Int. ONCE AGIAN YOU FLAMERS, JUST DEFENDING MY POSITION.<br />

Other then that its just looks and what you think fits you.<br />

I personly hate the way ogres look but thats why I have my woodelf illusion helm better looks and still not stunable.  Being Ogre helps alot when pulling dark mob you want run to a wall put your back against it and hit FD.  Sine you cant be stuned or pushed back FD isnt intrupted just have to watch for casting mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Warscout</div><div class="date">06-10-2003, 02:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sepcieulus, first and formost i want to disagree with every point you made. after haveing said that let me say you did a good job at makeing a perswasive argument, you were just wrong. In essence you were wrong but it didnt make you sound ignorant wich you must agree is a wonderful complement compared to some of my above comentary. now let me explain Why i thing you are wrong in a bullet point format.<br />
<br />
1) your evaluations with the magelo links were invalid baced apon starting point alocations. you gave your oger 20 int and your DE 20 stamana. try again giveing them both 20 wisdom and i would be very interested to see the results. becouse starting points are universal after all and we are truely talking about starting stats. dont get me wrong im ruteing for ogers in that contest. if you get a spare moment try adding an erudite to the list as well and edit your post showing my race as well.<br />
<br />
2) exp penalty- I have seen documentation levels 1 - 60 of a husband and wife team of necros who never grouped without eachother there entire carear. one was iksar and one was human. when the human dinged 60 the iksar dinged 59 3 kills later. the regen xp penelty is 1 level between 1 - 60. thats not signifagent thats 6 hours of extra xping at level 60. If that is correct and i beleave it, then the oger xp penelty is less than half the regen penelty so what your realy looseing is 2 hours 1 - 60. if the idea of two hours xping scares you then you picked the wrong god damned game, take your ass to the local arcade or find something with a save game button.<br />
<br />
3) iksar regen tops out at regrowth. hell yes thats a game breaker, i duno how many time is have been C healed with 150 HPs or less. in a 60 second fight you looking at almost 200 HPs how many deaths would that have saved me? 5? 10? 30? and soloing? i would give my left nut for a fungi to use when im low mana and life. chooseing a race baced on NOTHING but regen is a valid choice and thats all there is to that.<br />
<br />
4) Blindness- heh they fucking fixed blindness in the velious era, no one is truely blind anymore. not like they were pre velious. i have ran through the BB tunnel to everfrost nekked both befor and after and you people got no right to complain. blind at night now was like blind in the day back then it sucked but they fixed it. suck it up buttercup.<br />
<br />
5) two handed slam. i duno how to put this question into terms correctly so let me lead you a bit on this topic. If you could quest for the AA ability to 2h bash just like the skill or just like large races would you think about doing the quest? well there is a quest that gives you the AA ability to 2h bash. the quest is called innoruks curse and theres a good write up on this site. now here is what you do. you take your weapon (i use a narlanti's lance) and you hit shit with it holding your epic on your mouse curser, then you swich weapons hit bash and swich back without missing a swing on your good weapon. there congratulations you just learned how a warrior ghetto bashes and now have the ability to do it but better. you can AA for 2hb and spend 20 houes doing AAs or you can quest for the weapons and spend 20 hours questing for 2hb and an 250 point heal if you ever want it.<br />
<br />
6) unstunable- wonderful but it doesnt make you take less damage when tanking and it only adds maybe one swing a fight you would normaly be stunned. it wont save your ass ever again 51+ becouse at 51 you got run speed one and can now always get a long enough lead on mobs to FD reguardless. and if you didnt get run 1 at 51 stop whatever your doing and get it now bright boy.<br />
<br />
7) size does matter.........if you dont beleave me lift my loin cloth some time and see why erudite think of themselves are a superior race.<br />

I was in no way flaming you. I was in no way bashing or criticizing your or anyones choice in race. I was declaring my objection to Ogre SKs being referred to as Warriors with Harm-Touch.<br />
<br />
I had hoped to dispel the whole Stupid Ogre, Tiny Mana Pool, Warriors with Harm-Touch myths with a simple comparison. I had hoped this would illustrate the simple fact that with equipment choices all SK races can become equal in HP and Mana and that the only things that separated them are their racial uniqueness and abilities. <br />
<br />
The only reason I used DEs, as opposed to any other supposedly Intelligent SK race, to compare with an Ogre was it seemed like thats where Warscout (the originator of this mighty discussion thread and the originator of the inflammatory comment  If you want to be a gimp DE go on i cant stop you) wanted to head.<br />

<br />
Starting point allocations were based on the biggest differences between Ogres and DEs. And its is perfectly valid for the point I was trying to make. It might not be valid for you or your points. I have heard losts of commnets about Ogre mana pool and lack of stamina of other races. So increase what is considered week about a race and see what happens. I was just attempting to show that the difference in HP and Mana ammounts to a hill of beans.<br />

Are your saying that SKs with regen are better SKs? If so I disagree. If your saying that you wish you were an Iksar or Troll  its your choice and I agree it would be a valid choice. However I dont think its a game breaker  lets just agree to disagree.<br />

So from the above ... you only disagree with one of my points? All the others you either agreed with or didn't comment on.<br />

Did you just read the headings and skip my points assuming that my points would be contridictory to yours?<br />

Why the Majority seem to play DE's ? I think its mainly because of popular culture and group think <br />
<br />
Thats wrong. Pop Culture? If suddenly every one on say Zebuxoruk suddenly made Halfling Rangers, do you think that would cause EVERYONE else on ALL the other servers to say &quot;Hmm seems popular on Zeb, lets do it as well.&quot; And then delete all their Current Half-Elf, Wood-Elf and Human Rangers to make Halflings? No. Please don't be a Hypocrite, Spec, GROUP think is what most Warriors and Rogues do. Be Ogres for Warrior, and Halfling for Rogues. Why? Ogres have best Strength Stamina, nuff said. Halflings? Best Agi Dex start out with hide AND Sneak at 50, what more could a rogue want? THATS Popularity and group think, making a choice because it seems more logical and the stats are better, not because of the fact that the races actually like being an Ogre/Halfling (Although occasionally there are those who DO like the races, which is good for them). You yourself stated that Dark-Elves have no desirable traits for SK's, being worst Strength and Stamina, and yet you think everyone playing them is group think?  Everyone being Ogre Sk's is group think in My opinion because they go for Str/Sta and Unstunnability. All they need to do is tweak int a bit. So in reality, the majority of people playing dark-elves isn't just some huge conspiracy or 'group thinking' as you call it, but its just that more people see that as a better option because its not one extreme or the other.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok I think our definitions of Popularity and Group Think are a bit different.<br />
<br />
Popularity:<br />
Have you ever seen someone be elected to something not because they were the most qualified, not because they were the best for the job, not because the were the logical choice, but because they were the most popular (IE: the majority liked them)?<br />
<br />
Group Think: (I realize this has Big Brother, conspiracy type connotations. It was not ment in that negitive respect)<br />
<br />
As far as group think goes  plz ... check out the quotes from others in this thread below.<br />

<br />
<br />
So from the above quotes(which although I havent actually counted  seem like a majority in this thread to me) it would seem that a lot of the choices were made because of the way peeps feel about DEs, elves in general, or what they felt a Shadow Knight should be. <br />
<br />
Now being that DEs are a fictious fantasy creation, peeps perceptions of a DE have been shaped by books and popular culture. I consider this a type of Group Think (with no negitive connotations attatched). <br />
<br />
Think on this. What if  peeps perception of a DE and Ogre were reversed ? What if the treatment of Ogres and DEs in popular books were reversed? What if Peeps perception of what Looks Good were reversed? What if what most perceived as Good For RP  were reversed? Would the race choices of many change? Yes  I think so.<br />
<br />
I am not trashing anyones racial decision. Im just stateing what I think the main reason the majority who choose a DE choose the way they do. Not a fact, not the only reason, not everybody.<br />

I can see this thread being on any number of other posts with a lot of the same similarities, i.e. most SK's - DE, most Druids - Halfling, most Bards - Half-Elf.  Granted, I have only been playing for a couple of months, but I've seen these trends all ready.  I must admit that my choice was based on co-workers (long-time EQ players) telling me there opinions since I had nothing to go on myself.  I knew nothing of Ultravision, 2HB, no frontal stun, and the majority of information I based my choice off of was what I remembered from my AD&amp;D days.  I based my choice on role-play reasons, which was completely insane considering the lack of role-play on the non-PvP server which I am on.  That said, I agree with the personal choice argument.  If you don't like Trolls, don't play a Troll.  If you like evil Gnomes, play an evil gnome.  MY OPINION is that it is the person at the keyboard that makes the difference.  I have had the opportunity, and pleasure, to have met a couple of outstanding SKs that have helped me grow my character.  One is an Iksar, the other a DE.  I have also ran into quite a few SKs that I find an embarrasment, of multiple races, to both my guild and class.  I do see that there are differences in the stats and abilities, but I firmly believe that it is the person playing the toon that makes the difference between being an SK or being a Great Shadow Knight.<br />
<br />
With all that said, I am a Dark Elf Shadow Knight of Innoruuk.  I enjoy playing EQ very much, and realize that I have much to learn about the game as a whole and as an Emissary of my Dark Lord.  I do not want to be one of those &quot;people&quot; that just plays the game, I want to be an asset to whatever Raid I'm on or whoever I am grouped with.  These posts are a good way to learn my art through the teachings of those that have gone before, and I hope to bring great credit upon myself and OUR class.  <br />

Maybe i just see past small differences like skin colour, but thats the way i was raised, i guess most of you guys are just prejudice, thinking one race is evil just on looks.<br />
<br />
But in all BSing aside, the truely scarey evil looking races would have to be trolls ogres and iksar, a halfpint dark elf isn't scaring anybody.<br />

Most EQ players who play SKs mainly play them because they sound so badass from what they have read in drizzt books.</div></div><hr />

<br />
my friend started me playing EQ. he was a DE wizzy. i made a necro and sent him a tell. he told me that he could help get me started alot easier if i played a war or SK. and sk was half war half necro. so i logged out deleted necro and stared SK.  i wish i could claim it was stas or blindness that made me choose, but in all truth i screwed up my starting stats when i made the char. i put like 1 point into int, 4 into wis, max into str, and leftovers i think i put in agi. and night vision.... 100% serious, i didnt know the game had night programed into it untill i left nectulos forest to fight in oasis with my RL friends. human paladin told me it was my turn to pull cause he couldnt see crocs untill daytime. damn was i confused. <br />
<br />
i love my DE. i've been one so long. i am totally spoiled on ultravision(not wasting buff slots on sight spells, i rarely have room for all my raid buffs) or being equipment dependant on sight.<br />
<br />
oh yeah i been playin since 3 months after release. so exp penalties was big back then, as well as sight. and gnomes werent a choice. <br />
<br />
looking back i really owe my friend for all that help in the beginnng..... 1 backpack, rusty short sword, 2 pieces of patchwork armor. damn he hooked me up phat.</div></div><hr />

I chose DE because The stats were about Even, and I wasnt blind like a human or Erudite. Over a dozen people here have said the same thing, in the end it doesn't matter all that much except maybe the inherent abilities like Regen or Nightvision.<br />
<br />
Vanity or not, I chose DE because I liked the way they look, and the stats werent that bad anyway :)</div></div><hr />

In the grown-up world, we use 'commas' and 'periods' to separate our thoughts. Now, having said that, you are a moron. Plain and simple. I could hardly read anything you posted because of the massive amounts of typos and lack of punctuation. What I did read, however, was pure garbage. What you are basically saying is that dark elves are gimp because they have &quot;terrible&quot; starting stats. If you really play this game because of stats, then why the hell are you playing at all? This isn't about &quot;my character has more mana than yours so i am better omfgz lolz!!!111&quot; Rather, it is about playing how and what YOU want to play. Saying that people who play dark elves are idiots or whatever the fuck you rambled off back there is just sheer idiocy. I am not going to say dark elves are the best, and I am not going to say erudites are teh suck. I am just saying that people play what they want to play, and you have no right to say they are wrong. I picked dark elf because I thought they looked cool, not because they have so-and-so stats or such-and-such advantage. Just quit your goddamn whining and play the fucking game.</div></div><hr />

Each player choses the race they prefer, it s about stats, look and rp (damn, an iksar hates everyone and is hated/feared by everyone, that s a good start as a SK).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shintou Shinai</div><div class="date">07-24-2003, 07:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I play a DE cause I like hide...<br />
<br />
Ok thats not completly true, My first Charrie was a Human Warrior (Just trying to feel out the game so I started a basic Character), but all of my friends played on a different server and they were DE's so I made a DE Warrior, but I wanted Mana so I made a DE SK.<br />
<br />
I never read any Drizzit books, but I do RP ALOT since I do play on FV of all places, so I think I can touch on some of the RP things.<br />
<br />
First things first. DE's aren't any better to RP then it is to RP an Ogre, or any other race for that matter. As such &quot;Being able to RP A DE Better then RPing a Ogre&quot; is kind of a moot point<br />
<br />
Basically, people play what they want to play. I play a DE, why? Told you above.<br />
I keep playing a DE cause of some well.. Anime influence.<br />
<br />
Most of the cool Evil guys in Anime aren't the lumbering huge ass Troll, but the lil evil guy behind the troll with the bad ass swordsmanship. (usually an Evil Samurai or something).<br />
<br />
Example for those that might know a LITTLE bit about Anime? If you know something about say.. &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot;, you have these two evil guys,<br />
<br />
Vegeta and Nappa. Nappa is a huge ass dude, kicks everyones ass execpt for the main hero guy who comes and hands him his ass on a silver platter.<br />
<br />
Vegeta however fucks the heroguy up quite a bit. Since then I've always liked the Shorter Evil guy over the Bigger evil guy.<br />
<br />
Then again, Its just imho, so I mean if people like the big evil overlord by all means go for it, but the Anime influence is what really got me to be a DE.<br />
<br />
Stat wise, I try to show that with dex/agi. DEs' have one of the better DEX/AGI combos starting off, I know it doesn't really matter in the highend game, but guess what? I'm not in the Highend Game so it matters to me :p <br />
<br />
It makes sence. Darkelves probably would have better Swordsmanship skills and the better ability to Dodge and weave and flip around and shit then say.. a Troll or Ogre or Human or Iksar or Erudite. Gnomes might be better..<br />
<br />
But Gnomes are too damn short. shouldn't even be allowed to be war/sk/pal imho, but if you wanna do that again thats your piece of cake go right ahead and bite it. Beating up on lil Yoda Paladins is fun<br />
<br />
Another reason why people play DEs is that well.. Most Female Players that play a SK will play DE.<br />
<br />
Why? DE girls are sexy. They look cute. <br />
You will get some that will play different races, but which one looks the cutest in MOST peoples opinion? Hold a poll and see for your self, DE will come out on top. followed by Iksar.<br />
<br />
On that point, how many guys you know play Girl characters? Like me, you should know alot.<br />
Why do they play girl characters?<br />
<br />
I get from<br />
&quot;People treat me nicer and I get handouts and stuff&quot;<br />
<br />
to<br />
<br />
&quot;I like to watch her run :)&quot;<br />
<br />
Now if you are a guy, are you going to like watching that Ogre run around? Maybe you will, and if thats your piece of cake by all means watch it run.<br />
<br />
But most people will say they like that lil Darkelf girlie running. So they make a DE SK. And they sure as hell aren't going to make a Iksar girlie. Nothing to watch.<br />
<br />
Bad ass look. DEs do look bad ass with armor and the cool SK swords that probably are too big for them to handle IRL imho, but for the most bad ass looking Race its gotta be Iksar. They just are.<br />
<br />
Unstunnable from the front. Its nice. Very nice. Its happened where I get stunned and lose argo for that short moment. Maybe I didn't argo enought or fucked something up, but it does and can happen. Also I hate being stunned it sucks so bad.<br />
<br />
But I really do like Hide. A well skilled SK can use hide to solo well when he can't use his pet, I know I used it to solo in Skyshrine back before it was revamped and it worked very well.<br />
<br />
To sum it up..<br />
<br />
I play a DE SK because I wanted a not too tall overmuscle bound bad guy with badass Swordsmanship that wasn't too ugly and can use Hide. :). Solved my two hand bash problem with the Epic. <br />
<br />
Hope this answered anyones questions why alot of people play DE SKs..<br />
<br />
That is all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dreadmore</div><div class="date">07-30-2003, 03:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As near as I can tell, the whole point of the original poster is that a naked Erudite SK has more starting Intelligence than a naked Dark Elf SK... therefore, anyone who chose a Dark Elf is an idiot? Did I get that right?<br />
<br />
First of all, it's an 8 point difference in Intelligence, not 15.<br />
117 - 109 = 8. That's the math you're talking about.<br />
<br />
Let's try a different approach. Spend 8 of the Dark Elf's bonus points on Int, and  the rest on melee skills. Put all 20 of the Erudite's points into melee skills. The Dark Elf now has a 12 point melee advantage, and even Intelligence.<br />
<br />
A 3rd way is spend both race's 20 points all on Int. The Erudite would have 8 more points of Int, but the Dark Elf would have 20 more points in melee skills.<br />
<br />
My math gives the edge to the Dark Elves. But no matter whose math you use, the differences are so small (especially after you factor in gear) that it's ludicrous for you to bash others for choosing a race that you didn't.<br />

Human - well I am one, I didn't wanna role play one that cancelled out the Erudite too. Gnome, personally I had problems with looking like I was freakin ancient, small, fat and bald (not that there is anything wrong with that). Iskar well - everyone I knew was on Antonica so ... process of elimination = DE.<br />
<br />
Someday I'll start an SK in every race &quot;even&quot; a gnome just cause I dig being an SK. <br />

The only advantage an Iksar and Troll has over any race at 65 is the regen. To this day I still get monks, necros, and some SKs that scream at me wishing they had my regen when we're laying on the ground FDed after some catastrophe :D</div></div><hr />

He is perma bitching about just how bad his brother paladins are at screwing off and being non-helpfull to eachother. I made him a bet that if i started a rant on the shadowknight boards and he started a rant on the paladin boards mine would run in the top 20 a month longer at the least. I want to thank everyone involved for makeing sure that we Shadowknights havent lost the world cup for stupid bitching to those pansy paladins out there. I only tell you this becouse i saw a post asking what the origonal poster was trying to say. well that was my purpose. and by the by his rant was out dated 3 months ago already.<br />

If not for your bumping this thread would have died long ago.<br />

Congratulations your stupidity won the contest for you.<br />

Is this like those people who start a rant, then get flamed to hell and don't know what to do, so they suddenly insist that they had planned to get flamed all along?  You know, that whole &quot;lolololz u guyz acted just how i sed u would lolololz btw i am drunk rolfz&quot; bit?<br />

And considering how infrequently this forum is used, it isn't all that difficult to keep a thread in the top 20.  The 20th thread in this forum, sorted by date, is from the end of june or the start of july.  Gratz for being able to keep a thread in the top 20 posts in a dead forum, fool. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) Yes I'm a newbie, this is my first EQ Toon.<br />
2) I do RP despite not being on FV (check my Server). I play to have fun, not min/max every little detail.<br />
3) When looking through the toons, I liked the DE appearance (mind you I had old models then).<br />
<br />
Everything is hindsight - I didn't know what I was getting into when I made this character.<br />
<br />
My SK colleagues are DE's, Ogres and Trolls. Have yet to meet an Erudite SK or a Gnome SK, have run into one or two Humans. Do we complain about each other's racial choices? No, we enjoy playing SK's.</div></div><hr />

Which maxes DE's have the best mana pool :)<br />
<br />
Next point If you read EQ lore you would understand Why everone fears DE. Also with the new little class/race/stat thingy at the bottom of the char creation screen you will notice that the follow races fear DE and only DE. Troll,Ogre,Human and ERU.<br />
<br />
Last but not least i picked a DE cause neriack &gt; all</div></div><hr />
