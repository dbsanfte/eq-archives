<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The centaur just gets 2 boot slots<br />
<br />
People have 2 feet and get ONE boot slot<br />
<br />
Centaurs had 4 feet and should get TWO boot slots<br />
<br />
WTF is a horse man doing wearing boots anyway?  That's like a whole new set of feet items they have to make (smithing anyone?)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Only huge problem with this is... warrior with no plate armor? damn, i dunno how much good that would do, trying to tank...<br />
<br />
Otherwise, not bad ideas, though something that messed up and original will probably never make it into EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Peztilence Forever</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">YAY my turn.<br />
<br />
 1) @ Keveel .Horse DO wear Boots/Shoes !! <br />
     But yes I should have only said 2 slots<br />
<br />
 2) @ Naelyan.  U never seen a Iksar Warrior ?! Also its a rolepaly value.<br />
<br />
 3) @ the others.  Half the things in this forum dont relate to SKs.<br />
     and this was just a carry on from Keveels prevous post which wasnt flamed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I had actually thought of mine as a new zones, new way to get to places kind of thing, the Underwater race (who I just decided I'm going to call the &quot;Ingit&quot;) were kind of an off shoot.<br />
<br />
And while I didn't get flamed I was told that people wouldn't enjoy my new zones - I'm still waiting for new tank to ask me if there will be the underwater equivalent of KC.<br />

<br />
The shoe-ing is what I wanted to get at w/ my smithing suggestion as blacksmiths  made horse shoes (among other things and depending on speciality)<br />
<br />
EDIT: hey man, learn where the &quot;e&quot;'s in my name go</div></div><hr />
