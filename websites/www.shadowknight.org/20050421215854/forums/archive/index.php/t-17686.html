<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Darknyss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, after finally getting the book and shard (omg that took forever), I began to finish my LoP khukri quest... 4 weeks in City of Mist, 1 weekend in Frontier Mountains, and 15 horrifying minutes running through revamped Droga later... and I finally got my LoP khukri...<br />
<br />
Had some help taking down Glowing Golem.  Went Smith hunting in the Sarnak fort.  Dropped by Karnor's for a pick up, and grabbed a quill and parchment after a few turn ins...<br />
<br />
That mirror is all I need now... and I just don't have the force to go down and kill Drusella...<br />
<br />
Normally I don't like MQ's but, after starting this about 2 years ago and finally getting this close... I'm considering making an exception... <br />
<br />
send a tell to Darknyss, Gobuk, or Xorbnastralicus if you have a spare mirror.  =)</div></div><hr />

I would be willing to help put a group together, I have a guild (small one), but I'm sure the two of us could put together a big enough force to take her down. send a tell to Dredlok in-game</div></div><hr />
