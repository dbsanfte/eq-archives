<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eggborn</div><div class="date">11-05-2004, 10:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Adds happen.  Maybe not always suppose to but they do.<br />
<br />
I am a shadowknight who doensn't have dreaded gaze yet.  <br />
<br />
It is necessary for me sometimes to aggro several mobs on incoming during raids to save healer and chanters from getting smacked.  Normally I just aggro what I can, but single mobs at time.  I use the new terror, have used fear in the past.  I keep my eyes out for mouse targetting (but I am always lagging! this doesn't work well) , have some assist keys made for monks, have F8 to target closest mob ready to go.  I always get a spell haste to help cast faster.  I try to be in close proximity to mobs when possible.  If all that fails I seek out mobs that may have run over to healers, chanters, shammies etc and get aggro from them (not damage aggro).<br />
<br />
I can't seem though in some situations to prevent some serious deaths.  I have tried our other area of effect spells, but they don't seem to work for me.<br />
<br />
I am wondering if scrolling through the NPCS (I confess I am not sure how to set this up, what is the name of that function) would help.<br />
<br />
What else can help me do this?  Once I get aggro, I keep it, and my healers keep me up 99.9% of the time when I do without dying themselves.  <br />
<br />
Any suggestions on how to improve this?  I know it can be done.  I see other SK's do it all of the time!</div></div><hr />

I don't have Dreaded Gaze nor do I expect I will see it for some time.  For most content that we're presently doing (i.e. nothing uber), I simply have to trust the cc'er/offtanker to lock down the other mobs and hope for the best.<br />
<br />
Unless an unexpected named trails/warps-in on a pull, it's generally understood (in our group/raid) that I don't switch targets unless the 'chanter calls for it -- and let the others do their jobs.</div></div><hr />

using the mouse for targetting will only get you in trouble... the combinations of cycle between targets, target nearest, and toggle last 2 is enough to do a lot of stuff very quickly.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BludrainHalovex</div><div class="date">11-07-2004, 11:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally I do this quite often, the people I group with tend to get a little cocky, but this is not hard at all.  But first you need to realize that the chance of getting aggro on all before they get to you is very slim.  Even if you mem more than 1 spear spell, there are a lot of mobs that will be in your faces before recast, but your group mates shouldn't take more than 1 hit.<br />
<br />
First you need to get at an angle where you can see all mobs clearly, then shoot a spear off at the mob trailing last.  And the moment the spear lands, assist the puller as quickly as you can.  The chances are the one he/she has targetted is the one closer to him/her.  <br />
Once its in camp, time yourself carefully and attack it with attack, bash, taunt, and disarm while its still running its last few steps toward the puller.  This will cause a &quot;first attack&quot; aggro effect, which will last for about 3 or 4 seconds.  Plenty of time to get a fester darkness or heart flutter off.  Once thats done get a fear off on the other mob (do NOT use dots on more than one mob unless you have no crowd control other than yourself!) and your more or less set.<br />
Just keep alternating targets every 20 seconds or so to attack/taunt/repeat a darkness or flutter.  Cuz lets face it, now that people have such a hardon for paladins they hate us, and love to give us that whole &quot;SKs are so useless, I wouldn't have died if we had a paladin or warrior&quot; bullshit.  <br />
<br />
If there are more than 2 mobs, yes, your group will take a few more hits.  But it wont be that bad.  If your fast enough you can get some aggro spells in before your group members can get anything in that would piss it off enough to cause aggro problems.<br />
<br />
If there are more than 3 mobs, you *CAN* do it, but the cleric will be working, and you'll have to start hoping your defense is good enough.  Just follow the previous steps.<br />
<br />
If there are more than 4 mobs... rethink your pulling group members....<br />
<br />
As for the targetting issue, pick your poison.  Personally the target ring cycling feature worked great for me if things got too heated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kilst</div><div class="date">11-07-2004, 11:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Get more offtanks :P Depends on how many mobs u are tanking? If ur tanking 2, I normally assist the puller, tag with darkness, use the Cycle NPC and Terror that one. Both those spells are high aggro, they should come running for ya. Once there on ya aggro is easy to maintain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eggborn</div><div class="date">11-08-2004, 08:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It was a Plane of Time raid that prompted this discussion.  I was not MA.  <br />
<br />
Good helpful comments by the way.  I didn't know about the last two targets thing.  I set up nearest NPC and toggle through close as Q and W.  I will look for the other.  I like the spear the back one theory, then assist monk.  I really wish I had some range focus!! but usually it's not an issue.<br />
<br />
It is more than four.  Something went wrong, but if I could target faster and get those spells off, it would have been ok.  Healers healing tanks is far better than healers healing healers. I personally feel that not everything is gonna go right on every raid, but sometimes they can be saved.  Gets me to bed earlier if they can hehe.  Even a link death at the wrong time can really make ones night.</div></div><hr />

This key is the best invention after hot water, sliced bread and Hott  :cool:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Usually when I Tank, as we all SK's know, our Snare/DoT is one of our fastest ways of getting agro and keeping it, with the help of our Terror, and Voice line of spells.<br />
<br />
I have always noticed that even when 2 or more mobs are incoming, and I tag the mob(one that the Puller pulls) with a Snare/DoT all of his other friends, don't seem to like it and tends to head straight for you.  Yes, Yes I know, once the Ench or someone else throws a slow or some other form of Debuff, the other mobs will now put them higher on the hate lists and head for that person, where as the first mob I taged is still comming to me.  Now where does this all boil down too?  I have been able to get agro on atleast 3 mobs for sure by using this.  Puller pulls, I snare mob, and Wham here comes his two buddies who are really pissed off at me.  The first mob is snared and will take some time to get there:-  the other two one I hit with Terror spell, and the other I try my best to tag it, and hit Taunt.  Usually works for me, but it does fail sometimes, I know a pure caster might be really happy for that extra second he has to get mob tied down.  The only places of late where I see I am having trouble doing this is in the OoW, and GoD zones, where the mobs run Like Grease Lightning, so you really don't have time to tag em all.  In all it's a nice little way to grab agro off of a couple mobs when they are incoming.<br />
<br />
I would like to know though if anyone has been able to come up with a really good way of doing it in OoW, and GoD zones,,, Dam mobs are just too fast.<br />
<br />
Nice post, will keep reading.</div></div><hr />

BoR's (or Devotion) is not going to do anything if you're using any spell with a less than 3 second cast time.  If you're using CD/Fear then Tribute a spellhaste 1 effect or get the cheapo aug from LDON. Use that buff slot for something else. Maybe it's personal preference but with our innate spellhaste we already get as an SK (plus any worn focus haste effects), I'd rather be using that slot for a few hundred more HPs or more AC or something. If you have the extra AA buff slots tho, then knock yourself out ;)</div></div><hr />
