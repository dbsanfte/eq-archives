Of course some companies ban those sorts of web sites as a way around their filters and tend to get a bit testy about stuff like that  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Flanders</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Inside the application is a constant that looks like this<br />

As far as the other subject is concerned, just because you can circumvent router/firewall rulesets via a Proxy doesn't change the fact that the company can still see what you do since the data originates from within their own network.</div></div><hr />

When I started level6 it was trying to authenticate via a website so I loaded a sniffer and captured the traffic between it and I.<br />
It mentions an encryption routine that's basically just character substitution.<br />
After some finagling with the letters, I got:<br />
<br />
Username: dabomb<br />
Password: encryptionrawks<br />
<br />
It said I was successful and to proceed to the following URL:<br />
http://www.try2hack.nl/levels/level7-xfkohc.php<br />
<br />
This is what Level7 says: 	<br />
LEVEL 7<br />
 <br />
Browser check: Sorry, but you must use Microsoft Internet Explorer 7.66</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Flanders</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Ya I had loaded etheral and read the packet as well.  I got the encrypted info but at that time it was 3pm on Friday and they were drinking free beer in the company cafeteria...needless to say my productivity dropped off...<br />
<br />
Good Job...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Flanders</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Level 7 is reading your browser version number in either <br />
1.  Serverside scripting php/asp e.g. <br />
(asp vbs syntax here) <br />
if mid(request.servervariables(&quot;CLIENT_VERSION&quot;), instr(request.servervariables(&quot;CLIENT_VERSION&quot;), &quot;.&quot;) - 1, instr(request.servervariables(&quot;CLIENT_VERSION&quot;), &quot;.&quot;) + 2)) &lt; 7.66 then response.write &quot;Sorry, but you must use Microsoft Internet Explorer 7.66&quot;<br />
<br />
Cant quite recall what the actual variable name is...I dont believe its &quot;CLIENT_VERSION&quot; but for now you get the gist...<br />
<br />
-or-<br />
<br />
2.  Clientside scripting and sending it to the server for scripting via the post method.<br />
<br />
if it does it the first way the only thing I can suggest is actually fiddling with the iexplore.exe binary to make version 7.66+ and then have it report that its 7.66+<br />
<br />
or <br />
<br />
if it does it the second way you can create a dummy asp or php page that will send the server the posted data saying you version 7.66+ <br />
<br />
those are the only two ways I can think of really...<br />
<br />
edit: also for those of you that dont know.  Internet Explorer 7.66 doesnt exist...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Flanders</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">btw programmer chicks == hawt++</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Khat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">:o <br />
<br />
It's called User Agent.<br />
I changed my Netscape to fool the site into thinking it was MSIE 7.66 and it worked.<br />
Now the page says:<br />
LEVEL 7<br />
 <br />
Browser check: OK!<br />
<br />
OS check:Sorry, but you must use a unix or linux system<br />
<br />
One of two things to be done here, I guess:<br />
Fool it into thinking this Windows box is actually Linux, or<br />
Fire up my Linux box, change the User Agent on it also, and access the site and see what happens.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Khat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Now I get this:<br />

 <br />

<br />
OS check:OK!<br />
<br />
Link check:Sorry, but you must get here from a link on the page: http://www.microsoft.com/ms.htm<br />
<br />
This sounds like it has to do with how web pages get referral info but I'm not too savvy with that so I'll poke around.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">You people are fuckin crazy..... goddam, I wish I had the know-how to be able to do that shit  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Khat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">It's not that difficult, really.<br />
For that last one, if you look at the page source the only thing you can work with is it makes mention of a file that is placed on the site by default.  It shouldn't be there for security reasons.<br />
You issue a command that exploits a vulnerability based on that file and you grab the passwd file.<br />
After you have the file with the encrypted passwords, you run a program against it with a wordlist (or brute force) to try to determine what the password is.<br />
After a bit of time, Voila!<br />
<br />
The Level 9 one references a PHP file so that is what there is to work with now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">I honestly don't know shit all about programming and computers then, because goddam.... I got halfway through reading your post and was completely lost  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Flanders</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">You didnt explain how you broke the php script in 9....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Khat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">You didnt explain how you broke the php script in 9....<br />
<br />
I was focusing on just trying to get the script but nothing was working so I loaded up the sniffer again.  Inside the traffic was the username and password that was supposedly stored in a cookie.<br />
I tried the combination but it said there was a problem with authorization.<br />
I tried random stuff and it said they were basically wrong, so at least I knew I had the right user/pass but I couldn't figure out why it wasn't fully accepting them.<br />
<br />
I looked in my local cookie files and there weren't any entries for the site so I figured Netscape was just keeping them in memory for some reason.<br />
I configured the browser to ask my permission for each cookie operation and tried again.<br />
When I hit Enter on the page, a window popped up with the cookie info for the username, then another with the password, and finally one that said auth=no.  The auth one explains why it said there was a problem with authorization.  It also said that the cookie is to expire after the session which explains why it wasn't written to file.<br />
I needed to change the auth=no to auth=yes but since there was no entry in a file to modify I needed to make the change during the session.<br />
<br />
I hunted around and found the command to edit cookie values on-the-fly.<br />
I changed the auth= to yes, then entered the user/pass and it was successful. :)<br />
<br />
ADD: I went to the IRC channel to try level10 but it said it was currently down so I guess that's it for now until it comes back up again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Flanders</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">aah.  In a real world scenario the username/password check would be done server-side.  The username and password would never been sent to the client, especially in clear text.  I wish they would do that as a level, I doubt there are many people in the world who could break it....</div></div><hr />

Welcome, I am try2hack Level10! Decode the following line to proceed:<br />

010011100110100101100011011001010010000001101010011011110110001000101110001000000100111001101111011101110010000001110100011110010111000001100101001000000010011100101111011011010111001101100111001000000101010001010010010110010011001001001000010000010100001101001011001000000111001101101000011011110111011101100010011101010110011100100111001000000111010001101111001000000111001101100101011001010010000001110100011010000110010100100000011000100111010101100111<br />
<br />
I converted the binary to it's text equivalent and get this: &quot;Nice job. Now type '/msg TRY2HACK showbug' to see the bug&quot;<br />
<br />
I send the command to the bot and get this:<br />
<br />
ovaq pgpe - CVAT pgpe:cvatercyl<br />
<br />
cebp pgpe:cvatercyl {avpx hubfg unaq qrfg xrl net} {<br />

<br />
chgfrei &quot;ABGVPR $avpx :Lbhe cvat ercyl gbbx $qhe frpbaqf&quot;}<br />
<br />
This is as far as I've gotten in the last couple minutes.<br />
<br />
ADD:  This must obviously be encrypted because no programming language would use such garbage and it wouldn't be practical for these to be bot commands in their current form.<br />
Just a matter of determining how it's encrypted.</div></div><hr />
