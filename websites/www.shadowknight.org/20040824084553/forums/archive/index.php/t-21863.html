George W. Bush (http://www.georgewbush.com)<br />
<br />
Does this movie really make anyone want to vote for Bush?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">By &quot;vote&quot; do you mean &quot;assfuck until he bleeds to death&quot;? If so, then probably yes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Androsulach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It makes me want to fire the lot of them and elect some nobody who knows what it's like to EARN a living and balance their checkbook.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>yuggoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, that would rule out 99% of the politicians out there....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Excessium</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Comparing those democrats to Hitler cause they are angry at GWB? What a bunch of fucking morons. Then again, a few people in his camp say if you don't support the war, you are anti-american. Fuck all that noise. Bush can kiss my ass. He pisses me off everytime he opens his mouth.</div></div><hr />

Again, that's 99% of all politicians out there (Russ Fiengold doesn't bother me for some reason)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The problem I have with politicians is that it seems like they all believe that it's their duty to switch their opinions constantly, thus making the choice of who to vote for really no choice at all.  Gone are the days when most politicians had a platform, and you voted for them based off of whether you agreed with what they believed in or not.  It's like they're really all the same person copied thousands of times, with one or two tweaks for each copy.</div></div><hr />
