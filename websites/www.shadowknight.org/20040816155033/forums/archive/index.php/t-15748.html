<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Drakkurr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm just wondering if the luggald organ quest for Spell: Blood of Pain was MQable?<br />
<br />
I have one organ, and a guildmate of mine has his spell already and one organ banked.  Neither one of us knew whether it was MQable but didn't want to risk trying it and lose the organs becuase they're a pain in the ass to get.<br />
<br />
So any info would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Draven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ok i got a silly question... Wat does MQable mean?<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Khat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Multi-Questable.<br />
Meaning two people have a required itam to be turned in for the final quest item.<br />
Person A turns in their item(s) and then person B (the one to receive the reward) turns in their item(s).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zulpel Bonstalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yes it is. that is how i got mine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Drakkurr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Okay so you say it is MQable.. <br />
so I went earlier today with a friend of mine who had that other organ.<br />
<br />
He turned his organ in.. then I turned mine in.. but nothing happened...<br />
<br />
The quest didn't work.<br />
<br />
So.. did I do something wrong?<br />
<br />
I've never MQed anything before so I suppose i may have made some crucial mistake, but my thought was that was all there was to it.. he turns one part in... right after that.. i turn my part in.. simple.. so that's what I did but it didn't work for me..<br />
<br />
Any advice?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">That should have been it, as far as I know; so apart from a bug, did you:<br />
<br />
- make sure both were organs and not flesh, bile, blood or saliva?  (i.e. your friend may have gotten mixed up).<br />
<br />
- did you turn into the right npc?  Cedric-somebody if I recall.  All I remember offhand was that Cedric was in some tent camp in Stonebrunt (not in Gunthak).<br />
<br />
- did you both hail the npc to see if both of you got the quest text?  I don't think there are faction issues but that also confirms if you have the right npc or not.<br />
<br />
Those are all I can think of, AFAIK you did everything right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Drakkurr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">the only thing out of that list i did NOT do was hail him..<br />
<br />
but.. my friend who did the first part is a 55th SK guildmate of mine who has already completed the quest himself and since picked up a few extra organs solely for th epurpose of MQing.<br />
<br />
I didn't think to hail him before the turn in.. figuring that generally doesn't effect the outcome of most quests... however after doing it.. it seemed like the only thing i may not have done, so I don't know for sure.<br />
<br />
My friend still has another organ still in the bank... so next one i get i'm goign to try the MQ once more and see if it works after hailing him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zzketza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">&quot; but.. my friend who did the first part is a 55th SK guildmate of mine who has already completed the quest himself and since picked up a few extra organs solely for th epurpose of MQing&quot;<br />
<br />
That may be your problem.  My understanding is that someone who has already completed the quest will not get credit for repeating it (to farm easy exp off it).  It may just be that the system has decided your friend already gained the spell and refuses to acknowledge his turn-in.<br />
<br />
Of course I could be wrong, but everything I have seen and heard points this way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Drakkurr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ahh see I had considered that, but never heard one way or the other.<br />
<br />
What I did just now, was I sent a /petition to the gms explaining what happened and asked them what they thought, or what they could tell me.<br />
<br />
I'll keep everyone posted on how this progresses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Drakkurr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I got a response from my petition today and as it turns out.. GMS are not allowed to give any support when we MQ something.. they say that when we do that... we do it at our own risk.<br />
<br />
So i am goign to assume then that it's due to how my friend had already completed the quest.<br />
<br />
So hopefully now somebody learns that for this quest, make sure that if you MQ it.. the person who does the first turn in isn't a shadowknight who has done the quest already!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">That has an *inkling* of familiarity to it.  Doesn't completing the Blood of Pain quest 'flag you' somehow for the next LoY spell quest for SK's (the FD one... Comatose?)?  That is, 2 SK's, of which one has completed BoP and the other who hadn't will get two different quest text dialogues...?<br />
<br />
I've seen nothing positive regarding this but only after reading what you posted did it sort of click in that I *might* have read something along those lines now.  I guess one way to check is to both hail Cedric and see if you get identical text (I know -- too little too late, but rather than try another MQ...).<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Luxem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I would have to agree that after completing the blood of pain, you are flagged for comatose... Same Npc for the turn in of both spell quests, but Im not sure if the stuff he says after bein hailed are different or not whether you are flagged...<br />
      Anyways, you and your bud should just go get the last organ from the blue dude on the stone bridge, and finish it bro.<br />
      Almost sounds like you're doin more work now than the original quest... btw, that spell is sweet, nice decent dmg DOT, that you can cast a few times in a decent fight. Good luck!!<br />
