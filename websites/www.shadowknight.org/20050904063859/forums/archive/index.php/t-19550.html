Saw one this evening, was wearing rygor(no graphic on an eru) but with a black hood. Went out and nabbed one in case it happened to be that particular graphic that allows this, but to no avail. Anyone have any info on this?</div></div><hr />

<br />
for example. helm of the deep sea is cloth graphic and has a colour</div></div><hr />

Occasionaly people will see my hood as having a color even though I do not because of an error in updating the model when they zone. But you will always see the no color version because you always get the proper update to your own character. You get the same effect when you see a bunch of dyed dead people standing around after a wipe. If you notice, the people that were standing there before you will most likely have their dye color showing, but anyone that pops in after you will show color for a second then pop back to normal.<br />
<br />
If you customize your crown you will have a plate helm you can color.  Be pround of your culry-cue!  ALso, when dying the head slot you may have to put your helmet on and off a few times and /or change several colors for it to update properly.</div></div><hr />
