<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Blackfish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Here is the problem with the new SK diety specific Human Newbie quests......<br />
<br />
The no drop quest items required simply do not drop often enough.  I know it may sound like a whine, but let me explain.<br />
<br />
I have run both types of Human SK (Freeport and Queynos), working entirely on the newbie quests only.  I kill only the mobs that drop quest related items.  I buy the other items as needed.<br />
<br />
Here is the kicker.  The Trivial Loot Code causes a major issue.  Because the items drop so rarely, an average SK Newbie will be at level 12 before he (or she) can get enough of the no-drop items to put their armor together.  At that level, almost every mob that COULD drop the quest items will show as green to you, and the TLC will kick in, resulting in NO No-drop items being given.<br />
<br />
It's a catch 22, you have to kill them to get the drops, but by killing them (and not being lucky enough in your drops) you get too high, to fast and can no longer get the damn things you wanted in the first place.<br />
<br />
DISCLAIMER:  YES, I know the new quests are better than nothing and that all you &quot;oldtimer&quot; SK's would love to go back to the days where Newbies got nothing.  But that isn't happening, and if EQ is going to have a Newbie Quest, it should be balanced with the other races/classes.<br />
<br />
For example, my Barb Warrior had all quest armors and the quest sword by mid-level 6 (all the items were dropable and buyable at shops)..................My level 13 Scourge Knight now cannot load ANY of the bits (all loaders show green), and is still missing the vambraces, greaves and Breastplate.....<br />
<br />
I also know that many would say &quot;Screw the Quest&quot; and get Banded or some other easy to buy items.  Fact is, the newbie armors look cooler than heck, and are decent statisticly for your average non-tweaked newbie.  Those two factors alone make me want them, and want them badly.....<br />
<br />
Could we not pressue EQ to raise the drop rate just a bit.....</div></div><hr />

<br />
b) go to tox and kill &quot;a skeleton&quot;s at night (not the ones at the city zone. Much better drop rate for calcified parts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jobrill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Try getting Wasp Warrior Pollen or Sylvan Bat fur for newbie light elves. THERE'S Torture.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kromglon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ogre sk armor quest was pretty well layed out. I tried a few other noobie quests before I settled on the sk. Ya I agree some of them are a real beyotch. Ogre one was cake compared to the others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bigswerve</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The issue that you are having is server-specific. Only one server has that problem and as such it probably won't be addressed. <br />
<br />
If you insist on playing on the server you are on and have a real hard-on for the newbie armor, you could always de-level. Just repeatedly die your way back to 10 (or whatever level TLC isn't an issue). This solution makes zero sense to me since, as you stated, there is much better armor available to you but you seem to think the armor is important so this could be your only option.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Blackfish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">One Question.....how can you tell if your server has the TLC??  I play on Stromm Currently, as I just started playing Everqust (late to the game).  Should I simply switch servers to a better one??<br />
<br />
Any suggestions??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>yuggoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Isn't Firiona Vie the only server with TLC?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Okami</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">ya, FV only. <br />
They even removed it from zones that started with it (warrns and others)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>ZarrosLivinglight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The TLC is a very good idea that was very poorly implemented.  The intent is to make it impossible for people to farm green mobs for valuable loot/gear (aka farming) as said activities can prevent the use of said content for the lower level characters it was intended for.  The problem was and is that many quest drops are subject to the TLC, and that means either finding ways around it, or knowing about head of time so you can plan your hunting, or hiring lower level adventurers to do your dirty work for you. :cool: <br />
<br />
Implemented properly, quest drops would be flagged as exempt from the TLC, making it possible to do them when it would normally make sense to do so or not having to worry about rare drops causing you to outlevel the mobs and being unable to get them.  It could have been used on the high-PP vendor items in the aqua gobbie camps in BB to prevent higher level people from farming them endlessly, and thus remained a nice place for lower level characters to get some decent money for a little while.  Once they outlevelled it, the high-PP items would go &quot;trivial&quot; and stop dropping for them.  Instead, the entire camp was nerfed, hurting everyone, including the newbies it was designed to help.<br />
<br />
Personally I think the quests should be reworked ala the froglok progressive quest, where you get character flags as you proceed, and that if your character has a flag that says &quot;he's doing quest_01&quot; that the mob intended to drop the quest item should drop it.  Doing the turn in, or combine, should turn said flag back off, or set it to &quot;quest step completed&quot;.  That and a TLC that ignores quest drops, would work quite nicely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Blackfish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Interesting.  So Stromm mobs should still drop no-drop items (like quest items) even if your level is higher than them and they show green, eh?<br />
<br />
Well, the drop rate must REALLY suck then.......back to hunting I suppose.<br />
<br />
Thanks all....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>cft2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I personally don't think all of the designers at Sony have given up on the TLC.  I would bet if we had the source code, and a month to sort through it, we would find a mild version of the TLC, which doesn't prevent drops from happening, but that shifts the odds.<br />
<br />
Simple example.  When I was starting EQ, I made a gnome mage.  He hunted spiderlings for like 5 levels, from 3-6 or so.  Like 75 percent must have dropped silks, which I liked at the time cause they stacked. (I didn't have many bags cause backpacks were so expensive).<br />
<br />
Now, when my mage or my SK decides he needs some silk thread, I can't just kill a dozen spiderlings and expect to get 10 silks.  I get like 1/3 the drop rate.<br />
<br />
Eh, not that I farm them often anymore; easier to buy em.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>ZarrosLivinglight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">There is no TLC at all on Stromm, but I also play on Firiona Vie (newbie iksar sk) so I mostly lurk here and comment where I know something as opposed to talking out of my ass (or at least I hope its when I know something and I'm not talking out of my ass...:p )  The TLC is alive and well on Firiona Vie and generally I think its a good idea in terms of making sure level-appropriate content is available for level-appropriate groups with level-appropriate rewards without having to worry about higher level people farming it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Leafweir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Trivial loot code only affects lore/magic items. Doesn't affect normal drops or cash. Frankly I think the cure is just time, and making level appropriate drops for mobs. The most often farmed old world items (SMR, FBSS, Yak, GEBs) came off the hardest mobs of the time. The wouldn't have been affected and were appropriate.<br />
<br />
The problem came about when Kunark rolled around and you had the Goblin earring, circlet of shadows, forest giant rings, etc dropping off lowbie crap while being notably better than equipment dropped before hand. Same with Ancient Cyclops in SRO and jboots. You had equipment that was a basic necessity for high end gaming dropping in non-level appropriate zones and as such ran into the farming issues.<br />
<br />
Frankly I don't think any adjustment is needed and all the attempts I've seen to stop farming/twinking are retarded. The one thing I do agree with are recommended levels. You don't need required levels on anything. <br />
<br />
Just make it such that, when equipped by a low end person the armor/weapon/buff is less effective. They are not able to use it to it's highest efficiency due to lack of skill.  Yeah, you can cast Po9 on the level 1 newbie. It lasts 3 hours and adds about 50hp and 1 health and mana regen and 10 ac. Same with damage shields, level 1 person? You get hit and your 60 point ds instead does 1 point. That's if you're serious about stopping twinking.<br />
<br />
I hate in final fantasy that I have to level up my primary class, then get brand new gear to level my secondary because the level on the primary is too high... and I can't shift my exp such that my secondary gets a percentage ala AA. I have to play as a gimp and work him up as if I was that class alone. Overall, hella gay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Blackfish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Thanks again all.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, has anyone (new people I would assume) ever actually completed the Nebiw SK armor/Weapon quests??  <br />
<br />
Any suggestions would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kahntun Derstand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">FV?  Just buy a full set of Grimror's and a Sews.  Problem solved.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Blackfish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">As I may have mentioned, I am brand new to the world of EQ (after years of text based MUD play) and I am not nearly as knowledgeable as I would prefer.  However, I have looked up and printed out a number of SK guides for some assistence.  <br />
<br />
My issue is this.  I make little to no money at my current level (11).  When I visit the Bazaar, the best I can get is usually much worse that the Nebwie quest equipment.  To that point, I currently have 15pp and have bought only two Bazaar items (Zaxthril Forged Cutlass and Innoruuk Buckler (which looks very cool btw)).<br />
<br />
While I would love to buy a &quot;Full Set of Grimror's and a Sews&quot;, I don't yet know what they are and have never seen them for sale in the Bazaar (of course I limit my search to 10-20 pp over my current bank lot).<br />
<br />
Please, do not flame me for my lack of knowledge.  Everyone is new at some point.  And right now thats me....<br />
<br />
DISCLAIMER:  I suppose it also doesn't help that I am very much a Solo play type guy and don't usually like grouping.  (No flames on this either please).  I understand the drawbacks that come with such a decision.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kahntun Derstand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Hey, I didn't mean it as an insult, bud.  I was just joking around. :)<br />
<br />
I respect anyone who starts to play this monster of a game so late in its life.  There's definitely a lot more to learn now than when I first started.  Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Blackfish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Hey, I didn't mean it as an insult, bud. I was just joking around.  <br />
<br />
I understand.  No offence was taken from your comments.  Just trying to show where I am coming from in my line of inquiry.<br />
<br />
As a veteran of many an online Forum (DOH! too many hobbies....) I know the intrinsic attitude many &quot;Veternas&quot; can have toward those who are clulessly Neewbi-ized, like myself in this case.   Ijust wanted to morse specifically state what type of info I was looking for and why (in my case) such newbie questions may be appropriate.<br />
<br />
All in all, this forum has been quite good (from what I've seen) so far (at least to me).<br />

Killgore (Lvl 1) Human SK</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Drynnious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Why did you make 2 human sk's? Pick one and focus on one. Ecspcially if they are both human.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Blackfish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I created the second to try out the Freeport based Newbie Quest/SK.  Thus was before I found out my server DOESN'T have the Trivial Loot code...meaning I can keep hunting for the red Scourge Kniught armor for Chargore.<br />
<br />
So the other will be either deleted or deleted and a new secondary char named Killgore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>cft2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I haven't done the SK armor quests.   I *did* make a ranger a while back, and had him doing the Surefall Glade newbie armor quests.<br />
<br />
A ranger, WITH tracking, and I spent levels hunting in queynos hills in hopes of getting the drops I needed from certain types of rats.<br />
<br />
And no, I never did get a full set of armor.    After leveling to the point where the mobs I needed no longer gave exp, and then still not having enough drops to make the armor, I gave up, and just did some leveling.   Considering this was a ranger, who could use tracking to make it much easier to find the right type of mobs, I would say that they is very discouraging result for you...<br />
<br />
<br />
I *do* remember a patch message, about 3 months ago, where they said they were reviewing the drop rates on the newbie armor quests, but I don't know how much it helped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I remade an eru sk once to dink around with the newbie quest for the SK armor. At some point all the mobs had turned green that could possibly drop the armor pieces and I still only had 1 bracer and a helm. <br />
<br />
At that point I decided they weren't implemented very well, the drops rates needed to be overhauled. By the time you could reasonably (at least for the eru sk armor that I attempted) have any chance of finishing a suit of the armor it would be vastly inferior to what would be appropriate for the level at which you actually finished it.<br />
<br />
Your results may vary. There was another post saying the troll armor was done in 6 levels. Each set I am sure is set up slightly differently I suppose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Nycathis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Consider it training for when you want to do the epic weapon quest ...... :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>AlucardusDoomblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I would like to say that as a noobie of brell, i was quite happy about the fact that i had gotten almost every piece of the armor for the quest, although for some reason i was not able to combine the items for the quest past lvl 12....kind of disturbing, and i may not have looked at it right but oh well<br />
/shrug<br />
all i know is it can be done, the only thing i was ever missing was the bracer i think, still have the armor rotting in my bank now that i think of it....probably will take the time to finish it if i get bored later to see if i just used the right components or what, would love to have the OMG you got EVERYTHING from the noobie armor quest plaque on my wall lol....although that is really the only quest i have done thus far...oh well, time to move on...can't stay a noobie forever</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Benucifer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I like the fact that you can do;<br />
<br />
Newbie Quest/Class Quest/Twilight Sea Quest then whatever.  I think the only problem is that it just takes too much damn time to get them.<br />
<br />
The &quot;time&quot; cost compared to the reward of the item is just not worth it :(.<br />
<br />
Which is a pity, I think the above three quests would be great if the drops came easier  (or you didn't need a tracker to stand a chance at getting them).  As they all take you to different zones (I suppose the class stuff is one zone only), and gets people to try new and experience new things.   Which is great for new players imo, as EQ is so Vast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Doryshan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I started my first toon on Stromm and yes I completed the DE newbie armour quests. The drop rate on the higher items such as for BP was very lean. I found /ooc to be my friend and the newbies worked together to help with the rare stuff.<br />
<br />
I helped a newbie Human SK on Stromm over the past week. She has also found the drop rate in East Karana (she killed at the SE Skele Camp) to be few and far between. But she has a complete set of the armour now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Naaklum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I did the entire DE SK noob armor quest, as it was my first toon.  My freind started a level one drood when I was 12, by the time I finished, I was level 15 and they were level 17.  They also did the entire noob armor quest for their class.  I did nothing but camp the monolith in nektulos from level 7-12 or 13, then the undead camp near LS til 15 to get weapon.  I thought I was super uber.  =)  At level 30 I started Dark Forge, finished full set at 32.  I then went to DSP and started Twilight Sea Armor Quest right away.  At level 40 I still needed about 1/3 of the drops for it, had better armor by then, and gave up the quest.  My freinds drood was now level 47 I think fwiw.  I have done the entire Greenmist quest, and am only a soul leach away from epic.  Just dinged 58 last night.  I must say that if I didn't do ANY quests, my toon would be 65 by now easily.  As a side note, I made a warrior that I did nothing but exp groups with, and hit 46 in less than 2 weeks.  10 days I think to be exact.  /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Zakton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I have to agree that the newb armour drops are really slow.  I tried to see how often they dropped by killing all the skellys that drop it as much as possible, and it even less that the drop rate for darkforge.  At least with DF you get a item , whether its the one you want is another matter.</div></div><hr />
