<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ushak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings, my hate spreading bretheren.<br />
<br />
My name is Ushak, new Ogre Shadowknight from the Xev server.  I have a single question.  I am new to the world of Everquest and created and Ogre.  I put all 20 of my bonus points into INT upon start-up.  This brings my stats to:<br />
<br />
STR - 140<br />
STA - 127<br />
AGI - 70<br />
DEX - 70<br />
WIS - 67<br />
INT - 90<br />
CHA - 42<br />
<br />
Since my creation, I have read that having stats below 70 can be detrimental.  As I am only level 3, should I re-create myself, spending 5 points each in DEX and AGI with only 10 going to INT?<br />
<br />
I am not concerned with WIS as that doesn't seem to be important at all for SK.  And CHA...  I am an Ogre.  I am not suppossed to be pretty.<br />
<br />
I thank you for your wisdom in this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Meriboh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There really is no right or wrong way to distribute your starting stats, as you should custom your character as you see fit and how you wish to play.<br />
If you wish to know what the recommended placement for starting statistics are, it is as follows...<br />
All points should go into Stamina. Stamina will determine the amount of hit points you have as well as how well you continue to fight after your stamina is drained. More than 100 points in stamina will ensure that valuable statistics such as strength and dexterity do not drop when stamina bar is drained. Stamina also determines how long you can hold your breath and the length of time you can swim without tiring.<br />
Intelligence is one of the easiest statistics to raise using items in the game; that and strength.<br />
You are correct that wisdom and charisma have no impact on our class.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lunaticfringesk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">When creating a new ogre (or troll for that matter) SK, Ushak has probably done it perfectly.  Many might say to only put 15 into INT and 5 into AGI, so there wont be a huge ac hit, but getting 5 AGI is just painfully simple nowadays and I dont know of too many people that like to fight when naked.<br />
<br />
For a non-large race, I would recommend putting all into STA (other on this board would disagree strongly, but...).  For a large race, however, there is no question, INT is the way to go.<br />
<br />
Casterrealm's site is vastly outdated (a big bummer to me) and some the information on the site is highly questionable (i.e. see the defintion and explanation of combat stability).  One must be very careful using that site as a reference.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Moongarm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Honestly I would make over and put those extra 5 points each in dex and agility. Since you're new to the game(and assuming un-twinked) If you spend those 10 points now then you pretty much never have to worry about making sure they're over 75 again. (unless you're wearing any pieces with negative statistics on them, of course.) <br />
<br />
With the remaining 10 points, either going STA or INT you really can't go wrong on either.  Personally I'd choose INT. But either is a well invested 10 points.<br />
<br />
If you have any other questions feel free to send me a tell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>borrean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i know when i created my sk i put it all into int.<br />
<br />
and i prefer it that way i can solo longer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Frued</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I would reroll and place 5 points into Agility and Dexterity. <br />
<br />
 The remaining points I would place in Stamina, but placing the rest in Intelligence is certainly not a bad choice.<br />
<br />
 Also while intelligence is inportant it in no way dictates whether an Ogre SK can solo effectively. I did not surpass 100 INT till level 50 and I have soloed 95 percent of my levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>nnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">getting the 5 dex and 5 agi is not that hard with standard SK equipment. I'd say the Sta route is wise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Why Dex?  Aside from procs, it doesn't seem to affect any of our specific abilities.  I could see putting 5 points into AGI.  I could see the argument centered around whether to go with INT or STA on a large race.  Dex just seems a waste to me though.  Dex comes as a secondary stat on many SK wearable items, it jumps up fast, and it doesn't start that low.  Notice that with 20 points in INT, he's only at 90.  Honestly, I'd say that increased mana pool early on will be more of a benefit than extra proc ability when he won't be able to master even the lowest procs until much much later in his life.  And as a Troll, I've struggled with INT and mana pool for a very long time.  I didn't put any points into  INT at creation, and now, even with my tradeskill gear on (which I can't wear while fighting, because of the drop in AC/HP) I only get up to 120 or so.  I've seen a marked lack in decent +INT/+Mana gear for a non-twinked main character SK.<br />
<br />
/shrug<br />
<br />
Do whatever you feel comfortable with, though.  Even with only 89 INT in fighting gear, I do ok, and there's always KEI, right?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Lunaticfringesk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Kugbok hit the nail on the head...<br />
<br />
Many other SKs will argue to put all into INT, *regardless* of race, as they can max just about every stat but that.<br />
<br />
For a small race, I would probably still go the STA route, as the guild you need to be in to max STA *easily* probably needs to be SSRA/EMP capable, which not everyone can be in.<br />
<br />
For a large race, however, there is no question though.  All (or substantally all) into INT.  No question about it.<br />

Level 3 takes no time at all, and having agi under 75 is a huge AC hit.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Lunaticfringesk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I suppose Im confused...<br />
<br />
Why is there all this talk about *needing* to have AGI 75 (or above), therefore, put 5 starting points in AGI?<br />
<br />
AGI is really easy to increase, and, at higher levels, max out.  Im not to sure I see too many people fighting naked, nor do I believe that it is something that we would want to do on a frequent basis.<br />
<br />
So, I ask again, why put any points into AGI at inception if its so easy to increase?<br />

Read his post.  He's new to the game, why put yourself through any extra trouble than you have to?  It's not like that 5 points you spent in AGI and not STA or INT is going to make any incredibly huge impact on your HP's or Mana pool.  Are you really that far gone into Min/Maxing you can't see that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>NorrynNoir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">i would go with +5 into agi. if you are new to the game you won't be able to twink yourself so avoiding the ac penalty is definately worth 5 less intelligence.<br />
<br />
+5 agi +15 int<br />
<br />
and i agree with moongarm, luna you can't assume everyone will find it easy to get their agility up through gear right out of the gates at lvl 1.<br />
<br />
since before lvl 22 you realistically will be tanking everything for xp i'd say that AC negative would not be worth 5 more intelligence. <br />
<br />
you have indeed argued before that the additional intelligence that dark elves / erudites have adds little to their solo capability. if this is the case why spend 5 points on intelligence and take a nasty ac hit?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Lunaticfringesk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">&quot;Read his post.

<br />
<br />
<br />
Extra trouble?  You think getting 5 AGI is hard?  Im told all the time how *easy* it is for any race to max STA out, so what does that say about 5 more AGI?<br />
<br />
Further, smartass, I never stated that he *SHOULD* put all into INT, as you are insinuating.  My quote:<br />
<br />
&quot;All (or substantally all) [should go] into INT&quot; <br />
<br />
Loosely translated, 5 into AGI surely wouldnt be unreasonable.<br />
<br />
That, however, is not all the talk I see regarding this, including this thread.  Its always something along the lines of, &quot;You must put 5 into AGI, or your AC will suffer.&quot;<br />
<br />
Therefore, I wanted someone to explain that to me, not be a smart-ass, like you, and make some rude comment.  Yeah, Im really that far *gone*....<br />
<br />
I tell you what I am *gone* with.  Maximizing my advantage.  No matter how small the impact at 65 5 more INT is going to be, or how inconsequental it is to you, its still better then 5 less INT (assuming all other things are equal).  Your rude comment, however, calls into question of why even bother asking?  You could put all of your god-damn starting points into CHA if you wanted, and still generate one hell of an SK.  <br />
<br />
So, make up your mind.  Either the 20 starting points, and the increments of, do make a difference or they dont.  If they dont make a difference, then this entire thread is a waste of time.  If they do, then you sure as hell better re-think your comment.<br />
<br />
My guess is that they DO make a difference to you, lest you wasted your time, and everyone else's, telling him to start over with his oGre.<br />

<br />
+5 agi +15 int&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Being new to the game has little to do with how one should distribute your starting points.  What is of far greater importance is his best estimate of where he thinks he will be with his character in both the short and the long-term of his EQ *life*.  <br />
<br />
I was fairly certain out of the gates that I was going to be playing fairly hard-core.  The fact that I was *new* to the game surely wouldnt make me change my mind in terms of where I should put my starting points.  If you think you are going to be a power-gamer, you will hear arguements from many *elder* SKs that INT is the way to go.  While, in certain situations, I disagree with that, it still holds merit and is hard to argue looking at their profiles (Manslayer being one example).<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;luna you can't assume everyone will find it easy to get their agility up through gear right out of the gates at lvl 1.&quot;<br />
<br />
I never, ever, made this assumption and I know not where you got that from.  I merely stated that it is easy to get 5 AGI.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;since before lvl 22 you realistically will be tanking everything for xp i'd say that AC negative would not be worth 5 more intelligence. &quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
I dont know where the cut off point is, but getting 5 AGI by level 22 surely isnt unreasonable, especially with the game in its current state.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;you have indeed argued before that the additional intelligence that dark elves / erudites have adds little to their solo capability. if this is the case why spend 5 points on intelligence and take a nasty ac hit?&quot;<br />
<br />
The point is, it is doubtful, that the AC impact will have any relavance, as its easy to get 5 AGI.<br />

<br />
<br />
At the end of the day, USHAK needs to come to his own conclusion, so yes, I agree that he should be made aware that 74 and below AGI will have a detrimental impact on his AC.  He also should informed of a plethora of other aspects to that might justify *not* putting 5 points into AGI.  The simple fact of the matter is, he can go either way.  Both decisions *can* make sense.  Im NOT saying that all 20 into INT *is* the way to go, Im only saying that it is *wrong* to say that he *should* put 5 into AGI due to the AC penalty.<br />
<br />
The fact that he is new to the game, however, bears no relevance whatsoever.  I mean, think about it; a experienced player, who has and projects the same goals for his character as such new person, should make different starting point allocations?  /boggle<br />

I seldom, if ever, would *attack* someone else, for I go to great lengths to respect other people's viewpoints.  When I am disrepected, however, which, unfortunately takes place against so many people so often on this board its amazing, I am very quick to fire back.  Granted, perception may be different then reality, but it is difficult sometimes to note the difference between the two.<br />

On a serious note - I thank you all for your time and advice.  I have even been the fortunate recipient of some good natured adventurers who were getting rid of old stuff.  The issue of my Agility has already been cured through the use of gear.<br />
<br />
I have also been doing some homework.  The other day someone came into the Feerott buying spiderling silks at 1p each.  Not enjoying the few coppers or occassional silver I was getting from killing monsties, I quickly sold 40 of them.  40 platinum!  <br />
<br />
Now then.  If I average 2 silks per spider overall, I would have to kill 500 spiders to get 1000 platinum, and killing 10000 would net me 5000 platinum.  This means I need to kill only 160000 spiders before I can buy one of those nifty Fulvous Darkscale Breastplates I been reading about =)  I better get busy.</div></div><hr />
