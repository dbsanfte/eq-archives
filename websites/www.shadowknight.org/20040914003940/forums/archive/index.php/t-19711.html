<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dexk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A while ago, I read that a Mana Pres item would be equivalent to a FT 2.5 item in terms of mana management.  Is there any validity to this?  If not, how does FT and Mana Pres compare?<br />
<br />
Im debatting on whether to get a FT3 item or a mana pres IV item.  I currently only have FT1. <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any insight.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Totally depnds on the situation. For encounters with lots of downtime, FT may come out ahead. But for casting-intensive runs where you are likely to burn you mana bar, mana pres will make more of a difference.<br />
<br />
Short answer: get both.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">in terms of sustainable mana usage, mana preservation cuts all spells by 10%, so the more mana regen you have the more you will be helped by mana preservation. if you want to compare it directly to FT, divide the amount of mana you're regenning on the average tick by 10, and it's better than that much FT.<br />
<br />
lets say on average you're getting 45 mana/tick... you'd be able to spend 50 mana/tick worth infinitely with mp4, because you'd save 5 on every 50 you spend.<br />
<br />
<br />
at a minimum i'd say mana preservation 4 is slightly better than ft4, and the more mana you're getting the more beneficial it is. just using pact of hate, mental corruption, and zevfeer's bite, you can get 40+mana/tick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Darko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">MP is not a statick casting cost reducer it varies 1-10% or what ever the % indicated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">1-20% believe so avg comes to 10.5% if im not mistaken.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>aress</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">aye, get both, very worthwhile.  FT first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>NorrynNoir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i must say, mana preservation to me just doesn't seem like something that makes a lot of sense for me to work on. if i look a the various spell set ups i use for tanking / raiding / dps , etc. pretty much the spells that i'm using are:<br />
<br />
death peace lvl 60<br />
blood of hate lvl 63<br />
spear of decay lvl 64<br />
deny undead lvl 61?62?<br />
zevfeer's bite lvl 62<br />
festering darkness lvl 61<br />
ignite blood lvl 61<br />
clinging darkness lvl 15<br />
fear lvl 15<br />
aura of pain lvl 63<br />
touch of volatis lv 62/63?<br />
spear of plague 5(something)<br />
<br />
based on this an MP 3 focus will do jack shit for me. fear and cd are such low mana anyway what is 10% going to mean to me, not enough for me to give up any hp's i don't think. i don't use DP enough that i need to preserve mana on it, the 2nd lvl spear is not often in my lineup so that's not a big deal.<br />
<br />
an MP IV item would be fantastic but the only droppable one i'm ware of is the ceramic water sprinkler and it has zero ac/hp's on it i believe so in a tanking role you're certainly giving something up for it. the vast majority of the time i'm playing , i'm tanking so outside of the nice no drop MP IV items that are all raid type events, MP doesn't seem terribly attainable.<br />
<br />
is there any item i'm missing which is say 1 group attainable with MP 4, or is this a very difficult focus to obtain?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">people on our server two group Vallon Zek in tactics...and he drops the mana pres. 4 item i am wearing in my neck slot on my magelo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Noctix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ceramic Water Sprinkler of Marr has 0ac but it does have 65hp.  It also has a type 7 augment slot, which isn't available from elemental bows (which have a craptastic type 4 slot).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kuvak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">During exp group runs, I have found the most economical and efficient use of a mana pres item is the Ceramic Gavel of Justice. Only affects DoT type spells, but reduces cost by 25% on those, so makes Blood of Hate a LOT more desirable. Just cast early and it's usually about to wear off or worn off by the time the mob dies. I only have FT1 and I cast BoH at least once, and CD at least twice on every mob, and I never go OOM even when chain pulling, so long as I have Pact of Hate and MC up.<br />
