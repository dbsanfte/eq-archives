<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Stakeum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">On allahkazam in some of the quest descriptions will say that mobs holding an item for the quest will appear to be glowing.  I have done some of these quests and never noticed any of the mobs that happened to drop a quest item to be glowing.  Is there some configuration I need in options to see this, or is it a myth, or am I just blind?  Any information would be very appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lufan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">First of all, you have to go to Options (before logging in your account) and check the option that says: Dynamic Light<br />
<br />
Coldain Shawl Quest # 5 is one example. You need to kill the Wurms in GD to get the biles. At night, you can notice a significant difference that some wurms seem to carry a lightsource on them. <br />
<br />
Another example, the Reet Knights/Shamans in Sebilis. I was soloing one and I noticed one of them is a lot brighter compared to the others. I went for that, killed, and got the Reet Crown.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Silvershadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Can only confirm that yes, the wurms for coldain shawl 5 (I think it's 5 at least) do glow in the dark if they have the item and you have dynamic lighting on.<br />
<br />
That said, this does not apply to all that many mobs. Never noticed it anywhere besides there, really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Smidgit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Fire beetles glow when they have a fire beetle eye.<br />
<br />
But seriously, very few quest items give off light. Look up the item in Lucy, and see if it says anything for &quot;light.&quot; The entry under &quot;light&quot; will tell you just how strong of a light source the item is. I think torch is the weakest (2), and greater lightstone is the strongest (11).<br />

<br />
Sample which gives off light (for silverwing quest) (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=69325) <br />
Sample quest item which does NOT give off light (greenmist) (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=3889)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Darkmourn D`Estrellas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">More than likely he's referring to the new VP quest items that drop from glowing mobs.  As far as I know, every drop for the different quests, whether it be &quot;inscribable words&quot; or blood or power source etc. is torch level illumination.  I can personally confirm that the *one* time I've managed to get a quest piece, the mob was glowing quite noticeably.  It was in the Deep, and if you've ever spent much time there you'll know that there are a ton of glowing blue rocks all around.  I spent a lot of time killing mobs without getting a drop near those rocks just in case I couldn't see the glow because of the rock, and then when one spawned I knew instantly that it was going to have the piece.  It's very hard to explain, but unless the mob is standing right next to a torch already, and you have dynamic lighting on as described above, you'll know.  Of course, in zones like Torment there are freaking torches all over the place :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Modalex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">All 3 of the vp quest mobs in chardok b glow noticeably when they have the quest pieces on them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Stakeum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">thanks for all the help finally saw my first glowing mob and it indeed had a peice for one of the new vp quests</div></div><hr />
