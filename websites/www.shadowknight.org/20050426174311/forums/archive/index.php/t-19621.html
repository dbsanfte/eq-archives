<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nosnorb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does anyone know a good way to get the damned froglok raiders to spawn in Swamp of No Hope?  I got all but one now and the last one is killing me been stuck on this part for 2 days!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1)  Get rid of that monstrosity of a sig.  Jeebus, that thing is huge (filesize).  I have business class DSL and it took a full 45 seconds to download.<br />
<br />
2)  Keep plugging away at it, you'll get the last one.  It always seems like the last page is the rarest, but that's just perception.  In fact, none of the pages are any more or less rare than any other page.  It's kind of like asking &quot;why are my car keys always the last place I look?&quot;... <br />
<br />
3) Really, fix that sig.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>NorrynNoir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">all i remember is the raiders spawn in waves. so kill everything in sight in the north of the zone and eventually you'll get say 5 or 6 raiders to spawn in a 5 minute period. then things might go dry for 20 minutes.<br />
<br />
that was the distinct pattern i had when doing that quest but that could have been random chance. the good thing is though that that khukri is by far the most annoying one to do. i preferred the dalnir camp to that nightmare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nosnorb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hmm...I run on cable modem here and I load it just fine:confused: ...anyway thnx for the info guess Ill get it sooner or later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Signatures should be reasonable. This means we are recommending no larger than 150x600 pixels and 50k in size. This rules has been in discussion for a while and while we are not current forcing the limit signatures that grossly violate the recommendation will be removed and the owner asked to change the image. An acceptable bending of the rule would be a 200x200pixel images with the text to the right of it but a 400x50 sig with text below would be asked to change. <br />

Your animated sig pic is 1.4 MB.  The reason it loads fine for you is that it's already cached on your system.  It loads fine for everyone after the file is stored locally, it's the inital download that makes it annoying.... or the subsequent downloads for those of us who clear our temporary internet files more often than once a year.  <br />
<br />
Not trying to be a jerk, but it really is excessive, even if it does look mildly cool. :)<br />
<br />
And yes, do hang in there with the Frogloks.  That part was definitely worse for me than the Dalnir parts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nosnorb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ohh hehe didnt see that sorry all I wll change it.
