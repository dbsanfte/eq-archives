That's coz most SK's aren't fucktards and have had to acquire a few clues along he way, unlike sony dev's or people choosing to play warriors.<br />
<br />
I hate grouping with warriors, honestly, the amount of cocky doofuses you get &quot;I'll pull, I'll pull, ..... here I come, here I come, I'm pulling, I'm pulling !!!&quot; right - as the group stands mortified at the Tsunami of mobs Conan the No-brain drags back in tow.<br />
<br />
Seriously, the majority of wars you find playing are like some old ladies dopey sheep dog that will do anything for someone to 'throw the ball&quot; and say &quot;good boy&quot;.<br />
The melee balancing/warrior adjustments just made someones retarded kid on a war able to recreate the same effect as an SK/Pal - cept the retard on the end of the warrior can now continue mashing his taunt key like a coked out pidgeon in some demented psych experiment and not stop to wonder &quot;why it isn't working&quot; anymore&quot;. *sigh*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kalendrox Grimblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">We've got 3 in my guild, Time/Early GoD.  We don't really do much beyond off-tanking adds for some fights, or snaring/leashkiting for VZ.</div></div><hr />

<br />
still, I am the only one that really does more than dps, and its usually pulling</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Trysbrina67</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">We have about 5 active SKs, most concern themselves with OTing ( to be honest I like OTing more than pulling, but thats just me) on raids rather than pulling for a few reasons;<br />
<br />
1.  The Monks - For some reason monks really don't like anyone pulling on current content (even bards) and its not really worth the bitch out you occasionally recieve.<br />
<br />
2.  3 is enough - You dont need a million pullers for stuff, heck most stuff can be done reasonably well with 1 to 3 people, anymore than that and you simply start to get in each others way.<br />
<br />
That being said knights work well together, while 2 sks in a goup isnt huge dps it ensures that things like AoHate stay up almost constantly, which is nice for dps.</div></div><hr />

Hrm. Well Isengard has 9 sks that could show up to a raid at any given time, usually seeing 6 or so on. <br />
<br />
I'm going to go out on a limb and say that that's the highest saturation on Saryrn.<br />
<br />
The benefit of this? Beats me. 2 SKs in a group being more beneficial than an SK and some other class depends on who you're talking about, but if you assume skilled people I can think of better classes to choose over a 2nd sk.<br />
<br />
As far as raids go, offtanking usually, very little pulling, and pretending we're doing the raid a huge benefit by VoTing is the order of the day. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The upperlevel GoD guilds (ton, oop, hne, twc) have some good SKs, but not many in number if I recall correctly. And of that number even less would admit to sending me nasty sex tells when I'm reading my Bible by candlelight.</div></div><hr />

We are in Time and learning ikkinz atm.<br />

Our Sks usually OT and TankMez...<br />
if the pallies dont try to save us  :confused: <br />
But hey! i just use those pallies as my mitigation...since im still getting heals for calling OT haha<br />
<br />
A few Sks pull also if the monks let them. <br />
<br />
On Morrel Thule there are still alot of sks. Alot have quit eq though. :(</div></div><hr />

Sanctus Arcanium has 4 maybe 5 and they are not wanting anymore.<br />

I was in Black Company and we were just about to Time and the guild blew up in a bad way not sure why but it no longer exsist.  Not sure how it is on another server but all my friends that were in BC are now in SA Numi and Pak and I wont be able to join them because I am a SK and guilds on my server just do not want them.  <br />
<br />
Not sure why you are looking for more in a guild to group with unless you dont raid then that is a cool thing, I would almost say be happy your in a guild.</div></div><hr />

What guild are you in on Saryrn, Ukbar? Saryrn seems to have alot of 65 SKs nowadays, although a few of the best ones have retired. My guild OoP has 6 SKs and 1 inactive SK right now, which is probably a bit much to have, but you learn alot from each other. Really it is more about who your other SKs are than anything else, this class has attracted its share of morons along the way...</div></div><hr />

Now i could post a 14 page drama thread on how the BC officers sold their guild off, but I refrain.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Specnatz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">no offense Gan but I doubt you have any clue as to what happen except what you read on Realpoor.  Most of the stories out there are completely false and since you were not in BC how would you know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Ashrai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">So, I've often wondered what it would be like to be in a guild with more Shadow Knights<br />
<br />
Our guild has 7 SKs, with varying playtimes, one of them currently offline for a bit. Some nights I'll be the only SK on the raid for a while if I log on early, but usually we average 3-4. Our SKs and Pallies work closely together, sharing a chat channel, and our guild's clearing style allows for plenty of Offtankage to go around so no one gets bored. Our Warriors like to use VoT so if we've got a few SKs on the raid, it helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Arikash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I'm so bored with my guild ATM, we just got assimilated into a bigger guild, but the only thing is, ONLY monks pull, they won't even let my friend(skill-wise, best bard on server IMO) pull shit, when all the raid leaders know he can pull.  Singles everytime, so all I do is sit there and hit assist =/</div></div><hr />

Its not what is true and what is false, its what everyone else thinks its the truth. especially when you are guildless.</div></div><hr />

Again you demonstrate, your lact of logic, grammar and intelligence.</div></div><hr />

We are an EP guild working on our last EP god before Time (Corinav) and entry level GoD stuff (Smith Rondo/Vxed/Tipt).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Darkhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I am the GL of a mid level, social guild on Saryrn (150 members +/-). I am the only active SK in my clan as well. We have the occasional SK join us for a while, but they always seem to move on. We have a very high retention rate for recruits seeking a guild like ours, but sk's always seem to be searching for something...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Mid-Level guilds on Saryrn mostly fell apart as the T2/3 PoP zones were unlocked and people didn't have to spend 55-65 leveling in PoDisease or PoI Factory if they were lucky...lol. Happy to see some have managed to grow back now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>frotty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Again you demonstrate, your lact of logic, grammar and intelligence.<br />
<br />
According to the rules of grammar, you just said &quot;Again you demonstrate grammar and intelligence.&quot; I'm not sure, but your &quot;lact[sic] of logic&quot; either would act as a modifier of &quot;grammar and intelligence&quot; or &quot;demonstrate&quot; - why I'm not sure is because obviously neither make sense.<br />
<br />
Commas are a bitch, I suppose.<br />
<br />
~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
Dyrkk is right on with the midlevel guilds going poof. They generally don't give much airtime to the SKs, so the SKs figure &quot;well, if I'm going to fit into some spoiler 'max-efficiency' strategy I might as well be doing it in any other guild.&quot; <br />
<br />
In those spoilers, generally, having one more of a class that could do what the SK would be doing works just fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I did a long stint as an officer in a L50+ guild, and eventually it got to the point where we'd gotten epics done for 10 or more clerics...thats alot of time to spend with a mixed bag of L50s in Chardok, btw...and then we'd never see the cleric again basically.<br />
<br />
Intermediate guilds go along fine on the social/casual level...it's when you try to be a mid-level raiding/progression guild that the turnover becomes a constant factor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Arikash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">We had that happen to us a few times, but not with clerics, it happened once with a druid who just used us to get to 65, then another time with a chanter, who got her epic, then became quiet in chat, then after some FT loot from IV got distributed, she left saying shit was unfair.<br />
<br />
Now we've been absorbed into a new guild, we get 2-3 people a week, and 1-2 people leave a week it seems like, the other day on emp, our MT/GL says he was bugged and wouldn't proc, my friends and I are pretty sure after not watching him swing, he didn't have auto-attack on =/.</div></div><hr />
