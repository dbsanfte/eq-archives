<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Phara Dar says 'Poor Fraka, he was only a whelp. The betrayers have paid for their crime. While this has avenged the loss of my brother, it still does not take the pain away. Here is your reward for your trouble. Should you find this reward is not fitting, I can replace it with a different one. Now, please leave my sanctum. I need time alone.' <br />
<br />
If you don't like what he gives you, presumably you turn it in to him and get something else... has anyone tried this and know what it gets you?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>runcade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">melee version is ring of the azure sky.  the quest and loot is on allas</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bloodmere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Did you turn in Frakadar's Talisman? I did that and recievd the cloak of the Dar Brood a 34% back haste item</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have the ring of azure sky.  My question is if I give ring of azure sky to phara dar, what does he give me back?  He hints that there are other rewards if I'm not happy with the ring.  As it is, i'm happy with the ring, so I don't hand it in... but I do wonder what the other rewards are.  Is there a 2nd or 3rd melee reward?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Valdeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I understood for all the vp quests that turning back in items just cycled through the different class-group rewards.  Not first hand though; still looking for tooth and blood :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>kharan_zechts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The only other reward is earring of phara dar (look it up on lucy).<br />
Its a caster item. Every vp quest has one melee and one caster reward. You can hand in your ring for the ear then hand in the ear back for the ring again.</div></div><hr />
