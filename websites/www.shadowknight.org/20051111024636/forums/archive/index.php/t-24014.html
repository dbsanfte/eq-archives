<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CursedBlue</div><div class="date">01-13-2005, 04:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh I got the shiny brass halberd from heritage quest, I didn't sell it, leaving for a few days come back its no drop no trade no value. What the hell do I do with it? Can't even equip as an sk...Destroying comes to mind but there must be something else... :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bulvyne</div><div class="date">01-13-2005, 10:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">2 things come to mind:<br />
<br />
1) Put it in the bank, hoping that down the road we'll be able to somehow use it. Maybe they'll give us the skill to use it, or maybe they'll change it. But, I wouldn't hold my breath if I were you. ;)<br />
<br />
2) Destroy it.<br />
<br />
I have to say, I though it was funny how a few days before the patch, all those guys trying to sell it for 10-50 gold suddenly started dropping their prices down to 2-3 gold, or less.  :p</div></div><hr />

It sucks that we cant use, I will keep it in bank thought in case of a future change. Dont forget that the real reward of this quest are the 40k status points you got and not the halberd. Also keep in mind that having completed 5 heritage quests you receive the title 'the Treasure Hunter'.</div></div><hr />

<br />
New member here. The shiny brass halberd can be used by SK. I use it all the time when i solo. Might have changed it. Old thread?.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lucard</div><div class="date">06-14-2005, 08:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah this was an old thread.  SK's can use the SBH and once you dont want to use it anymore, you can mount it on your wall or sell it to a vendor.  If at anytime you want it back, you can go to the shady swashbuckler on the dock in Nektulos and buy it back.<br />
<br />
On the personal status, I am pretty sure you get it back when you join another guild, its just exp lost for a guild that can never be gotten back.  If you were a patron that is.</div></div><hr />
