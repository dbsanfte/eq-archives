<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bakatengu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">People argue all the time about which race makes the best sk's. Unlike other classes (cough, cough, warriors), there isn't one race that stands out above the rest. Why? Because SK's are a flexible class that can be played in a variety of ways. The way you play influences which race is best for you. Here is my view of the strengths and weaknesses of each race.<br />
<br />
Dark Elves<br />
Advantages: Infravision is always nice. Having Hide as a starting ability can be a litteral life saver, and can make medding a lot less agrivating early on. <br />
Drawbacks: While they have great int and agil, their strength is low, and they have the least Stamina of the sk's.<br />
Overall: DE's are balanced pretty well, and have a wide selection of gear. Generally they tend to make good group members as secondary tanks. May not be as good as soloing as some of the other races until the latter levels, but aren't slouches either. <br />
Best Played by: People whith Smurf fetishes.<br />
<br />
Euridites<br />
Advantages: Highest Starting Intelligence in the game. Great starting area.<br />
Drawbacks: Nightblind, lackluster stats aside from Int.<br />
Overall: Euridites are the thinking man/women's SK. They can't rush blindly into battle and hope for the best. They tend to be 2/3 necro 1/3 tank. Euridites make some of the best fear kiters in the game, as they generally have an ample mana pool to draw from. Which is good, as you will have to face some negative stereotyping regarding your tanking ability. Despite the fact that you have the same starting str, and better Sta than a DE, you will always be regarded as the weaker of the two races. That means you have to be smarter to gain the respect you deserve, which is fine. Thats what euridites are good at.<br />
Best played by: Caster oriented people, and those with forehead fetishes.<br />
<br />
Gnomes<br />
Advantages: Highest Dex, decent int and agil. Infravision and the ability to Tinker can be fun. Another often unmentioned plus is their small size. Saves on shrink potions, and aids in dungeon crawling with groups. They also lvl the quickest.<br />
Drawbacks: lackluster str. Stamina. Unliked and hated by all. <br />
Overall: Gnomes are a lot like Dark elves, but shorter, and not blue. They are pretty balanced overall, will be a little group dependant at first, but should solo fine with decent gear. If I were to make one, I'd focus on their high dex. It might be interesting to see how a high proc frequency would effect their solo ability.<br />
Best played by: Disturbed individuals.<br />
<br />
Humans<br />
Advantages: No glaring weaknesses. Easiest faction adjustments. Also has the highest starting Cha, which will help you save money, which will help you to save up up for gear to improve your lackluster stats.<br />
Disadvantages: No glaring strengths, Nightblind.<br />
Overall:Humans are average overall, and can be geared up according to your playstyle. They are the best of the sk's when it comes to building faction, and tradeskilling as they have less of a hurdle to cover than the other races.<br />
Best played by: Roleplayers, questers, tradeskillers.<br />
<br />
Iskar<br />
Advantages: Better on average overall stats. Infravision, regeneration, 100 starting skill in swiming, foraging, AC bonus, and Great quests.<br />
Drawbacks: XP penalty, unable to wear many great armors, and hated in all Norrathian cities except Cabilis.<br />
Overall: Iskar's come with a ton of perks, and some mostly circumventable drawbacks. Only thing you can't get around is the xp penalty, which is significant. Due to their regeneration, Iskar and trolls have the least amount of downtime of the races. This can be a HUGE benifit if you spend alot of time soloing. Iskar's solo well, and are great contributor's in groups. because of this I would say they are the most flexible of the sk's.<br />
Best Played By: Solo'ers, Isolationists.<br />
<br />
Oger<br />
Advantages: Unstunnable from the front. By far the strongest sk's, and the toughest. Can Slam while wielding a 2 hander, which not only adds damage, but helps against casters. Infravision is thrown in the deal as well.<br />
Drawbacks: Int? What Int?<br />
Overall: Oger's are the race of choice for those who definatley want to be more tank than Necro. They also tend to be the most group oriented the sk's as well. Often times an Oger will be the main assist, as their spells wil help them keep aggro, and they have the hp's to do the job. <br />
Best Played by: People compensating for something.<br />
<br />
Troll<br />
Advantages: Great Str. and Sta, Infravision, Slam, and Regeneration.<br />
Disadvantages: XP penalty, and even less Int than an Oger (Which is really saying something).<br />
Overall: Trolls are also very melee oriented, and like Oger's can make decent MA's in a pinch. Like Iskar's Trolls heal at an increased rate, which really cuts down on downtime between fights. This makes them one of the best races for soloing early on.<br />
Best played by: Solo'ers, and people who like being mean and green.<br />
<br />
For me, I chose to be a Troll. I don't like being dependant on a group, and knew that I would be doing alot of soloing. At 46 I can melee some blues without casting or having a pet up, yet have enough mana to be able to fear kite them without ever loosing a full red of health. On the other hand, I generally have no problems getting groups either and am a respected Tank. The xp penalty does hurt, but it balances out a little with lessened downtime and soloability. <br />
<br />
Bottomline, it all depends on what you want out of your character, and how you play him. <br />

I agree with just about all the points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>GoBuk Agogo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">OGRE &gt; troll !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bakatengu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I agree GoBuk, Oger's are less than the Trolls. However that is my personal opinion only, and I was trying to be unbiased (even for the gnomes). :P <br />
<br />
However I can go into detail onto why Trolls are the most highly evolved species in Norrath.<br />
<br />
Top 5 reasons why Trolls are the most perfectly evolved race to their natural habitat.<br />
<br />
1. Trolls have larger than average size, str, and stamina, there by insuring that they become the dominate predator in their swampy habitat.<br />
<br />
2. Trolls developed infravision, which lets them see clearly under the dark murky cannopy of the swamp.<br />
<br />
3. Trolls developed regeneration, which helps them to fight off the rampant disease, and poisonous pests that are common in swamps.<br />
<br />
4. The Trollish language is one of the easiest to learn. This simpleness denotes refinment, which speaks of a highly evolved culture.<br />
<br />
5. Grobb was the most eco friendly of the the Norrathian cities. It worked around nature, with very little modification or artificial constructions. This is a true indicator of a highly advanced and wise society, working with nature instead of destroying or altering it.<br />
<br />
That being said, I bet the whole froglock thing was a DE plot. They must have slipped something in the water to mutate those frogs, forcing us into their debt. Thats why I spend time in Cabilis or Paineel instead. I'd rather be with other cazicites than those sneaky Inny worshippers.<br />

<br />
Couldn't think of a better place to start.<br />
<br />
I picked the Ogre race. I did this mostly to benefit from being unstunnable from the front. I have played a warrior before (I was one of those 'taunt button mashers' heh. I wanted to play the game and didn't give a crap about plowing through message boards to find out if I was doing it right). Anyway, being stunned on a regular basis, well, it just sucks. Standing there waiting to be able to attack again was unbearable. So I vowed that if I were to play a melee again, it would be an Ogre. I haven't regretted it yet.<br />
<br />
I have noticed a propensity to run short of mana. That's usually fixed by a short run to the Nexus or PoK for a KEI.<br />
<br />
Solo'ing isn't a problem. Snare, DoT, tap a few times and lay the smack down. Tap during the fight for the duration. When it turns to run, /attack off /pet back off and tap to regain lost hit points.<br />
<br />
Which brings me to another point; I seem to be able to regain my concentration during fights about 80% of the time. That seems odd to me. I have played a true caster (Enchanter) and it seems that I wasn't able to really start regaining concentration on a regular basis until I was well into my 50's. I'm not sure if this is due to the unstunnable factor or not. Any input there would be great.<br />
<br />
Needless to say, I wanted to play a Shadow Knight more along the melee lines. I suppose I chose the right race.<br />
