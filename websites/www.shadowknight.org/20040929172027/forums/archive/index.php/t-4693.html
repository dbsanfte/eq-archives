<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>HeartView</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a 31st level Human SK and love him.  But, I'm experimenting with an Iksar SK to see how much of a difference regen makes.  I'm playing him untwinked for now (kind of neat to see all the new quests in Cabilis) and it's been pretty fun so far.  I'm duoing with my wife who created an Iksar Shaman (our former pair was my Human SK and her Barbarian Shaman).<br />
<br />
So, my question is this.  At 20th, Human natural regen went from 1/2 to 1/3 (standing/sitting).  I don't think I got another boost at 30th.  I'm assuming at 20th as an Iksar it would go from 2/4 to 2/6.<br />
<br />
Is there a chart somewhere that shows at what level Iksar get improved regen and how much it is at those levels?  Searching for &quot;regen&quot; seems futile on the race board since it is a very common topic.  Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />
