Anyone know what happened?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">its all fun and games until someone in the motion picture industry loses $42</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ghoule</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, I think that eventually we will see some changes in the movie industry...with things getting faster and faster paced its very difficult for me to take my wife out to a movie (besides why go to a theater when we can turn on Playboy and watch it....but I digress)...I think we will see movies being downloadable or at least simulcast on the net in some form in a few years.<br />
Just makes sense, if you cant beat the hackers/copyright breakers, join them and beat them at their own game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Azudno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The theatre is part of the movie experience. A downloaded movie comes nowhere near viewing it in the cinema. It's like saying people won't go to concerts anymore because they can download the mp3's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Theater's won't go away due to the internet just like books didn't go away.<br />
<br />
It IS the experience.  There are certain movies I will see in the theatre, LoTR trilogy, Star Wars, Harry Potter, Miracle, etc.  The popcorn, the seats the huge screen, you pay for the experience as much as you pay for the movie (from the consumer point of view not the business point of view).  <br />
<br />
Hell I went to see the latest Harry Potter at the IMAX at the Milwaukee Public Museum just a week ago and the tickets were sold out over a week in advance.<br />
<br />
But ghoule does have a point, Hollywood does need to change to keep us going to the theatres.  It's the Epics that draw us.  I think the changes are already occuring though, look at how cinemetography has improved in just the last 10 years</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kebsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I don't think theatres have too much to worry about from internet piracy, at least not much more then they did from bootlegging which goes back decades.  But DVD and VHS sales may suffer.</div></div><hr />

...they still make books?  cool.  i hope i can still read.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>kharan_zechts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Netflix + DvD burner is all you need.<br />
It's stupid tho, a lot of people download stuff off places like suprnova, find out they like it and buy the real thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kebsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">oh yeah I did that all the time</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Xranix Blackshadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">suprnova and other torrent services are unstopable as far as im concerened... im it right now at a diff address.... all suprnova is is a website linking to other users sharing the same files.... anyone can copy the website and make it again. the technology makes it impossible if not very hard, to make ppl stop connecting there computers to one another. granted, less people are on suprnova now and the files might be harder to find, or slower in dl speed, but it still works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Piracy will always exist, ever since there were modems there were newsgroups to download software.  Shutting down places like Suprnova just stops a large group of people from getting stuff for free... say, 60% of people.  Thats a large chunk.</div></div><hr />

But eventually it will grow back, in one form or another.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Yep, the masses are going to go from one file sharing system to another.  The best music/movie industries can do is attempt to shut them down as they pop up</div></div><hr />

Exactly.  I wont put down $18 for a cd or $20-40 for a dvd unless I know I like it.  If it wasnt for file sharing services the RIAA and the MPAA wouldnt see a dime from me.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Croix VorAbaddon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Think of it as a game:<br />
<br />
You're desire/objective is to get free stuff.<br />
Their desire/objective is to make you pay for said stuff.<br />
<br />
They do what they can, you do what you can. Both sides take risks. Lawsuits like this are a huge investment on the industries part, and the artist contributing nothing to the effort will still have their songs/movies/games not on the program. If the lawsuit fails, the company/association is out a LOT of money, and a hole has opened up.<br />
<br />
The user takes the risks of viruses, and getting caught. Those involved in the distribution take greater risks.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, sometimes the theory is right. I downloaded Boondock Saints awhile back, loved the movie. Eventually bought it.<br />
<br />
However, many of my friends who are into mental, particularly fantasy metal, have heard of, like, and have some Nocturnal Rites. Great band... but I'm one of ... two people I know to ever buy their music.<br />
<br />
It's an issue that isn't going to die, and the fight will go back and forth as technology increases. Legal loopholes get found. Consider the risk vs reward, and be prepared to get a new program. I remember when Napster was shut down, everyone freaked. Then Morpheus came along... then Kazaa, then ((and still)) Soulseek, and Bit Torrent. It's not over for either side.</div></div><hr />

I love how people justify stealing.  I do it too but don't try to justify it atleast, I know full well what I'm doing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Call it justification of stealing if you like, but the fact remains they receive none of my money unless I preview the product first.  Maybe as a form of preview more should use that new DVD/CD thing where they sell it cheap and it becomes unplayable in a couple days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>The Truth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">larger business are paying for the fact that they didnt jump on file sharing technology years ago, and for some reason or another wanted to stick to selling things off a shelf. blockbuster should have started a netflix kind of thing a lot time ago. record companies should have sold songs online for 99 cents at about the same time.<br />
<br />
rather, you're both paying for it.</div></div><hr />

Big companies should have proven that they don't know how to do business by jumping on what would have been a money losing bleeding edge platform before public acceptance and industry standards were set?????<br />
<br />
Business are supposed to accept that being stolen from is part of business?</div></div><hr />
