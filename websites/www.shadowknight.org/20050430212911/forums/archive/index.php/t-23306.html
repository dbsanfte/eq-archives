<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Taniar Sanguine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just a quick question - the EQ game map is disabled in several zones (ele planes, Hate, ToV, etc) yet there are maps of these zons on places like mapfiend which to my untrained eye look like they're in the sony map format.<br />
<br />
Can they be used somehow ingame, or am I touching on something like Rule #1, or is there no way to do it?<br />
<br />
PM me if it's something not to be discussed where outlanders can see.  :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Asking a legitimate question and asking to have your hand held as you play the game are two different things.</div></div><hr />

Typical hypocrisy<br />
You got flamed for:<br />
1) not asking a direct question<br />
2) being a jerk<br />
3) not giving enough information<br />
4) lying<br />
5) assuming other people meant things that they did not<br />
6) typing inaccurate information<br />
7) not being satisfied with constructive infromation<br />
8) not paying attention to the constructive information<br />
<br />
Also, if you are a male who goes by the name &quot;goldenpine&quot; you are gay.<br />
Since we already know you are stupid, I'd like to point out that stupid and gay is a horrible combination and you will die a long slow painful death.  <br />
Cut to the chase....die in a tire fire.</div></div><hr />

I know maps of most planes are there to DL and even print if you wish.  Its where I went many years ago before there even was a map feature.  I have a couple notebooks of color printed and lamenated maps.  heheheh  <br />
<br />
Good Luck!</div></div><hr />

HA! You feel my pain. Newtank was on my server (I never see him anymore, so I assume he quit trying to be an all-powerful level 55 SK).</div></div><hr />
