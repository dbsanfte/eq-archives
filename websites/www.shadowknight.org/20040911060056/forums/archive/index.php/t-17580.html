<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aoninie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I did the Kurron Ni hit, the elixer, got the Drake Spine, the Ghoulbane, and got the soulcase so far. I tried to do the seal run from Marl to Gerot. Marl gave me the seal but Gerot took it when I gave it to him and said something about not helping the likes of me. I believe I am apprehensive to him. I tried the hide trick a couple times (didn't know about /con though, just tried right clicking on him after the window was up and couldn't get a con). What am I doing wrong or is there a bug? And yes I did read the fool proof epic thread. I would love to get my epic before I deploy to Iraq, but it ain't lookin good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wedgey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Dont know if this will help but here goes anyway...<br />
<br />
None of the guys like me, and I'm over halfway done.  What i have had to do is --  put the item in the trade window and have SOMEONE ELSE invis me -- then I &quot;c&quot; to consider make sure it is at indifferent -- and then I hit trade.  It does not work putting it into trade window and invising yourself, so I assume that hiding doesnt work either.  <br />
<br />
Hope that helps, good luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xegonick Soulstryfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hide does work.I've used it for all of my epic turn ins.What you wanna do is get behind the NPC,hand him the item,and have a hide hot button set up within easy reach so you can hide as soon as the trade window comes up.Be sure to use &quot;c&quot; to con like wedgey said.When indifferent,go ahead and hit trade.Best to practice this on easy turn ins like the seal,so you can get it down pat before goign to hand in something important like your decrepit hide or something hehe.<br />

P.S.:when you turn in the seal gerot will give you a note to marl.If you want to keep getting your factIon better...you know just in case...destroy the note(don't worry there's an endless supply :P)and go back to marl for another seal.Just keep bringing seals to gerot until he says something to the effect of &quot;your my hero!&quot; when you hail him.That's when you know your factions good,Because i hear we never go above apprehensive thru the entire quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aoninie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks, worked great!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Drakang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Timing use to be the key to the hide trick. You had about 1/2 a second after handing the item before hot keys were locked out. Now if you use an alternate skin most of the allow you to hide any time after you hand in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nenadar W'Vern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Has anyone tried other methods of getting the TS faction up?  I noticed that quite a few epics use the same faction and in the Shammy one its possible to get TS up to ally:<br />
<br />
1. Do the Black Dire and Shield quest over and over until you are MAX ally with the Truespirit Faction! Meaning, &quot;Your faction with the Truespirit could not possibly get any better.&quot; No less or you will be crying when you lose the iksar child tear. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Seal running takes a half hour to get to the level needed.  Why on earth would you want to take the time to do anything to get it to ally?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Valkyria Grymreaper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Catharsis  is right, just run seals.<br />
<br />
When you get to the part where he says &quot;YOUR NAME, My Hero! Blah Blah Blah...&quot; thats the faction you need. Your done.<br />
<br />
And if the cats give you any shit while running seals, just kill them. They are only cats after all...</div></div><hr />
