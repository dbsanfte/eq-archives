<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gukabuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Im looking for some quest for my Shadowknight, Im out fitted in full crusty, vf wedding ring, vinly crafted velium ring, lammy and a sarnak battle sheild and some other stuff, and was just looking to see if I could find some quest for like a 2 hs wep, or somthinhg to that effect or somthing.  I have a 35 warrior that could do most of it, if its not to much of a &quot;No Drop&quot; quest.  My shadow knight is 11, and growin' pretty quickly, so pretty much any quest that a 35 warrior could complete for a shadowknight alt, would be cool if you knew any.<br />
<br />
-Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Morgrist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You're in good shape at 35 as it is.<br />
 <br />
You can be doing the Hollowshade Moor war with a group,though. The sub-bosses and main boss drop some nice stuff-good earrings, nice shoulder pieces, even an FT1 item. <br />
<br />
You can do Darkforge as well-you're in the range to do the spirtualist outside of CT too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gukabuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Could you eather explan how to do what you just said, or maybe a link to where I can find out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Morgrist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hollowshade War is the zonewide fighting in Hollowshade Moor,outside of Shar Vahl.<br />
 <br />
It's 3 sides. Grimlings,Owlbears,Sonic Wolves. Each has a leader-a mob specially named in most cases (owlbears have a placeholder occasionally). At the start,each controls part of the Moor.<br />
 <br />
Kill them. Eventually,this will trigger either the named spawn and/or start an attack from one of the other moor factions on the front of the entry to one of the other faction's lair. A few defenders will spawn in front of the lair,and attackers will wander from the other faction to attack them. Help them win,and the attackers will take over that spot and the area will respawn with the new owners instead of the old. The nameds can have some nice loot,depending on who controls what part of the Moor (and hence,the leaders/nameds to kill to get it!)<br />
 <br />
If all three parts are controlled by the same faction,the Vah Shir outpost there is overrun and a big boss spawns in it. The Moor will remain in the possession of one faction until someone exterminates the big boss,which will have some even nicer stuff-and shortly afterwards the zone will respawn with all three in their original places.<br />
<br />
Some of the loot is literally the first of it's kind a lower-level SK could expect to see-including a Flowing Thought item and a decent Haste belt.<br />
<br />
Darkforge quest is given in the Temple of Soulsek Ro. If you look up the quests in Allakhazam's,it'll tell you where to go/what to do. All Darkfoge armor takes quest pieces called &quot;decaying armor&quot;-the spiritualist spawn,which is in a corner of the Feerott (again,Allakhazam's is your friend,as is EQAtlas) is the best way to camp and get what pieces of it you need.</div></div><hr />
