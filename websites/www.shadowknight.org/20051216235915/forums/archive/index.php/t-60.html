<br />
Due to the increased costs of running the EverQuest game service, we will be increasing our subscription rates in April. Effective April 25, the new monthly subscription rate will be $12.95/month. We will continue to offer discounts from the new rate plan on multi-month subscriptions. You don’t have to do a thing; you will automatically be migrated to the new billing structure under your current subscription plan when your current subscription plan expires.<br />
<br />
New EverQuest rates as of April 25, 2002: <br />
<br />
$12.95 per Month <br />
$35.85 for 3 Months <br />
$65.70 for 6 Months <br />
<br />
HOWEVER, for a limited time only (from April 10 through April 24, 2002), you may extend your current subscription for an additional 12 or 24 months by signing up for the new EQ 12 or 24 month plan – and reap great savings off of the new rates:<br />
<br />
Extend for 12 months for $109 US – and get a 30% discount off of the new monthly rates!<br />
<br />
Extend for 24 months for $190 US – and get a 39% discount off of the new monthly rates!<br />
<br />
Now is the time to lock in these rates, so don’t miss out.<br />
<br />
All pricing plans (except for the 12 and 24 month extension plans) are recurring, meaning you will continue to be billed at the appropriate interval, until you cancel your subscription. Note that purchasers of the full game will receive their free month of game play after supplying valid billing information. If you cancel your subscription during the free month, no charges will be made to your credit card. <br />
<br />
New York State and Texas residents will be charged sales tax. <br />
<br />
All subscription fees will appear on your credit card statement under the heading &quot;SOE*EverQuest&quot;. <br />
<br />
Please note:<br />
<br />
The subscription charges are in addition to the cost of the game. You will need to purchase a copy of the game from a retail store or online at the Station Store. The price of the game will vary depending upon the store.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Byttorr Ebonknight</div><div class="date">03-25-2002, 04:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm guessing they saw that Mythic is getting away with it for DAoC,  so they said why not. They could have given a bit more advanced notice but at least they've given people the chance to pay up for a renewal at the current rate, they didn't have to do that. It's shrewd business. They're going to increase their cash intake by 20% (I'm sure that will increase the profit margin by much more than 20%), and I don't see that many people will quit because of it. Even at $12/mo it's still great value for the dollar. If $2 a month is going to break you, you probably should have given EQ up long ago.<br />
<br />
They say there are 420,000 EQ subscribers. At $9.99/mo that comes to just short of $4.2 million a month. Now they'll be raking in $5.4 million a month. Looks like a few new Porsches will be seen in their company parking lot. ;)</div></div><hr />

CS on Stormhammer was excellent, would be nice to see similar on the other servers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Let's just hope they put the extra $$$ to good use.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nocifer Deathblade</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 09:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe, yeah almost all of MMORG games just hiked their prices. It seems that they secretly talked about hiking and agreed. It basically is overdue for price hike. It's normal for price hikes over several years for service to offset inflation. They actually were losing money each year if they stick to fixed price of $9.69 cuz of inflation itself. I understand that they have very high subscription base to offset inflation but the cost of lot of stuff just hiked and reduce their profit margin per subscription that can slowly choke them dry. I am very happy for the price hike that allows them to invest MORE into EQ in a long run which is very healthy for us. If they hike price every year then that's a different story. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cactuz</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 10:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Considering it has been $10.00 a month for 3 years I thinkit is fair to up the price a few bucks.  If anything I save money by playing everquest instead of doing other things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rhumba_Kween</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 11:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Had to figure it would happen sooner or later. I just hope they give us some carrot for this. Maybe a promise of better CS, that would be nice.<br />
<br />
I've only had to deal with GM's 3x in almost 2 1/2 years and the average wait time was around 6 hours. The first time was around 12 hours during prime time. That was the first time I thought ill of VI. A company's CS tends to say alot about the company itself.<br />
