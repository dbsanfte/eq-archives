<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Winkles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering if the Fungi would last longer as a viable option as a bp because of the ac bonus that ikkys get.   And is there anyplace that shows the actual ac bonus of iksars.  I have heard it but don't seem to be able to find it anywhere.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Drynnious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm pretty sure the ikky ac bonus is 50ac. From level 1 to level 65. If you were put up to an equally equiped sk of another race, yes you could equip your fungi and still be 50ac more than them. <br />
<br />
The reason why people trade from fungi to a BP with more ac is because eventually you will get to the point to where 40+ more ac will do a lot more than 15hp/tick. Once you start tanking in pop type zones the 15hp/tick will mean nothing compared to the mitgation a 50+ac BP could give you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Reflan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's still very very good in PON or POD or LDON though in the high 50's.  At 59, I can wear either the fungi or my fulvous darkscale cultural armor with 50-plus AC and nice hitpoints etc, but I almost always wind up using the fungi.  <br />
<br />
I'm an ogre though, so I'm not already riding high on a ton of regen like you are.  But I also have a 60 iksar monk, so I'm aware of what it's like for regen toons too.  <br />
<br />
As a main tank against the harder PoP mobs, things change a bit.  But the easier PoP mobs let you still get away with wearing a fungi for quite a while if you have a good healer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ruuti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Just recently traded in my fungi,  the first place I noticed a problem was in PoV and BoT.  Even CoD the mobs hit hard,  and the casters mana takes a dip.  The regen comes to mean absolutely nothing at that point...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>ZilshasisEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I sold my Fungi at level 23 and got a thurg bp instead. the clicky heal gets you back in the rat race faster. Only sad thing is that you cannot sit and med while getting hp back fast :) But mana usage is not alot for me atm.</div></div><hr />
