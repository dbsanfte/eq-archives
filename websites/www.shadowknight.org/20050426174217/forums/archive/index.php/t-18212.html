<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kowl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I did a search for this but didn't find much to help. Last night I led a group, 54SK(Me), 55 Druid, 58 Cleric, 58 Bard, 62 Necro and 61 Necro, down to the Herb Shack. We went for me to get the Greenish Metal Shard and for the Necro's to get their epic piece. We moved pretty quickly down to the shack and really didn't have any problems until we got there. We were there long enough to get the Alchemist Acolyte to spawn once but no shard. After that due to just bad luck me and the druid died. The bard, cleric and 2 necor's where left with several mobs and by the time we got rezzed it was prety much a no win situation and we got wiped. I was at least glad we made it to the shack, a lot of people wouldn't go because they didn't think this was group doable. Now that they know it can be done maybe it will get easier to get people to go. My question though is does anyone have a good strategy for the herb shack. We came in from the NE tunnel and pretty much stayed there until the wipe. The problem with this was we kept getting adds from behind. Any ideas on a good place to camp or how to break the room. Any advice would be apreciated.</div></div><hr />

On the 2nd map in the above post, I set up in the corridor immediately northeast of the shack. There will be 1 wanderer that I wait for to go on his way then I attack the static mob in the corridor. This usually brings 1 mob from up the slope, usually a dog. I dual box an SK and a druid so I charm the dog and use it to quickly kill the static mob. The wanderer will normally be close again at this point and I use the dog to kill him too, then break charm and kill the dog. The next mob I kill is a static mob south of my camp spot and east of the shack, unless it's another dog which I will charm for the next 2-3 kills. Next, while standing in the corridor I originally cleared, I cast on whatever is in the Alchemist Acolyte spot. He will run to me and about 50% of the time bring 1 mob from inside the hut with him. After these 2 are dead, I pull both mobs left in the hut.<br />
<br />
If there are no dogs it's tougher for me but out of maybe 50 break ins in the last month I have only had the no-dog thing happen 1 time.<br />
<br />
If the Grand Herbalist is up, have the highest level person invis and open the door then back up to the wall, cast on GH before door closes then run back in corridor. When I do this, he never brings adds even if they are dark blue to me. When this happens, I use the opportunity to split the spawns up so one thing spawns in the hut about every 5-6 minutes. With the group you listed, you should be fine if you have to tank 2 mobs. I would let the 62 necro pull and feign mobs off as you  engage.<br />
<br />
One other thing: most of the mobs down here are shaman mobs so have someone annul magic as soon as possible on each mob. Just getting rid of their haste makes them much easier.<br />
<br />
Old school advice here, let the druid use ensnare as it lasts much longer than any darkness you would use, and then you don't have to worry about darkness wearing off while you are in the middle of battle spam. If a mob gets away down there with a 54 on its hate list, you are gonna have a pile of friends show up real fast.<br />

I am at work and trying to do my job and throw out info at the same time so if anything I typed was confusing or unclear, let me know.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From your post I gather the NE tunnel is the best place to pull from then. When we first started I was doing the pulling but quickly decided it would be better for the necro to pull and me MT. Also made sure to tell the druid to snare everything because a train here would be a bad thing. Still very sound advice.<br />
<br />
I wish I had talked to you before last night. I didn't do enough research, walked up to the herb shack, opened the door and there stood Grand Herbalist Mak'ha in all his glory. Needless to say he handed me a new one real quick. Him and the adds that came with him are what killed me and the druid last night.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have  idea on the spawn rate down here. I read somewhere that it was an 8 minute spawn. Is that correct?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ganodoar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hi there. Spawn time on chardok mobs down there is 20 minutes, no more no less. The acolyte is an uncommon spawn and the shard is rare. Common is the dizok escape staff, uncommon vile sarnak brew, rare the shard. I have also seen him drop a ring of dizok as well.<br />
If anything I found the acolyte to be more common than Grand Herbalist Mak'ha. One time I was down there we got 10 phs in a row for the Grand Herbalist and 3 Alchemist Acolytes. <br />
<br />
Out of 6 kills so far I have gotten 3 dizok escape staves, 2 rings and 1 drink. Hehe beleive it or not but one time in Howling Stones our wizard saved our hides with the dizok escape staff so if he drops the staff be grateful somewhat. That baby could save your butt :P Of course if he doesn't drop the shard after tons of kills you need to get very upset :)<br />
<br />
Hope you get the shard friend. Not suprisingly my friend necro's  friend got her herb and the shard to drop while I wasn't in Chardok. However, I chose to only buy it as a last resort. Meaning if my guildie necros and my friend gets the mansi herb before the shard drops then I will buy it.</div></div><hr />
