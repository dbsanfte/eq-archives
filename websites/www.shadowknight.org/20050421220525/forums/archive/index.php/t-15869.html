<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kentsin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok...for the last 2 days I have spent over 13 hours a day annihilating the damned stables in city of mist. I have had 3 couriers pop over this course of time. I must be doing something wrong if the pop of this guy is this rare? I've heard he only spawns at night and thus i've tried to time the spawns so they repop at night, but it only seems a bigger waste of effort. I'm out of drink now, so my mana is not regenerating. I've stopped clearing the entire stables and instead am now just camping the one room with 4 spawns, as it seems the only place I can get him to spawn. I've been playing Wild Arms 3 during downtime and well, i've almost beaten the damned game. A camp that takes as long as an RPG? Something must be wrong.<br />
<br />
Somebody tell me I'm doing something wrong and what to do to get the courier to spawn, before my fist goes through the monitor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kentsin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well after 30 hours total I have gotten all 3 scrolls from CoM. Now off to FM to get the keys and Greenmist is mine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">the entire camp took me 40 minutes, including the time the server went down while i was there.  server pop back up and he was there and i got my last scroll.<br />
your doing nothing wrong,  theres no secret procedure to get him to spawn or to drop the scrolls.  you just have bad luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kentsin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Seriously bad luck. I log in inside the tunnels in FM where all the old droga mobs are, kill a penmaster thats up, and im like WTF! Bone necklace! WOOT I GOT THE RARE ON THE FIRST KILL!<br />
<br />
....<br />
<br />
Not so. 5 hours later, after 4 or 5 penkeeper deaths i FINALLY get the stone key. After letting about 8 bone necklaces rot. Rare my ass -_- I'm now off to Dalnir to do the final combine...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dobbin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">LOL lets talk unlucky,  took me over 23 hours camping off and on for the shard drop in dalnir.  no there wasnt any other imps up ether,and yes i do loose every roll i'm on :p</div></div><hr />
