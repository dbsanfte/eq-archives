<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Deaddragoxo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello i am Deaddragoxo. A necro (yes gnome am I) and I am looking into the the mystery of my brothern known as the Shadowknight. I have read many of the threads regarding the whole issue of which is more important as a racial skill/ability and came to this conclusion. I know it may not be seen as a justifable topic or whatever but this is how I see it. <br />
<br />
Soloing: People say Unstunnable is useless in Soloing when a person is fear kiting but I think of it as this. If i am low on health or need to get this fear out ASAP. What will help me more regening 2 hp a tick or making sure that I am not stunned and therefore knocked out of the spell? I would definately choose the Unstunnable. Even though i may have to heal up more later it definately makes me take less damage since the target will be feared and not bashing my brains out.<br />
<br />
Grouping: If you are grouping you will probably have a healer who should know what he/she is doing. I do see the worth in the regen as it shortens the downtime but being unstunnable from the front allows me to just dish out the damage. Not to mention to keep casting my taps, aggro spells, etc. so that I stay high on HP and my group doesnt have to worry about ping pong.<br />
<br />
Raiding: Being stunned on a raid is a biatch esp. if you are the SA or TA. If you are just starting to aggro a mob being stunned will give the the mob the chance to run back after the other raiders esp killing a caster or less importantly a ranger.<br />
<br />
I still think that looks is more important when you choose your race as any class and details on stats and whatnot can be ironed out later. I just thought id give my gnomish 2cents in. Ya maybe i am biased and ya im inexperienced in the ways of the SK but I was just giving my input as a third party. I do plan on making a SK soon and im still deciding between iggy ogre or troll, which is why ive been reading up on this stuff. Laterz<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Emnity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i rarely get stunned from the front and when soloing usually am waiting on mana not health.<br />
<br />
ogres have the best stats and a lesser exp penalty than trolls &amp; iksars</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gorrum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Whats cool is: if you get multiple mobs you move as such that they are all in your front arch (like backing into a corner) and then your avoiding stuns. As I leveled up I had much respect for that ability. I know A guy that had the most bad ass twinkage on this dwarf warrior he insisted on playing even after I told him to go Ogre over and over..one on one he owned red/yellow mobs but let 3+ mobs get on him and he was chain-stunned so bad he never got a swing in...then they would slowly whittle him down. But remember the ogre penelty isnt as bad as troll/ikky but it sucks all the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aaoogaa Soulhunter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">15% for Ogas 20% for trolls and Ikkys.  Unstunnable is the only racial ability that cannot be equaled with gear.  Want to feign death?  Turn and face the mob...never have to worry about getting stunned.  Its a great ability and since I always have a healer with me regen is not worth the exp penelty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Deaddragoxo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">thast EXACTLY what im talkin about Aaoogaa.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shadowsoal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I am an Iksar I can't remember the last time I was stunned, maybe cause on raids I generally am not MT (thats a warriors job) and I dont group much (thats for pussy paladins and rangers) and when I solo I generally keep mob feared and when fear does run short and mob atks me I can't seem to remember getting stunned much at all.... I dont' think I have really ever died cause I was stunned from front, I mean pre 30 (and pre FD) I might run away from a mob to the guards and get stunned and killed but I wasn't faceing them... if you solo a lot imo regen helps a ton, specially 50+ when it jumps up a lot...<br />

  Oh god not a day goes by I'm not disappointed that I didn't make a Ogre I die so much when if only I could have been unstunnable.<br />

/sarcasm off<br />

 I'm so sick and tired of people trying to trump up their racial choice. It's like they need to reaffirm it for themselves. Some racial abilities might appeal more to you then others so pick the race you think you'll like the best or try them all. No racial ability makes or breaks the class and the added benefit's are really minimal when you get down to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Soulstar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">regardless of whether you get stunned, if you get bashed, your spell is interupted.  Period.<br />
<br />
Besides, the only racial bonus that matters is how cool you look.  And Iksar look the coolest, and gnomes look the lamest... that's all that matters...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gorrum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Don't get pissy ppl the guy was asking for our opinions and input on the races and wanted first hand info.  I dont have to justify my choice in race. First time I played an Sk it was a dark elf...and I used to whine about ogre/troll min maxers...hmmm, and sounded alot like you guys. Then I decided to min max myself. :D</div></div><hr />

I keep on. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dakkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">My little ogre SK gets interrupted casting a lot by bashes and kicks etc; being unstunnable doesn't seem to make much difference this way from the troll I played before.<br />
<br />
It's sometimes an advantage with multiple mobs in camp though, as Gorrum says.<br />
<br />
Overall lifetaps mean I don't miss the troll's regen, but the ogre's a noticeably better tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">A notice to all new posters: <br />
<br />
PLEASE stop having this innane conversation over and over again!  If you use the search button (you know, that thing in the upper right hand corner, next to the home and f.a.q. buttons) you will see that over the last 6 months, this particular issue has been put forward at least 10 times for discussion.  If you go even further and actually READ the threads, you'll see it always ends the same way.<br />
<br />
In the future, I think we would all appreciate it if you would refrain from bringing up ANY and ALL of the following topics:<br />
<br />
Gnomes R teh sux<br />
Ogre Unstunnable vs. Troll/Ikky regen<br />
Which race has the best starting stats<br />
Which race looks the coolest<br />
What starting stats did you pick for your SK, I'm thinking of taking all CHA<br />
CHA affects how long fear lasts (for you, synn)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Dakkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Kind of inevitable in a race discussion forum that people will discuss the benefits of one race versus another Groff, so when someone raises an old topic in a slightly new way a few things will get rehashed /shrug.<br />
<br />
I'm sure it doesn't do any harm so long as people don't get frustrated or lose their heads and start trolling or flaming on the subject.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Deaddragoxo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">he does have a point...we starting to sound like Monkly Business with the whole Human vs Iksar discussion. Gawd it sucked going there during that time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">It's not being raised in a new way, Dakkin.  It's the same old way.  It's the same old arguments, and it's the same old answer from the longtime SKs.   Racial benefits don't matter in the long run.  Play what you enjoy/will not get sick of looking at.<br />
<br />
Ogre non stun is nice, but it's not a deal breaker.<br />
<br />
Troll/Ikky regen is nice, but it's not a deal breaker.<br />
<br />
DE/ERUD/GNM large intelligence (IE: manapool) is nice, but it's not a deal breaker.<br />
<br />
I would at least hope that people who are new to the board, and have read some of the previous threads on their intended topic, would begin to see a trend.<br />
<br />
SOE does not allow any racial benefit to overpower or out gun any other.  There are always benefits and draw backs.  Every race has them.  It really doesn't matter what race you choose, it's all personal preference, because in the end, all races end up being relatively equal with equal gear.  Sure, it may make a slight difference to you when you're first starting out.  Hell, I got stunned a ton as a young Troll, and it sucked.  Of course, I was able to regen up my life much quicker than the Ogres who weren't getting stunned...<br />
<br />
In any case, I almost never get stunned, from the front OR the back now.  That racial ability means next to nothing to me.  And with HP so high, I hardly even notice the increased Troll regen.  I may have about 20 seconds less down time than any other race without that racial ability.  So it doesn't matter.  Period.  End of story.  Discussion over.  Please don't make me repeat myself.</div></div><hr />

You can still be interrupted even when you are not stunned.  I don't get stunned very often, and thus it is rare that any interrupted spells are due to being stunned.  In regards to your question- which is better?  Better is having your channeling ability max'ed so you get that Fear off before you die. :)<br />
<br />
Grouping: If you are grouping you will probably have a healer who should know what he/she is doing. I do see the worth in the regen as it shortens the downtime but being unstunnable from the front allows me to just dish out the damage.<br />
<br />
If I'm in a group, I'm doing one of two things:<br />
<br />
a- I am tanking, in which case my primary responsibility is to hold aggro.  Stuns have never affected me adversely in terms of doing this.  And since I don't get stunned very often, even when tanking, the effect on my DPS is minimal.<br />
<br />
b- I am a damage dealer if someone else is the tank.  In this case I am not getting stunned, so it is a non-issue.<br />
<br />
c- one other thing I may be doing is pulling.  Getting stunned is a possibility here, though often I pull by casting from a distance and running the mob back to the group.  In any event, if you're pulling, you are either getting beat from the back (in which case you can be stunned as an ogre), or you are backing up as you face the mob (in which case you are moving slowly and getting beaten more than you would otherwise before you get to the group).<br />
<br />
Raiding: Being stunned on a raid is a biatch esp. if you are the SA or TA. If you are just starting to aggro a mob being stunned will give the the mob the chance to run back after the other raiders esp killing a caster or less importantly a ranger.<br />
 <br />
See above regarding grouping.<br />
<br />
On a raid, the tank is often given some time to build up aggro before anyone else steps in, so being stunned once or twice shouldn't do more than add a second or two of time that you wait before calling assist.  Then again, due to our array of aggro-generating spells, we don't have to wait as long as a warrior would before calling assist.<br />
<br />
I've said before, the inability to be stunned from the front is overrated in my mind.  If I was to pick the factors that would cause me to choose an ogre, the primary ones would be the better melee stats (STR/STA anyway) and the ability to bash without equipping a shield (slam).  I would certainly be happy with the 'unstunable from the front' capability, but I haven't found the lack of it to have much impact, if any.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Dakkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Groff, I was suggesting, as politely as I could, that arguing that people should stop discussing SK race issues on a board dedicated to SK race discussion might look a little trollish.<br />
<br />
Not intentional on your part I'm sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jobrill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">See Dakkin, this whole unstunnable thing comes up every few weeks, and it's always the same old thing:<br />
<br />
1. OGRES ROCK CUZ THEY R UNSTUNABLE, U R AN IDIOT IF U DONT PLAY ONE!<br />
2. Um, I play another race, and I get stunned, but I hardly ever notice it, what's the big deal?<br />
3. NO I BET U DIE A LOT CUZ YOU GET STUNNED U R SUCK RACE<br />
4. Ogres suck, They're Ugly.<br />
5. Um, I play an Ogre, I like the unstunability, but it's not that big a deal. Let people play what class they want<br />

<br />
I am a Troll.  That's what the &quot;T&quot; stands for in L48 TSK. ;) <br />
<br />
But what Jobrill said is exactly what I was getting at.  If you look through the race discussion board, you'll see that barring a few new posters with slightly different wording, this is almost EXACTLY the same thread as the other 400 about Ogres being Unstunnable, Trolls having Regen, Ikkys having natural AC boost, Gnomes being cute, DEs being hot and able to get all the hot cyb3rz luvvin for phat plats, etc, etc, etc.<br />
<br />
I've been posting to this board for 6 months, been reading it for much longer, and ever month at least one of these threads comes up, it's always the same, and it's always kind of stupid.  <br />
<br />
As for the bit about it being in the Race Discussion board, and so it should be ok, well...  Yes, I appreciate that the original poster put his race discussion in the correct forum.  It would have been even less accepted if he put it in the Inny's Curse forum or something, but that doesn't change the fact that it's tired.<br />
<br />
But thanks for offering your opinions in a couth and tactful way.  I really do appreciate it that you didn't jump down my back with lots of leet-speke and cursing.<br />
<br />
/salute.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Jupke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">hehe, the only reason i ever check the race boards is to look for some stupid gnome remarks or make them myself. <br />
<br />
The only thing that in EQ matters is looks if you are looking at races. Stats matter somewhat in the first 40-50 levels, but they fast become obsolote once gettting past 50-55.<br />
The only ability that helps from level 1-10 is the troll/iksar regen, after that, dont count on it to rescue you.<br />
People should learn to play what they want cause of the look instead of oooh i am unstunnable or oooh i regen, or ooooh i have high int. I've seen erudites with more stamina then me. <br />
<br />
Oh and one thing, while i am here, i hate gnomes.</div></div><hr />
