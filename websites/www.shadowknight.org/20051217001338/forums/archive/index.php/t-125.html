It did take me a while, 23 hours, thank god not as long as you camped it.( no offence) I dont know if there are any tactics that work to spawn the ac quicker, I've heard there are but cant confirm them. It might be a better idea to spend some points to get run-3. Might take longer but since jboots cant be used indoors, you'll have to do it some day anyway =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Byttorr Ebonknight</div><div class="date">03-27-2002, 08:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've nailed the AC in SRo twice, once by just happening to find him up as I headed from Guk to Freeport in the wee hours, and the other time, he spawned immediately after I killed the undead in the tower (again in the wee hours when I was alone in the zone). Probably just coincidence on that, though. And that second time, as I was admiring my good fortune, a wizard who had just ported in started shouting with glee because he too had just killed an AC he saw when he ported in. So, it *is* possible to have two ACs in a row there. The one thing I have noticed, from being in the zone numerous times when others have gotten him, is that I can't ever recall him spawning during game daytime.<br />
<br />
But overall, I would recommend camping the AC in OOT over SRo. Assuming you find it uncamped, you have 100% chance of getting an AC if you're able to spend the time (and if you managed 33 hours in SRo, you're good to go in OOT). The loot's a LOT better, you can even make some exp. My two marathon OOT AC camps for friends, one took 14 hours, the other 18. And each time I walked away with over 1000pp from gems and cash. Compare that to your time and profit in SRo and you'll see why I recommend the OOT method.<br />
<br />
Of course, as pointed out, in that kind of timeframe, you can probably make the 3 AAXP points for run 3, assuming you're 51+. J-boot speed being a 33% increase, Run 3 being 30% increase but usable indoors, I think now I'd opt for the Run 3 instead of the boots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Talkatan</div><div class="date">03-27-2002, 08:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is the guide that my guild goes by when hunting the AC, its all common sense stuff really, but I hope it helps..<br />
<br />
~HERE LIES THE SECRETS TO THE DESERT OF SOUTHERN RO~<br />
<br />
        The first thing when hunting the Ancient Cyclops is to forget all the rumours and tales you have heard as to how to make him spawn. He is NOT triggered, he does NOT spawn only at night, and he is NOT linked to the mobs in the sunken tower (actually part of an Erudite cleric helm quest). Anyone who tells you otherwise has trouble with the concept of coincidence. <br />
<br />
        The Ancient Cyclops follows the normal EQ “named” procedure of being a rare spawn with a placeholder. What has caused such confusion is that he has roughly six spawn points, many placeholders and has only a 1% chance of spawning. However if you know his placeholders and concentrate on them, it greatly improves your chances.<br />
<br />
        The easiest way to categorise the mobs in Sro is as “commons” and “rares”. Many of the mobs that seem common in Nro/Oasis are in fact quite rare in Sro and these make up the majority of the placeholders.<br />
        The best tactic is therefore to know what your looking for and not waste time with anything else.<br />
<br />
<br />
        The most efficient way to hunt the Ancient Cyclops is with a team of five people. One member sets up on the hill by the gypsie camp, each of the others picks a corner, NE,NW,SE,SW…….only cover the sand area, the Cyclops never spawns on the grassland. Each member is responsible for scouring their area for “rares” and once killed call it in grp chat. Should one of the larger mobs, or the Cyclops himself spawn it is easy enough to call “AC in NE corner” and have everyone get to him quickly.<br />
<br />
<br />
        Be Warned: The Ancient Cyclops is a free for all mob and following Verants rules you cannot claim him. The first person (capable of killing him) that lands a blow has the right to the mob. Basically if you put in all the work to make him spawn, you need to be quick and organised to get to him first…people in zone WILL try to KS you. Five pairs of eyes and a few Harm Touches should give you the advantage. However, should you lose the Cyclops to someone else, do not engage in a /shout, /ooc slanging match. The GM’s will not help and all you will do is make yourself and your firends look foolish. Better to congratulate them on “finally getting their j-boots”…….most KS’rs are high level and will either get laughed at for not having j-boots already, or slated for farming it instead of giving it to those who need. <br />

Rare Spawns of Southern Ro.<br />
<br />
A Crypt Mummy.<br />
Dune Tarantula.<br />
An Asp.<br />
A Giant Rattlesnake.<br />
A Madman.<br />
An Orc Raider (3 spawn).<br />
A Dervish Cuthroat (single derv that wanders the desert, not fixed at camp).<br />
A Sand Mummy.<br />
A Young Ronin.<br />
“Scrounge”. Named Jackal.<br />
“Erg Bluntbruiser”. Named Orc.<br />
Sandgiant Hussam.<br />
Sand Giant.<br />
Terrorantula.<br />
Ancient Cyclops.<br />
<br />
<br />
        Concentrate on finding and killing the above. However avoid killing the desert madmen and desert tarantulas, there is a theory that they reset spawn timers and I don’t want to spend hours in Sro to verify this.<br />
<br />
        Final word of warning, the three things that will be against you are:<br />
<br />
The idiots who will spam /shout about how to get the AC to spawn because their brother’s friend’s cousin once met a man at a bus stop who was given the secret by a talking dog….so it must be true and everyone else is wrong.<br />
<br />
The KS’rs…...most are druids and so used to reading track lists that they’ve forgotten how to actually look for something with their own eyes……be quick and alert, most druids will get lost from one side of the zone to the other anyway.<br />
<br />
The mind numbing pain of targeting snakes and other mobs amongst endless sand dunes. You have about 2 hours before the boredom sets in, another three before it becomes painfull, and then you just don’t care if it pops on your head. You need to stay reasonably alert and the boredom is your worst enemy.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Byttorr Ebonknight</div><div class="date">03-27-2002, 08:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have only ever seen the SRo AC spawn on the flat just east of the DE tents, at approximate loc 0,0. I'm not saying Talkatan is wrong about multiple spawn points, but I've only ever seen him at the spot I described, and this has been the case of anyone else I've known who has gotten him in SRo as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nikumu</div><div class="date">03-27-2002, 09:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can confirm what Talkatan was saying in his post.  The AC is a rare mob with placeholders, just like most dungeon named mobs.  That is a comprehensive list of PH that he posted.<br />
<br />
If you want to have fun in Nro, there are 2 rare named spawns there and the zone uses a similar system of &quot;odd named&quot; place holders to spawn them.  One is the giant armadillo that drops the Scute Shield (a 12ac +sta shield, not a bad low level item) and the other is a named mummy that I dont believe I have seen since the first week or two that I was playing EQ (so he may not be there anymore, but I believe he still is, just how many people really hunt anything, but the derv camps in nro anymore)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rhumba_Kween</div><div class="date">03-27-2002, 10:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I must say that is a very nice guide Talkatan.<br />
<br />
I have always been a big fan of the just kill everything in site philosophy. I have gotten the kill 4 times now. It's kind of the thing I like to do for friends when I'm feeling in the generous mood. :)<br />
<br />
Let me add to the KS thing. I get so mad at people who think they own SRO. I had been in sro for 3 hours one day killing everything in about 1/4 of the desert occasionally wandering to check a few other spots. Another group moved in about 1/2 hour before the AC spawned right on top of me, so I took him. They managed to say that they had made him spawn. I asked them how and they said they killed all the undead (which is BS), because i've seen him spawn with lots of undead up. My point being, if you are there to camp him stay alert so that you can get that first hit in. <br />
<br />
As a word of encouragement, that same night that the group got mad at me, I saw him spawn 3x in those 3 hours. The first two times I did not get to him first. The moral of the story being. Kill everything and he will come. BTW I gennerally do it with my Mage, because they are about the best there is for killing lots of greens fast. He can usually keep half the desert fairly clear on his own. Just have to make a '/pet kill a' hotkey. :)<br />

He can spawn in any of the 4 corners of the desert.  I can't really confirm or contest the guide, I just whack anything and everything in site.<br />

It's usually easier with a few friends too, keeps the KSing to a minimum.  But with HT its pretty much yours if you hit it first.</div></div><hr />

                         I have killed the AC twice now, both times within 45 minutes of entering SRO. Both times I just stood on a hill by the Oasis zone and watched. I don't know about any way to get anything there to pop other than killing everything and hoping but both times I killed the AC a sand giant and a a named sand giant popped before the AC. <br />
<br />
First time I lost out even though I killed the AC I didn't get his agro first so the GM made me destroy the ring. but 2 nights ago I killed the 2 sand giants and the AC popped across the zone from me...fortunately no one noticed him till I killed him.<br />
<br />
I can say from my experience that he does pop in different places..he popped by the oasis zone the first time and east of the DE merchants the second time.</div></div><hr />

Hell, there's only one other npc on the island and she wouldn't talk to me.  I finally ended up swimming around and killing sharks in between spawns just so I could KILL SOMETHING!!!<br />

Island is the one just beside Sister Island. It also has a non-aggressive High Elf spell merchant.<br />
<br />
Spawn rate is 6 minutes.<br />
<br />
Placeholders from most frequent, to least (in my experience)<br />
<br />
<br />
 Cyclops<br />
 Boog Mudtoe <br />
 A Pirate<br />
 An Aquagoblin<br />
<br />
Boog is an ogre that will wreck Greenblood Knights, Clurg and Craknek Warriors, I was there with friends, so they killed him.  If you want to keep Oggok faction then I don't recommend soloing the camp as Boog *will* spawn and you'll be screwed until someone kills him. <br />
<br />
Pirate lowers Pirates of Gunthank<br />
<br />
Contrary to what was posted earlier, in my experience, the loot was crap.  Cyclops drop a couple of plat each time and rarely an 8-15pp gem or piece of jewelry.</div></div><hr />

is the AC in OOT a higher level then the one in SRo? <br />
<br />
my 2cp about SRo:<br />
  I've sat for many hours(over 20) and many SOW potions in SRo camping him... seen him spawn 3 times... once was right next to me and I landed the first hit... some mage started nuking... i /ooc'd MINE.... he /ooc'd FFA... a fellow SK whom I have grouped with before had just entered the zone when he saw my /ooc and sent me an omw tell to help me beat out the mage, same level as me at the time (37... AC was blue)... when the AC went down... i knew the mage had gotten the kill... i was fighting him like i would have any other mob... darkness, heat blood, fear, melee and HT if i needed to... WRONG... i learned that on a FFA mob with soooooo many KSers wanting him, to melee and HT fast and early... get as many hits in as you can before they start nuking him... since I will never be the KSing type... i wouldn't recommend doing it while someone is engaged all ready.  I still go to SRo looking for him... one day I won't have to spend money on freakin SOW potions.</div></div><hr />

This 51 bard was clearing em all out. After about 1/2 hour I got bored and decided to leave. Right then it popped on me. <br />
<br />
I got the first hits in, threw HT and beat it to about 1/2 life. The damn bard charmed it and then tried to take it. Luckily bards suck for melee so I managed to outdamage him. He then proceeded to cuss me out because he wanted it for soloing. One of the best days of my gaming life.<br />
<br />
 A nice follow-up was that I ran into him again a few weeks later. He challenged me to a duel and I beat the crap out of him.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My guess would be this theory is false.  A couple of guildies took to using an AoE approach to clearing SRO, long before we figured out what AoE is really for.  I don't think it ever took more than half an hour this way and we certainly chewed through plenty of madmen and tarantulas in the process.</div></div><hr />

I don't believe it lasts for 2 min, but yeah when he told me that I believe my response was something to the effect of &quot;Blow me&quot;. <br />
<br />
Anyway answer some questions. The OOT is a much higher level spawn. It *can* be solo'd at 51 but I would say it's a needlessly risky endevour. I recommend getting a partner to pull sea furies to the isle in-between spawns. They are decent exp and a great source of cash.</div></div><hr />
