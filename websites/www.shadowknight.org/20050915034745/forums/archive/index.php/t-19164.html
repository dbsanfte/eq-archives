<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaleyen</div><div class="date">12-27-2003, 03:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I'm 56 she's 60.  She has about average gear for a 60 bard, right about 2.5k HP.  How would I go about killing her?  I expect not all of my spells to land, her being 4 levels higher then me.  Is it possible for me to defeat her based on the level difference?  And what /disc would you use?  On a mob with unholy disc I HT for a little over 1k, so that would be cut in half when dueling, but would I want to use my resistant disc because of her songs?  Any help would be great, thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sazzabi</div><div class="date">12-27-2003, 07:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is going to be near impossible to win if she plays it perfectly. She can just play resist songs and run around in circles at high speed and dot/mana drain you. What i would do under that situation is hope she doesn't play her resist songs and try to dooming dark, spear, boil blood her. If none of that is landing chain cast spirit tap (this should land) until she is around 25%. Then disc HT. If you go oom before she gets low try to snare her with blood ember guants until you have mana for another tap.<br />
<br />
Make a pet beforehand too to give her another thing to worry about. Normal pvp selfbuffs to have up would be resist cold, endure disease, bobbing corpse, banshee aura, shroud of death as well as having 2 instaclick item buffs in the first 2 slots like grim aura earring and jboots (or something else if you want to use a sow potion).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RaevaelDarkstar</div><div class="date">12-28-2003, 09:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ugh, sorry...bards are the only class I try to avoid dueling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khaguk</div><div class="date">12-28-2003, 08:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A huge problem with bards is they can get into that &quot;kiss almost all of your spells goodbye&quot; stage of resists other classes need far better gear to attain.  I don't know what to tell you, really... a duel with a bard never really ends unless she wants it to.  Worse to worse, they can turn on the jets and just get the hell away from you.  If you got lucky, you could hit her with taps until she gets within range of a disced HT, then somehow get close enough and blast her with that.  <br />
<br />
If she was playing a resist song that didn't guard against magic (for some reason) and you snared her, you've lucked out.  The biggest fear a bard would have against a SK is getting snared.  Doesn't matter what we do, a bard only gets hit by a SK from melee if he's snared.  I can't think of a reason a bard would try to get close enough to you to get hit unless she lagged for a second, or you drove her into a corner and she had to run past you to get away.<br />
<br />
Umm, honestly?  Good luck with that... your biggest hope is snare landing.  If they're playing a MR song with a TDoK... I haven't looked at numbers, but I doubt you'd have the manapool to completely kill the bard from taps alone.  Maybe it'd be semi-close, I'm not sure... but then again, she could keep you out of spell range and keep twisting in a regen song to bring her health back up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sazzabi</div><div class="date">12-28-2003, 10:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, the numbers seem to show him being able to lifetap + HT her to death no problem assuming the fight doesn't last a very long time. <br />
<br />
He has 3355mana. Spirit Tap costs 144 mana, which means he can cast it 23 times, and with an ID4 item should be able to do over 2500dmg with taps alone if he averages 115 a tap (probably about right with an ID4 item in pvp). Unless the bard starts mana draining as soon as the fight starts or you fight in an area that lets them run out of spell range for long periods of time you should be able to tap + disc HT the bard dead. <br />
<br />
Also, spirit tap has a very fast recast of 2.5 seconds. It would take you just over a minute to do that 2500dmg with taps. If the bard does not either: A). mana drain right away. B). run out of spell range (this might not be possible for them if you fight somewhere like the bazaar arena, try to fight there if possible) they are probably going to get low enough on hps to where you can disc HT them. A lot of bards i have faced in pvp don't mana drain right away. Some dot you and run around, some even melee you and try to use their ds to hurt you.<br />
<br />
Anyway, Kaleyen is overmatched on level but he has weapons to win if the bard makes a mistake.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sabazios</div><div class="date">12-29-2003, 05:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the only mistake the bard will make is trying to straight melee the sk! most likely bard will run away and mana sieve you then dot you! curse them!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaleyen</div><div class="date">12-29-2003, 08:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the info guys, really helpful :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ganaith</div><div class="date">12-30-2003, 03:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As stated before, a bard will completely own you. If he loses he wants to lose.<br />
<br />
Nothing to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DiggleDoggyfeets</div><div class="date">12-30-2003, 09:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not so sure if this will work, but insist on fighting in a zone with water. When the fight starts and you're not near the water make a beeline for it. When you see them coming at you fire off a nuke, launch an arrow, and jump into the water ( my reasoning for this being that you cannot cast on something in the water if you're not and vice-versa. Not sure if it works with bard songs however). If the bard chases you into to water hop out wash, rinse, repeat.  Eventually they may get frustrated and try to melee you, which is what you want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sabazios</div><div class="date">01-09-2004, 04:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok actually you should fight in a zone w. cliffs and then run off one and hope bard follows and takes 10k dmg! hahahah take that bard!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tr0lls</div><div class="date">01-10-2004, 12:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you don't consider it cheating to use right click items, you might want to invest in some right click shaman potions for resistances, but honestly, you don't have a chance.<br />
<br />
Maybe, if you were the same level, and you at least had the AA horse to outrun the bard if you absolutely had to, you could  possibly joust the bard to death, assuming you could outrun the bard well enough to land some hits. Yeah... slim chance at best.<br />
<br />
I think your best bet would be to try to lifetap the bard to death, somehow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hekk Fire</div><div class="date">01-10-2004, 05:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anyone here actually raced a bard?<br />
<br />
 From what I've seen the movement increase above base rates are like 30% for run3, 35% for level 9 SoW, 98% for AA horse, and max movement cap at 158% which can be made by level 50 bard with a top level drum.   If that's all reasonably accurate, it seems a 60 bard with any drum worth having should outrun our horse.<br />
<br />
  What's the real deal here?<br />
<br />
  Even the odds a bit, offer to duel in Neriak foreign quarter arena!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sabazios</div><div class="date">01-11-2004, 04:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">also don't forget a bard can cast spells while moving, and has instant stop/start which the horse does not offer!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nurbok</div><div class="date">01-30-2004, 07:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You have to flat out kill a bard in seconds or neither side will ever win.  If the bard in question as an ancinet mez or gets you mezed your mana will be gone and every chance of killing them over.  A bard friend of mine and myself duel every so often and it ends up in a draw every single time.  I can get him down to about 5-10% but never kill him and now that he has an unresitable mez I have no chance.  On the flip side he has no way of killing me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aress</div><div class="date">02-03-2004, 05:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">curious, is the mana drain resistable?  What about the dots?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lorddaeth</div><div class="date">02-03-2004, 06:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">just tell her &quot;you choose the time, i choose the place&quot;.....<br />
<br />
even a wizard buddy of mine would never accept that challenge...cause in Thurgardin, you can't run...hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oagan</div><div class="date">02-03-2004, 06:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">already said several times...a well played bard will not be beaten in pvp.  You'll only beat the idiot ones, and that's no accomplishment.  The indoor idea isn't a bad idea, though.</div></div><hr />

How does that work?  I'm really curious.</div></div><hr />

It's indoor no run song<br />
It's basically a circle</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Camby_VZ</div><div class="date">02-10-2004, 12:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Coming from a PvP server I can tell you that beating a bard is damn tough and on a Red Server you don't have the luxury of choosing the time and place you will encounter a fight. <br />
<br />
If you want my honest opinion ... your a 56 SK .. she's a 60 bard .. you're best bet is to zone to PoK and forget about it.  You cannot win unless she is either the most lousy bard in all of EQ or she goes LD.  Doesnt matter how well equipped you are .... doesn't matter if you are a damn good duelist SK.  You can't win,  so pack it up and go exp.:D <br />
<br />
Even if you were 60 and she were 60 .... you stand little chance of winning .. she would just need to mana drain you and then watch you slowly die to her dots.  Even if you did get her low she can just run around avoiding you singing heals on herself and be back to 100% before you can regen squat.<br />
<br />
Tap / Tap / Tap ... KABOOM .. that's how you beat a pesky bard .. but your KABOOM at lvl 56 is still just a firecracker ;)</div></div><hr />
