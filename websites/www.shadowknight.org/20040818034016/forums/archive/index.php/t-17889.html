<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Scrion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm been browsing Allakhazam's for some quests to do, and I came across the Plane of Knowledge Fine Antique quests - namely the pelisse, the ring, and the mask. The rewards look pretty nice, and I was just wondering if anyone has any expierence with the quests. Are they worth doing? Just so you know, I'm untwinked and am quite poor, so buying better equipment may not be an option.<br />
Thanks for the help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bonkonon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've done the ring, pretty easy and MPII is nice. I got everything but the cougarskin off drops - killed cougars for some time and then I happened to find a bunch on one of the pirate vendors, doh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Talonmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You can buy a good chunk iof the components for most of these quests either in the bazaar or on merchants in zones that they drop in (ie. sarnak blood and cocktrice beaks).  <br />
<br />
That makes those pretty easy.<br />
<br />
Others, however, may or may not be worth it depending on your current gear/levels/friends.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>LoganHex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Did the  ring quest. <br />
<br />
Pretty easy.<br />
<br />
Cockatrice beaks are pretty common drops in the Overthere. Go snag yourself one.<br />
<br />
The tiny rockhopper eye was simple too. Head to Shar Vahl and drop down into the pit area. Wander around killing the little rockhoppers until you get a tiny eye. These are pretty common too.<br />
<br />
I heard nightmare stories about obtaining a high quality cougarskin. All of the posts that I read say they drop more frequently in the Eastern Wastes but I did not want to wander around the entire zone looking for the cougars so I went to Iceclad where there is a camp of them. Not sure if I just got lucky or not but I got the high quality skin on my sixth kill.<br />
<br />
I went to Lower Guk for my undead froglok tongue just because I had never been and always wanted to go. No need to though. You can hit the Qeynos Aqueduct system and get it too.<br />
<br />
Or you can just buy every item in the Bazaar. None of it is no drop.<br />
<br />
Is it worth it? I think so. As for how much mana it actually preserves I would say about one bubble per full mana bar. No serious research done to back this up but that is what I tend to notice. Aside from that I think it is worthwhile for training spell skills. I am one of the few losers who still maxes out my spell skills as soon as I gain a new level and the Fine Antique Ring makes the process much faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dester</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">did the ring and the mask quest many times for alts.<br />
<br />
Ring, see above (note that cougar skins are often on merchant in thurg or at the pirate camp in IC)<br />
<br />
Mask, Just need a sarnak blood (easily found on merchants in OT, or bought off someone in OT).<br />
<br />
then just need invis of some sort (if you have a wizard or druid friend that would be best to bring along).  Basicly the mask can be done in about 20 min once you have the blood, nothing to kill beyond that.<br />
