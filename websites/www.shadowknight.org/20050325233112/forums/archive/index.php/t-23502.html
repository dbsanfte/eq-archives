<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grarg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I hate to be a negative arsewhipe, but ive waited two weeks, and i reading the damn boards is painfull, cause everytime I click on something it comes up with an error of unterminated string constant, and i have to move the mouse, click ok, then go back to where i was.<br />
Im not gonna go turnign off java debugging cause im a programmer, and i need it so i dont turn out crap to my clients.<br />
Frankly i would be embarrised to have such an obvious, and easily fixable bug present in any piece of software ive delivered for such an extended period of time.<br />
<br />
Its a surefire way of alienating your reader base.<br />
<br />
Anyway end of bitch/moan/rant/complain.<br />
<br />
Any idea on a fix? some time frame so i just dont stop coming here?<br />
<br />
rgds<br />
Grarg arg arg!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">no java bugs here...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Uvaavu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">No bugs here - but then I use a real browser - Firefox (http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/).<br />
<br />
If I use IE to browse sk.org I do get a Java error in the bottom left corner. It's certainly not a popup though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Marruk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Its not a popup for you in IE (nor for me) because we have our browsers set to suppress the errors.<br />
<br />
When I do my web developement, it is useful to have the errors pop up for debugging purposes, which is what he is complaining about. <br />
However, it is real easy to switch that setting when you aren't debugging.<br />
<br />
Besides, wtf are you doing browsing SK.org from work?  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I was thinking to myself that I have no clue what's being talked about (I'm no techie type -- Java is what I drink in the morning) but I did notice now that I do have a yellow caution icon on the bottom left corner of my IE browser; and if memory serves that denotes some kind of error on the page.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>kuulaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Seeing as the person who set this site up, does not get paid, that this site is not officially supported, has been here for much longer than 2 weeks, errors and all, and is FREE for you to use.<br />
<br />
<br />
Your welcome to STFU and go back to the Glade with the rest of the pansy asses.<br />
<br />
<br />
I code too and I dont have any issue turning of debugging when I am not actually, oh I dont know, CODING.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nycathis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Java is the error.<br />
<br />
As soon as the pointless love affair is over and people realise that you simply cannot write enterprise software or expect to run multi million dollar sites on a language that <br />
a) is STILL not defined, <br />
b) therefore still not completely nor correctly implemented, <br />
c) was originally developed to run kitchen appliances, <br />
<br />
the better.<br />
<br />
Now before people start saying what do I know about - Ive been in the industry since 1982. <br />
Think about it people, Ive been cutting code, developing systems and managing sites for longer than a lot of you have been alive or at least capable of reason.<br />
Ive seen the &quot;next big thing&quot; fail miserably time after time:<br />
PL/1, Pascal, 4GLs, Expert Systems - the list goes on.<br />
<br />
My current position has me dealing with organisations who simply cannot get the functionality that they require coupled to the stability that they must have in order to operate, because they have chosen to implement a JAVA based solution.<br />
The so called portability is a myth - I have run many JAVA benchmarks on different Operating Systems and quite simply things that work fine on one platform will perform abismally on another.<br />
This situation was engineered right from the start by Sun - if you run Sun Java on a Sun0S/Solaris platform on Sparc then you get good performance.<br />
Run it (the Sun JVM) on anything else and you get performace hits - encouraging you to buy Sun based systems.<br />
IBM followed suit with their version of the JAVA Virtual Machine which will only run efficently on IBM built platforms (RISC based etc - not the old PC / Intel systems )<br />
Finally even Intel in collabaration with another Java based Company developed a version of the JVM called JRockit which will also run better on Intel chips but fail to deliver on Sparc or RISC.<br />
All these implementations test to see what processor they are running on and include delays accordingly. <br />
<br />
All JAVA has become is a Advertisement to sell the Hardware of its manufacturer!!<br />
<br />
The commities that are defining the specification are still arguing on what the language is meant to do 10 years down the track.<br />
The EXACT same mistakes that brought about the language called PL/1 are being repeated now with Java.<br />
<br />
Java - pheh! Maybe it should be called &quot;Cat-shit Coffee&quot; - that would be a more honest description of that language</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Carasak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">java not equal to javascript<br />
<br />
and the error is javascript error<br />
<br />
thats the line(s) causeing the error:<br />
document.write (&quot;&lt;&quot; + &quot;script language='JavaScript' <br />
type='text/javascript' src='&quot;);<br />
try to make that 1 line instead of 2</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kahntun Derstand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I get it on 9 out of 10 of the computers I use.  It's annoying, but I'll agree with Kuulaak on this one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Khat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Looks like it's missing an apostrophe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>kuulaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It is not above the realm of possibility, that you ...  I dont know, PM the code fragment to the admin and point it out.  He may actually take a few minutes and go fix the error.<br />
<br />
<br />
It would be far more productive than creating a post pointing fingers.  If you really are a coder, and do it for a living, then you will understand how little priority a site like this has in his/her life.<br />
<br />
<br />
There are sites I have set up that I have not touched in over a year, unless I get a PM.</div></div><hr />
