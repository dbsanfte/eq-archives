<br />
We had a nice thread on this topic at TKW, but alas it is gone.<br />
<br />
I was scrambling for info last night because we made it to the bank and held out for about 2 hours there.  I think we found the spawn point but wasn't 100% sure.  That bank area is a blast!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Auronan</div><div class="date">03-27-2002, 11:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok the mobs that spawn right in front of the bank entrance (where the Grand Herbalist now spawns) are some of the PHs for the Alchemist Acolyte. I would suggest just camping that area around the bank and killing everything and that is your best bet to get the Acolyte to spawn quickly (worked for me). If the Acolyte does appear, you will see the Shard in its hand as a dagger like graphic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khardra</div><div class="date">03-29-2002, 12:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Alchemist Acolyte only spawns in one spot in my experience.  It's outside the shack and just to the side.  The Wizened Herb Collector also spawns in that spot, so if you know where he spawns then you've found the spawn point of the Acolyte.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />

<br />
To avoid any confusion, make sure you are camping the wooden shack that you can see upon wading through the waterfall near bank.  That is the Herbie/Love shack mentioned in spoilers, etc.<br />
<br />
Good luck on your shard drop.</div></div><hr />

We had some Herbalist type sarnak come, and he dropped a Goblin Juntah Harvester.  Unfortuantely, that was the only pull from that spot. :(<br />
<br />
I will have to go back there repeatedly.  Our Guild Leader wants the Girdle of Rapidity from the bank as well, so that's incentive for him to arrange more raid-ettes.</div></div><hr />
