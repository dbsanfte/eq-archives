<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Klaaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi, all.  This will be a fairly fundamental question, but that is mainly because I have done more grouping than raiding, so I am a little iffy on raid tactics.  Do SK's make good members of raid Kite Teams?  <br />
<br />
On the face of things, we would seem to be wonderful kiters since we are great at generating aggro even at a distance, and we can stand up to a few hits here or there when necessary.  The only problem I would see with this would be mob summoning?  Do most PoP and above raid-adds summon if damaged by our snares, or could we just downshift to our lowest snares to avoid damaging them enough to allow them to summon.<br />
<br />
Any tips you could provide would be greatly appreciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Onlee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If there was a lack of rangers, I'd kite during the Xegony event.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Daeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">most of the stuff we kite can't be snared anyways =/ just in case tho i load fear for kiting</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I keep fear loaded during raids for offtanking if neccessary or kiting</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ashrai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yes, Knights make excellent kiters. Your traditional &quot;kite classes&quot; such as Druids and Wizards are usually needed in other capacities (Healing and DPS respectively) on events such as RZtW. <br />
<br />
However while our own snare may not damage a mob to start it summoning, there are times when you want to remind the raid that you are kiting and that while nuking the mob may seem like they are being helpful, they are going to get you killed. Having a hotkey ready usually does the trick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Klaaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thanks guys!  I always thought this would be a great use for knights on a raid, since even rangers can be put to good use dropping True Shot and such on the mobs, and we just seem like the ideal kiting class other than maybe bards, but I wanted to check to ensure that I wasn't overlooking anything before proposing it to our raid leader.<br />
<br />
The other raids I was thinking I could help out on would be RZtW and Aerrin Dar, since the adds seem to be the major issue to be dealth with.<br />
<br />
Anyway, thanks again for the input!  I will definitely make a &quot;I am KITING %t.  Nuke and he is all YOURS!&quot; key.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Keep harmshield up just in case you are about to eat it, a lot of times if you are the only one on the aggro list, they will still follow you with harmshield popped.<br />
<br />
Fear usually gets the mobs attention. I would avoid snaring them, usually if they can be snared they can be rooted, which is more better as long as your rooters don't root them on top of the raid :) This would go for A'Dar.(minus the named golem)<br />
<br />
During RZ there are a few tricks to it, but just keep the adds away from the raid at all costs, you can learn the tricks on your own.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>signa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I love naked kiting during RZ. I always told my kite team it wasn't a real rz raid unless they were running around buck ass naked trying to aggro everything in the pit ~.~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Klaaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Sounds like a blast!  I can't wait to give it a try!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ashrai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I love naked kiting during RZ.<br />
<br />
LOL me too. It's not a raid unless I have a min of 2 corpses to get rezed. Nothing better than getting a pack of adds off the PP or RZ corpse and getting them all the way to the tunnel and getting an FD off and then realising that you were naked. <br />
<br />
By the way Klaaz: pop a Diamondskin on yourself too. Yea I know it's like pissing in the wind against what some of the mobs hit for but on something like the RZ adds it can mean you getting just those few steps farther- and on that raid it's ALL about the adds. RZ isn't what is gonna wipe you and prevent you from seeing those Elemental Planes: it's the adds.  <br />
<br />
I wouldn't be to worried about proposing it to your raid leader, I have done RZ with more than a few raid forces and every single one uses Knights on the kite team.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Novellus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I would rank the following as best kiters in order of <br />
<br />
Bard &gt; Wiz &gt; Druids &gt; Rangers &gt; Monks &gt; SKs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Grem, we once had someone blind adds on VZ to try and kite them... that was semi amusing until the idiot factor wore off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Klaaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Brael,<br />
<br />
I can easily understand why bards are better, and to some degree why wizards are better with their stuns and runes, but why the rest?  Monks don't seem to have all that significant an ability to create and sustain aggro from a distance.  And what makes Rangers and Druids better?  My first thought would have been the non-dmg snare, but most people here said that is not a significant issue.<br />
<br />
With all that said, each and every one of those classes other than bards can either out DPS us as a rule, or can help in the healing process.  If your opinion is right that wizards, druids, rangers, and monks are better kiters, I would think that SK's can still easily get the job done, and it would benefit the raid to have the other classes avaialble for other duties.  I simply can't imagine a raid being willing to give up its wizzie DPS to keep the SK's ont he main target.<br />
<br />
This is really just a curiosity, but as I am trying to get more involved in the raiding aspects of EQ, I would love to get a few opinions, and educate myself a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">It wasn't me that said that, a low hp bard is the best kiter though.<br />
<br />
Oh, Bards can outdamage us to.  Our Bards are capable of sustaining 110 dps in dots with an additional 95'ish in melee so 205 dps if they want.  They usually don't do this however since well, they can add more dps by enhancing others capabilities.  Show me an SK that can sustain 205 dps against raid mobs, you'll only break that in bursts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Klaaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Heh ... I tried bard, but just too much for me.  Try as I might, I always seem to come back to my SK to get the job done.  And that was my bad above.  I am so used to seeing your posts Brael that I just wrote the wrong thing.  I should have addressed that to Novellus.<br />
<br />
I will try to start treating bards with more respect.  It just FEELS like a Shadow Knight should look down on a minstrel ...</div></div><hr />
