<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Belyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I see that there is a terror upgrade listed on lucy for omens.  Instead of another spell that just adds a strait hate number why not make something that will acutally be useful.  Even if its enought hate to actually make a difference at the time of release, its usefulness will erode as peoples equipment and spells increase in power.<br />
I would suggest that all terrors instead of a strait hate number give current highest hate plus a significant hate number (1000).  This would also mean that if the sk had the current highest hate, it would add that hate plus 1000 and add it to current aggro.  Example 1.  Overnuking wizard has hate of 10,000 and is holding aggro, cast terror and sk now has aggro with a hate number of 11,000.  Example 2.  SK is holding aggro with 11,000 hate, he casts terror to maintain aggro and now has hate equal to 11,000 + 11,000 + 1000 = 23,000.  Apply this change to all current terror spells as well.<br />
<br />
There should never be another terror upgrade if all the devs are going to do is add another couple hundred hate.</div></div><hr />

You're stupid. Go play with a fork and an electrical outlet.<br />

We'll never get anything like this, we never SHOULD get anything like this, it would be like AE tauntx10000, except little recast, and...... no...... you're stupid. I hate you, people like you should be fed to dogs. Dogs with ugly teeth.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Belyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">There was a time when your replies would have been vastly different.  I imagine they would have been along the lines of what the hell do we need a dumb useless spell like that for ?<br />
<br />
When i started eq, belyle was the first character i made and i have been playing him ever since.  I focused on the sk because i liked the primary atributes of the class, 1. tanking  2. pulling  3. aggro generation.  Over the years the game designers have eroded or allowed the erosion of those abilities by nerf, by not allowing them to scale with new content, and by improving or adding abilities to other classes to make them better or widen the margin of how much better at it then we are.  In some cases, i would go as far as saying they did it unintentionally, and to make things worse they did nothing to correct it.<br />
<br />
The only thing ridiculous about this would be the bitchfest on the warrior boards.  Sks are pretty damn far from the kings of aggro, king implies number one by a wide margin.  Im sure there is some senerio at some lvl with certian gear where terrors work, but they dont scale at all.  We currently arent number one by any margin, we are about number 4.<br />
<br />
Can you name the weapon procs and worn enhancement effects that are equal to or greater then the lvl 60 spells from the class that they were derived ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>StruzorGnome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">eh...?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Arikash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ok, normally I don't post or even look at these boards, or do this, but<br />
<br />
<br />
You're a fucking idiot dude, 100% taunt + some more on top of that, that's fucking ridiculous(sp?).  A more realistic suggestion would be add a 0.0sec stun to them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Belyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Disease cloud and shadow vortex used to work better then 100 percent taunt plus aggro on top of that.  They where both much greater then stun as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Do you have any idea how taunt works?<br />
<br />
Go find out and come back.  Disease cloud was not 100% taunt, it was just a hell of a lot of aggro.  Shadow vortex was a lot, but it was no where near disease cloud aggro.<br />
<br />
No one in this game will ever get 100% taunt, in a version you can re-use every few seconds.  If you want any clue as to how powerful sony believes this ability to be... look no further than AET.  It's the only 100% taunt in the game, and it's usable what... once every 10-15 minutes?<br />
<br />
We won't get a 100% taunt spell, we don't need one, spend your time on something more realistic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Belyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">What i was implying was if the terror i was suggesting was around since day 1, its power would have been dwarfed in comparison to what DC and SV used to be, and no one would have bothered to use the terror.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Oberyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">...because what you suggested puts you at the top of the agro list GUARANTEED, then adds a bunch of hate on top of that.<br />
<br />
DC and SV were high agro, but quantifiable.  ie: if everyone else has a million hate (number out of my ass, obviously), then its still gonna take a lot of casts of DC to catch up...<br />
<br />
No offense, but use your brain man, and ask for something reasonable.   <br />
<br />
guaranteed taunt + a large amount of hate is not reasonable.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oberyn</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Belyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Oberyn, back when DC and SV worked for aggro, no one could come close to making that much hate on a mob.  Theres a huge problem with our aggro, its not super apparent atm but its gonna get worse.  Hate generated from melee dps, other hate from itemization and hate from other classes detremental spells are starting to come out from under the shadow of fear and darkness.  Pretty soon those spells(fear and darkness) wont be very effective at all.  The fact that they are cheap mana spells is nice, but we dont have any high  mana cost spells that work substantially better to replace them with when they stop working.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Oberyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">...how well DC worked.<br />
<br />
Let me postulate a situation:  you decide/need to grab agro at the END of a fight (everyone else has MASSIVE agro already).  one cast of DC isn't going to do it.  2 maybe:P<br />
<br />
With your version, the SK walks in at the very end of a boss mob fight (or whenever), casts once, and has GUARANTEED agro.  <br />
<br />
Does that sound reasonable to you?  You don't see it trivializing anything?  Making any exploits possible?  <br />
<br />
I agree, we need Terrors reworked, or a better form of agro spell, but that has been presented in our top 10 fixes, in a reasonable context. <br />
<br />
One cast guaranteed agro on anything (in a non-timed format) is unreasonable.  <br />
<br />
and I think I'm done here.<br />
<br />
Oberyn</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Belyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">They way you speak of sv and dc, sounds like you where not around when those spells worked.<br />
<br />
I can walk in at the end of a boss mob fight and grab aggro right now by hitting the tuant button.  Although, i have no reason to do so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">No you can't.<br />
<br />
Taunt is probabalistic.<br />
<br />
Yes, you *might* get aggro, but higher level boss mobs... chance of getting aggro off of one taunt aren't great.  Maybe 1/3 taunts succeed, if that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Belyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Its certianly not 100 percent but it is possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Possible, and then if the other person you just took agro from happens to land a critical hit, or nuke, or cast a spell, or whatever, they get agro back; what you're saying is 100% guaranteed, plus a shitload of agro on top of that, so that they will not get agro back from you in the next few seconds, no matter what. And that is just unreasonable. It's retarded. Go kill yourself, and end this petty, stupid argument.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Oh yes, I forgot about this also...<br />
<br />
Example 2. SK is holding aggro with 11,000 hate, he casts terror to maintain aggro and now has hate equal to 11,000 + 11,000 + 1000 = 23,000.<br />
<br />
So what you're saying is, with 2, maybe 3 casts of this terror (with which we more than double our agro off of each cast) you could basically have an agro lock that no one could even try to overcome (other than with taunt) for minutes and minutes of pure DPS/agro....... again, with the stupidity.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There was a time when our spells pretty much did exactly what your saying is stupid.  After they nerfed them into nothing, i remember sks being quite upset.  Then the devs said ok we are going to give you back your aggro, here is the terror line.  The bitchfest that followed that didnt last long as we pulled out fear and darkness as ok replacements, at that time they still provided way more then sufficent aggro.  Fast forward to today, fear and darkness barely provide sufficent aggro and in some cases not enough....and terrors still dont work.</div></div><hr />
