<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gibman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I spent 5 aa on this which my 7.2k HT and only does around 900 dmg. This doesn't seem right in the description due to the fact of this ability turning your HT into a lifetap.  Logic would tell you that means it being more than 900 tap if you spend 30aa on something else. I reported this as a feedback and no changes yet, its been a month.<br />
<br />
Thoughts please</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Drynnious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I bet it's working as intended. If we got it to heal for 7k paladins would freak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gibman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">They would, but my point is for 5 aa we should get something better than a 900 heal that uses the IHT hotkey, and I want VI to understand that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lejina Bloodbath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It does not use the Imp.HT hotkey.<br />
<br />
It use the HT hotkey (the regular one).<br />
<br />
Imp.HT and Leech Touch have nothing to do with each others (other than you need the regular HT to be up before use for both).<br />
<br />
<br />
Kinda like a warrior with Disciplines Defensive and Evasive. Two different things, but they both need the Discipline timer to be up and ready to use them and they are both down when one is used.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, and if you still arent sure about it : yes, Leech Touch is teh suq. Dont waste your aa's on this people!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>GenoReaper999</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">ok so i wont get leech touch. so what aa's should i work for first? run??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gibman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I should have specified about the IHT hotkey. No it doesnt use this, but it does use HT which reduces the value of IHT.  If they dont change the dmg on leechtouch, then i would advise them to change the description of the ability instead of luring people in spending aa points which they cannot reimburse.<br />
<br />
And yes Lejina is right, this is a pos ability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>darkil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Discipline Unholy does not work with leechtouch.  Very sad.  I bought this ability in hopes that it would always exceptional heal like IHT crits.  <br />
<br />
It's not totally worthless... Just almost worthless.  If you go to droga and AE... and get a few too many mobs, a 900 heal is helpful (since lifetap can get interrupted with lotta mobs beating on you).</div></div><hr />
