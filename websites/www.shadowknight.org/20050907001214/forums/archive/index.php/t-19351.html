<br />
My understanding is Armor AC affects how much you get hit for but agility/defense affects if you get hit.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to lower your avoidence AC without lowering your mitigation AC?  Does soft cap still remain for low atk mobs?<br />
<br />
When I fight low blue mobs they hit me for about 20 on ave and I think I can get a 58 pts ds.  Anyone tried getting major DS and then taking a cleric and farming low blues?<br />
<br />
Seems to me the DPS should be 1HP=2.85 DS damage<br />
<br />
With a cleric getting 18.75 heal per 1 mana with CH into a 7500+ tank they amount of damage per mana spent by cleric could be <br />
about 54 damage per mana.  With KEI and a horse seems a duo could do some major major major dps.<br />
<br />
I don't have 7500 hp and I am sure when I do the low blues will hit harder than 20 but you can see why this is interesting to me...<br />
<br />
anyone tried it?  Does high weight do the trick?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Go kill yourself.<br />
<br />
By the time you have 7500+ hp, unless you're stupid (which from the looks of things ya are), killing a mob with a DS is not only moronic, but incredibly in-efficient.</div></div><hr />

<br />
who knows?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The idea was to kill 4 at a time.  Using an AE weapon to hold agro.  Killing 4 per min gives potential of 240 low blues per hour.<br />
<br />
I think that exp could easily add up.<br />
<br />
Even if you only got 4k worth of heal from the CH the ratio of 20 damage per 1 mana from cleric is kinda good.</div></div><hr />

<br />
also while the idea sounds remotely possible, <br />
where will you have this many lt blues?  <br />
Who is refreshing the DS?  (maybe just take a druid to begin with)  <br />
Also even if you get good exp from these light blues, they will go green really quick and then you have to move on again.  Sounds like this is beginning to be a hassle.<br />
<br />
4 per minute seems optimistic.  who's pulling anyway?  Even if you peaked at 4 per minute you won't be able to hold that rate.<br />
<br />
Where the hell are there 240 lt blues that will all pop within an hour that won't infringe on someone elses camp?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sebkorsisu</div><div class="date">01-12-2004, 05:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This technique works fine for PLing toons to into the 30s, maybe up to 40 or so. After that the mobs hit way too hard. They will outdamage the DS by a wide margin. One downside of doing this is that the toon's basic skills will suffer. So you will probably be spending some more time practicing things like basic casting skills and working a little harder to max out the various weapon skills.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I use this method in LDoN normals whenever I can.  I pull a room of 5-6, tell everyone not to slow, and I just aggro them all.  With a bard and mage, I easily pass 100 DS, and have seen upwards of 150.  Only require one or two CH's during that time, and the DPS is downright insane.  <br />
<br />
This is the one reason I don't mind our AA that increases DS's.  Jesus, if it ended up being a 2x modifier, that would be upwards of a 300 point DS.  That's pretty powerful.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Which DS if I may ask?<br />
<br />
I am using chardok ring 25+eighth ring 8 for 33 but chardok ring stacks with shaman potion 33 if I read lucy right.<br />
<br />
When I lazy about the recharge I use banshee 12 instead of chardok.</div></div><hr />
