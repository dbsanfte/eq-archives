<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Valon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Im a level 50 sk, reasonablly well geared and have access to a 65 enchanter to haste and c5 my groups.  I am looking for suggestions as to where in veskar and nurga a low 50's group should camp, I have no experience in either zone, but they sound like a nice change to the constant LDoN missions.  I know some of you are adverse to powerlevel, but I just use the chanter in addition to my regular groups.<br />
<br />
Thanks in Advance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Krassus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">did entrance and such yesterday from 55-56 took about 3 hours with monk / shaman PLing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Savoline</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'll suggest you to head to PoN, load Beckon Tash slow ARune etc, group with ench w/ SK and start charm soloing the zone down.<br />
<br />
wheres the problem with PLing anyways? There's a reason you have access to this enchanter :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Valon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">As I understood it, that with the charm nerfs, the pet steals xp based on the amount of damage hes done,  I had used it to level up twinks before the nerfs, but as I understood it, the pet steals too much xp to make this viable anymore.  I am however, not an expert in this, and only recently started playing again, so I may be uninformed or just plain wrong, anyone care to fill me in?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Savoline</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">for every point of damage the pet does it takes 0,33% of the experience. if the pet does 100%, it will take 33% of the experience. at 64, 2boxing ench charming and my SK I get around the same exp in HoH NE basement as if I was in an absolutly kickass BoT group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gnobb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Have the Enchanter Mez the MoB when it is close to death and then Memwhipe.<br />
SK finishes off the MoB and gets full XP for the kill while Chanter and pet head off to pull a new MoB.<br />
Enchanters can PL any class very easily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>nabolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">When charming in pon with my druid. I would cast invis on myself when both mobs where down to 10% or below. Then finish off both mobs. This stopped the charm mob from taking exp away.</div></div><hr />
