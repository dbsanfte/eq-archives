<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yabyab</div><div class="date">12-01-2003, 01:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Been parsing alot in raids, I wasnt pushing my damage usually I had that impression of me being down there in the list in terms of DPS (since we're knights and got this 225 cap). Until I found out that my DPS is NOT too far from rogues/rangers.<br />
<br />
 Then I decided to add Pet and Cast more. I was amazed.<br />
<br />
 I know that, if I want to beat our best Rogue's DPS I CAN. And can sustain in Raids only (not XP groups).<br />
<br />
 In mini/boss/named encounters we can dish out INSANE damage IF the tank can hold enough Aggro. Heck, we dont need the tank to hold aggro. I Chain cast ToI/ToV + BoH + Pet + AoH then FD after awhile for a sec then unFD to chain a couple of times. With the right gear (we get lots of mana and mana regeneartion from EP+ loot really) we can sustain spells in Raids (SD, bot9, VoQ and ModRod). Add to that Death Touch and its hard to beat our Total Damage in boss encounters.<br />
<br />
 I usually come 5th behind our best Rogue, Ranger, Wizzie and Monk (heck even without Pet). If I use DT I can be 3rd/4th per encounter in Total Damage.<br />
<br />
 If I can only convince our shammies to cast FA on me :D<br />
<br />
 Any of you guys noticed this potential of DPS for the SK class?</div></div><hr />

I think you'd also have to factor in if &quot;the best geared&quot; are really trying to do max DPS as well since i know people like to be slackers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dhantes</div><div class="date">12-01-2003, 06:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yah heh back  in my old velious era guild on raid mob with my wmbs i outdamaged our best rouges with pet+melee alone heh. Not sure bout wizards etc though my parser at the time didn't show spell dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Burek</div><div class="date">12-07-2003, 12:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">At lvl 58, I usually parse around 41dps (WMBS and around 1200 ATK) while my pet is around 12dps while hasted with strenghten death.  <br />
<br />
Most rogues my lvl that I look at their parse are around 60-70dps, which doesn't put me that far behind with my pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brael</div><div class="date">12-07-2003, 01:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We can do good damage but not for very long.  Pets don't really factor into the higher end boss mobs to because they all have ae's.  Average lifespan of my pet in time is about 10 seconds</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dhantes</div><div class="date">12-07-2003, 02:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">so does that mean i shouldn't buy pet hold :)?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Inferna</div><div class="date">12-08-2003, 12:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Be quiet we are already getting complaints that we do too much damage from rangers.<br />
<br />
I dont see it personally maybe burst damage or with time weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DConquest</div><div class="date">12-08-2003, 10:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Our DPS is great on Boss mobs due to our spell line up  and special abilities.  Despite that fact, we still don't outdo most melee that are using their offensive disclines as well.  If Rangers got to use Trueshot they'd outdmg us as well, but that isn't possible on most boss mobs.   <br />
<br />
In exp groups that don't involve undead, it goes down drastically.  I can only BoH, Spear so much before I start getting low on mana.  Not to mention we waste alot of swings buffing group, ourselves, and taunting each mob.</div></div><hr />

We get a Death Touch?  OMFG, when? Can you teach me how to get it?  Maybe you could post a walkthrough for getting DT, and then how to make a hot button for it or whatever?<br />
<br />
You, sir, are the win.<br />

Edit:  Just incase you missed it, :rolleyes: :rolleyes: :rolleyes: , for those who are fucking retarded.</div></div><hr />
