<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Klotar AngedeMorts</div><div class="date">01-22-2004, 10:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's been discussed before, but mostly embedded in other posts.  Damage Shields, so powerful in the early to mid-levels (especially when powerlevelling), diminishes in power as we level and the mobs we fight hit harder (and so the dmg shield does a smaller percentage of damage relatively) and mobs are usually slowed.<br />
<br />
The majority of people I might talk to nowadays consider DS's to be useless or at least of dubious value at 65.  I've always been a fan of damage shields in 4 years of playing EQ but perhaps I need to take another look at it.<br />
<br />
Please keep in mind though, that I do not play in the high end of EQ and so I generally do not tank 1100+ hitters and such.  On the other hand, I tank 99% of the time -- currently doing normal adventures pretty much exclusively.  And JUST recently, we started doing normal adventures without a slower or crowd control (rather than doing other stuff till a shm/enc/bl/bard got online).<br />
<br />
Okay, enough preamble.  I generally have 48 pts of DS on (10 from Cloak of Luclin, 8 from 9th ring, and 40 from druid DS) at most times.  And, that takes up a few buff slots.  CoL I would keep up regardless of whether I liked DS's or not; Shield of the 8th I would keep up because it's not just an 8 pt DS -- it's also an insta-clicky for anti-dispell purposes; and so the lion's share of the DS comes from druid DS.  If no druid/mage is in group, I even go to the trouble of loading up Banshee Aura, which then takes up a spell slot (due to it's short duration) in addition to a buff slot, that gives me 30 pts of DS.<br />
<br />
Question: is it worth it?  I think it is but it seems not many agree.  I'd always preferred a DS over agi/str/dex buffs, etc.  I'm looking at this now again because of the proposed GoD Intense Hatred AA line.  If it truly does give us, at level 5, after 45 aa points, 30 points of innate DS; that means the majority of the time I will have a 78 pt DS with druid present or 60 pt DS self buffed.  Or, if I choose to go with no DS because buff slots are tight, I will still have a 48 pt DS (CoL-10, Shield of 8th-8, innate-30).<br />
<br />
Before anyone thinks I am completely whacko for wanting to blow 45 aa points on Intense Hatred (not to mention spend 30 on this right off the bat and first), I should mention that by the time GoD comes out, I will have ~500 aa points plus 30 banked.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for input and discussion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
in many cases we found it so effective in dealing extra dmg that we didn't use bardslow and just mini healed with the druid and CH'd with the cleric.<br />
<br />
against a slowed mob i think their effectiveness drops through the floor however. it's still extra dmg and depending on the number of buff slots it's taking up, dmg is dmg i think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">newtank</div><div class="date">01-22-2004, 01:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK at lvl 65 my understanding is that we do something in the ball park of 100 DPS melee.  I am using 100 even though I have heard 88-140 so I could be 40% low or 12% high.<br />
<br />
With 100 DPS each % haste is 1 DPS.<br />
<br />
If the mob averages 1 hit per tick ave (I am totally guessing here but again using easy number)  then each 6pts DS=1% haste.  It is very easy in a group to get to 30pts DS and at 65 it is possible to get up in the 100-120 range.<br />
<br />
Realize that if my numbers above are right anyone who tells you that 120 DS is not very important is also telling you that the difference between 3k SCHW with 21% haste and 41% haste valued at 100k is small.<br />
<br />
Even the difference between 36% and 41% items in bazaar are telling.  So if you think you would rather have 41% haste over 36% haste then you probably want to have your ~30 pts DS up.<br />
<br />
NOTE I am lvl 55 so I may be off on the numbers above for lvl 65 but if you 65 you should be able to tell if I off my a factor of 2 or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jodgrim</div><div class="date">01-22-2004, 02:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A DS is extra damage, and that is never a bad thing. They are more effective against un-slowed mobs, but even on slowed mobs they shorten the fight so unless your buff window is full, a DS is not a bad thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lynxal</div><div class="date">01-22-2004, 02:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We use Damage Shields all the time doing normal LDoN adventures since we don't slow the mobs.  It ends up being like 30DPS.<br />
<br />
I am not 100% sold on an innate 30 point damage shield.  I would hate to channel a FD through a barage of hits by a mob I was pulling or splitting, only to stand up and get summoned 100 yards into the dungeon because I did 500 damage from the damage shields.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NorrynNoir</div><div class="date">01-22-2004, 04:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i'm not certain damage shields affect aggro.  i could be wrong but i didn't think DS damage was attributed to any individual but was generic 'non-melee' dmg.<br />
<br />
also 100 dps melee for an sk seems high to me. i know that with 31% haste , a WMBS and lvl 65 i come nowhere near that. maybe that's with raid haste and buffs, not sure, but it seems to me DPS should be determined without those buffs so comparisons are more simple.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Klotar AngedeMorts</div><div class="date">01-22-2004, 06:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks so far for the input.  As far as I know, damage shields are still unattributed although there was a point last year where I believe SOE was going to change that (to cut down on rapid PL).  This is why the twink being PL'd has to do that 1 point of damage to get the kill on a mob.<br />
<br />
As for the proposed Intense Hatred AA, I'm not sure if that will be attributed but I'd guess not, unless a change occurs globally for all DS's.  There is currently an aug in Nro theme, Type 3 Shield of Pain II, which adds an worn/innate (no buff icon) 2 pt DS which may be similar to what we get.<br />
<br />
Intense Hatred, if it goes live and if it scales linearly at 6 DS per level (i.e. doesn't give greater benefit for more points spent), I'd probably just go to level 3 off the bat for 18 aa to get 18 pts of DS rather than spend 27 more aa to get 12 more pts of DS.  I could probably earn 760 ap faster than 27 aa points.  ;)<br />
<br />
As for dps, I know that with my wep I certainly don't parse high, even with a DS I think I get only 70ish... (yeah yeah, so I have a sad wep).  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kormus the Dark Angel</div><div class="date">01-23-2004, 06:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been a puller through all of my life. When I am raid pulling I usually ask not to DS me - it caused more than a handful of deaths when trigger happy Mages slapped DS on me. Ssra caster mob + 2 hits on pull = summon mode. That can be a pain.<br />
<br />
DS basically is free damage - just grab naggy arms for those insta click +9 DS without mana cost.<br />
<br />
Here (http://forum.magecompendium.com/viewtopic.php?t=10017&amp;highlight=damage+shield+effective) you might find a thread that covers some DS numbers among other stuff.<br />
<br />
As an aside: 10+8+40 = 58<br />
/grimmode off</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Klotar AngedeMorts</div><div class="date">01-23-2004, 09:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh yeah, 58 -- not 48.  :)<br />
<br />
I browsed the mage thread, and it's interesting to see it from the caster side of things in terms of efficiency; but I have been viewing it as always efficient as long as the buff slots are available.  My side question, I suppose, might be: at what point should I drop the DS in favor of some other buff(s) or to keep buff slots open for debuffs/dot's and heal over time?<br />
<br />
As for the summoning, that makes sense.  Although the damage shield damage might be unattributed, the damage has been done -- and as puller, you are likely the only one on the hate list.  Good point and something to consider.<br />
<br />
One additional negative I forgot about too, is that some enchanters dislike me using a DS; since on, let's say a 2-pull, the chanter doesn't know which one to mez, since both are close together and not at 100% health.<br />
<br />
I'm concluding at this point that if a DS is available (dru/mag) and buff slots are not at a premium, then I should go with a DS.  If a dru/mag is not available, I perhaps should not bother using Banshee Aura to add 12 pts and taking up a spell gem (which might be better used for nukes/taps/dot's) due to it's relatively short duration (9 min).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cauchy</div><div class="date">01-23-2004, 11:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Instead of banshee aura, I use the blazing vambraces off zordak.  It's a little less than banshee, but it's a targetable clicky, so you don't have to waste a spell gem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Svartrot</div><div class="date">01-23-2004, 05:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, the other night I had a 161 point DS going for a couple adventures (normal setting). We'd pull multiples and skipped slowing. I did not parse but I am pretty sure the mobs took more from damage hitting me than they dealt.<br />
<br />
Saryrn belt clicky + 9th coldain ring clicky + cloak of luclin + mage DS + bard.<br />
<br />
Outside normal difficulty adventures I don't use Ds much though. I'll put em up if they are free.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ramgar SK</div><div class="date">01-26-2004, 11:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Even using slow, a DS makes a big difference in an extended fight.  I know this from tons of grouping with a druid friend and using my 2boxed chanter.  I always make sure I have a slot open for his DS, and of course my cloak.<br />
<br />
Sure, I could put Grim Aura up, or Intellectual Superority, etc, but they don't put out DPS near what a DS can do.<br />
<br />
Free buff slots and DS available = yes, always use it.<br />
<br />
Full buff slots = consider the DPS they provide.  Click off the one or 2 that don't add much.  <br />
<br />
It's all about weighing the value of the buffs you have available.<br />
<br />
IMO, a DS has to rank high in the list of all buffs available even considering a slowed mob.  I would not put it above haste, big HP, or mana regen, or even a melee stat(s) buff.<br />
<br />
Now on the other hand, if you are fighting things that don't hit you often, the DS becomes pointless.  But why would you fight that whimp?  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Naeldaar Blackhearted</div><div class="date">01-27-2004, 02:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Use of damage shields is entirely situational, as has been suggested. I, like any 65 SK, have CoL up at all times. However, with raid buffs, and even in most exp groups, I'm almost always hovering dangerously close to 15 buffs - I prefer to have no more than 12 on (leaving 1 for heal over time, 1 for aura of pain, 1 for aura of hate). When fighting mobs that dot/debuff me, I like having even more slots open. Naturally, this means something's gotta go. Have to have CoL, SoC, some sort of mana regen, virtue (symbol and 9 are nice but even more brutal on buff slots).. haste, shammy buffs, etc eat up spell slots quick. <br />
<br />
Anyway, the point is, when it comes time to click something off, the first thing to go is always acumen (I never keep Acumen on because I'm a dark elf so I have UV anyway, and I have a see invis item.. the sta regen effect on acumen is no longer there since the disc revamp). The second to go in most cases is usually the damage shield a helpful druid or mage has tossed on me. Why? I'm primarily a puller and a tank. I generally don't get hit enough on a pull to get summoned, so that's not really the issue. However, in the pulling role, I'd rather have the slot the DS was taking up filled with sow or SoE - more likely to keep me alive, plus it speeds up my pulling. <br />
<br />
For the same reason I click off damage shields often when tanking - it just takes up a buff slot that I need for aura of pain/hate (I'd say hate is more group dps increase when your group has 3+ melees than even a high damage shield - especially on slowed mobs). In addition, as a SK I mitigate well and lifetap and all that good stuff, but the fact of the matter is I still take more damage than a paladin with similar AA would. Because of this, when tanking and in need of slots, I'll generally drop stuff first that doesn't directly affect my ability to mitigate damage - DS dps, while nice, is simply an extra and I gain more from being hasted, auraed, max hp buffed, and having my pet up than I could from a DS. Also, the more mana my cleric saves, the more she's gonna be nuking, which is also better damage than a DS will do on your average slowed fight.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'm rambling, I think there may be a point in there somewhere, good luck finding it. :D<br />
<br />
Edit: This applies mostly to PoP, in normal LDoN the way to go is definitely less buffs, a DS and no slower :p</div></div><hr />

Yep. And I dish out more dps so with a limited hp pool to fight against I shorten fights. <br />
<br />
First off, I said a paladin takes less damage, not that they're better. I think it goes without saying that we outdamage paladins in our sleep... shit, our pets alone are a constant 25+ dps over and above what they can do. Factor in our nukes and the ability to add almost 30 dps with a single dot...<br />
<br />
No doubt, on mobs with lower hp pools, we own paladins. On mobs that are unstunnable we make them cry, we're such better tanks. On longer fights, provided the mob is stunnable, however.. you may shorten the fight even by a significant amount, but a paladin will take less damage in the long run. We're the offensive knights, they're the more defensive ones. To that end, they're *gasp* better tanks in some situations, especially on harder hitting mobs, or unslowable/difficult to slow ones. If you can't even admit that paladins have their little niche, and may even be better than shadowknights in one tiny facet of one thing we do... then I don't know who you are to be tossing the word 'retarded' around. When you think paladin you think tank, and when you think shadowknight, you think tank, puller, dps. Paladins are more specialized than we are; to that end, in their single role with the right conditions, they have an edge on us. If they didn't, there'd be a lot less of them around, because they're boring as ass to play. God knows there aren't so many of them because of their amazing soloing ability.<br />
<br />
Anyway, this is all WAY off topic and has been all said before ad nauseum, and I can't believe I'm writing a post DEFENDING paladins... but consider my comment elaborated upon.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aress</div><div class="date">02-03-2004, 05:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">aye, when the DS gets to &gt;100, and the mob is unslowed, it's fantastic.  However, keep in mind that you need a high MR cleric/druid, and that you lose dps if your other dps spells are interupted by an unslowed mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lorddaeth</div><div class="date">02-03-2004, 06:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">just how high can we get DS to go?<br />
<br />
i know that i was at 88 with just CoL+mage group DS+Kilva (shaman potion) just yesterday farming pelts in EW for my coldain ring.<br />
<br />
please post which spells/effects you have used, and how high it got.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">window</div><div class="date">02-05-2004, 05:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">just from parsing some 3 different LDoN runs with just enchanters slowing, in normal LDON mobs hit me a little less than .3 times per second. unslowed i'd guess they'd hit about .85 times per second.<br />
<br />
so... i'd guess the DPS gained from damage shields is around .3 per point of DS with a slower, or .85 without in normal ldon, and probably similar in other places. so every 5 points of DS should add at least 1.5 DPS when tanking, which is pretty nice.<br />
<br />
if you're tanking 2 unslowed mobs at a time, its up to 8.5 DPS per 5 points DS.</div></div><hr />
