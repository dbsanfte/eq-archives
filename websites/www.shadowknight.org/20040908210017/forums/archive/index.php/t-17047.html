<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jabekaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings! ... I am new to these boards so bare with me, but I have used it a great many times to do many things, such as the forging of Greenmist and did most of my research here for obtaining Innoruuk's Curse. .. and now im down to Lhranc.<br />
<br />
To the point: I have two questions<br />
<br />
1. IS HE SLOWABLE?: ) I couldn't find it  &quot;anywhere&quot; ... and ya so theres one ..<br />
2. What will Lhranc con upon turning in the items?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance, Jabekaz Shadowreaver of Rallos Zek - Common Wealth Alliance :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rolukk Earbiter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ok bro. I just killed him a few days ago. Here's what I learned. <br />
1. He's not slowable. Only lures/lifetap land on him (and MB!)<br />
2. Once you turn in your stuff, he is not kos to you or anyone else that has decent truespirit (epic) faction. He will only attack once hailed. Get HS up, then hail and pull him out of hut.<br />
3. He fucking owns. Still. Dropped my 8k tank in about 10secs.   Almost every hit he lands procs a 500pt dd. You want to kill him as fast as possible. MB him, HT him, whatever. Just put him down, or he will put you down...Quite fast. Doesnt have too many hp tho, so shouldnt be too much of a problem. And if you wipe...Just rez and try again. He doesnt despawn. Hope this helps!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ziagwa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">just be sure to bind in CoM all your raid force so you can get there fast to finish the job and when the SKs die and pop HT his ass so when you die again you can HT him :) thats what we did for a friends epic</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>yuggoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">MB wizzys rule for this.. so do AM3 rangers.  We had an AM3 ranger at my Lhranc takedown and I think he did about 40% of the total damage.</div></div><hr />
