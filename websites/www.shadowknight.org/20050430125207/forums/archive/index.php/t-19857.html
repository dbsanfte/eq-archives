I also need a good hunting place that i can solo efficiantly in. Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Maybe check my magelo profile to see where i can go with my equipment and maybe suggest some more stuff i should get.</div></div><hr />

Whatever you do, don't sit in KC for the next 6 months trying to max stupid AA like Innate Dex.  <br />
<br />

<br />
<br />

<br />

Why the fuck are you linking MySupersales in your sig?<br />
<br />
Is that why you're 55 and don't know how to play your toon?<br />
<br />
I suppose that would also explain why you don't know how to use search, nor have enough respect for the people you've come to ask advice from to actually find the answers for yourself...<br />
<br />
/sigh<br />
<br />
<br />
And people actually have the audacity to ask me why I hate everyone...</div></div><hr />

<br />
How bout you get money by earning it rather than promoting exploiters that screw up bazaar prices?<br />
<br />
It's a cheap, easy, lazy way to get money.  And I don't mean inexpensive.</div></div><hr />
