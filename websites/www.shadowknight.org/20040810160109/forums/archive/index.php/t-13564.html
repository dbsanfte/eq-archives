<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jormunrek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does anyone know of or have found a quets involving:<br />
Worn Belt Buckle<br />
8.0wt. Size: medium<br />
Class: war, shd, mnk, rog<br />
Race: all<br />
<br />
Silver Skull Ring<br />
Slot: fingers<br />
0.5 wt. Size: small<br />
Class: war, shd, mnk, rog<br />
Race: all<br />
<br />
Grant it that much of the LoY quest items are no drop but it seems odd that they would put class and race listings on vendor trash.<br />
<br />
And thoughts?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You can see them both in the bank on my magelo profile, for those that are curious about the items.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm pretty sure that the belt buckle is for a quest.  I think I came across it on www.allakhazam.com.  Check there for more information, you should be able to search for quests by item and/or zone.<br />
<br />
I've never seen the ring thing, but I've pretty much left the new zones for a while in favor of grinding out aa's in easier environs (like Katta) and working on Greenmist.<br />
<br />
Good luck, and let us know what you come up with if it's something cool. :)<br />
<br />
Edit: Ooh, cool new script, I didn't actually use the http:// button and it still converted the alla's address to a link.  Sweet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rotarr Rok'Vodarna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Those items are for neck haste item quests.  One of the quests gives you a 20% haste neck with some stats, and the other is like a 22 or 24% with some ac and stats.<br />
<br />
I read this last week somewhere on www.allakhazam.com.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jormunrek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have checked Alla several times and keep checking back on those two specific items and have yet to find a corresponding quest for either.<br />
<br />
I am aware of the haste two part quest that uses the torn luggald robe for the first quest.  But it is not usable by SK's.<br />
<br />
Hehe I searched all over BEFORE asking if anyone has come across the quest for fear of being assualted by the Search Button Squad of Deth. :cool: <br />
<br />
If you happen across where you found the info for the haste item quest involving them I would be very interested in that url.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think they've got to be for an as-yet unsolved quest.  Would be nice to figure out what they are from.  I posted this stuff on www.thesafehouse.org since they are usually pretty good at solving unsolved quests and it looks like this might be rogue useable as well.  Might look there and see what they've come up with.<br />
