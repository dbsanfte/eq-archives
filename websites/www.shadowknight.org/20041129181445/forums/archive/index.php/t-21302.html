<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Greythanos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, this is really my first suggestion, and I usually don't like to post because it seems that people flame everyone for a suggestion.  Oh well, here it goes.<br />

Our HT / AA ability LeechTouch is pretty much useless.  Spending the AA's and time on that skill is pointless IMO when you could just do 10k damage instead of 4k or so healing (situational of course).  What if the Devs added a AA ability that made LeechTouch MGB?  When you hit it, everyone in the surrounding area was healed for that much?  Was thinking this would give us a more prominant role during a raid.  <br />
<br />
Prolly overpowered or something.. hehe was just bored at work and spewing thoughts out on the Message boards...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vedark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I feel leechtouch should be on a separate timer, as it is now we have an enormous sink of aa all bottlenecked by putting it on one timer. <br />
<br />
and no more pet aa please, i'm not a pet class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Androsulach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">They could make us a pet class, but that would be said to be overpowering.  After all, we could solo as well as necros then.<br />
<br />
If they uncoupled the timers on Improved HT and Leechtouch there'd be some who'd complain about our burst damage.  Still, do the AAs stack as far as Improved HT and Leechtouch are concerned?  Are the dmg improvement AAs cumulative?  If we can do 9k HTs with Improved HT, can we Leechtouch for that amount as well or not?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vedark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">no one would complain about &quot;burst damage&quot; because adding another 1900 damage from the leech touch wouldn't offend anyone. It a trivial amount.  You don't seem to see the aa problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">heh they shoulda given us leechtouch on the same timer instead of modifying unholy aura to do more damage.  That would offset the bulk of the damage increase from leech touch right there.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't say leech is useless.... it *has* saved my ass on more than one occaision, but it is definitely underpowered for its cost.  An unslowed trash mob hitting for 1400..... leech touch will buy you a fraction of a second for the next heal to land and save your ass.  Sometimes it's enough.... more often than not I find myself at my bind wishing I hadn't bothered and saved HT for damage.<br />
<br />
It should at very least be on a seperate timer.  If they're going to keep it on the same timer it needs to do a lot more damage.... perhaps work with unholy aura, perhaps just up it by 50 or 75% on its own.  Maybe make it perma crit like standard HT?  Also, wth doesn't focus affect it?  Seems rather silly to me.</div></div><hr />
