<br />
Because my int is naturally so low where should i try to get it too? I know all casters try to get a minimumk of 200, but since im more warrior than necro (and it would take an insane amount of really good items) i doubt 200 int is realistic. So, as an Ogre SK where should my long-term goal for Int be? (Note: Its currently at 115)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frued</div><div class="date">04-02-2002, 11:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I started at 75 INT long ago. Soloed for 46 levels then joined a guild and am now at 54. I only now eclipsed 100 INT.<br />
<br />
 I wouldn't worry about it to much. Use what you have to the best of your ability. Ogre's are not inkies so don't try to play your Ogre SK like one.<br />
<br />
 If you want to be concerned about a stat concentrate on AC and haste. Stay evil.........</div></div><hr />

My Necro is at 202 (Cap is 255 now btw) and all the stuff it takes to get him there would waste space on my doofus SK</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zemi</div><div class="date">04-02-2002, 05:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Depends how you play your SK. I pull in almost every group I'm in.  In that setting, the &quot;lack&quot; of the mana pool means very little, it comes down to your mana regen.  Never have I died because I didn't have a big enough manapool, it's because I can't regen it enough.</div></div><hr />

If you like casting more often you need more mana itmes+int.  If you wnat better Dam need faster hard hitting weap with STR.....the faster the easier it is to get rid of pesky caster mobs whether you bash or not hehehe. I hate caster mobs especially shamans.</div></div><hr />
