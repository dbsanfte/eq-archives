<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Reddisk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The Shadowknight Epic 1.5 starts in Dulak Harbor - uneeded if you already have the epic 1.0 aka Innoruuk's Curse.<br />
	Ritald is at the dock in Dulak Harbor<br />
<br />
PART 1<br />
You say, 'Hail, Ritald'<br />
	Ritald says 'Greetings, dark one. Do you feel it? I am sure you do. Innoruuk's voice is so distant now. His voice is merely a whisper. This disturbs me greatly. How will the evil ones do their master's bidding without his dark guidance? I fear the end is almost near for true champions of darkness such as yourself. We cannot let that happen! I believe I know of a way to slow down the diminishing of our master's voice. There is a sword of great evil. It is however not of this world. I believe I can summon it to this plane of existence, but I will need several items first. Will you [take on this task]? Your future and the future of all our dark brethren depends on obtaining this sword!'<br />
<br />
You say, 'I will take on this task'<br />
<br />
	Ritald says 'Excellent. There is no time to waste. The first item I need is an ancient flamberge of hatred. I believe a trollish pirate named, Captain Varns, here in Dulak's Harbor is in possession of one. Destroy him and return this item to me. The second item is an essence of hate. You should be able to find such an essence in the Plane of Hate. The last item I need is a stormborn phylactery. You should be able to find one in the Plane of Storms. When you have all these items, hand them to me so that I may begin the summoning of the sword.'<br />
	The items you need are as follows:<br />
Ancient Flamberge of Hate - From Captain Varns in Dulak's Harbor (AOE slow, slow casting, 500DD)<br />
Essence of Hate - Overlord R' Gahbsa in the Plane of Hate<br />
Stormborn Phylatercy - Olidan in the Plane of Storms (1600 hitting red Ocean giant, rampages but slowable.)<br />
ATTENTION: THIS IS ONLY NEEDED IF YOU DO NOT ALREADY HAVE EPIC 1.0<br />
Hand the items back to Ritald and you will recieve<br />
	Innoruuk's Voice.<br />
PART 2<br />
Next head to the Plane of Knowledge.<br />
Find Sienn Kastane in the Plane of Knowledge in the evil part, in the building between the Neriak and Oggok stones. He will only speak to you if you have epic 1.0.<br />
You say, &quot;Hail, Sienn Kastane'<br />
	Sienn Kastane says 'You. You are the one I have seen in my visions.' Sienn removes a dark blade from a scabbard. I have just obtained this sword from one of my apprentices. This blade may be the key to the very existence of the Shadowknight. Are you familiar with what has [been transpiring]?<br />
You say, &quot;What has been transpiring?'<br />
	Sienn Kastane places her hands upon your forehead. A gravelly voice that is clearly not Sienn's fills your mind. 'Do you feel it? I am sure you do. Innoruuk's voice is so distant now. His voice is merely a whisper. This disturbs me greatly. How will the evil ones do their master's bidding without his dark guidance? I fear the end is almost near for the true champions of darkness such as yourself. We cannot let that happen? I believe I know of a way to slow down the diminishing of our master's voice. Tehre is a sword of great evil. It is however not of this world. I believe i can summon it to this plane of existence, but I will need several [items] first. . .' The voice ends. 'That was the voice of [Ritald], a luggald in the service of the dark lord, Innoruuk.<br />
You say, &quot;What items?'<br />
	Sienn Kastane says 'Your first task is to find a tome. The sword has told me of a tome that details its history. I do not know where this tome might be, but i suggest you talk to the Grand Librarian Maelin here in the Plane of Knowledge. He may have more information on this tome. When you find it, return it to me.'<br />
You say, &quot;Who is Ritald?'<br />
	Sienn Kastane says 'Ritald is a luggald int he service of Innoruuk. He is concerned about the future of the Shadowknight now that the gods no longer answer our prayers.'<br />
You say, &quot;Hail, Grand Librarian Maelin'<br />
You say, &quot;What tome'<br />
	Grand Librarian Maelin says 'Yes, I seem to recall having such a tome. But evil it is. I don't hand out such dangerous knowledge to just anyone. However. . . I am curious about something and perhaps you can help me. A prominent professor of biology and I have a bet as to how a certain creature from the Realm of Discord, known as a murkglider breeds. He believes they give live birth, and I believe they are egg layers. Unfortunately, I have been so busy here, that I have not been able to make arrangements to travel there and observe the creatures more. If you could travel to the Realm of Discord and [find an egg] for me, I will give you the book you seek.'<br />
You say, &quot;Where can I find an egg?'	<br />
	Grand Librarian Maelin says 'I appreciate your help with this! The creature I was supposed to study are most commonly known as murkgliders. The easiest way to describe them is that they look like large, floating octopuses. See if you can hunt down any breeding murkgliders and return an egg to me that I can study. You might want to bring some companions along, as this might be a dangerous task.'<br />
<br />
Gelatinous Murkglider Egg - drops off a &quot;Murkglider Breeder&quot; in an Omens of War zone in the Dranik Ruins that will be found in the South-West corner of your map. You get to it through two circular rooms are joined by the hallways cutting through a mountain. The location of the room you need is -730, 870. Is said to spawn level 66 babies at about 70% but you should be able to evacuate from the room and return to easily single pull her. This method is highly reccomended if this is being done with one group. The egg drops every time.<br />
Upon returning this to Grand Librarian Maelin:<br />
	Grand Librarian Maelin says 'I knew they were egg-layers! Ha, this is one gnome who hates losing a bet and thanks to you I wont! This is the tome you seek. Please bring it back to me when you are done.'<br />
He will hand you 'The Silent Gods.'<br />
Take this to Sienn Kastane and upon return recieve:<br />
	Sienn Kastane says &quot;You have done well in aquiring this tome.' Sienn opens the tome and begins to read. 'It says that a sheath must be created to protect the sword. Unfortunatly the instructions for making this sheath are a bit unclear. The only clues given to the items needed are, to gather a dark hide of a creature unmatched in its bleakness, a holy lock of hair from a fair creature unmatched in happiness, and a gem possessing the very essence of fear itself, held by a creature more fearsome. If you find these three items, combine them in a sewing kit and then hand the sheath to me. I await your return.<br />
PART 3<br />
Gloom Nightmare Hide - This drops from 'a gloom nightmare' in the Plane of Nightmare<br />
Lock of Blessed Unicorn Hair - This drops from a rolling plains steed in the Plane of Growth<br />
Eye of the Dark Gods - This drops from Amydgalan Knights and Amydgalan Warriors in the Plane of Fear<br />
Once you have all three items combine in a tailoring kit. The skill needed is now know to be between 153 and 163... The higher the better no need to risk it. Upon success you will recieve Sheath of Darktidings.<br />
Upon handing this into Sienn Kastane you will recieve:<br />
	&quot;I admit that I did not think you could accomplish this task. Perhaps you really are meant to be the sword's champion. Our work here is not done however. There are those that wish the sword to be destroyed. One of these beings is a froglok paladin named Fraga. He was last seen in the Plane of Valor. Kill him and bring me any clues as to what his plans may be.&quot;<br />
<br />
PART 4<br />
Fraga's Parchment - The only thing know about Fraga is that he is about lvl 64-65 Froglok, Paladin. He can be found in the one of the tents in the Plane of Valor near the Grave Yard. He can quad for up to 2850. Massive amout of HP's and heals himself as well. VERY IMPORTANT: Immune to snares and roots. Reccomended tactic is to get a powerful group together with a Shaman to pull with slows. Also spiky dps and hits pretty slowly. Does not summon.<br />
Upon return of the parchment to Sienn Kastane: <br />
	Sienn Kastane begins to read the parchment. A worried look plays across her face. ‘The weapon is not safe. The forces of good strongly wish to have it destroyed. To make matters worse, the sword is emanating hate that can be felt by powerful beings, both good and evil, across all planes of existence. As it stands right now, I wouldn’t be surprised if the forces of good are converging to have the sword destroyed and the forces of evil are conniving to take the sword for themselves. It is only a matter of time before they locate the sword and come for it themselves. I have been studying the tome while you were gone. The tome describes a way to [mask the sword’s presence].’<br />
<br />
You say, “Mask the sword’s presence.”<br />
<br />
	Sienn Kastane says, “In the Plane of Nightmare, there dwells a banshee known as the Wailing Sister. In her possession is a rune of great power. The sword’s hatred has awoken from a deep slumber. The rune however is only part of what will be needed to help mask’s the sword’s hatred. The rune is inactive until combined with the Wailing Sister’s blood. Recover the rune and a sample of her blood and return them to me.”<br />
PART 5<br />
Wailing Rune + Wailing Sister's Blood - Dropped from The Wailing Sister in the Plane of Nightmare. You must hail to have her start attacking. Easy enough for one group with 920 max hit, and a Cloud of Fear AE.<br />
Upon handing these items into Sienn Kastane:<br />
	Sienn Kastane purs the blood on the rune. The rune begins to glowa bright red color and a horrifying wail fills your ears. ‘The runes has been activated.’ Sienn holds the rune against the sheath you created earlier. The rune instantaneously melts into the sheath. ‘The sword is safe for now, but I think it should be moved just in case. Do not lose the sheathed sword. If you do lose it somehow, come back to me and tell me you lost it and I will attempt to make you another one. I only have enough left of the items you brought me to make you one more though. Now, take the sword to a servant of mine, named Gilina Yilzior, here in the Plane of Knowledge. She is very knowledgeable and should be able to help you further.<br />
You receive the Sheathed Innoruuk’s Voice.<br />
<br />
	Gilina Yilzior looks at you with a cold stare. ‘The time has come. I have heard the dark blade’s whispers. It wants to find a master, but before that can become a reality, a test must be passed. There are four other shadowknights who wish to become the sword’s wielder. If you are up for the challenge, then seek out Silithis Sisnta in the Timorous Deep, Gubblegrot Smashfist in the Ocean of Tears, Skurza Slicekutt in the Swamp of No Hope, and Giligattabus Igglebix in Iceclad. Return their heads to me and we shall see if the sword is satisfied with your progress.<br />
PART 6<br />
Silithis' Head - An Iksar. Unsnareable, summons, and has an ae dot, which I neglected to get the name of, and RC3 does not cure.<br />
Gubblegrot's Head - An Ogre. Unsnareable, procs a small lifetap frequently.<br />
Giligattabus's Head - A Gnome. doesn’t summon, snares easily, probably soloable. Hah, fuck gnomes.<br />
Skurza's Head - A Troll. Unsnareable, summons, and procs Deadly Lifetap. (Traks proc, 1500 LT)<br />
Upon return of the heads to Gilina Yilzior you will recieve:<br />
<br />
	Gilina Yilzior says, ‘I can sense that the sword is pleased with your progress. However there is another task it wishes you to perform. I have learned through a contact of mine, that there is to be a ceremony in Kithicor Woods. Several paladins will be converging there to try to cleanse the undead from the forest, once and for all. The blade thirsts for the blood of these paladins. Before the blade will allow you to become it’s champion, you must kill as many of these paladins as you can, and bring me three samples of their blood. Take the Sheathed Innoruuk’s Voice back and when you have three samples of paladin’s blood, hand them to me along with the Sheathed Innoruuk’s Voice so that I may perform the ceremony to sate the blade’s thirst. Go now and find my contact in Kithicor. His name is Tarnamil. Take the sword back for safe keeping.’<br />
<br />
You recieve Sheathed Innoruuk's Voice.<br />
PART 7<br />
You will find Tarnamil in Kithicor Forest, he is a green-con skeleton.<br />
You say, “Hail, Tarnamil.”<br />
<br />
	Tarnamil says, ‘The paladins are coming from the west, my lord. The come to destroy the dead that walk at night. Already, the undead generals plot their demise, but they are powerful. They approach soon. I am getting out of here.’<br />
Sample of Paladin's Blood - This will be recieved from 6 paladins that spawn to the west of you after your discussion with Tarnamil. All max hit within the 800's<br />
Upon returning the samples into Gilina Yilzior you will recieve:<br />
	Gilina Yilzior says, ‘Well done.’ Gilina takes the blood samples starts to pour them onto the blade of Innoruuk’s Voice. The blade appears to become super-heated as the blood drops trickle down its surface. A thick black smoke begins to waft from the blade. ‘The blade is now complete. Before I give the blade to you there is something else you must do. A mighty templar named, Sir Elmonious Falmont has heard of your crimes against the paladins and seeks revenge. It is important that we let none get in the way of our goals. As we speak, he is making his way from the Western Wastes in the continent of Velious to kill us. Destroy him and return his holy symbol to me.”<br />
<br />
PART 8<br />
Sir Falmont's Holy Symbol - This will be looted off of a Human Paladin from the Western Wastes zone in. To activate you must hail. He is know to quad for 2526 max, and has an AE that takes 2khp and 1k mana, also does a single target 2 sec stun. AE is every minute at -175 prismatic check, stun is every 30 seconds resistable.<br />
Upon returning the symbol to Gilina Yilzior you will recieve:<br />
Gilina Yilzior says, ‘You have permormed well. The blade is yours to wield now, champion. You may be on your way, or stay to hear about a [vision] I recently had.’<br />
YOU RECIEVE INNORUUK'S VOICE.<br />
Congradulations to Duke Krushum Gudended of the Innoruuk Server to be the first SK to complete the Shadowknight Epic 1.5<br />
To continue onto Epic 2.0 follow Gilina Yilzior's speach.<br />

SORRY FORGOT TO ADD ALL THIS INFORMATION WAS FOUND IN THE SAME FORUMS YOU WENT THROUGH TO GET TO THIS THREAD! Tyvm to all those who contributed.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Udyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Thank you very much for your collective work, im currently looking to take out the guy in hate. My problem is finding him. Never really visited hate much, have an idea or direction you could give me?<br />
<br />
BTW Gratz man</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>TinyDiabla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Gubblegrot summons too..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Amdor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Very nice map of PoHateB, Tier 1 and 2 is a mix of undead and living so you might need to clear to tier 3, not hard to do at all. I have yet to come across anything in tier 3 or 4 that sees invis. None of the named have ever been up when I was running though so not sure if they see invis or not. Aggro range in hate is fairly low now. Mobs will assist if they are near each other, but running by the aggro range is low.<br />
<br />

<br />
   I can conferm that the Mistress of Malevolence drops Essence of Hate in Tier 2. I got mine there 2 nights ago. Camped her for 4 hours then she spawned and droped it first try. Only hits for 500s, the Overlord hits for 800s so a bit easier. Bring a shaman and it is very easy. Hope this helps  :)</div></div><hr />
