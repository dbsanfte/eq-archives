<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Imothep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is anyone encountered some named mobs in  the instanced zones in don ? <br />
<br />
Not the named who are part of the mission of course, but random pop named like Pixt anhiliator in ikinz trial which have a set chance to be up when the instanced zone is generated and which can drop loots.<br />
<br />
So far i was unlucky, but maybe there is no named at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rhumba_Kween</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've yet to see any either. Although I've only done 15 or so missions to date.<br />
<br />
This has been one of my gripes about DoN. The instances seem so narrow in purpose. Adding nameds to the instances would make the easiness of them till you get to the Nest a bit easier to take. Although with as easy as they are, the loot would have to be pretty weak.<br />
<br />
The only loot dropping named from the instances that I'm aware of are from the 24+ person raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Elkar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My guild got a named on the Emoush raid on Monday.  I wasn't there but I'll try to get some details, but that was the first time we've seen.</div></div><hr />
