Folks still point to those, especially the 470-point tap, as if they balance out the DPS of mobs you'd be killing at 65, even for exp.  I'm guessing that they think that our lifetaps are insta-cast with a one second recast and cost no mana, so we can chain cast them forever when we're tanking.<br />
<br />
Next time they go to tank something, ask them to have the cleric cast Superior Healing on them every ~15 seconds.  Then, after they get their rez, ask them if a 470-point lifetap on a 10-second timer sounds so useful. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

so many ppl confuse trivial raid content with one group content, its seriously sad...Ive never even one grouped half of the things i can, just cause i dont like taking upgrades from &quot;casual players&quot; or low end raiders.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Howlitoezis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">from the thread, posted by frotty:<br />
&quot;The problem is that both the developers and lots of tanks in general don't want it, and are very passionate about it. There are entire threads dedicated to it. My point is that this thread might be best spent suggesting alternate means of increasing your tanking ability rather than beating a dead horse.<br />
<br />
My suggestion, again, of increasing the healing without increasing the DPS of lifetaps would be an example of something that would allow you to tank better. An upgraded fear of sorts to compare to the mitigation brought about by stuns is another. Especially if the fear was fixed, short duration (several seconds only) with a built in high percentage snare.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wil someone explain to this guy that lifetaps are NOT mitigation?<br />
I'm interrupted quite a bit when MTing, and a reasonable amount of reliaility of damage reduction is required to even be considered as any kind of real mitigation.<br />
On top of that, it wouldn't even count as mitigation if it WAS more reliable. You can cast taps when you are dead, and lifetap doesnt help much with unlucky RGN runs. It isn't damage reduction, its taking back some of what the mob already TOOK from you.<br />
God, the stupidity sometimes fucking amazes me. But then I remember I was just as amazed last time, and the amazement fades into a dull state of disgust.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if I like the idea of a high % snare and short duration fear spell.<br />
Seriously fucks up rogues, and a crapload of mobs in GoD are not snarable (the same dark blue mobs that eat me for fkin lunch). If our mitigation is reliant on an easily resisted or flat out undoable (snare resist mob) spell, it isn't a viable means of mitigation for us, in my opinion, but I'll leave that up to the experts to hash out.</div></div><hr />

if warriors can use the &quot;rp aspect&quot; of being an all around great tank...then we should be able to &quot;paralyze our enemies with fear&quot;  for a short amount of time to be on par with stuns.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Dkhar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I was thinking of a new line of spells. Basically cold based. Like say, Icy Needles. 1 second cast time. 30 second recast. 100 damage, 10 second duration on the affect, 500 mana. It would affect the mobs percentage to hit. Kinda like freezing your opponent, making his combat abilities slow and predictable and easily avoidable. It's not directly raising our avoidance but sort of indirectly. I'm unsure of the % that it would lower the mobs chance to hit to make an actual difference though as I am not a number cruncher. 50% ? So 10 seconds out of 30 the mob will have approximately half the chance to hit you. So with the quick cast time if you get cracked really hard one round, you can pop this spell off real fast so you can start avoiding damage in order to give the incoming heal a chance to land. 10 seconds = CH :D<br />
<br />
Probably not what the high end sk's want for a form of mitigation or a way to avoid being one rounded but hey, I think it's a cool idea.</div></div><hr />

Would this really solve anything? Do we really want to be more like Pallys in what we can tank? I'd think our goal should be something to help tank those really hard mobs. This type of solution (like pallys) will never work on hard mobs of an expansion.<br />
<br />
It seems to me like this solution would have the exact same problems that Pallys have now. And that being that a Warrior can always do bigger and better stuff, relegating the Paladin to lower level content. And even with this, we still would not have rez, which is what makes Pallys so wanted on GoD adventures. That second rezzer, makes the group so much more surviveable.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Ibring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Hi All,<br />
<br />
I have only very recently started a SK and, so far, I think he is great (I have just reached lvl 26).<br />
<br />
I do not know much about the SK high lvl problems but I have playing the game for close to 2 years now (my main is a mage, another class that is being left behind a little in the recent expansion).<br />
<br />
There is 1 thing, however, which puzzels me: SKs don't seem to have enough selfish abilities, and don't appear to be sufficiently evil.<br />
<br />
How about resolving the mitigation issue with a group life tap? I.e. The SK deals 70 dmage per tick to each other group member, and receives back 350 hp per tick?<br />
<br />
Not very popular with your group mates, perhaps, but definitely in line with the class flavour :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Mortifera Inferi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">It's a fun suggestion, however one of the main issue is scalability.<br />
<br />
The 350 HP per tick is surely a great thing against certain mobs of a certain level. However, as mob power grows, your 350 does not, whereas stuns stop the mob from attacking no matter how much damage they do. :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Ibring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Hmmm, point taken.<br />
<br />
There could be another solution on the same lines, however.<br />
<br />
How about a reverse shielding effect? Say we take 30% of all the damage taken and distribute it evenly to all the people in a raid....:D <br />
<br />
That would be similar to having a mini defensive, would scale up, and would satisfy my flavour for being evil.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Blackeagle Dwimmerlaik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">you know, something like a short duration 'over-slow' would be kind of cool, instead of a stun.  it would stack with regular slows and slow maybe 10% ... have something like a 4 tick duration.. would help make up some of the tanking gap, as well as giving us a useful raid role to call our own, without stepping on many toes<br />
<br />
a fear2 sort of spell would be nice too, and frankly it seems like the normal 'stun classes' are all for us getting it, but I don't know how likely it is for us to get a stun sort of spell</div></div><hr />

I dont see why this would be a problem.  Necros get screaming terror as an upgrade to fear so why dont we?  Screaming Terror stuns and has the chance of a memory wipe...I dont know why this hasnt been demanded earlier.</div></div><hr />

I thought about that, but with SOE so adamently stating that shammys will never get a slow beyond 75% and the fact that it's fairly baseless in anything our class has/had, I highly doubt it'd ever be implimented.  Even if it were, it's not really the best answer.  It'd give us something to do on raids, but we'd be relagated to slowers rather than tanks - we could slow other people's mobs just as well as our own, even if it had a big hatemod (thx FD).  It would have to be able to bypass mitigation or it'd be fairly useless, and I'm not even sure that that's able to be coded.  <br />

<br />
Call me jaded, but I don't see us getting both, and any discussion about something that does not tackle our real problem seems like a bad idea... And if they give us something to make us better against trash (which we dont really need, imo), why would they give us something to make us better against challenging content?

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Flanders</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">Screaming terror doesn't mitigate any incoming damage because it's a mez not a stun. The second you land it someone else broke it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thats a good point, I forgot it was a mez...its been a while since I played my necro.  But asside from that, I can see benefit from having it or a beafed up version of it.  As it stands the spell is an 18 second fixed duration mez with a 1% chance of mem blur.  If they upped that to a 24-36 second fixed duration with say a 20-30% chance for mem blur that could help dramatically and in many situations.  Not to mention that would add a uniqueness to our class and fit right in to our persona as SKs(After all we are Dread Lords).<br />
<br />
Having a spell like that could make it alot easier to FD split casters and all other types of crowd control, which would considerably up our desirability in raids. <br />

Idea #2:  Improved Self Rune:<br />
 <br />
A rune that would absorb 100% of melee damage for two ticks and would also have a recast time of 45 seconds:<br />
 <br />
Pros:  would scale with mob dps.  No mobs running wild.  Would work against multple mobs beating on one Shadow Knight.<br />
 <br />
Cons:  No Shadow Knight stacking.  More complex to code.   <br />
<br />
The only problem with what he proposed is it would have to be a recourse effect so that mobs could be made immune to it, and you'd still have the problem with people using it on HEB's.  If you can find a workaround to that, I'm all for it, but if you can't, it'd be very overpowered for many situations.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">Originally posted by Slein Jinn <br />
Honestly, a derivitive of fear could be used to parallel pally stuns if implimented properly. I've pondered it a bit recently and havn't really decided how to make it work short of using something to the effect of the fear2 line used by fearing mobs in dungeons, but I'm not convinced it couldn't be done eitiher. I doubt SK's will get a stun in the same sense as pallys do, but something needs to be done to address the glaring inequality between the knight classes.<br />
<br />
Possibilities include:<br />
<br />
Fear2 line spell - effectively equivilant to stunning the target. Would be ideal.<br />
<br />
If it's possible to make a spell overwrite a mob's immunity, it would be simple enough to add a high percentage snare and keep the duration short; pally stuns would still be slightly better in that they wouldn't fuck with rogues and effect mob positioning, but the SK spell would still do the job mitigation wise. Pally stuns should be slightly better than what SK's get to compensate anyway to account for Aura of Pain and it's upgrade.<br />
<br />
If the above is not possible, and fear can be coded in partial ticks, a super-short duration fear could possibly work too. This would be a last resort if the above is not possible and if SOE would refuse to impliment a fear2 type spell, as its drawbacks would be excessively significant with the high number of unsnarable mobs found today.<br />
<br />
A spin-stun type spell, like Whorl 'till you Hurl and Spin the Bottle would work too.  <br />
<br />
Any ideas that don't make us undesireable for ceratiin group set ups?</div></div><hr />

<br />
A short duration fear with a high-percentage snare wouldn't be as nice as stun/fear2, but it would be servicable if there's a way to bypass snare immunity.  You're not going to be using it on raid named either way - for offtanking and single groups, it's usable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the details and implementation could be in any number of forms, but the idea is a debuff that makes a significant and noticable difference in the damage output of a mob, and it could perhaps double as an effective aggro spell</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u86"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p86">The only problem with debuffs (although I think they would hti the target perfectly in groups) is we would probally be made to cast them on all mobs in camp in raids while Warriors/Paladins tanked the mobs since we would be to busy to slow everything while tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u87"><b>Dakkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p87">A debuff wouldn't be remotely as effective as paly stuns.  Here's a typical scenario in an efficient raiding guild:<br />
<br />
- Puller pulls some blue con trash mobs (usually stunnable).<br />
<br />
- MA1 paly targets one and MA2 paly targets the second.<br />
<br />
- They cast 4 second stun (may or may not land) followed by a low level stun on way in.<br />
<br />
- Mobs arrive in camp tashed malod and malosini'd, following which MAs frequently land 10 second stuns which last till mobs nearly dead.<br />
<br />
- 4 or 5 palys leap on adds and aggro with taunt and very fast casting non-damage stuns till chanters lock them down.  If chanter calls a mob unmezzable, they switch to high level stuns and ghetto mez it themselves.<br />
<br />
If the mobs are level 66+ then MAs are usually warriors because they have defensive and stonewall for emergencies.<br />
<br />
Where, in any of this, would a well-run guild consider using an SK who can debuff 2 or 300 ATK from the mob as a tank?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u88"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p88">A debuff is nice, but it's more of a support cast role, not the role of a tank</div></div><hr />

Shamans already slow for 75% (and slows dont stack), and assuming raid or even single group you are probably already hasted with Vallons so you are capped at 100%.<br />
