<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Brahms</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This isn't a bug with SK's as much as with the game, or maybe I just can't figure it out.  I fell in the water near the nexus port in SH and I couldn't get out.  I trained my swimming, but had to drown myself and drag my corpse out later.  WTF?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Darko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Swim directly at the ledge while looking straight up and jump.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bick is Bad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I had the same problem when I used to pk in SH a lot, basically it was because my swimming skill sucked so I couldnt build up enough momentum to jump back on to land. Just swim into a wall and go AFK for an hour or so. When you get back your swimming skill should be high enough that you can get out.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Anyone ever tried Shadow Stepping out of the water?<br />
<br />
As a Troll who has fallen off the boat in TD more times than I care to count, I've got pretty high swimming skill and a natural height advantage, so I've never had much problem getting out of the water.   It seems like halflings and gnomes in particular fall in and can't get out most often though.  Bobbing corpse will also help you get out, or Lev, but you'll have to have the caster get into the water with you in order for it to hit you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hatre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">with SH in specific the centre platform in the water there ie the one you appear on when you zone in from nexus, is slightly lower than any other edge that you can try to get out of the water from making that the easiest point to get out.  But with almost 200 swim skill now i can leap out of the water there first try every try regardless of whether i use that platform or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brahms</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I hold my nose when I jump into the water.  Also I bought one of those nose grapplers, that keeps the water from entering my nose.  The water was a little warm too.  I think I saw a troll in there for awhile.  Thanks for the tips.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Liabach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">shadowstep wont work, it takes you 'into' the water.  its mildly random, but in general you port to a lower elevation spot that where you left from, and water tends to be lowest elevation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Amphitryon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Is this post for real? YOu really drowned in the pool in SH?<br />
<br />
<br />
hahahahah<br />
<br />
&lt;ahem&gt;<br />

hahahahahahaha<br />
<br />
sorry<br />
<br />
guess the lifeguard was off duty that day..didnt yer  mom teach you not to eat right before going swimming?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>SweetMeef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If you're walking toward the Nex portal from the middle, if you go straight and right- that corner (that goes on to the bridge) is the one you can get out at.  Don't know which direction it is but that was the only place i could get out w/ low swim skill.<br />
<br />
But then of course i put autorun on and taped down the right arrow and swam in a circle one day till my swimming skill was 200... hooray.</div></div><hr />
