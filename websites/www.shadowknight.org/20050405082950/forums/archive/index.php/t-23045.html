<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Howlitoezis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After I replace my current haste belt (runed bolster belt) with ldon helm and haste aug, I need a decent waist item.<br />
1 or 2 groups 60-65 would be what I could get together for it. Would prefer to camp something rather than buy. Decent AC and HP is what I'm looking for. No VT, EP or Time flag required stuff please.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>pogge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Belt of Virility (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=8951) <br />
<br />
You can one group that easy.<br />
You wont find a better one groupable pre-elemental belt than that. You need the stat boosts too from the looks of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xanathol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I was gonna post the same thing as Pogge, but after looking at your magelo, if everyone else in your group is geared about the same, I don't think you can 1-2 group Grieg, esp if you have to tank him. May want to try taking your band of freinds to AC and get the Wormhusk Harness (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=11546). He's a 7 day spawn, perma-rooted, and not too bad if you debuff before engage, keep him debuffed, and have enough healing. He's a lil tougher than Grieg in hits, esp if unslowed, but less HP iirc and no AE. Disease slow btw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>pogge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">ah good point I didnt see his magelo .. yeah the AEs will be hard to resist at ur lvl and resists.  if u get a high lvl pally u can have him chain stun the fucker. that helps alot.<br />
<br />
another option is just go get a Kylong Darkmail Girdle (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=21713) <br />
from veksar .. that woudl be a realy easy kill for a group of 3ish. Not same calibur as the others, but 15ac is decent for such an easy belt to get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Wormhusk harnass is good if you can get it.  If not, or as a holdover in the mean time, just a Kylong Darkmail Girdle would be a decent, cheap filler.  Costs a few K in the bazaar, or you can get one in Veskar.  LDoN belt wouldn't be a bad option either, but you've got more important places to spend your points.</div></div><hr />

Currently working on flawless steel mask and loyalists shield as well. Working towards, as I said, EF helm, also EF legs and tak BP.<br />
<br />
/edit<br />
Never mind, found a short term replacement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">or France (the only country ever to lose to Italy twice)<br />

OK, you definately ripped that from me.  :mad:  :mad:  :mad: <br />
<br />
I had something in my AIM profile about that for months...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>BetrayerofHope</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Not to disable your discussion of Vietnam, but there is also the Taelosian Runed Girdle as a belt upgrade; easy enough to get. Drops in sewers exp version (or thats where I got mine, anyways) and since I am extremely gimped, shouldnt pose any problems; got mine in about an hour of clearing there.<br />
 Bah, just saw where Howl already got an upgrade : P<br />
<br />
 Ashamael 66 Dreadlord? Lord? fuck who knows...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Nazak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I definitely recall a decent belt dropping in the sewers.<br />
<br />
Fwiw, I would strongly consider tak or ef pants before the tak bp.  I thing it would be a much bigger upgrade.  My tak pants are still holding up pretty well.  That said, I'm thinking that there was a decent set of pants fairly early in GoD, maybe in Riwwi, from a mini named, but I'm not totally sure.<br />
<br />
I'm thinking you should be able to do some ldon hards as well.  In ruj, there's gloves, an earring, and a belt that would be acceptable upgrades for you, if I recall right.  In mistmore there are boots and a ring, I think.  In everfrost, there is a bracer.<br />
<br />
Edit:  Oh yeah, the shield I'm using, while not the greatest, looks kinda cool and drops in the sewers.  And if you don't mind some long questing, the reward for the riwwi event gets decent after a few rounds.  Depending on how far your group can get, it will be a decent belt/neck.</div></div><hr />

um you coudl get the Belt of Virility with that raid group. have the pally stun the fux outa it u will be aight.<br />
<br />
you have a pretty well rounded full 65 group there. if thier gear is halfwhay not shitty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Howlitoezis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Good suggestions so far.<br />
Thanks for the help.<br />
<br />
I think what my short term goals are are these, lemme know what you think:<br />
<br />
first off, gonna stop dicking around and just go get 65.<br />
<br />
Head:<br />
EF helmet<br />
31% haste aug<br />
<br />
Arms:<br />
Guildy making me magnetic or<br />
The 442 pt ldon arms<br />
<br />
Face:<br />
flawless steel mask from SG<br />
<br />
Back:<br />
Loyalists<br />
<br />
Legs:<br />
EF legs<br />
<br />
Belt:<br />
I'm kinda liking the look of that wormhusk belt, could take a long time to get it though.<br />
<br />
Hands:<br />
Not sure on this one, maybe magnetic as well?<br />
<br />
Going to look into that shield.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Howlitoezis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">OK, I've upgraded arms, neck, legs and changed belts (for now). Think its ok to go for EF helm and haste aug now, then higher ac belt, or go for tak BP first?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Apokx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Magnetic helm.Then use your ldon points to save for an aug or Tak bp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Howlitoezis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">But haste aug only fits aug 3 on head, waist, back or range.<br />
If the only ldon piece I have is chest, I can't use ldon haste aug.<br />
So wouldnt EF helm be most cost efficient?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I wouldn't get an EF helm - you're going to end up upgrading it later, and unlike DKP, it's not bad policy to horde LDoN points for the biggest upgrades.  If you need haste, take one of the ideas from ealier in the thread or camp the type7 haste aug, from Ferubi I believe.  At least hold out for a tak helm, but tak BP would be a better use of the points ATM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Howlitoezis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">that slot 7 haste aug looks like a bitch and a half to get without commiting a couple groupa of peoples time for an entire day.<br />
Guess ill go for tak BP and stick with soulscream until I can get a griegs group going.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Your faction standing with kromrif could not possibly get any worse&quot;<br />
&quot;Your faction standing with kromzek could not possibly get any worse&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Ephyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">you actually need tormax faction not kromirf or kromzek for turn in....<br />
<br />
but faction farming is not that hard to do...you can do it by killing the royal gurads around the dain...give direct +_ tormax hits...which can be done easily pet pulling....<br />
<br />
or you can afk pet farm faction down in the miners caves in GD...that will raise both kromrif and kromxek faction....take you a couple of nights....set up pet....go to bed ....wake up...oh..my faction has gotten better...etc<br />
<br />
then will need to turn in a bunch of coldain heads to captain bvellos...to raise actual tormax faction...whic handily drop from the same coldain miners....<br />
<br />
while you are there...if you want to do it non-afk...the expedition miners give a bit of exp for aa even at lvls 65...about 1% aa xp solo per kill<br />
<br />
all of the dorfs in cave are on a 10 min respawn....so that is pretty fast...<br />
<br />
i did this for belt of giant slaying....auged it with a 10 ac aug from MMC...and voila...30 ac betl, 100 h 100 mana, 2 regen 10 attack and some stats<br />
<br />
-Ephyr<br />
<br />
PS edit...sorry nm...youd want to have the lvl 64 pet to do this afk...</div></div><hr />
