<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>smoses799</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Camping this drop is so wreached that its is slowly driving me mad</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rezrril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">yes, yes it is. and the best part? thats just the 1.0 catch up. I was up in Hate at 4 in the morning the night i got it, was gonna go to bed after the next spawn, and whaddaya know, the Mistress was right there staring me in the face. After i changed pants, we took her down no sweat. I spent about 3 weeks in this camp, good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Draegloth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Wow... three weeks is harsh.<br />
<br />
I spent about 4-5 hours there running between mistress and overlord... Never saw the mistress pop but the overlord sure did.  Quad boxing 63 (at the time) SK, 68 cleric, 67 wiz, 66 chanter, fight was no problem.  Dropped the essence first try for me.<br />
<br />
Of course, I also got the PoG drop in about 20 mins and the PoFear drop in about 15.. so it's possible I'm just a lucky bastard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>smoses799</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">well, i started a routine on watching a movie while i camped them.. on the second move Mistress poped and dropped the piece<br />
<br />
guess i got lucky</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Meowbot Killdozer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I camped her solo, was really easy to keep the house clear and kind of fun also - took me 11 hours of straight camping.<br />
<br />
I did this farm the same day I did Murkglider, I was not a very happy person after all was said and done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Saruton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Sounds like someone clearly didnt had to camp decrepit hide the hard way or the golems...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Do -not- whine about any camp you have to do for this epic. <br />
<br />
As the poster above mentioned. You cannot begin to understand the hell SK's went through getting epic 1.0 during kunark - velious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Peztilence Forever</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Anyone have any Details on the mob please.<br />
<br />
 And there are 2 mobs that drop the item right?<br />
<br />
<br />
 Much appreciated once again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sarrasis Darkmist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm seriously getting tired of people asking the same questions over and over when EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE FUCKING QUEST IS IN THIS FORUM.  GOD DAMN, USE SEARCH AND READ FFS!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If you haven't done &quot;122 ashenbone drakes, no drop yet, and counting&quot; for epic 1.0, you do not deserve to complain about camping something for under a week for epic 1.5. :)<br />
<br />
Epic 1.0 was the LONG camp epic.<br />
