<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raztick</div><div class="date">04-23-2002, 05:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a friend who is switching servers to play on Druzzil Ro. Rather than pay the money to get her naked 51 pally switched we decided to PL her. She is playing a SK and is already 20 in the blink of an eye.<br />
<br />
Anyway the question is, what kind of equipment is good but not impossible to get. The regulars fighting for her stuff are 50 ranger, 40 ranger, 39 SK...with 50 war and 50 monk sometimes. I have some friends in uber guilds, but I can probably only bug them for one or two peices. Anyway this is what she has ATM. BTW she wants above rygorr, or basically around what her 51 pally had.<br />

Ear 1: CC Earring<br />
Ear 2: CC Earring<br />
Neck: Torins Choker Ac4Dex3Agi3<br />
Head: Turtle Shell Helm<br />
Arms: Bone Armplate Ac5 str5 dex-4<br />
Hand: Dark Mail Gauntlets<br />
Bracer 1: nothing<br />
Bracer 2: nothing<br />
Finger 1: Jagged Band<br />
Finger 2: Jagged Band<br />
SHoulders: Drovlarg Mantle<br />
Chest: Netherbian Chiten<br />
Cloak Fireclaw AC8 str5 fr+10<br />
Waist: Black Lace sash<br />
Feet: Flayed Skin Boots<br />
Weapon: BABS<br />
<br />
We can get her rygorr for all the spots needed, but wanted to try and get better gear first. Sorry I am don't know much about SK stuff but I am ranger, and plate mail (except my tolans helm) is a pipe dream so I always ignore the stuff :) I would appreciate any help.<br />

Sentient armor/Darkforge should work.</div></div><hr />

Easier still just go down into icewell and kill the dwarves there for armor.  Maybe pick up an argent protector and MOSS and maybe a bladestopper and that should do it for quite a while.</div></div><hr />

<br />
sentient armor that drop from suits of sentient armor in WL and crustacean shell armor that drop off the othmir in CS are good as well, and both are better than ry'gorr.<br />
<br />
darkforge, the temple of sol ro quested armor is good also but time consuming to quest.</div></div><hr />
