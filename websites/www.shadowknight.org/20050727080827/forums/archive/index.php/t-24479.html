<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hehe, EQ2 forums here aren't as active as EQ1 is cuz of EQ2players.com forums in existence and more activity over there. Lot of old school SKs for EQ1 didn't want to use EQ1 SOE forums cuz it wasn't that good before and full of flames then it got disabled for long time and private SK forums grew over time. EQ2 invited lot of new players and most of them still didn't know about this site at all; therefore, little activities over here other than old school Sks who plays EQ2 SKs usually ended up posting some stuff over here heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Witchfinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">There's hardly any activity from the &quot;old skool&quot; though either!<br />
<br />
The patch was nice, I've been slaying with my Shiny Brass Halberd.  I managed to take on three large groups of green Ancient Rumbleroots last night.  Simultaneously!  I was mightily impressed.  I think SKs/tanks got some stealth boosts or something.<br />
<br />
Astaroth, your equipment looks grand.  I'm still needing to kill the Creator and that fella in Cauldron Hollow before I can progress Ghoulbane to the final stage.  D'you reckon the reward is worth the effort?</div></div><hr />

Yah GB is pretty good.  I just replaced it last night with an Ebon Flamberge that I plan on replaciing with an Icen Guard Langseax (sp?) pretty soon here.  So I was able to get use out of it for about 6 levels or so.  Unfortunatly I am outta cash at the moment, I let a female friend of mine decorate my appartment, I told her to use about 40g but needless to say I am down a plat :P.  On top of all that they introduced new housing in EFP so I had to pickup and move from WFP to EFP which cost a nice sum.  Oh well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>vansteel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">This forum is dead because eq2 is dying. People are leaving it because past level 20, the game stinks. Why do you think Sony is advertising on Gamespy now and spaming emails for &quot;let a friend try it for free&quot;?  Quit playing,  go out, and do something for real. Believe me , it's worth it. Since I've quit playing I've started racing offroad dirtbikes again, learned to play the guitar, and have started learning Spanish. Instead of crafting a make-believe item for a make-believe character for make-believe money, go out and learn to craft something FOR REAL. Get off your fat ass and get outside!!!!!!!!! :)  :)</div></div><hr />

Says the man who quit EQ2 and yet still trolls on EQ2 forums... /boggle<br />
<br />
As for doing something else, you do realize this is a game right?  You do realize it does not have to consume's ones life to play it?  Maybe you have OCD or something if EQ2 kept you from doing all the things you list there.  I can easily manage to play EQ2 as well as goto work, spend time with my GF, and partake in other various and sundry activities.  I guess your assuption that someone who plays EQ2 (probably based on your personal experience) shuts down the rest of the aspects of his life, seems comical to me.  <br />
<br />
The fact that you still read EQ2 forums since you quit the game and &quot;found jesus&quot; and try to lead other &quot;sinners&quot; to the &quot;path of richiousness&quot; just smacks of EQ2 still being a bigger part of your life than it should be and than you would like to admit.<br />
<br />
This psychological evalution brought to you by the letters A, I and D and the number 42.<br />
<br />
P.S. When you read this and become enraged and have an urge to flame me, go practice some spanish instead.  I wont be reading your replies, because I dont care.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I chuckled when Van said EQ2 is dying. :) It totally contridicates with the total subscription base been growing nicely. Also, EQ2 surely is ALOT better now than 6 months ago. I can't believe how much EQ2 improved lately in short time frame.. EQ1 didn't improve that fast in 6 months during its launch..<br />
<br />
Also, higher end content is starting to be more and more interesting than before. ;) Tradeskills are doing pretty good than 6 months ago as well. List goes on..  Of course, SK class itself still have plenty of improvement. ;) I'm 41 and I think SK is doing pretty good even with bugs and restrictions..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Lucard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I have to agree with Nocifer, the game has done nothing but gotten better.  Nothing right now could lead me back to EQ1.  I am simply having too much fun with EQ2.  Overall though the majority of the SK's post on the official Sony forums now but the overall majority of whiners and crybabies still runs rampant.  I mostly only read and post in the more mainstream forum sections as it is.  Only recently have I begun posting some in their SK forums.</div></div><hr />

The official forums are useful because that's where you're most likely to get &quot;official&quot; answers to questions.  I post there and I've been maintaining the current list of Shadowknight issues.  Hopefully it's going some way towards getting some of our bugged abilities fixed.</div></div><hr />
