<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kahel Everhate</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok bear with me, we all love the greenmist, those of us that have it  and there are still many striving to get one. I was lucky enough to get mine a about 18 months ago. To this day i would love to see it get an upgrade. <br />
<br />
**DISCLAIMER**<br />
this is goina be a long drone, if you have no interest in the quest RUN AWAY!! :D <br />
<br />
**END A' WARNIN**<br />
<br />
Ok my idea has always been that SoE could make a very reasonable upgrade to our old and wonderful Greenmist to make it better suited for the sk class.<br />
<br />
1) I would love to see it turn into a 2hs, more powerful weapons generally require both hands to control in rl. I mean we are talking about a weapon that banished the Shissar and freed the Iksar race. I would like to think the Greenmist in existance now is the weakened state of what the fabled blade really was.<br />
<br />
I would say for a final up grade.. Make her a 2 hander, up the stats to be around the level of the Sword of Ssra.. after all this blade put the Emperor outta business ;). Keep the bane damage as is as well as the proc. Our class benefits from the use of two handers over that of 1 handers in much of the higher end game. That should be taken advantage of. <br />
<br />
2) We all know that at lvl 65 the Greenmist can be soloed in a matter of a week . I personally soloed all the blades at 49 with occasional help from one or two friends. By lvl 51 i had my Greenmist. The only help really needed were the final boss mobs. Of course the IC requires multiple killings of  mobs that aren't exactly pushovers. So I say make it fair, Include some good old hi lvl raid mobs for the final form of this quest. <br />
<br />
I would suggest look to some part in Veeshans Peak. Namely Phara Dar. Use his drop of Sword of Rile as one of the necessary components for a final combine/ turn-in. There is an easy way to tie this into the story line.<br />
<br />
Everquest has always had a love of consperacies in its quests. The Dain rings.. the Giants conspire with the Rygorr and Coldains to take over thurg, you have to expose this conspiracy. The IC, there is the whole prophecy of a blade that will balance out good by providing the equal answer of evil. I say tie in another conspiracy.<br />
<br />
You have the shissar and the ring of scale. Looking at the loot tables for many of the Ancient dragons in Veeshans Peak  we see a bunch of Shissar weapons and equipment. Is it not reasonable to think that the Shissar and  the Ring of Sale once coexisted with trade and knowledge between both empires? The Iksar are  natural enemies to the Ring of Scale as it is, why not put an in depth hate between these two races? Rile (wielder of Greenmist) over threw the Shissar empire and brought forth a new age. Lets say the Ring of Scale , seeing that its allies or even just trading partners the shissar have been ousted by their own slaves.. Dragons are naturally aloof believing their kind is superior, from lore the same can be said of the shissar. The dragons as we know made war with the Iksar for ages and eventually Rile did die. A great way to get the last blade quested is to base it on vengeance. The Iksar race after all was created by the God of Fear, and Shadow Knights are well known to hold grudges.<br />
<br />
Take a quest through some of the ancient cities, maybe some of the new zones, ie Veksar.  Travel to Veeshans Peak , kill Phara Dar, grab Riles &quot;other&quot; sword. Toss in a head as loot for Phara Dar... Now that you have killed the leader of the Ring of Scale and secured Riles Sword finish the job that Rile would have. Make the player go to Luclin. Put a head on Ssra's loot table, kill him loot the head. Now lets say end it by resurrecting Rile by some means. Turn in both heads, Greenmist, and the 2hander Sword of Rile for the new Greenmist , unlocked in its full glory and evil. <br />
<br />
**end of idea for now**<br />
<br />
I really think this is feasible and can easily be incorporated into the game. It has everything it needs. Hi level raid required mobs to kill.. mini quests to get to the two main mobs (keys), and a sub quest to somehow call forth Riles Spirit.<br />
<br />
I know the Dev time looks through these posts for ideas, and I would really like to see some constructive ideas on anything else that could be included to make this a very worth while and rewarding quest.<br />
<br />
This is how i would Invision the final step for Greenmist<br />
<br />
Greenmist, Curse of Rile<br />
LORE MAGIC ITEM NO DROP<br />
PRIMARY<br />
2HS Dmg 45 dly 37<br />
Poisen Dmg:3<br />
Bane Dmg: Shissar +6<br />
AC+35 STR+15 AGI+15 DEX+15 INT+25<br />
Disease R+20 Magic R+35 Poisen R+15<br />
HP 150 Mana 150<br />
Effect: Greenmist (Combat)<br />
Req lvl 60 Rec lvl 65<br />
wt 7.0 size LARGE<br />
SK<br />
ALL<br />
<br />
Add a Partile effect, maybe similar to the flames on the pally epic, except with a sickly green tint, or a soft green mist hazing and moving across the blade.<br />
<br />
Make the sword larger and update the graphic on it, make it look more elegant, yet synister.<br />
<br />
This is a very very reasonable idea, it would be fun, and rewarding at the same time, the weapon would be on par with Sword of Ssra opening up that weapon to other classes while giving a great alternative to the sk's. Please add some thougths and lets see if we can get the Dev's to notice us ;)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kahel Everhate</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">lol ok , 63 views and not one response :rolleyes:  work with me peeps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Saruton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">We are talking about a Kunark Weapon dont we ? Like 6 Expansions ago ?<br />
<br />
At least you still have dreams.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vezax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">For what content you put up to farm for, the weapon quality is way too good.  For a weapon that good, screw veeshan peak, make it at least involve the shissar.  Make some of the pieces drop in some &quot;easier&quot; zones like veksar or seb.  Then make some piece drop off in say the grey.  Let the final piece drop off a raid quality in ssra.  I would chose either xtc or emp.  xtc (tsomething the creator btw) from what I understand created the void in the grey.  Since he seems to be the type to have mystical random researchy type artifacts have it on him.  If you made it drop  off emp you can say when they were defeated, it took a powerful fragment of the true greenmist with him to lucilin.  <br />
<br />
But getting a 45 (3)/37 weapon farming things like vesshans peak?  get real.  For a weapon of that quality (IE on par w/ emp sword/golden rod) you should have to kill things worthy of it.<br />
<br />
Also the lore behind the khuriks and GM seem to make the sword a 1her.  Make it more of a 25 ( 2 poison)/ 20 weapon with some sort of GM type proc and I think it would be fairly balanced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kahel Everhate</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Great ideas, ;) I did mention the use of smaller zones as veksar to help build up the plot of the quest.<br />
<br />
I also said Veeshan's peak is only a part of it, saying uses Sword of rile as well as having a head drop from Phara Dar. I like the idea of ting in the creater and a few zones.<br />
<br />
Perhaps leave Sword of Rile as a part of the final combine / turn in . Use the Head as a trigger for another mob in the quest, somebody to deal with the whole relation between the Ring of Scale  and Shissar<br />
<br />
I also mentioned that i would have the Emperor himself be one of the final mobs. Make a head that drops off him as another part of the final turn in/ combine.<br />
<br />
You figure you need to farm for the key for the emperor, need to get the force big enough to get to Phara Dar and the Emperor and take them.  Nothing trivial about either mobs. <br />
<br />
I feel considerign the fact you are going to be killing the Emperor plus going through much extra effort i believe merits a weapon with that stats i suggested. After all why go through the effort when you can just kill the Emperor and hope for a Sword of Ssra. See where I am going?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vezax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah I see, maybe XTC is a better choice, cause hes a lot easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>MasterVicker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Great Ideas, I love my GM and use it out of pride mostly.  Any kind of upgrade to it would be a good thing.<br />
<br />
It does not matter if its old content.  Its still a major part of the storyline that makes up the game.  Why not continue the storyline through quests.<br />
<br />
Vicker</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kizzestra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">How bout you just get a new and better weapon instead of rehashing 5 expansion old material?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I think it would be cool to see a extension to greenmist hehe<br />
would be nice to see a quest bit to make it better drop off the emperor...but even then what you have setup is no where near as good as the Sword of Ssra...<br />
<br />
Kizzestra some people like the storyline of the game and would like to see it continued. <br />
<br />
Vezax yeah xtc is a better choice but theres no way in hell id waste DKP on a quest item for a sword like that when i have better...it would have to be something smaller. Rhagg/Arch Lich is really easy and could prolly be done on an un-official raid.  But then again ive done xtc on an unofficial raid with 20 peeps (10 of which were 2box casters and preists) cause he popped at 6am for some insane reason (WRU HK'S!!!!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kahel Everhate</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm just being realistic on the stats i show, its on par with the ssra, considering both use limited bane dmg, and the elemental dmg isn't too bad. The thing is you have to realize if SoE were to implement an addition like this they would probably make a weaker blade, what i put was what I felt would be a realistic upgrade and a fair enough quest result for the quest.<br />

Kahel Dawnshadow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">yeah i agree id expect, at best, something like this<br />
<br />
Greenmist, Curse of Rile<br />
LORE MAGIC ITEM NO DROP<br />
PRIMARY<br />
2HS Dmg 40 dly 38<br />
Bane Dmg: Shissar +6<br />
STA + 10 STR+10 AGI+5 INT+10<br />
HP +100 Mana +75<br />
Disease R +10 Magic R +20 Poison R +10<br />
Effect: Greenmist (Combat)<br />
Rec lvl 56<br />
wt 7.0 size LARGE<br />
SK<br />
ALL<br />
<br />
Thats almost Blindfoe with bane dmg...But then again look at some of the elemental end quests (manuals, talismans) i dont think it would be even that good of a ratio, but you can always dream :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kahel Everhate</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">heh yes i do love to dream, but you never know.. there are after all a ton of undiscovered quests out there. We already know there are weapon skins that were implimented that we haven't seen, anyone that has hunted in katta and given their lil boner a gaurd shield i am sure has seen that lil sword that pops on their pet in its place. There are a bunch of broken quests, but there are undiscovered ones as well, no one here can tell me you know the quests have all been solved or found broken. Also the Dev teams seem to surf these boards for ideas, consider this a lil suggestion i am tossing out there for them. I would honestly love to see some of the old quests evolve. I'm not sure if the IC could evolve, but the greenmist still has a ton of potential with Luclin being out there and new dungeons in kunark. My 2 cents, and if nothing else what hurt does it do to brain storm ;) the dev's may not take notice, but then again as you said.. &quot;you can always dream&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ruuti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I like the idea  of taking quest items,  things that we have worked our asses off for before,  and making them more powerful.  Sure you can always find a bigger badder sword out there.  But some people appreciate the hard work and questing that goes into accomplishing a tough quest like Greenmist.  I know that no one in this game actually follows the concept of roleplay and fantasy,  and it has degenerated to a system of numbers with who can get the most outlandish rare graphic,  but if someone were to put themselves back in a roleplay frame of mind,  the greenmist would be the type of weapon that would be handed down from Generation to generation.  EQ now is made up of those who only have to add,  GEE DOOD WHY YOU REHASHING STUFF FROM LIKE 5 EXPANSIONS AGO?<br />
<br />
<br />
I say more power too ya Kahel,  would like to see more upgrading of quest swords,  offering us the option to see our hard work endure instead of just get banked or destroyed.  Remeber when Darkforge WAS the SK armor.  Bet some people still have that suit that they sat in freaking Cazic for HOURS for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kahel Everhate</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I hear you Ruut, many of the Gravelords out there are from within the last year, i know this for a fact because some of you lvl 65's posting here were lvl 40's when i left the states 8 mo ago ;) these days with the gear there is and the ease of getting it , it does not take long to become  &quot;uber&quot; by todays standards. Does anyone here remember when kunark first came out, how Fine Plate was considered uber, uberer still if it were dyed ;). Kahel is 62 and the only reason that is ...<br />
<br />
1) I was among the first to be a heavy eq tunnel rat, i lived in that hole for weeks on end instead of leveling<br />
<br />
2) I quested more.. As an sk i took advantage of how self reliant our class can be. Most of the gear i got came out when velious showed up.<br />
<br />
3) I'm out in this giant kitty litter box :-P<br />
<br />
As it is i have no guild now , so my 10th ring and 8th shawl are on hold I'm looking to get 65 , get my Duke, plus some more aa then from there i have to find a suitable guild that can use my out of date knowledge on quests, raids and tradeskills.<br />
<br />
Some people love the grind of pulling 8 hours straight , lol i been there and done that back in my 40's and 50's in DL 2 yrs ago. I don't enjoy that. I would rather be farming dain rings for guild mates, or working on fletching, smithing, jewel crafting and pottery to get better gear for myself and guild mates. I love roleplaying and i love the questing. Greenmist was one of the most indepth quests i have completed, i would love another chapter added to it.<br />
<br />
I don't have atm the resources of a guild to go hunt zones for uber armor, and i rather use my plat on tradeskills. Heck I'm 62 using my PoFear Arms still ;). I pride myself on knowing every bit of my character and how to play him, I love dueling and can tell you straight off its the player that makes their character, not so much the armor.<br />
<br />
I say enjoy and play the game as you see fit :) but just because gear is from 5 expansions back doesn't make it worthless...hello prenerf COS *cough*<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Shainaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">the &quot;it's 5 expansions old&quot; line is annoying...   Yes kunark is that old.  No GM isn't though considering it was broken up to luclin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I dont even consider LoY or Ldon expansions (mostly cause they suck)<br />
i /q @ ldon btw...;p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Vezax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The problem is the old expansion arguement is pretty valid.  The green mist consists of doing epic level content, so you deserve to get an epic level reward (kinda lacking compared to epic, but it is close).  The rewards should equal to what you have to kill to get it.  <br />
<br />
Also doesnt the lore of GM kinda make it out to be a 1her?  If it is a 1her, I'd personally like it to stay true to being a 1her.  the ratio i put out before (25 (2 poison) /20) would put in line with lesser ssra weapons like blindfoe or Cocd.  I choose that rato based off the fact that parses from the pali board have the gem encrusted axe (30/20 i think) puts out GR damage.<br />
<br />
And i find XTC way easier then AL.  Well let me amend that, I find XTC way easier then fighting getting getting too AL.  Those guys that are in front of him are a friggin pain =D.  As for the DKP problem, would really have to spend DKP on an SK only quest drop?  I would assume they would just default it to an sk who actually went through the effort of doing GM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>krikk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">For the first year and a half I played Krikk I took HUGE interest in the Kunark Storyline (Now Im a little more into PoP progression, but Kunark still interests me). I've always wanted to see an upgrade for Greenmist, but believe it should stay a 1h'der, as it IS a Khukri. the sword of Rile is an awesome idea. Havn't ever seen anyone using one, but i know people have em in banks. Would give people a reason to go to VP too. XTC would probably be a more logical kill for the Ssra part. Maybe gathering some remains of Rile Sathir (the ones which were recovered by the trader and used by the cult of the arisen to ressurect Venril Sathir, as mentioned in &quot;Atlas: The Maps of Myrist&quot;) Maybe after killing Venril Sathir or VSR you could get a pile of bone dust to use to bring Rile's Spirit back into the world, after giving it to a lvl 1, unfightable spirit who flys around TT. He would say that by acquiring his old Khukri, you've done well; but he still thirsts for revenge. Maybe he'd give you an ancient Sebilisian coin (to call him back when you've got all the quest pieces, like the broken mirror in the GM quest) and a 4 slot bag, in which you'd put his 2 old swords, the heart of the creator (XTC) and a scale from one of the VP dragons. you know, the one who killed him, Phara Dhar or whoever. Combine all 4 and return it to the Ghost of Rile Sathir, after you turn in the old coin. Considering the difficulty, the weapon couldn't be TOO much better than something the Creator would drop. He has both knight class specific 2hbs and the Blade of Angels, so it could still be a really sweet 1h'der. How's this sound?<br />
<br />
Greenmist, Rile's Unholy Khukri:<br />
Magic, lore, no drop, yada yada<br />
25 dmg, 22 del <br />
4 disease damage<br />
Bane damage Shissar: 6<br />
Sv Magic 35, Sv Disease 15, Sv Poision 10<br />
AC: 20, Str 10, Dex 15, INT 25, Hp 50 Mana 50<br />
Effect: Torrent of Greenmist<br />
(initally does 50 DD lifetap, and then 300 more over 6 ticks)<br />
Focus Effect: Rile's Revenge<br />
(Increase DoT durration by 25% Spell level limit: 65)<br />
Required level 60 Recomended lvl 65. <br />
<br />
I've been thinking about this for awhile, as well. this might be too much of an upgrade, but i'd sure as hell use it again!<br />
<br />
(edit) One thing I forgot to mention about how old the expansion is. Who cares? I think it'd be great to get some oldworld content going again. And greenmist isn't FROM the kunark era, it's from RIGHT before SoL. It just mostly takes place in Kunark zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Sandmann Dreamcatcher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">cool  ideas, <br />

i would love to see old weapons and or armor getting upgraded. <br />

i heard about a old robe(velious) for casters who can be upgrated now maybe  SOE  is now heading in the direction we are all hope for. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Sithanator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Make CT one of the quest npc. Or at the very least make it diety only Cazic-Thule.<br />

Make CT one of the quest npc. Or at the very least make it diety only Cazic-Thule. <br />
<br />
If they did make an upgrade for GM, i can't see them making it CT only.... it would piss off too many of the inny-worshipping SKs, and if they did that, then there would be a huge argument out to make IC Inny-only.... ya know, cuz it is his Curse and all...<br />
<br />
Just my thoughts anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">No thanks for it to be 2h. 1h concept should stay. :) There are way too much weigh in 2h for knights. Need improvement in 1h/shield area such as new aaxp skills, more 1h drops in high end games, more 1h quests..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>vilesoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I agree, we are knights, and as knights we should have a shield to use as needed.<br />
<br />
But....<br />
<br />
With teh current EQ system, you need a DAMN nice one hander to use with a shield.  Greenie is almost that sword.  Maybe a quest to strengthen it's magic, or maybe you had the temper wrong, and mob_X has to do some finishing touches....something.  It can be another epic in and of itself.  Make the blood of tunare one of the parts needed, that will make just rallying the forces hard enough since almost every guild has like a 1/4 good elf populace.<br />
<br />
OR....<br />
<br />
We could have a crusader's shield of greenmist quest, which would yield a sheild with an effect that augments greenmist's abilities.</div></div><hr />
