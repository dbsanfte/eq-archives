<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been keeping up with (or have at least tried to) disciplines with respect to the system change (now tomes and ctrl-c menus), but didn't see this question specifically.<br />
<br />
As we know, under the old discipline system, the timer suspended while you were offline.  As we also know, AA timers continue to run even while offline (Imp.HT, Exodus, MGB, Dire Charm, etc.).  And as we know, our regular HT's (our level 1 skill) timer is suspended when we are offline, although it can be reset on death.<br />
<br />
My question is: now that we have gone onto a new discipline system, does the timer continue to count down while we are offline or does it suspend like before?  I guess to make it easy and not complicate it with HT and HT-related aa/skills, suppose if we used /disc Leech Curse and then logged immediately afterwards until the next RL day.  I'd imagine our endurance would be drained, but would be have Leech Curse &quot;back&quot; when we logged in?<br />
<br />
Add: Yes, I will try to remember to try it tonight but someone might have noticed already.  :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ahhhhh.  That's great news -- that'd decrease the odds of HT and the discs being out of synch (one ready and the other not, etc.).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">accept for us poor red sk's =\ our HT dont count down while were offline. luckily the disc's do though i guess heh. one of the reasons i've considered ToW is so that when my ht is out of sync it will take less time to get it into sync with disc heh.</div></div><hr />
