<br />
Err... NT was around much prior to Millenium Edition being released.... <br />
<br />
And it wasn't really &quot;built from the ground up&quot; per se. <br />
Windows for Workgroups was the original &quot;business network edition&quot; of windows, and NT was the &quot;upgrade&quot; from that, beginning with I believe Windows NT v3.51, where WfW was Windows version 3.11<br />
<br />
Of course, there were many &quot;groundbreaking&quot; changes made to the windows platform in order to make network computing more stable and secure than it previously had been with Windows for Workgroups.  When Windows NT's limitations for the small business and home office were realized, along with it's trend toward user &quot;unfriendlyness&quot;, Windows 2000 was concieved, and released around the time of Windows Millenium Edition (actually about 3 months prior to the first retail release of ME).<br />
<br />
What is more, Windows 2k was never intended for purely home use. It was still released as a business/small business/home business operating system, while Millenium Edition was supposed to be the more Network friendly home version.  In the grand old tradition of Microsoft, they released ME on a 9x platform type and it was buggy and unstable and no one really used it that was serious about keeping things working for long periods of time.<br />
<br />
Enter Windows XP, which originally only came in &quot;Professional&quot; version, which is the &quot;upgrade&quot; from Windows 2k.  By this point most home users were more interested in Windows NT based systems than they were 9x based OS's.  So XP Professional came out first and sold quite a bit more off-the-shelf licenses than XP Home, which was released later and was supposedly more user friendly and scaled down in functionality to a closer replica of the 9x platform while still being technically a part of the &quot;NT family&quot;.<br />
<br />
And that boys and girls, is where we are today.<br />
<br />
Edit: Oh, and D-day I believe stands for Declaration Day, which is a remembrance of the day that we declared war in Europe against Hitler and his Nazi Fuckhead cronies.  As opposed to VE-Day which is Victory in Europe day, the day we finally kicked their teeth in.  <br />
<br />
And who says the American education system doesn't work? :)</div></div><hr />

Heh, you can say that again! Windows ME was such a buggy ass piece of shit OS that many people downgraded back to Windows 98 (Hell I know I sure did). It crashed on me more times 3.11 did back when I had it.</div></div><hr />

My company builds NT servers every week, some are dual or even quad Xeon systems.<br />

The term New Technology is a a running joke from the original release, as is the joke term, Norton Technology, since NT was a project developed with Norton's collaboration.</div></div><hr />

Most people don't even realize it.<br />
<br />
But it's known to most computer OEM's.<br />
<br />
ME was discontinued by Microsoft just 3 months after original release date, and all OEM bulk orders were recalled from the major distributors.<br />
<br />
Microsoft said, &quot;It was too buggy to fix.&quot;  But they never went public with that statement.</div></div><hr />

I personally believe in the VMS -&gt; WNT theory, since I have seen some other names MS developers come up with, and they have a history of that kind of 'humor'. However, no one really knows, and it doesn't really matter.<br />

Not going to go into the rest of the 'facts' stated in this thread, but I will say that facts are a silly thing to bring up when people have so many entertaining opinions...</div></div><hr />

Go fuck yourself Naz. So you and your fuckhead friend that build servers sit around and talk about what Windows NT stands for? I am a network engineer that is in charge of 1200 desktops, and roughly 60 servers.  What windows NT stands for has never ever come up in my work. So again, what does your job have to do with making you an expert on what windows NT stands for?  You need to start jacking off more and relaxing, you fucking dork!</div></div><hr />

Calling someone a Moron because they are right is pretty funny....<br />
<br />
It meant that when NT v3.0 was released. 3.1 and 3.51. When Windows NT v4.0 was released, people started making the Joke.<br />
<br />
&quot;How could it be New Technology if v3.0 was the first release?&quot;<br />
<br />
Don't ask me how I know all this because I won't tell you.<br />

So yah, Original poster was correct. Running 1200 desktops doesn't mean jack shit. Just means your another script kiddie making people feel stupid because you don't know what the fuck you are doing when their shit breaks....<br />

<br />
Windows NT is trademarked, regardless of how many convenient usages of it there have been since invention. The Windows NT name does not directly reflect engineering origins - it is a MARKETING name. Marketing names rarely have actual engineering origins, and often the origin you hear about is made up after the fact. It could be factual, it could be a joke, and it could just be what some marketing guy thought sounded good.<br />
<br />
You can guess all you want, and calling each other names because they are wrong and you are right is pretty impressive, but I have to ask: you weren't there so how do you know? Either show a reference that claims the origins of the name, or the next guy is just gonna call you a name back and tell you how stupid you are. Proof - it's not just for getting OJ out of jail... <br />
<br />
Windows NT - that is what the name is - nothing more and nothing less... deal with the disappointment now, you'll feel better for it later...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Although that quote wasn't directed to me, I do agree; but...<br />
<br />
I work tech support and I'm sure others that do will agree, sometimes simply saying `NIC` is just going to prolong the conversation when the person on the other end doesn't understand what I mean.<br />
<br />
(And I will probably have to take back my entry on the 1st page where I said:<br />
NT == New Technology <br />
After some curious searching I found absolutely nothing of fact that I could base this on; I.E  Copyrights, Trademarks, Patents, etc.  The only thing it appears M$ has registered in any capacity is simply `Windows NT` with no absolute breakdown of the `NT` acronym.<br />
I would think that the main reason the majority believes it's `New Technology` is because it's always spelled out next to NT on the loading screens.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nnod</div><div class="date">01-15-2003, 08:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yep, apparently MS has no meaning for NT. it's just... NT.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Skurrge</div><div class="date">01-16-2003, 11:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This thread has reaffirmed my impression that most people that play EQ are cumgurgling fucktards who don't know what the fuck they are talking about 99% of the time.<br />
<br />
D-Day did indeed stand for &quot;Day Day&quot;, as odd as it may sound.  http://www.army.mil/cmh-pg/faq/ddaydef.htm has all the information you need to know (and the army would know, I imagine).  The whole deal about the D meaning Declaration or Devastation was added way later but that was never official as we had officially declared war on Germany a lot earlier than that and there was certainly no devastation of one side going on-- both sides lost a massive amount of lives on the beaches of Normandy (visit Normandy sometime if you can manage to pry yourself away from camping Stormfeather for long enough).<br />
<br />
NT stands for &quot;New Technology&quot;, not &quot;Network Technology&quot; or any shit like that.  Why New Technology?  At the time it came out, Windows NT was doing something a bit revolutionary apart from the other Windows (WIndows 3.11 and Windows 95) in that it was using a protected memory approach to how programs ran.  They got this bright idea from IBM&quot;s OS/2 and also from one of the original developers of Windows NT, Dave Cutler, of VMS fame.  Since Dave Cutler was involved with Windows NT, it is also thought that he picked the NT letters because then the product would be WNT, which is all one letter down on the alphabet from his first baby, VMS.  So, in truth, the NT letters may have gained the meaning &quot;New Technology&quot; after they were picked by the development team.  But they do mean &quot;New Technology&quot; for anyone that asks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Groff Gorespiller</div><div class="date">01-16-2003, 11:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow, Skurrge....<br />
<br />
Good job on researching your facts.<br />
<br />
Now everyone can rest easy knowing that none of it meant anything, as meanings were added and changed after the fact...<br />
<br />
Who the fuck cares anymore?  The real cumguzzling fucktards are the people who are willing to argue this shit for weeks and get thoroughly bent at anyone who doesn't agree with them, all while no one is showing any proof what-so-ever that they are right.<br />

<br />
You actually did some research about D-Day, which wasn't even the point of this thread, but fail to come up with anything better than &quot;NT stands for 'New Technology'&quot; to prove this point? You name drop Dave Cutler, which I guess should make us all believe you? You restate the stuff about VMS already mentioned several times, which makes the whole New Technology thing an *after the fact made to fit for convenience* sort of name at best, but state it like anyone saying different is an idiot? Try stamping your feet to make a point, it might help you. <br />
<br />
Why bother with facts when you can just make shit up? Do us all a favor and take your own holier than thou plagiarized advice.</div></div><hr />
