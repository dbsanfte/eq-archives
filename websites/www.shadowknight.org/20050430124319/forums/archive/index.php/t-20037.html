<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone have a level range for the new zones?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">55+ but from the sounds of it... even pretty well equiped 65's can get their ass handed to them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm sorry I should have been more clear.<br />
Can anyone break down the new Zones into level ranges similar to what is in the stickied post here?  You know list the name of the zone and give an approximation of the level to hunt there.  I'll assume all levels are group because soloing in a new zone gets dangerous with all the trains.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ramgar SK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Natimbi is 55+.  It's the first zone with the WF camp and where the boat drops you off.  Lots of light blues to 65 here.  Do not underestimate the lb's though.  They hit hard and fast, but have few hitpoints.<br />
<br />
Qinimi is 60+.   Kyv Hearpeircers are deadly.  They hit like PoV golums, run like bards, can't be snared, and mitigate slow.  Snaring and slowing are comonly mitigated by mobs here.<br />
<br />
We didn't go any further than the entrance to Qinimi.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Amphitryon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Judging by the sheer volume of corpses I saw littering the WF camp in Natimbi, id say the mobs are pretty tough. (the big spike backed lzard things conned LB to me at 60 but I saw it was taking a duo to kill them<br />
<br />
I wandered across the inlt to a large set of ruins and there is about 6-7 dark blue con to 60 Undead types close together.<br />
<br />
Farther down the inlet there were some mobs up the hill guarding the bridges, all were dark blue con to 60<br />
<br />
I didnt see a lot of wanderers, in fact the only mobs walking around near the inlet was the big lizards and they were all LB con<br />
<br />
The bridges seem interesting from a solo standpoint..since there arent a lot of mobs up there, it may be possible to kite mobs back and forth across the bridges (maybe even fear kite)<br />
<br />
as far as that bunch of undead was concerned, I was going to go back and try to split them w/ our undead lull and see what happens (there room down the beach where there seems to be no wanderers and as such there may be room to kite (if they turn out to resit the lull then I will see how fast I can pull a FD - i can tell by the number of corpses the magus there is a train target</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zackendorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Mobs in Natimbi range from green to dark blue at 65, mobs in qinimi and beyond were all dark blue, far as I can tell nothing in Qinimi see's invis, but beyond that they randomly see through it, so be carefull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Daeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">corpse at natimbi are usually from people who zone in and go afk =/ and people tend to train wayfayer camp there alot so watch out when you zone in</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Saruton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">far as I can tell nothing in Qinimi see's invis,<br />
<br />
Wrong, there are dogs that even see SoS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Buhga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">My favorite GoD spot (I've only explored there once) is the colosium in Riwwi.  Wanderers come through maybe once every 5-10 minutes, if you need more action you can single pull all day from the ledge overlooking the colosium and they drop straight down without aggroing others.  PLENTY of room to aggro kite with no adds and they go down fast (well, to a 65 necro).  It is also full of low level mobs (dubious) that are slaves to the inhabitants that you will be killing, and if you wait until a wanderer attacks one of these slaves (I think they always do) you will have a second pet assisting you.</div></div><hr />
