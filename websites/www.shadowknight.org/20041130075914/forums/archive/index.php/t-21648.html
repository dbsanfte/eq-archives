<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I still think a slow / haste tap would be a good spell to add to our line-up. Nothing near the ability of Shaman or Enchanters, not even near the ability of Beastlords.<br />
<br />
Level 50 = 10% slow / 10% haste <br />
Level 60 = 20% slow / 20% haste<br />
Level 65 = 30% slow / 30% haste<br />
<br />
This spell would be overwritten by any slows / hastes caste by Shaman, Enchanters, Beastlords. It would have a low duration (about the same amount of time as our auras), high aggro modifier, and fairly low mana cost.<br />
<br />
Why do I want this...<br />
<br />
1) Great for soloists in our class. Or those that maybe group with 1 other person.<br />
<br />
2) We know that slows generate alot of aggro, so maybe this could be our new aggro tool? Maybe even add a aggro multiplier to it?<br />
<br />
3) Pulling - it would give us a reason to be pullers. Wouldn't it be nice if the mob came in already slowed 30%, giving the real slower the time required to &quot;wait&quot; to cast that big slow?<br />
<br />
4) As a &quot;non-damage&quot; high aggro tool it would be used to generate aggro on mezzed mobs.<br />
<br />
hmmm, why not?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I would like to see spells that enhance our ability to tank, and something to counteract stun mitigation the paladins have. This line may help us pre-slow and better solo ability, but that's about all it would do. To me it would be minor and situational for people to use a spell slot for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">No, No, No, No.  It's been brought up before, it was a bad idea then, it's a bad idea now.<br />
<br />
We have aggro spells for non-mezzed mobs already.  Slow wouldn't be vastly superior.  We'd intrude on other classes areas.  Our difficulties atm stem from tanking, and this wouldn't do shit to help that.  We still wouldn't get many groups as a 'slower', and in any group with a slower it'd be completely and utterly useless.<br />
<br />
Basically it's a way to paint a target on our backs for real slowing classes to take potshots at us and really not give us much in return.</div></div><hr />
