<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KobanTheCatBoss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Those Gnomes from the second Harry Potter movie are pretty damn pathetic in their own right, so which is FUGLIER?<br />
<br />
Harry Potter Gnome vs. EQ Gnome?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">That's like asking whether you wanna be kicked in the balls or in the face.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rhade Kilsbugsded</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Depends on how hard they're kicking and whether it is to the front or the back of my head.<br />
<br />
-Rhade</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kebsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think anyone would prefer the kick to the face, assuming we're talking about a really, really hard kick.  I think a better analogy would be would you prefer getting hit in the nuts with a pipe or a wrench.<br />
<br />
I've never seen harry potter, but I'd have to assume I'd prefer those gnomes simply because they can't be SKs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Keero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">can gnomes even reach anyone's face ?(besides other gnomes)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jinsei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yes, provided that they wear stilts, jump high, are really tall, have an illusion on, if you were a halfling or dwarf, or you squatted down or he was on a big rock, we were playing gnomeball :D /punt, someone threw them, etc, etc...<br />
<br />
I say we have a gnomeball league sometime. FUN! strucwolf can be the main ball :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Krazix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I saw harry potter 2, cause my cousin needed someone to go with her, anyway.. the only thing I saw resembling a Gnome looked like a Gnome, I think you're thinking about the House Elf (the guy that kept showing up trying to keep the kid out of magic school) he said he was a house elf, and if your curious, he looks like a toilet monster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kebsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I saw harry potter 2, cause my cousin needed someone to go with her, anyway..  <br />
<br />
Riiight, right....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Darkenesis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Was just thinkin the same thing myself...<br />
<br />
Proud to say I've never read any books, nor seen any of the movies.  From what I've collected, Harry Potter is to the Fantasy genre what Mystic Quest for the SNES was to the RPG.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Uglugg Bloodsbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I read that god awful series of books to my neice when I look after her, they are crap! I wouldn't wipe my ass with those books they are such an insult to the fantasy genre.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jobrill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">People love to hate Harry Potter cuz it's the cool thing to do. Personally, I find Harry Potter a rather fun and ingenious combination of the basic British boarding school coming of age novel with a dash of High Fantasy. I mean, it's not Tolkien, but it's not Harlequin romance novels either. Hell, Piers Anthony turns out worse drek, and everyone still likes him :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Uglugg Bloodsbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I do not hate potter because its &quot;the cool thing to do&quot; I hate it because I do not like the way she writes, her take on the fantasy genre and the winey bitch of a main character in the books. Everyone in the world could love this trash and I would still hate it.<br />
<br />
As for the other author you mentioned, never heard of him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Zumgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">there were some funny parts to it though, you just gotta let yourself get into the movie, like when he was fighting the giant snake he was running from it and fell right on his face and slid :)<br />
<br />
and the one near the end where the gnome was slapped in the back of the head by the evil dude and then he got kicked down some stairs lol (yeah i know you gotta have a sadistic sense of humor) :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Xelot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Hell, Piers Anthony turns out worse drek, and everyone still likes him :D  <br />
<br />
Verty true, I read Piers Anthony when I was young.  I stopped cause it got way too annoying.  I won't even touch a Harry Potter book.  It's all childrens fantasy.<br />
<br />
X~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>kbern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Piers Anthony was at least original.<br />
<br />
Potter is just goofy, but both are made for 10 year olds (Pier's Xanth series anyway), his Incarnations of Imortality is an awesome series.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>asguth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">well if the pages are 2 ply id concider wiping my ass with em ahhhh hehe (Btw the mystic quest thing is so true!!! lol remember those little enemies bocking the road that you couldnt get around hehe! IMHO harry potter is so bad that i think you are being a bit harsh to mystic quest! )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>asguth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">you know what tho just dawned on me id rather play mystic quest tho than having to play final fantasy x where one spell takes the good portion of a day to cast. My god they ruined that series they have good storylines but you cast a spell go to sleep wake up and then your almost ready for the next round of combat! I havent played a ff game since 3 us version and the unreleased ones. i hate ff x more than harry potter i think hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>borrean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">very true about the ff series.<br />
<br />
as for harry potter books they are a generally decent kids book thats all. if your reading them because your looking for an engrossing fantasy novel your retarded they are kids books.<br />
and looked at from the perspective of a kids book they are pretty good from a fantasy novel perspective they suck. go figure if you look at it as its intended its not so bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Dios Hyaenae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Harry Potter's pretty good for the age group it's aimed at, actually. the Narnia series kicks his ass as far as &quot;kids fantasy&quot; goes. I'd put it up with Roland Dahl (or whatever his name is - the guy who wrote about huge peaches).<br />
<br />
However, as far as British children fantasy authors go, Brian Jaques pwns all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>asguth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">hell yes narnia kicked arse! then i moved to terry brooks ahh terry brooks love those books..........</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Darkenesis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Shannara series &gt; Harry Pothead</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Cursed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I for one am greatly disturbed by the Harry Potter craze. Not by the kids, but the middle-aged crowd that is going apeshit over it. <br />
<br />
Has it been that long since people read good books? <br />
<br />
30 year people fawning over formulaec children's fantasy whose protagonist is a whiny rich jock who gets everything handed to him, never really does anything for himself?<br />
<br />
Marketing is scarey and powerful.<br />
<br />
Just as bad as a few years ago when teenagers and people aged 20+ were running around with fucking pacifiers in their mouths cause some rapper/boy band/mouseketeer did it on MTV.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Buliwyk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Sadly, the tagline on the back of Terry Brook's newer books say something like:  &quot;If you liked Harry Potter, you're in for a real treat with Terry Brooks.&quot;<br />
<br />
I can't believe his publisher jumped on that bandwagon.<br />
<br />
Narnia Pwns.<br />
<br />
Piers Anthony (for younger crowd) was great at the beginning, and steadily got worse each book for like, um, 30 books?</div></div><hr />

That is bragable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Grimrod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">1.  I believe your thinking about the house elf, didn't really see any gnomes in the movie (yeah I went and saw it, it was either that or the new Steven Segal movie so I went with the better actor).<br />
<br />
2.  In the face, never the balls.<br />
<br />
3.  Richard Marcinko - Rogue Warrior series.  Not for children due to language and graphic content, otherwise some great fiction.<br />
<br />
4.  Steven Brust - Fantasy Author - A number of books out, all very good with descriptive combat scenes.<br />
<br />
PS - why the **** are you letting someone attempt to kick you in the face or balls???  Kick his kneecap out and he'll go down period.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>PollieDarkearth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Anyone live in the bible belt? Currently station down here, and the southern babtist group picketted both openings to the Harry Potter movies. <br />
<br />
They also randomly send me pray cards because me no believe in jebus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Kebsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Send them a Rallos Zek prayer card.</div></div><hr />

If i was terry brooks id kick that guys arse for putting that on my book! Can you imagine what that would do to a guy eesh hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Reserve_Rage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I like the Harry Potter books for what they're aimed at.  Children.  I look back at some of the cr@p I read when I was a kid (like Piers Anthony), but as I grew I developed a sense of taste (and enjoyment of trashing crap authors such as Piers Anthony and David Eddings).   But I know personally one child who's reading skills have increased dramatically due to Harry Potter, and that, in my mind, is a good thing.  As she gets older I'll introduce her to The Hobbit and other books that are actually worth reading.  If she'd not gotten hooked on the Harry Potter books my chances of doing that would be about nil, as her reading skills were poor and attention span for reading was very low.  Realistically the Harry Potter books have enriched her life in this way dramatically.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Jobrill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">&quot;Piers Anthony was at least original.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yeah if you call &quot;Lemme see, What Animal and/or Demon should I have a Human screw to make a new race of creature this book?&quot; Original.<br />
<br />
Piers Anthony has issues. :p</div></div><hr />
