<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Strassis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Maybe not the best forum for this, but didn't want to soil the &quot;greenmist&quot; quest post with this.<br />

I'm not in a raid capable guild who can jump down to the library in chardok.  Anyone on AB server have a history that they &quot;know&quot; they won't use. OR have a guild that would sell at reasonable price.  Only one i've seen on AB was for 30k, and thought that was insanely high.<br />
<br />
ALL I need to finish greenmist quest is that book, and I've got me Lord of Pain Khukri to prove it  :( <br />
<br />
Anyway, flame on.  that's what we're best at here.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Strassis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not that there have been any replies, but nevermind.  Wife got one today on pick-up raid to help a cleric do singed scroll.   :D   Happy me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sacrore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">30k!!!!  Wow you've got some crazy pricing...I bought mine for 90pp on Povar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Strassis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">LOL crazy indeed.  3 days after wife got me one, I found about 12 copies in bazaar, ranging from 400 pp to 1.5k.    <br />
<br />
<br />
On a SAD note... I was incorrect about having everything.  GREENISH METAL SHARD was not what I had banked... seems I had the wrong bloody shard, so I'm still trying to get one at herby camp.  Seem to keep dieing in the effort.  Don't suppose anyone knows a friend of a friend who might have one for sale on AB ?  :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Strassis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Nevermind.  bought one today.  6k, but alas, I was desperate to finish.</div></div><hr />
