Firstly<br />
This would be a one week event in a persons lifetime. Since you are not going to be repeating it over and over every week afterwards it would not find time to become dull, boring, or otherwise meaningless during the period in which it is occurring.<br />
<br />
However most anything that you have unlimited access to is only exciting during an initial period while that access is still new. Once this activity becomes normal or mundane it is no longer capable of producing the same effects of pleasure that you got when you first started experiencing it.<br />
<br />
However the brief encounter would live on in your memory and as most things have a tendency to do would become greater then the event itself was. This might be positive (much like how a 30 year old remembers their days of highschool football, every year those memories get fonder and fonder) or negative (like remembering chronic abuse from a parent for example, this person can become more and more demonized and brutal over time). In either case the memory evolves and grows but does not tend to lose the feelings it invoked at the time the event occurred.<br />
<br />
Secondly<br />
I personally think Britney Spears is fucking hot as hell and I would much rather be eating her.<br />
<br />
You may pick either of the reasons you feel best suits your needs.</div></div><hr />

Spears could also be the key to population control.  Just remove her utterus and send her to africa to hump everyone.....of course those men are going to choose her over their sagging tittied wife jam-jam so no more babies would be born and both world population and third world hunger would decrease.

I have a friend who was in purchasing for Purina back in the 80's and I remember him bitching that he got outbid on a shipment of &quot;chicken parts&quot; by McDonalds.

You probably should kill yourself.  OK, maybe not, given events of the past couple weeks, but castration may still be in order...<br />
<br />
Clearly there must be something wrong with you.  It may be a genetic defect, which we don't want passed on.  If that's not the case, then there's still the risk of the McNuggets causing some sort of bad mutation in your gametes (rather like radiation can) which would similarly fuck up your offspring.

I would have to be paid a fairly large amount of money to fuck Britney Spears. She is a lunatic and her boob job isn't particularly good even.<br />

That means there is no option in this poll that I can use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u95"><b>Wyrdlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p95">I chose the nuggets, because I'm pretty sure we'd both chafe something fierce if we had sex for a whole week.  I'd be pretty tired after the first couple hours anyway and I'm guessing it'd be all downhill from there.<br />
<br />
Now if it was oral sex for a week, I could probably handle that but I'd get pretty sleepy and I'm not sure I could sleep through that.  Plus when her jaw got tired she'd probably be all teethy, and I hate that.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, that will pacify all the people who are duped into buying a high-calorie burger.. that is 2/3 of a pound of beef with cheese and bacon. Those Thickburgers are good, but not worth the $5+ for them.</div></div><hr />

Yep, I know the reason. And I myself haven't voted, because well, I don't care for the chicken, and my tongue doesn't lick in that direction... So no votes for me!</div></div><hr />

the test wouldnt work, this is a lifetime supply of nuggets! you cant just stick that in a room....... it means u get nuggets any fucking time you want em. pick up a fat chick for some dirty sex? need to feed her? well you have all the mcnuggets you need. its win win.</div></div><hr />

Aside from the fact that they're a lot more disease prone than Brittany Spears, think about all the different ways you could use a week's worth of sex with a famous pop star to make more than enough money to buy a lifetime supply of food that tastes a whole lot better than McNuggets...<br />
<br />
And on top of all that, you get the sex.<br />

<br />
Whereas with the nuggets, that's pretty tough to go to jail for anything involving those.<br />
<br />
I mean, c'mon... you don't really think she's gonna consent do you?  Not to all the sick stuff us shd wanna do to her.<br />
<br />
And I can think of some really sick stuff to do to Ms. Spears.  I'll go with the nuggets, gives me a longer life expectancy (but not by much).<br />

or that you're the guy that rescues her and McDonald's offered a reward of a lifetime supply of nuggets to the person that finds Ms. Spears.<br />

The implication is that she won't dissent to sex (unless that sort of thing gets you going).  I see know imolied sense that she would not consent to profit from sales of sex tapes (Oddly enough &quot;One Night in Brittany&quot; works), just like you can't sell the nuggets.</div></div><hr />
