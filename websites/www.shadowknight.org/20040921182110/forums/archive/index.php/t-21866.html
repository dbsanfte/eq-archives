<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i like to run around fire trial with dark empathy up and pretend im a paladin</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'll second that motion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You're an idiot.  That entire notion went out with Kunark when our class got redefined for the first time, it went out further with Velious, then with Luclin, then whenever they rewrote class descriptions, and again it's coming up once more where we get redefined.<br />
<br />
With 75/25 we had about 95% of Warrior tanking ability (and more with spells being used appropriatley) with half the offensive power, and some necro power btw.  Even with that description what was originally stated can't be twisted into what exists now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">So, bearing the above in mind, will you delete it?  I really don't want to have to put up with a warrior reading this and saying &quot;look!  Smurt SK's agree that you guys should suck at everything!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>yuggoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I always heard that we had 75% of the tanking ability of a necro, and 25% the spell-casting ability of a warrior....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>signa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">could you make your sig bigger please? im having trouble seeing it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Chayde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">could you make your sig bigger please? im having trouble seeing it<br />

hehe<br />

<br />
It's an amusing sig, sure it's big, but it tells a lot about him. <br />
<br />
One of his &quot;Friends for life&quot; is ashamed to be seen with him, her back is turned.<br />
<br />
Someone probably took the screen shot for him, because I would pray no male SK would make a sig that actually said &quot;friends for life&quot; on it. I tend to believe that males like blood and gore, not carebear pixie dust luvy-duvy crap.<br />
<br />
It lacks an imagination, no one is doing anything of interest, no fun back ground, just three people standing around, obviously not even talking to each other, just standing there.<br />
<br />
It gives the feeling of &quot;Everyone else has a sig, I need one too, but this is the only picture I have&quot; <br />
<br />
Like I said, I like it, shows Laziness, lack of imagination, and some social issues that he was desperate to prove he had none. (pointing out he had friends!)  And that's what I like, the &quot;feeling&quot; that went into it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: Ya know, I looked at it again, they are standing in a circle, impressive, must have taken a lot of time to get everyone into a circle. But that means when the Orc Pawn hits that cleric, everyone will be looking in opposite directions, she will fall so quickly they wouldn't have time to blink.</div></div><hr />

he has other threads?<br />
<br />
Wow, I am more obvlious to things then I thought I was.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have fun with that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Krazaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">75% warrior, 25% necro doesn't mean that we have 75% of the power of a warrior and 25% of the power of a necro.<br />
<br />
It means that 75% of our class makeup comes from Warriors; the armor, weapons, tanking ability, melee damage and 25% of out class makeup comes from Necros; mid level necro spells, weak pet, feign death.<br />
<br />
I don't understand why people cring whenever they hear 75%/25%.  It has no bearing on our overall power, just a description of where our power comes from.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Because it's flawed no matter how you look at it, and idiot warriors use it to justify us sucking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Novellus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Its so sad to see a game being such a stage for struggle for class supremacy , sarcastic criticism of class inbalance and dreadful thirst for power.<br />
  There is no intent of saying Sks should suck or supreme. The sentence was logically what many new players of EQ view of SKs from somewhere and you cant blame how the definition hadnt changed over the years or misleading it could get .<br />
    shrug..never knew theres so much concern over such an issue here...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Chania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">If warriors use it as a justification, ask them where our 75% of warrior disciplines are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Novellus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Your right Chania . I feel is not cry for supremacy but questioning over the rpg element of a shadowknight class in the world of swords and fantasy.<br />
<br />
  the 75/25 thing gets injected into alot of NEW MMORPG players choosing the sk class and they are never known of how the high end game was being played or how the sk class has progressed to throughout the levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Parasite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">If the 75 / 25% would be true, we had warrior skills from up to lvl 46.. and Bind affinity and gate~ :p<br />
<br />
So no, this is bullshit and honestly I want it to stay bullshit before warriors read this and whine that it should be like that!.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Those are meaningless numbers, never get caught up in them. Knight classes have more to do with each other than they do with Warriors...SKs and Paladins are reflections of each other in a dark/light mirror. The necro and cleric type attriutes of both classes have never been reflected by a simple %.<br />
<br />
Shadowknights have the overall disadvantage of being a great deal more complicated and a shitload more fun to play than other classes. It keeps us hooked even at times when our overall role and relative power and balance get completely fucked with. The experience of playing our class has very little to do with being a Warrior or being a Necro.<br />
<br />
There was a great SK on my server who taught me alot of things along the way, and he said that he never chose the SK as a class to play so much as the class really chose him. I feel exactly the same, and those who do not should experiment until they find a class that does the same for them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Its so sad to see a game being such a stage for struggle for class supremacy , sarcastic criticism of class inbalance and dreadful thirst for power.<br />
<br />
This &quot;game&quot; involves thousands of real life human beings. That inherently means that there will be emotional involvement and different levels of dedication and drive for success however it is defined for that person.<br />
 <br />
The struggle, criticism, and thirst as you describe them are the human element involved whenever more then one person is in any form of competition with another. It is this very human element that has created the phenomenon that is EQ and keeps us all playing and paying for our online time.<br />
<br />
It is in fact this same element that spawns the creation of hundreds of EQ related websites where we spend our time when not even in the game. Like you coming here and posting  ;) <br />
<br />
    shrug..never knew theres so much concern over such an issue here...<br />
<br />
These boards (and about every other class board) have been lit up for weeks on end since the release of GoD with issues of balance and perception. To not know that high levels of concern exist over these topics is either to be blatantly new to both the game and its politics (which you may be) or to be just ignoring them.</div></div><hr />
