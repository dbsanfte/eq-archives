<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Doryshan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I recently got lvl 1 in this AA and noticed that it appears to work differently to Warrior Crits. When I do score a critical hit, it seems to always at least be damage comparable to my average damage with the current weapon/mob/buff combination and quite often in the upper end of my best hits if not my new high-score. While watching Warrior Crits during the same melee's I don't seem to get the low damage crits they do.  Agreed I also don't get the mid to high results they get and that is fine. What I'm curious about is the lack of low-damage crits.<br />
<br />
Wondered if anyone else has seen this.</div></div><hr />

To answer the question, keep watching.  Crits are crits, observing and parsing they act the same in my experience.<br />
<br />
You aren't by any chance comparing warriors with 1hers to you with a 2her are you?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I compared both. <br />
<br />
I'm not comparing how much damage I do to how much the Warrior does in normal or Crit damage. I'm comparing how much our respective Crits do compared to the normal damage we do.  Seems the Warrior gets a lot of small Crit hits that are less than what they do with a normal hit. I don't see the low crit scoring yet for my toon..maybe I'm just lucky so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">+1.66 damage from a crit</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Doryshan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Originally posted by Brael <br />
+1.66 damage from a crit  <br />
<br />
Sorry Brael I don't understand the significance of the number.  I'm not trying to be obtuse I really would like to understand as much about my chosen class as I can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>ugloid foo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think Brael is saying a crit is what the attack would have been x1.66. So if the hit would have been 100 damage, it would have crit for 166 damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>DConquest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Your original slash would of been 300, but it got a crit roll so... 300 * 1.66 = 498 is your hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It's all in the mix..<br />
<br />
Unless I'm wrong, warr's can crit on an off-hand swing. Off hand has no damage bonus so you will see hits for 1 sometimes. So critted - 2. i like to announce those in raid chat &quot;OMFG NICE CRITZ!&quot; because someone always asks &quot;what was it?&quot; lolerlz :):):)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Lurker99</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">so, let me understand this correctly, the number presented to you when you crit is before the 1.66 damage or after.<br />
<br />
exemple<br />
<br />
Soandso hits for 166 crit (166)   &lt;-- is this then multiplied by 1.66 or is this the result of 1.66, so you actually hit for 100??<br />
<br />
It's probably not as complicated as Im making it.... oh well</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">after</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tumy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Thats some good info, and also expalines why I havent crit for more than 603 with my Lance of the Flame Knight.  Max hit is 365 for me X 1.66 = 605.9 max crit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Doryshan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Cool that makes sense being a x1.66. It also explains why my crits only *appear* to not be lower than my median damage.<br />
<br />
Thanks to for moving the post to the correct forum.</div></div><hr />
