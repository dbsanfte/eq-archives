<br />
Actually, I've heard all sorts of things :) <br />
<br />
Anyone care to enlighten me?<br />
<br />
I'm currently using a Pegasus Hide Belt (41%) and am actively questing the Eyepatch of Plunder (20% clickable.)<br />
<br />
Currently lvl 56, planning to get to lvl 60 by the end of next month.<br />
<br />
I've also been told that with Shissar or VoG, all you need is an FBSS as an SK to hit the haste cap. Which would be true if the cap were 80%. On raids, haste isn't ever a problem, unless fighting dispellers.   When fighting dispelling mobs, and especially when soloing, I'd like my haste as close to maximum as possible :)<br />

I doubt a fbss will cut it at that level though in terms of hitting the haste cap.  aq/vog/wr/sos should get you to 100%+ with your Pegasus Hide Belt so you have nothing to worry about ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Razziel</div><div class="date">03-27-2002, 07:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You've heard two different stories because both are correct depending on what level you are.<br />
<br />
If you're 59 or below, the item haste + spell haste combo cap is 80%ish.  The only way to reach 100% haste is with a stacking bard haste song.  So yes, at these levels you could reach the cap with a FBSS and SoS.<br />
<br />
At lvl 60, the item haste + spell haste combo cap is 100% (some say up to 106% haste depending on your class).  So at 60, you need at least a 34% haste item to reach 100% haste with SoS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now, if anyone has a link to a site where I can reference parsed data that would help me tremendously.  My board searching skills arent very l33t, I'm afraid. :o <br />
<br />
There has been a bit of discussion in our guild forums about haste caps, and so far the people who I thought were right turned out to be right, inasmuch as their theory matches yours.  Any kind of evidence whatsoever would be an asset at this point.<br />
Not that I doubt you :)<br />
