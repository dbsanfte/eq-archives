<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cyrielle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I got this today from turning  a Taelosian Geomancy Stone droped from named in Kod'Taz.The turn in guy is Reyfin Malakwa in Abysmal Sea located at 220 270 . From the info I got it seems Miasmic and Horror are drop only , Shroud is Quest only and Ancient is Raid droped.<br />
<br />
Effect is 225 lifetap proc witH SA3 , i am pretty disapointed will probably end up only using Mental Horror once i get it , since I very rarely used SoC.</div></div><hr />

Look at the spell data for Black Shroud (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4903&amp;source=Live) and Black Shroud Strike (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4910).<br />

Unless I'm blind, there's no autocast for that recourse anywhere on there.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Cyrielle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">need 4 sewer trials or flag from Weaponmaster in Ferubi +2 moutain trials.<br />
The last 2 trials are kinda hardcore if you don't have Solid TIme geared crew.<br />
Maybe the rune might drop in another zone, no info on that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, you need to complete the 4 sewer trials and then the 2 mountain pass trials.  Mountain pass trials are hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Thack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">So you have to do some fairly nasty trials just to get a minor upgrade to Shroud of Chaos?  Wow, I'm in.  (not)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kastizi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I just finished my 2 mountain trials the other night.  Vxed mountain trial can kiss my ass.  That one is insane.  <br />
<br />
The Tipt one wasnt so bad until we got to the guy 3 friggin times and his riddle was bugged each time (we had the same damn riddle).<br />
<br />
Grown in darkness, I shine with pale light, much to a woman's delight.  (or something like that)<br />
<br />
We all said diamond or pearl for the answer (though that answer is not available), so we went with :<br />
<br />
1st try : Gold --- DOOM!<br />
2nd try: Rose --- DOOM, again!<br />
3rd try : Firework -- Hey guess what? DOOM !<br />
<br />
So like, wtf?  The answer is bugged on this one....<br />
<br />
On the 4th try, we got a different riddle (thank god) and passed it with ease.<br />
<br />
Always eating, I am always hungry, the finger that feeds me will soon be red ( or something like that ).  <br />
Anyway, that answer was Fire.<br />
<br />
Overall, if the Tipt mountain trial wasnt so bugged, I would say it was the easier of the 2 mountain trials.<br />
<br />
(Vxed can kiss my ass!)</div></div><hr />

The correct answer is indeed pearl.  Why this gimp wouldn't accept the correct answer to a riddle that's been thrown around for centuries is beyond me, however.</div></div><hr />

I totally wasnt thinking Pearl.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, I can think of several replies also that probably wouldn't be listed.  Although, my boys don't always shine, just for special occasions.<br />
<br />
-Astrakan</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Nasiir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Anyone have information on other drop locations? I don't know how far I can realistically make it through the trials, but since the spells have been beefed up a bit recently, I'm now interested in GoD, assuming I have a chance in hell of obtaining either the dropped spells or the geomancy stone for the quest.<br />
<br />
Also, for the Geomancy stone, we are talking about vt/time geared groups for the flags needed to get into the zone where it drops?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>aress</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">no, for KodTaz access for the stone you can pass the trials with EP geared groups, may have to try it a few times though.<br />

KodTaz trials plus is a completely different story.....</div></div><hr />

Miasmic Spear drops in the sewer trials.  I was fortunate to get this in my first GoD trial group.  Pretty sure that Mental Horror drops in the mountain trials.<br />
<br />
You shouldn't have too much trouble with the sewer trials.  For success in the mountain trials, take a good enchanter along with you. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Cyrielle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I got Mental Horror in SNlair sewers , pretty easy to farm. Drops from a Sludge eating fly that spawns near zone in.<br />
Farm strat is basically get expedition zone in track for fly near zone,(around 15 mobs from zone in max) if its up kill if its not retake expedition etc...( multiple can spawn near zone in)<br />
We got many spells doing it this way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Atraleto</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Sweet didnt know any sk spells dropped in the Lair expedition have gotten only shaman spells so far.</div></div><hr />

Mine dropped from the Ancient Kyosops (boss mob) in the Purfying Plant sewer trial.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">You can get both turnin spells from any expidition in sewers/mountans.<br />

Suprisingly Miasmic Spear really isnt all that bad if you use it for aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Ghismonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Suprisingly Miasmic Spear really isnt all that bad if you use it for aggro. <br />
<br />
This might turn into a little bit of a hijack, but has anyone else noticed that the GOD spells seem to generate noticably more aggro than POP spells?  I first noticed it when a guild shaman was using the new GOD slow.  My usual combo to gain inital aggro would be enough to last through a malo, bounced slow, slow routine, but he was pulling it as soon as it was slowed.<br />
<br />
If Miasmic seems to generate more aggro than other spears, would this be fitting a trend that other SKs have been noticing as well?<br />
<br />
And would it fit with the GOD weapon affinity AA making warriors need it to proc those EB weapons to maintain aggro with the new era of spells?<br />
<br />
Just a thought...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Parasite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Spell: Mental Horror dropped off a named &quot;Pxet Vzanki Kzan&quot; today in Ferubi.<br />
Same room as the Hammermaster Goat for the Smith Quest. Dunno if hes a random position spawn or always spawns there.<br />
Also dropped some Scaled Leggings of Dark Dreams (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68528) for a Rogue Twinky. Easy Fight:)</div></div><hr />
