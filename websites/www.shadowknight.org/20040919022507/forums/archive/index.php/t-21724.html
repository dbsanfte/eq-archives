The Diabolic Destroyer - the boss of trial 7, now will attack the rest of the party if the Warrior clicks any of his defensive disciplines. This was done because alot of the Knights were complaining of thier uselessness in GoD. Furious does still work, and I can only assume the bosses in trials 8 and 9 will react the same way to defensive disciplines, though I have not personally done 8 and 9 myself yet. <br />
<br />
As a side note, when they added this aspect into the trial a few things were also nerfed to make it much easier, including making DD herself slowable, which she previously was not. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So this means that all 3 tanking classes are now on near equal footing (Warriors still have the advantage in superior hps / ac, and innate mitigation bonus as they should) for this encounter then I would guess. Its not a raid encounter so you have to admit you shouldn't NEED a particular class in order to get it done. <br />
<br />
I can sort of see why this came about though. Sony had to be between a rock and a hard place. On the one hand Knights are the only melee class with zero form of melee mitigation disc but warriors were screaming bloody murder about giving their tanking competition any form of defensive (even if it was a lesser version with less mitigation and for a shorter duration) that sort of forces Sony to only one other viable path. <br />
<br />
Making her slowable also eases the encounter for other classes as well however like healers.<br />
<br />
Edit: Ok I after reading through the patch message and seeing Siilvers post I realize this might be a little late.</div></div><hr />

This is live, and clerics who use supernal remedy for quad 2100 mobs just need to fucking die.  Oh, and that named that spawned like 3 mobs deep in DD trial dosent spawn anymore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 Agree Slein, but if they are going to go to these lengths to avoid giving it to knights...<br />
<br />
I'm starting to think that getting rid of defensive as a discipline altogether and scaling out permanent mitigation bonuses to the three tank classes in a WAR on top (but not by much) heirarchy might be better all around.<br />
<br />
I can hear the cursing at knights passing through the ether from the Steel Warrior already.    I HATE the idea of gimped encounters where a class can't use all thats available to them.<br />
<br />
Knights need to be brought into line with warriors, no doubt, but defensive certainly causes a lot of tuning troubles, in many aspects of the game.  <br />
<br />
At least if Mitigation was scaled correctly on all the tanks, things would be predictable from a development point of view.  The current crop sure seem to need all the help they can get:(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Agarwaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">SOE is in an invidious position.<br />
<br />
Warriors, as best I understand it, are double the player base of SKs and Paladins each, though paladins have been on the rise for a long time now so that may be out of date.<br />
<br />
Sony have always argued Warriors are seen as a base class in EQ, ie one to nurture.  <br />
<br />
Wars are the kings of tanking, have been since kunark, and they love it.  Taking that away from them would be like removing c-heal from clerics.  You could do it, probably should for game balance reasons, but the noise would be so destabilising no one in SOE has the gumption to stick it out.  Indeed, it would probably be a lot easier to remove c-heal in the modern game than defensive from a outrage viewpoint.<br />
<br />
Sony's move to address cheal and slow mitigation has been to moderate its effective-ness, and broaden character's access to it.<br />
<br />
Ultimately SOE will have no choice, in my view, but to provide knights access to a moderated defensive or equivalent.  I say equivalent because it is conceivable to make a spell that is scalar and achieves the same effect.<br />
<br />
For myself, as posted elsewhere, IMHO knights should get full defensive, while warriors are given improved situational combat abilities and itemisation.  Thats based on my view that warriors should achieve x level of tanking for less xp than knights, but knights should be able to match that tanking ability overall given x+y xp.  Similarly wars should gain access to gear more readily than knights.  Its radical, would give warriors apoplexy, and result in quite a lot of work for soe to actually make worthwhile abilities and itemisation for wars.  <br />
<br />
Ultimately it would make the game better for warriors (more abilities to challenge themselves with, same progression advantage) in the ability sense, while removing their constructive monopoly on raid MT, but I am the first to acknowledge SOE would never have the guts to commit to such a far reaching option.  And I have no doubt warriors would quit in protest left right and center if faced with losing their role as raid MT king, just as more than a few SKs quit in protest of Kunark re the same four years ago.  <br />
<br />
That said SKs have always been pretty tough about crap like that, you can be confident a lot more warriors would whine, quit, and run around like pansies, than SKs ever did when RoK came out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Dakkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">OK, so they're going to address tank class balance via nerfing defensive, fair enough.<br />
<br />
But I'm sure both warriors and knights would have been happier with (say) reducing its damage mitigation to 50% or so on these mobs (or in my case, all mobs barring raid ubermobs).<br />
<br />
The fact they've decided to do so by making it not just valueless, but lethal, on specific encounters is a very bad precedent and unfair to both warriors and knights.<br />
<br />
It's too limited in scope and unnecessarily harsh in execution.<br />
<br />
Cmon Sony, get a clue.  Making defensive murderously lethal on a couple of key mobs in the game will (rightly) cause howls of protest from warriors because it's not a fair way to approach class balance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Dkhar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">It kinda feels like Sony is intentionally trying to make everyone hate knights. Even in the patch message a few patches ago it stated something like &quot;Because knights whine like bitches we toned down zone_x and mobs_d-z&quot;.  Well, not exactly like that but it kinda made me angry they are such asshats about it. It's like being spiteful in a way. We are yelling loud so they are forced to do something about it but they are pissed that they have to think and implement balance in the game, so they throw insults at us knights. Again, with this patch it feels that way. They punish Warriors with this (surprise!) and I bet it makes certain classes despise us. Warriors must hate us now, gee, they get defensive and are at the top of the game but then Knights say something because we are falling behind and they not only nerf content but make defensive dangerous to use. <br />
<br />

I can sense the hateful glares behind my back already...</div></div><hr />

Warriors have been posting that furious and stonewall works fine so problem solved for them  <br />
<br />
One post with a total length of one sentence and no elaboration on the entire thread from a nobody is considered reliable?<br />
<br />
Let me elaborate my experience testing this last night:<br />
We did Tipt last night for our 3rd acct, and when the warrior popped stonewall Jhiru started spamming some text about ignoring him every tick - since we'd used WS first and then the warrior AE Taunted off he didn't lose aggro immediately, but by the end Jhiru was pingponging pretty bad for those last 10 sec or so. (and yes, we warned the warrior not to use it - old habits die hard I guess, heh)<br />
<br />
Net result - it defintely does happen, it's not instant DA style like was originally stated, seems more like -XXXX aggro per tick while they're under disc, so its kinda usable, but honestly after having to tank Jhiru for most of those last 10 sec and him LIVING (1850 AC, 7.8k HP max defensive AA on the cleric) I really would say that using defensive/stonewall was a bad risk even in that ideal situation.<br />
<br />
On DD due to the MUCH longer fight, I'm expecting that defensive/stonewall would be a similar death sentence.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Kahntun Derstand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">It'd be useful from a balance standpoint if all three had a form in that it would distance the tank classes from the non-tanks. <br />
<br />
I've never heard it said better, Selin.  If I had to say it, I'd replace non-tanks with wannabe tanks.  The fact that Rangers, Monks, and Beastlords actually beleive they have the right to tank is ridiculous.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Only monks as a group seem to want to tank adamantly - most rangers want to have their DPS role fixed; beastlords I must admit are one of the 4 class boards I don't read (zerker/cleric/bard being the other 3)...<br />
<br />
Rangers wanting to tank are pretty much the same type of subgroup as SK's wanting to be a DPS class, and from what little I've seen, beastlords are pretty much the same.  Monks just want to be gods again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually I was going by what a warrior in my guild told me who tanked the trial yesterday.  He said that he used Fortitude and  stonewall and he went down like nothing and aggro  was not a problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Vaclav</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Ask him to elaborate on the circumstances - was it similar to the one I listed above with a high DPS group?<br />
<br />
That would explain the circumstances if so - or did he get a string of successful taunts off while the mob was trying to turn from him?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Askeer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">You can probably tank it as well Inferna as long as you have a couple good healers and a good slower. Just be sure to take a DI and ask the cleric(s) to do first heal(s) with darb so they don't overaggro you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Howlitoezis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">The screaming on the sony warrior balance board is damn entertaining.<br />
Of course, you know it's our fault for wanting to be able to tank GoD that the warriors were 'nerfed'.<br />
It's all your fault!<br />
lmfao, love it.<br />
Maybe next time they wont be so fucking quick to shoot down viable means of tank-class balancing.<br />
fucking wankers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I think this was a nice fix.<br />
<br />
What I've seen for Tipt...<br />
<br />
They increased the atk of the mobs again, making it harder.  Perhaps not as hard as it originally was, but harder than it was last week.<br />
<br />
They made it so that /disc defensive or /disc stonewall is pointless, putting knights on even footing for the boss mobs.<br />
<br />
They made the boss mobs slowable, making it possible to do them without /disc defensive for all classes.<br />
<br />
They changed cloak of luclin to stack with brell's, putting shadowknights on equal hp footing, buff-wise, with paladins.<br />
<br />
The result is trials that are more challenging (higher atk on most mobs = more hits at or near the max) but that can be tanked equally well by all tank classes, for the most part.<br />
<br />
Bravo, Sony.  Looks liek they working on balancing things for a change.  Betcha they did similar stuff to Ikkinz and so on.<br />
