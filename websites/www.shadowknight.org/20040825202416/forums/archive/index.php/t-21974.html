I think someone is a repressed homosexual.... with the exception of your post about someone's mom getting shot in the womb while she was pregnant, I think almost every one of your posts has had something to do with someone else being gay. Trust me.... when your dad told you that it didn't make you gay because you were the one with your cock in his ass, he was lying. He just liked your boy-sex, and wanted to get as much of it as he could. Now, for the love of god, go play in traffic while blindfolded and on fire. A fire fuelled by kerosene. That's right, kerosene.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>vilesoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">he's not worth fire.<br />

And no, while I can't say I've ever gotten off by fucking dead things (any more than the next person, i guess), I just want a lot of people dead. Not to have sex with them, mind you... just dead so that I don't ever have to see or hear them again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>nezzka is bad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">flames dude</div></div><hr />

Well sitting in your room playing EQ for the rest of your life will probably accomplish the same thing, so why bother killing people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Because (while I haven't killed anyone yet, because going to jail would suck), I think that killing people would be much more fun. And my room is ugly anyway, it needs a new paint job.</div></div><hr />
