Haven’t seen you on in awhile (I know why now).<br />
<br />
I too, haven’t been on much in the past 4 months. With the new patch, it seems that they have made adjustments for resists and mitigation. The part I liked the most was the fact that they have increased melee range by 50%. No more “Your target is too far away” even though you are right on top of them!<br />
Anyhow, in my 4 months of being absent, a lot of things seemed to have changed. The only way to describe it is to log on ad wade your way through the dead bodies.<br />
Good luck on your new cpu.<br />

translation : Jousting no longer requires any skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Meriboh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Jousting will still require skill. The important aspect that changes, is that a fleeing or strafing target cannot exploit this small bug anymore.<br />

jousting no longer requires timing-- instead of having like a 1/2 second window to hit attack, you now have what-- 3 seconds?.  What other skill besides timing is needed for superior jousting?  all else is gear and buff dependent-- ie movement rate, weapon damage, regen...<br />
<br />
positioning has long been an integral part of eq pvp as a melee-- if you can't drive your halfling better than the next guy, then how the hell are you going to be a leet pk rogue?<br />
<br />
and i bet you ten hundred million billion zillion dollars they did not fix any warp problems, reduce ghosting, or install a system to catch offset hax, which you know damn well are the real problems with pvp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Those are the real problems, but I have no idea how they will fix ghosting, as it’s form the player’s side. Maybe instant LD?<br />
<br />
The 50% increase in melee range is a welcome change for me, as my crappy system lags so much that in high volume zones, I’m usually seeing the target too far away message.<br />
Target too far away combined with hill bugging and ghosting has always been frustrating for me, as a melee.<br />
