<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Winkles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ever been so frustrated with someone that you want to hit them through the comp?  <br />
<br />
Ok here I am chatting in guildchat that alot of rangers use melee because its better dps than using a bow unless trueshot disc is up.  I've got this from the ranger boards by the way.  Anyway this lvl 65 ranger in guild says &quot;No way I do over 500dps with a bow.&quot;<br />
I said &quot;How the hell do you do that without ts going? That's more than a rogue or wizard.&quot;<br />
<br />
Anyway it went on and on how he crits for over 1k with his bow.  I told him he would have to do that every shot.  Then guild leader comes in and says she has seen him do that much dps.  About this time I just give up.  I'm trying to explain that dps isn't one shot that it's over time.<br />
<br />
Don't know why this bugged me so much but it sure the hell did.  And how could our guild leader be so dumb and encourage the fool?  Felt like removing myself from guild after this.  I guess it's just the frustration of knowing you are right and some lame head saying you aren't.  By the way his bow is a Stonewood Compound bow so it's not like its some no drop GoD bow.<br />

Sorry just ranting.</div></div><hr />

I was sitting at a gas station the other day getting a horrible tasting watered down &quot;cappuccino&quot; with 4x the sugar in it of a twinkie as I often do and this typical hick family drives their pickup into the space next to mine which convinently was next to a pay phone, the man is tall/skinny, missing a couple teeth, has a horrible accent, and a nice mullet gets out to put some coins in the phone, then hands it to his wife.  His wife is approx 500 pounds, wearing a mumu, and took up more space than one of those $15,000 tv's you see at the enterance to circut city.  Also, I forgot to mention she also had a mullet except her hair was rather dirty, I suspect shes to fat to take showers now and couldn't wash her hair.  Now if this isn't enough the little hick family had their hick kids in the back of the pickup.  Kid #1 missing a tooth wearing a mullet, and acted like a jackass.  Kid #2 once again a mullet but thats all I remember from him.  Anyways, when I saw these people I was hoping a tornado would come devestate their trailer and that they would drown in their septic tank.</div></div><hr />

I was leaving a grocery store when I was done shopping and started to drive away while behind another shopper that was also leaving.  This woman drove out of the plaza and proceeded down the major road adjacent to it, as anyone would.<br />
She got about 50 yards down the 3-lane road and came to a dead stop in the center of the road.  She got out and went to her trunk to get some food from the groceries she just bought, got back in her car and continued driving.<br />
The fatso (she was very large) couldn't wait until she got home to start snacking on her fucking ring-dings but instead give the potential for a major pileup.<br />

Lol it sounds to me like you are describing the middletown/hamilton/cincy area ;p  ya its terrible, but it does get worse...especially the further southeast (georgetown,ripley,new richmond) you go, and the closer you get to the ohio river there. ive never ventured further then that,  i try to make my trips out of dayton as short as possible.<br />

If he lives on the Ohio he probably lives about 30 mins from me. I live in Hamilton County, and no Vinny I am not a hick. Hamilton really isn't that bad - though I suppose its probably just the part I live in.<br />

I was helping a friend out at his dental office doing some work for a few days until they could get permenant person in.  Well one patient who came in was an 18 year old girl and even though its been near 2 years I'm not sure whether I should be amazed or sad at her story.  In little over 1 years time she had been married, had a child, divorced, pregnant with another guys kid and currently engaged.  She didnt even finish high school, I believe she only finished 10th grade.  In addition she was there to get dentures for nearly the entire upper row of her teeth.  Her only saving grace was that she wasnt morbidly obese (yet anyway).<br />
---------------------------------------<br />
<br />
This story is truly a testament to how stupid human beings can be.<br />
Same dental office and same week (what a week it was!) a woman comes in with what I can only describe as the most fucked up teeth I have ever seen.  Her breath smelled like a litter of kittens had died in her mouth 3 months ago and she never bothered to do anything about it.  I should have kept my mouth shut, but my duties dictated that I give the dentists and assistants some idea what was wrong with her.  This Roseanne Bar look alike in all her brilliance had decided that she needed dentures at her old age for her rotting teeth.  However rather than spend money paying for quality dentures she decided to make her own dentures.  Her husband had a shit ton of arcylic in their basement so she shaped it into something which in her opinion resembled human teeth and put it in her mouth OVER all her remaining teeth.  This created a block of rotting, healthy and arcylic 'teeth' that were beginning to damage her gums.  The smell eminating from her mouth was her gums and teeth rotting because of the acrylic she stuffed in there.<br />
<br />
The dentists never having experienced something quite this stupid before were baffled.  In the end they decided the best thing to do would be to drill and cut away everything and give her full dentures since there was no way they could pull the acrylic out at this point and save the few remaining healthy teeth she had.  The best way to describe what happened next is with an equation;<br />
<br />
rotting teeth sealed in acrylic + high powered dental tools (ie friction and heat) = a smell worse than death, burnt microwave popcorn and old vomit kept in a small unventilated room.  To try and alieviate the smell we opened every window and door in the office but the smell did not leave.  In the end, because of the smell, we had no choice but to close early and reschedule patients for another day (not that they minded, many were walking out due to the smell).</div></div><hr />

I was walking to my job in Chicago and I saw this hillbilly family that must have been visiting from their backwater town (the fat wife was wearing a mickey mouse t-shirt btw).  They looked extremely out of place and were actually trying to talk to people that were walking around.  Mostly they just got ignored and got some funny looks.  One businessman told them to &quot;leave him the hell alone&quot;.  <br />
These people couldn't understand why everyone was in such a rush and why they were walking so fast.  They didn't understand that people actually have places to go and things to do...and that people don't want to be bothered by idiots trying to talk to them about jack shit.  They must have been used to their town with a population of 200 where everyone knows each other and they're all related.<br />

Champagne is for seafood, pasta, and sometimes...traditional meat dishes (as in rack of lamb, prime rib, etc).  This is abhorrent, and screams &quot;OMFG look I have class, I drank teh bubblay wine thingy Jeb! Now gimme that thar rib bone to suck on!!&quot;.

food/drink arguments are there for a reason, because some people do not know what is good and have to be told.</div></div><hr />

Spaten is a great beer for eating, as is Sapporo and Tsingtao.  Singha is good, if you can find it.  If your eating some nice italian or even french food, try out Chimay (red label).  For general summer drinking, try out Franziskaner Heffe-weisse, if the Hefe is too much for you, try their Club-Weisse.

...Even american, try out Stone Smoked Porter if you are a dark beer fan...it's bizarre, but damn tasty.  Fat Tire Ale is a pretty good session beer, so is Anchor        <br />
 porter and summer beer.  <br />
<br />
Some beers that are less than spectacular is Warsteiner (pay no attention to the &quot;best selling gerrman beer&quot; crap, it's basically an improved budweiser....less of that watery feel and rather bitter...it's not great beer, but it's ok if that's all you can find...actually It's just under heineken for taste.  Actually if you like Heineken, try Oranjeboom, it's another dutch beer, and at least to me is better than heinie.</div></div><hr />

Try Grolsch and Palm, both dutch beers. Loads better then heineken, although heineken isn't bad if it's all you got.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the problem with all that is i only have drank 2 of those beers you listed.... the city i live in isnt that large and the beer selection at restaruants aint that big. if you want something different its to the liquor store to randomly try crap that may or may not be good. but in the end it all turns out good if you drink enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>vilesoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">Hmm, well if they aren't that big, try out some Sam Adam's seasonals....at the least they are decent.  Their pale ale isn't half bad.<br />
<br />
If you have any beerrs fomr Acme, Anchor, Widmer's, Pyramid, or Samuel Smith (british import, extremely popular ale).  Give any a try.  I have no clue if your west coast or not, sadly most of these are west coast names, since well...I'm west coast.</div></div><hr />

Woops, yeah you're right Jupke, Palm is great though, better then any dutch beer I know. You belgians can do stuff besides earfucking waffles.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Palm, hoegaarden, duvel, kriek, geuze, ...<br />
<br />
Belgium has the most non-pils beers in the world. <br />
<br />
(pils-beers are all brewed on the same way with the same ingredients with small difference. Well known pils beers are budweiser, heineken, carlsbergh, etc..)<br />
Also belgium has the largest (i think, not sure anymore) beer producent in the world (interbrew) with offices and factories all over the world.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well today I tried out a new ale, Trois Pistoles, and holy shit it rocks...it's a very dark ale, very wine-like, and also very very good at concealing it's alcohol content, even at room temp (where every good ale should be consumed at).<br />
<br />
Not too bad at $7 for a 1pt, 9oz bottle....I'm prolly going to go back to the beer shop this weekend and buy a dozen of these :)<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW, Beer Shop = Beverages &amp; More, they are the shit.</div></div><hr />

Hate when that happens.<br />
Been times where I wouldn't be paying attention and right after I would open a beer I'd put my cigarette out in it.<br />
It foams up and all there is is a mess on the desk and a wasted beer.</div></div><hr />
