I was pretty pissed to find out that a lvl 10 could have bought a quest result item that I had a lot of problems with at lvl 45 soloing...<br />
<br />
Anyways, I am soon going to try and finish the last Khukri and start on the Greenmist...should be doable at this time, all I need to do is find me a guild :D</div></div><hr />

I am looking into solo strategies for the Lord of Pain khukri, hopefully this one won't be as much of a &quot;pain&quot; as the Hero was.  Could help it. ;)<br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />
