Also: related topic any EB items you've camped besides the stupid QH guy?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you can get your katta faction up a bit, there is a quest there requiring 3 shissar organs from the revenants around the temple that will net you an EB neck.  Don't know what the faction level required is, as I bombed katta faction hunting there long ago.<br />
<br />
I duoed there with a shammy partner at around 55, we were trying to get him a Golem's Jawbone.  Lots of clears, very rare drop, we never did get it, but it was fun enough.  EB requirement and traps and wanderers are annoying, especially the worms, but they're not terribly deadly unless you aren't paying attention.  Snakes are easy to Feign split, and golems rarely double if you have your mob rotation down correctly.  Golems don't hit hard (well, niether do the snakes, really) and once slowed are cake.  Just keep in mind that the golems proc some whirl-till-you-hurl type stun spell that is annoying as crap.<br />
<br />
We really only hunted at the temple and at the revenant lake in the north east corner, the rest of the zone just has too many wanderers and traps to have been worth our time at that level, but you might find it more rewarding at a slightly lower level. /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Silvershadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Dubious to the quest guy (don't remember exactly which faction he is on, think Magus Conlegium) is enough as you can then use hide (or have someone else invis you after trade window is opened) to raise to indiff for turn-in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Savoline</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">the grey is the only zone in game with a negative ZEM (65), so exping there is hardly a good choice :(</div></div><hr />

LoIO is listed at ZEM 60, and I know plenty of people who xp'd there as a matter of preference before SoL...<br />
<br />
During my time duoing in The Grey, the xp didn't roll in, but when the base ZEM is 75, you're only looking at a small negative modifyer to begin with, and if you have a reason to want to hunt there, don't let anyone tell you it's a bad choice.  Personally, I'd look at the need for an EB item and the constant traps and wandering worms as more of a deterrant to grinding there than anything, but like I said, I had a good time hunting in this zone, it was fast paced and action packed, and in the end that's all that matters to me.<br />

good luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nugaruk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The RPGGamer list is out of date, LoIO has the standard 75% ZEM now.  As far as I'm aware, he is correct, the Grey is the only zone which currently has a ZEM &lt; 75.  (or negative xp bonus if you want to call it that)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Savoline</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">can someone explain me how 75 = 0% but 160 = 85%?</div></div><hr />
