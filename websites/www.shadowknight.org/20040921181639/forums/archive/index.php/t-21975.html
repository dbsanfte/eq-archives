(The breastplate without all the augs was linked in guildchat today, sparked a conversation about the guild needing more equipment)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ghismonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Those three augments are part of the Breakdown in Communication quest, aren't they?  Meaning, to upgrade to each progressionally better augment, you need to turn in the previous one? I suppose in order to do that, you'd need to do BIC Quest three times.  <br />
<br />
Not only would that be hugely prohibitive timesink wise, but I am about 90% certain that the quest NPCs use hidden flags so that you can't (and don't need to) redo what you've already done.  So in short, no, I don't think that's legal.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's considered an exploit Novellus although theres no real exploiting involved in doing it other than corpsing lore items, it's obviously something not intended to be done with the quest though so I would assume thats why they consider it an exploit.  I know the person that made the BP quite well.  It was only made for the link, the actual item sits on a corpse they have outside Kod'Taz.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kyfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Why would they spend the time making it to stick it on a corpse?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Seeing items like that make me cry..... especially when items like that are sitting on someone's godforsaken corpse outside of KT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Because it's not right to use it Kyfe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Supposedly will be fixed on patch day coming up, so enjoy it while it lasts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>The Zenogias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Why is it such a problem? By the time you can do that part of the quest, shouldn't you have access to such powerful enchancements?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">the quest is such that you are only supposed to have ONE of the augs at a time -- whichever is the most recent.  Not all the ones before that one too.<br />
And you aren't supposed to be able to do the quest again, only the part you're flagged for currently.<br />
<br />
-Bolas</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Its like if you cheated to keep the intermediate pieces to the other incremental quest like Grimmel, Coldain ring/shawls without redoing the quest (redoing insnt an option with BIC because you get flagged at each step).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Krazaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The developer in charge of that quest knows about it and has a fix going in soon. <br />
<br />
It will retroactively effect people who've already exploited the quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">So much for my plans to exploit the quest *grin*<br />
<br />
-Bolas</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Androsulach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">By the time you exploited, you'd get patched to only having the latest aug in the quest.  I'm assuming that what they'll do, is compare augments to BIC flags and delete previous versions of the augment.  If only they'd waited until they got the Muramite drop for Rayin's and kept working on finishing the quest.<br />
<br />
Ghismonda, you don't turn in the augment at each stage.  You combine it with the next substance in the quest container.  Which makes it a timesink with getting the drops from the appropriate zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>nekko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">If you have more than one, they will be turned to 0 hp ect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Morbent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">That bp no longer is attainable anyway cause it has slot 2, slot 2, and slot 3<br />
<br />
The bp today = slot 1, slot 2, slot 3, but im sure those augs fit in all slots *shrugs*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Vaclav</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Something I'm calling &quot;Linked Lore&quot; when I'm describing it to people coming soon as Nekko said earlier.<br />
<br />
You can get as many as you'd like by exploitiing still, but any beyond the first (maybe even the first too, not sure) the engine detects will be nummy 0's across the board.<br />
<br />
Was supposedly why the &quot;Aid Grimel choice&quot; quest was delayed as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Zaim Nae'blis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The view of the original BP is down. Could someone repost the shot?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Rhumba_Kween</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Lyndro, one of the EQ Devs over on the Sony Boards posted this about the BiC quests and how it will be fixed.<br />
<br />
This is considered an exploit.  You aren't supposed to have multiple BiC augmentations on at the same time.  In the next patch having more than one will cause all your items to be deleted from your character and you will be set to level 1....<br />

So as you can see shame on those that exploited this quest. :)</div></div><hr />

None of the BiC augments will work if you have more than one.  You need to destroy all but one to get it to work.  You can equip them, but they won't have any stats.</div></div><hr />

Michael Moore does it... I assumed it was perfectly fine to only use parts of quotes to make points.   :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

He doesn't catch that much hell for it... But either way, I did post it in jest, and was very surprised no one had called me on it before I went to bed last night...   :eek:</div></div><hr />
