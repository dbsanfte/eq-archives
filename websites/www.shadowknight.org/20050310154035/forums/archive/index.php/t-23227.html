Might want to slap this into the spells/Skills forum. I'm sure the parse nuts will go wild and provide us with useful data in no time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Nice that we can now have a recourse that blows longer.  Make it 3 minutes, and we might have a cheap way to get off with epic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>zice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Now worth using since it's useable by inventory  :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Being usable from inventory doesn't make the effect better, it just makes it more convenient to use.  They should still completely scrap the current effect and give us something good instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I was watching how much it showed it healed.  One round of melee 309 211 429 yeilded one message, of being healed for 30.  I would say that totally sucks.  It only healed on the first hit, and not on other hits if I doubled or tripled.  And since others in group, usually bitched about a worthless buff slot being taken up, I didn't bother clicking it anymore.  Maybe I had the correct messages turned off.  I fired leechcurse off, and it worked like normal and saw the messages.  I was around 80% health.</div></div><hr />

Godly!! THAT is what we had been asking for epic's longevity. We can still use epic for effects even though we got better weapons. Wow. Epic usefulness would stay with us for years!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It should just be 18 sec of 100% leech just like our disc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Epic accuracy mod is a decent substitute for a real damage disc.  However, the healing is irrelevant to our tanking ability... it just doesn't do enough to make much of a difference.  It can heal back a small amount of AE damage.  Still, on heavy AE fights I'm reluctant to cast it because it might block an AE heal on someone in my group, which is ultimately much more useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I actually don't mind our click a whole lot anymore personally, it should heal more for sure but it's not that bad.  I tend to use it often, my regular group has a rogue and shaman both in it.  Me and the shaman can click our epics at the same time and basically double everyones dps for a minute, really evil if the rogue happens to take that opportunity to disc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Knevil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yup, anyone thats high dps seems to like it, I find it a little useful for AE's... I agree it should land every hit that lands and possibly for a higher % even still. If I'm using GBoC or Epic my swinging is pretty slow, Nice that the effect is usable from inventory. Haven't tested it yet, wonder if focus is still active for when we switch to a shield.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Focii are worn.  You don't get the lifetap focus if you're using a 1h/shield, if that's what you're asking.</div></div><hr />
