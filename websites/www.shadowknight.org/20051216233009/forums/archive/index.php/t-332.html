<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bubonic</div><div class="date">04-01-2002, 10:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Found this info you might be interested in, it came from Steelwarrior.org. Nice little guide for those who have not set theirs up yet.<br />
<br />
Man I love my Guild Members: <br />
<br />
OK hitsmode looks neat, I haven't had a chance to use it while grouped, but <br />
I did prance around Misty Thicket and iron out the bugs enough to know how <br />
to set it up. <br />
<br />
/hitsmode &lt;me|my|other&gt; &lt;m2 - m5&gt; &lt;X&gt; &lt;Y&gt; &lt;lines&gt; &lt;font&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;bg&gt; &lt;width&gt; <br />
<br />
&lt;me/my/other&gt; = you hitting something, getting hit, and others' hits. <br />
<br />
-This gives 3 &quot;temporary&quot; boxes where battle spam shows up instead of in the <br />
chat window. <br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;m2/m3/m4/m5&gt; = level of detail given in the new hits boxes. <br />
<br />
- m2 = Highest level of detail. &quot;You punch a large bat for 2 points of <br />
damage.&quot; <br />
<br />
- m3 = Second highest level of detail. &quot;Punch a large bat for 2&quot; <br />
<br />
- m4 = You get the following text for a 2 point of damage punch, &quot;2&quot;. Just <br />
the number. <br />
<br />
- m5 = This can ONLY be used in reporting YOUR attacks. &quot;Punch 2&quot;. <br />
<br />
It works the same way for me, my, and other: <br />
<br />
&quot;You punch a large bat for 2 points of damage.&quot; <br />
&quot;Punch a large bat for 2&quot; <br />
&quot;2&quot; <br />
&quot;Punch 2&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;A large rat bites YOU for 1 point of damage&quot; <br />
&quot;A large rat bites for 1&quot; <br />
&quot;1&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Guard Droolas slashes an orc centurion for 124 points of damage&quot; <br />
&quot;Guard Droolas slashes an orc centurion for 124&quot; <br />
&quot;124&quot; <br />
<br />
&lt;X&gt; and &lt;Y&gt; <br />
<br />
Remember coordinates from math class? Well think way back. X=0 and Y=0 <br />
[origin = (0,0)] is the top left hand corner of your screen. Add to x and <br />
the text box moves to the right. Add to y and the text box moves down. <br />
<br />
&lt;lines&gt; <br />
<br />
This is a value between 1 and 10. How many lines of text do you want to <br />
appear in the new hits box? choose wisely <br />
<br />
&lt;font&gt; <br />
<br />
Font size. Yay! 0 to 3 I think...3 being the biggest...I THINK! <br />
<br />
&lt;head&gt; <br />
<br />
Displays a heading on the top of the hit box indicating which it is: you <br />
hitting, getting hit, or others' hits. 0 and 1 turn it on or off. <br />
<br />
&lt;bg&gt; <br />
<br />
Toggles transparent polygons. Either the box will have no background or a <br />
tinted background. 0 and 1 turn it on or off. <br />
<br />
&lt;width&gt; <br />
<br />
The width of the box. I dont think this affects anything other than the <br />
width of the shaded area. It doesn't make text skip down to the next line or <br />
anything. <br />
<br />
EXAMPLES: <br />
<br />
I have my display set up with the hotkeys and the chatboxes in the default <br />
position so here is the setup that worked well for me, without hindering my <br />
line of sight: <br />
<br />
/hitsmode me m3 98 432 6 3 0 1 150 <br />
<br />
/hitsmode my m3 260 432 6 3 0 1 150 <br />
<br />
/hitsmode other m3 425 432 6 3 0 1 230 <br />
<br />
I hotkeyed these in socials in case i have to redo them. This way if I <br />
forget how to do it they'll always be around. <br />

glad to see someone else posted this so i didn't have to go searching for the other one on this site... one question though.... if you ever do get bored with it, how do you turn it off and put it back in your regular chat window? just wondering.... it took me alot of figuring and tinkering to get it where i want it, only because i couldn't figure out how to tuen it off and put it back the way it came, lol.<br />
<br />
it does make things a little cleaner though:)</div></div><hr />
