<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>DrayMay</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">If this is old news I apologise for repeating the information but I thought I would pass on something that occured last night.  On an off raid night a couple guild mates and I decided to switch to alts that we have in the mid 50s and try to see if we could get a Draniks Scar expedition.  Long story short we were able to and decided on Murkgliders Hive as we were familiar with the layout of it.<br />
<br />
There were just 3 of us, me 55 SK, and then a 56 cleric and 55 shaman.  We were in there originally to see just how it went, then it became to see how far we could push.  Trash mobs were hitting as high as 248 but averages were down in the 125 range.  We were just clearing and moving along, eventually we worked our way into the Pool Room and much to our suprise there was a hideous rat just to the right of the entrance.<br />
<br />
We killed that and cleared a few other mobs then decided to wait to see what the respawn was.  On the next cycle of spawns a named Murglider popped.  I can not recall the actual name but was Murkglider &quot;something&quot; and did not see it listed on Ala's.  Max hit was 308 and had a poison proc that stuns.  Using the Unholy Aura Disc and HT hit for 1300 and barely dented the HPs.  He dropped a Type 7 Regen 2 Augment that would fit in any armor slot.  All in all it was a worth while trip, a new experience, 1 named spawn that we were not anticipating, about 1.5%AA per kill and 250pp for each of us over the course of a couple hours.<br />
<br />
Looks like the OOW expeditions offer something for those of lower levels as well.  It will be a spot I will go back and explore a few more times.</div></div><hr />
