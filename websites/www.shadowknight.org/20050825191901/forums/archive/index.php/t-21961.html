<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anyte</div><div class="date">07-02-2004, 02:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">okay i was surfing thru a thread over at allakhzam on spirit wracked cords and guy posted he heard rumor urn dropped off other bosses in zone.   He said he couldn't confirm but said it's most likely since he looted the rod and the mirror DS drops off another boss mob.   Can the mirror drop off other bosses now in the east wing?   Me and two friends all working on quest together and camped all 3 of our greenmist shards last night and ran in and axed DS for first of the 3 mirrors we needed.   Then i saw above mentioned post.   We could slaughter any other named spawn in there and if has a change would like to know if it's been confirmed.   Will prob go try camping a couple of the named in east wing to start seeing.   chance off of any east wing would sure cute down on waiting 3 more days.</div></div><hr />

So if you have everything for the final turn in, you can use the same mirror for 2 different people.</div></div><hr />
