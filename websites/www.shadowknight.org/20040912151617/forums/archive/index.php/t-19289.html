<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">here's my monthly or so aa advice post okay at 202 aa the order is in my sig. Just finished fota3 and im kinda looking and seeing no aa's i really really want that will make me more powerful. AA's are one of the only ways i upgrade myself since my guild isn't raiding material that could upgrade me atm and i dont like to farm/buy high expensive stuff. <br />
<br />
K i've heard SCE1 is a good buy for fear/clinging but i dont notice fizzles much on those really so im thinking this could wait. channelingfocus1 looks kinda okay but once again not sure how much this will benefit me wont make me do more dps or make me take less dps and i see the pvp potentional not being too high. What ive been considering is finishing mental clarity2 and 3 since i do only have ft1 and mc1 for mana regen but since i box a bl and have kei/poh and have a limited casting setup i dont know if i need this. next two things im thinking are metabolism aa's i do use stat food and force feed so this could give me moretiem to force feed i guess and planar power aa's. With fero/ios/sta i should max my sta with pp5 and dex and str but im not sure if this will be a worthy dps/hp upgrade from the dex str sta? im leaning towards pp and metabolism atm cuz they are less expensive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">pp is good, innate metabolism is good... the faster and harder something hits, more likely you are to get interrupted... so I'm planning on getting channeling focus soon myself.<br />
<br />
Since you're on PvP, resists are expensive, but might be worth it.  Any FT seems worth it if you've already gotten the tanking and offensive stuff out of the way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Menon Lifeblight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Max out PP, MC, and Channeling focus.  Add SCE1 and IM3 and you are pretty much done with useful AAs.<br />
<br />
Edit - forgot to mention TotW3 and Consumption of the Soul.  I don't have either, but I imagine they would be at least situationally useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Saveaux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Dhantes I belive that you might want to start banking AA, seeing as how with Gates of Discord we will have a few new AA to start working on. It would be nice to have a few new AA the day GoD goes live. <br />
<br />
I forget all of the proposed new AA but I believe Fury of the Magic is one, and I would DEFINATELY start banking for it, even if its the only one worth anything.<br />
<br />
I believe theres another touch of the wicked also. Could someone correct me if I'm wrong? I don't know how much more it will lower our HT reuse time, but any less than 30min sounds uber to me. if this is the case I think I would max Touch of the Wicked imediately. <br />
<br />
Heh what do I know.....I'm only at aa 61 =\........</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i'll probably start banking a week ahead of it going live maybe 2 i really hate saving aa's fomm is something i will be getting soon as GoD goes live though.</div></div><hr />
