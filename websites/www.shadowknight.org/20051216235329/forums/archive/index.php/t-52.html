<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xilr</div><div class="date">03-25-2002, 01:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know this has probably been hashed out before, and if it has I apologize just please direct me to the link....  Anyways, I'd like to find out if Combat Agility and Combat Stability would make any difference at all for me.<br />
<br />
I pair with a cleric for most of my exp.  Mobs are around 46th level and hit for 120ish tops.  Normally I get hit for 30s and 40s.  Raids and Raiding skills arent an issue since I will *never, ever* be used as a MT for anything, even trivial mobs.  Please keep that in mind when giving your reasons.<br />
<br />
Currently, I'm under the impression that these skills are not worth developing or at most get one point in each for when I get Physical Enchancement....  I'd love to hear both conflicting and supporting opinions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
before I had those, I thought mobs that hit for 180ish hurt, after those I don't even notice unless something's hitting for 250ish max... my gear has improved since before I got those, but not nearly to that extent<br />
<br />
if you're content killing mobs that hit for 120 though, they may not make much difference (except durability since you pair with a cleric - more hps = more efficient CHs)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't have them yet, but last night in ToV tanking a guardian wurm after all the warriors died, I survived, but barely :)  had 2 clerics and had to disc to keep my life up.  I'm pretty sure having these AAs would have made my job a lot easier :)</div></div><hr />

I found myself pulling the Halls of Testing once.<br />
We had 16 people total and I was the only FD person.<br />
That doesn't qualify as tanking but I was also tanking adds since we only had 3 plate tanks.<br />
I lived to tell about it and I have 0 AAXP points.<br />
In my opinion: Level&gt;All<br />
I certainly plan to get combat agility and stability when the time comes to reduce the damage.<br />

<br />
But yes, for about every situation level&gt;aaxp.  The only thing I might consider before 60 is pullers getting run 3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xilr</div><div class="date">03-25-2002, 05:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We had a guild discussion on it, even if its a moss snake we still need a warrior to tank it.  No SK for tanking, no matter what the circumstance.  You shoulda seen our 4th warder battle plan......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Blackeagle Dwimmerlaik</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 04:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">bah, my guild regularly uses SKs over warriors as MA except on mobs that require defensive...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">trun</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 04:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Go for max dmg aaxp things first, then beef up the tanking stuff. Personally, I'm maxing SA before i do phys enhancement, durability, agility, stability in that order. We do make decent tanks, god knows we hold aggro better than warrs, but dmg is best for us if your guild is packing a few warrs per raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shaion De'luthien</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 06:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What combat agillity does is raising the soft cap for AC. Currently it's around 1250 without any aaxp points, with combat agillity 3 it's should pop up to about 1300 - 1350. Physical enchantment raises it abit too.</div></div><hr />
