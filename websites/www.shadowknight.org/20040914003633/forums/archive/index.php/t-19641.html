<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ZilshasisEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Since our current Sticky'ed thread about this topic is very old and not up to date I've taken apon myself to start a new one with more relivant info.<br />
<br />
So here goes, I appoligize in advance for any and all spelling errors, grammar ect as English is not my native language.<br />
<br />
This thread is intended for the starting shadowknight, so I will not go into the focus on higher level raid equipment. Should you wish a full list of all possible Focus  effects then please click Here (http://www.bjornstar.com/index.html) <br />
<br />
For a listing of the droppable Shadowknight Usable Focus items currently entered into the Allakhazam search engine click Here (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/adv_search.html?classes=5&amp;race=0&amp;type=Any+Slot&amp;effect=9999&amp;fzone=0&amp;foodtype=0&amp;smod=0&amp;stype=0&amp;stat1=None&amp;statlim1=0&amp;stat2=None&amp;statlim2=0&amp;stat3=None&amp;statlim3=0&amp;pristat=ac&amp;priwt=2&amp;secstat=hp&amp;secwt=1&amp;tristat=none&amp;triwt=0&amp;level=&amp;price=&amp;qt=b&amp;planar=y&amp;nodrop=n&amp;ofocus=y&amp;aug=n&amp;st=)  <br />
<br />
Introduction <br />
<br />
Q : What are these Focus effects I keep seeing pop up on my equipment?<br />
<br />
A : Focus effects were part of the so called Caster Balancing made by Sony Online Entertainment during the Luclin period. Mainly intended for the pure casters we as Shadowknights can gain great benifits as well by chosing the right focus for the job at hand. It can be very hard for your average player to gain the right types of Focus, and so SoE added an option for items summoned by the Magician class. All types of focus will be covered later on.<br />
<br />
Q : Right then, so what kind of Focus are there?<br />
<br />
A: There are quite alot by now, and more enter the game every expansion. Thus this is a work in progress and more items will be added when it becomes required. I will start with listing the &quot;Basic&quot; kind of Focus. Please note that Focus range from rank I to rank IV. Rank I effects level 1-20 spells, Rank II 1-44, Rank III 1-60 and Rank IV 1-65. Thus Ideally you'd want rank IV focus. <br />
<br />
Also please note that the effect procentage ranges from 1% to whatever procent listed. So an Improved Damage IV would make direct damage spells do between 1% and 20% more damage. It is random everytime you cast a spell, so people generally consider Half the listed value as what you get out of it on average.

<br />
<br />
  Spell Haste (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3525&amp;source=Live) - Helps you cast certain spells faster<br />
  Mana Preservation (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3537&amp;source=Live) (MP) - Saves mana on all spells<br />
  Improved Damage (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3513&amp;source=Live) (ID) - Helps your single target direct damage spells do more damage<br />
  Improved Healing (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3501&amp;source=Live) (IH) - Makes your healing spells better<br />
  Burning Affiction (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3507&amp;source=Live) (BA) - Increased DoT damage<br />
  Extended Range (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3510&amp;source=Live) - Increases the Range of your spells<br />
  Extended Enhancement (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3504&amp;source=Live) (EE) - Increases Buff timer<br />
  Reagent Conservation (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4016&amp;source=Live)  (RC) - Gives you a chance of casting a spell that requires a reagent without consuming said reagent.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Those are the basic focus you will see the most often. There are of course nearly a focus for every type of spell currently in Everquest, but these are the most common and widespread. <br />
Since this is all about Shadowknights we should cut right to the chase and see what Focus we can make the best use out of. <br />
 <br />
Which Focus for the job? <br />
<br />
Since we're all about two types of spells, namely Direct damage and Damage over Time (DoT) it's of course best to start off with focus that effect those two catagories. Every spell cost mana, so of course saving mana on every cast is something that could be useful as well. <br />
Shadowknights have, as all hybrids do an innate spell casting haste on harmful spells. This innate ability starts at level 51, and scales all the way up to level 65, where it gives you a 45% haste on casting harmful spells. Thus I don't consider Spell Haste that important for us.<br />
<br />
This leaves us with a number of choices for focus. We need something to help us Do more damage with DDs and DoTs, and we need to save mana. That leaves us pretty much with the basic Improved Damage, Burning Affiction and Mana Preservation.<br />
<br />
Why Improved Damage? <br />
<br />
We use Direct Damage to do more damage with our DD spells. We have a number of those and lifetaps are included in this catagory. The nifty thing about the ID focus and lifetaps are that it both increases how much our Lifetaps damage, but also how much we get healed by the tap. The Improved Damage focus also help our HT do more damage as our HT is considered a spell by the EverQuest spell engine. So thumbs up to this one, getting an ID item can and should be a fairly imporant task. Most SK's opt for the War Crested Ring (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=10947) with it's ID4. It can be a bit pricy, but it's a good goal to have.<br />
<br />
Why Burning Affiction? <br />
<br />
We creave more damage, thus it comes as no surprise that we should look to increase the potential of our DoT spells as well. BA helps us do that. The BA is checked for every tick (A tick is six seconds) so if you leave your DoT damage on it will produce different numbers almost every tick. More damage is always good, so a BA focus can be very worth it. While you are at it you could look for a way of increasing the DoT Duration with a Focus called Extend Torment (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4462&amp;source=Live). That Focus requires the Lost Dungeons of Norrath Expansion though, and quite alot of Favor Points to buy though, so there's no need to search far and wide for equipment with that effect. Longer duration on dots = More damage, which was what we wanted all along.<br />
<br />
Why Mana Preservation? <br />
<br />
As hybrids our mana pool tend to be a bit lacking till we get into the Raiding game and all it's spendor of items. Thus saving mana on every spell can be a very nice thing indeed. More mana means you can cast more spells in the long run. Toss in a mana regen buff and some Flowing Thought items and you're a machine of spell casting death.<br />
<br />
What should I focus on then? <br />
<br />
Q : Cool, so Focus items can do alot for my shadowknight. Whats the catch?<br />
<br />
A : Well, the &quot;catch&quot; is that you have to make some choices regarding your gear as you get better and better gear. We are mostly Tanks and Pullers so normally you'd Focus on AC, Hp and stamina when you chose your gear to help survive tanking and pulling better. So often you have to comprimise a bit till you can get good gear thru raiding that has the focus we need. The Lost Dungeons of Norrath Expansion can help the casual Shadowknight obtain such focus with some hard work and alot of Favor point spent, so there is light as the end of the tunnel there as well.<br />
<br />
Magician Summoned Items <br />
<br />
So you haven't quite made enough points in LDoN to deck yourself out with Focus items yet? No worries, by bothering your local magician a little you can get No Rent items that basicly do the same as those Focus obtained other places. On raids where you're not pulling or tanking there's no harm in sacrificing a little Hp/AC to gain a useful effect. But what do you ask them for?<br />
<br />
Here are what Magicians have to offer, to make it easy on the reader I have included the closest type of compadable Focus in parantheses :<br />
<br />
Please note that I list the highest possible summoned items for the sake of simplicity. You can always find a magician around your level to summon a lower level version of the ones listed below.<br />
<br />
Another thing to note about magician summoned focus items is that they follow other guidelines for when they stop effecting spells. You will have to look each of them up if you pick up lower level versions of those items. Follow the Lucy link on the top of this document and see what the magician spell list looks like.<br />
<br />
<br />
  Tavee's Runed Mantle (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=29797) - Extended Enchancement IV on Benificial buffs only.<br />
  Gallenite's Sapphire Bracelet (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=29798) - ID IV focus<br />
  Naki's Spiked Ring (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=29799) - Spell Haste IV Focus<br />
  Rallican's Steel Bracelet (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=59564)  - BA IV focus<br />
  Jedah's Platinum Choker (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=29796) - Gives you a chance of casting a spell without using a reagent.<br />
  Jolum's Glowing Bauble (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=29800) - Up to 15% mana saved per Harmfull spell cast.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Thus, as a Shadowknight You'd want an earring and the two different bracers from your local Magician. Or you can pick them up in any well stocked Bazaar for a few platinium.<br />
<br />
Thank you for reading, I hope it has answered your questions. If it has not then feel free to post below and we'll see if I can add the information you seek.<br />

Happy hunting!<br />

Special Thanks : To Window and Viconia deVir for Corrections and additional information.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>aress</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">nice job</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Viconia deVir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Magician earring only works on Nukes and dots btw.  Also its 15% mana pres whereas mana pres is 10%</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ZilshasisEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Aye, you're right. Shows how little you should trust your memory on such matters :) Will correct right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">a mostly accurate list of focus effects is here:<br />
http://www.bjornstar.com/index.html<br />
<br />
hybrid detrimental spell haste is 45% at 65. buffs and pets aren't included.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well if you are addressing this to newbies, the 2 things I would mention are some epecific (and good--if there are any) level 1 and 2 focus's that SKs should go for. (The FIne Antique Ring (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=28237)  is probably something I should pick up for Blacki and at least an option for any SK to 49th...its about 50 plat for a MP2...low AC but good for when DPS is more important that AC.) <br />
<br />
The other thing I would mention is starting about 20th (I think) mages can summon focus items that are the lower level equivilents of the top end stuff you mention.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>ZilshasisEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Aye, Magicians start summoning those items starting from level 4 for the Choker. <br />
<br />
The Reason I list the high level ones are because it's easier for the overview. It matters not if you get rank I items if you're only level 20 or Rank IV if you're level 61 as long as you know why you should bother in the first place. I'll make this more apparent in the post :)<br />
<br />
I'd rather not edit the post in regards to loot though. Thats what the Armory is for. I know I list the War crested Ring but that is because it is to my knowledge the only droppable ID IV focus we can get, aside from the Ceramic insense burner of course which everyone can use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ahh well I guess I consider starting shadowknights, low level, like 20 :p. War Crested Ring, yes belongs in the armory thread, but since all the class communities are made of up mid and high level characters, the noob end of things often get ignored.<br />
<br />
So while high level gear discussions are always going (and changing) what is good for low level char's gets far less discussion, and, realyl wiht a set of people who are not as familiar with the tools to locate good gear.<br />
<br />
Anyway, a test:<br />
