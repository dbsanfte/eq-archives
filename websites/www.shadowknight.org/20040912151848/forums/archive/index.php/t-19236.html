<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tirnan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi guys, I would like some advice.<br />
<br />
Current AA's 26 (25 spent, 1 banked)<br />
RS3<br />
Regen 3<br />
ND3<br />
CA1<br />
CS1<br />
SCF1<br />
ToL1<br />

<br />
I have recently moved from a smaller Family style Guild to what once was the Top guild on the server (lots of defections to FFXI, so realisticly number 3 maybe 4 on server atm).<br />
<br />
I am planning to max out defensive and tanking AA's first (and maybe add in Pet Hold as a pulling tool)<br />
<br />
The list as I see them needed are CA 2/3, CS2/3, PE, PD, LR, ID.  Did I miss any?  More importantly what order should I do them in?  It seems like PE and PD don't give the same return ND did... should I do them last or first?  At what point does SA returns outweigh the HP bonuses as an offtank on raids?<br />
<br />
Secondly I am under the impression that I will be mostly offtanking as needed (or DPS if not) and only occasionally on the raid puller team.  However In LdoNs and xp groups I am being asked to both pull and tank more often.<br />
<br />
Whats a good road map that balances all this and still maximizes my utility to the guild?  With a little luck I should be elemental capable in a week or two, Im not sure if this will affect the advice, but thought I should throw it in.<br />
<br />

Thanks for advice and does anyone know the %age returns on LR/ID etc?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Menon Lifeblight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I did them in this order:<br />
<br />
PE<br />
CA3<br />
CS3<br />
PD3<br />
LR5<br />
ID5<br />
<br />
This would be fine too:<br />
PE<br />
CS3<br />
CA3<br />
ID5<br />
LR5<br />
PD3<br />
<br />
PE next, then finish the Luclin AAs, then the PoP ones.  Other than that, the order is fairly irrelevant.</div></div><hr />
