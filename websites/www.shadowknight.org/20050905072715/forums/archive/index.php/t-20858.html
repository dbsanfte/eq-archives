<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Prylos</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 07:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello, I have learned alot about dueling from the threads in this website, and have even started dueling myself with my sk(now level 20), and from what a good friend of mine on Fennin Ro ( Cova, member of Devir). He says an sk can practicly own every class except Bard and Enchanter. After some debate we decided it would probabaly be very possible for an SK to kill a Bard although somewhat hard. But what about an Enchanter? They have Rune spells to absorb practicly all our damage and I think he told me they have high -resist spells.<br />
<br />
If anyone would tell me how to properly defeat a high level enchanter It would be very appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tarrasque</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 07:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are two very good ways of preparing to fight an enchanter. Get your magic resistance as high as possible. Sacrifice everything for MR, and try to get it to 250+ if you can. This way he can't land his nukes on you and will have no way of killing you. Second, buy a handful of Crimson Potions in Shadowhaven. These insta-click potions will affect you with a DoT that will break mezz every tick (6 seconds). If the enchanter charms a mob, dispel it with a pumice stone (can be bought in the same vendor as the crimson potions) or a spell. This will cause the mob to attack the enchanter and will most likely be fatal to him. If you can, use a 1-hander and a shield, since bashing him to interrupt him will prevent him from casting anything, especially his darn absorb shields. If you have all the harmtouch AA's, harmtouch him at 75%. This will do 4-5000 damage to him and should definitely kill him unless he cheated and got virtue and other buffs, and it still may kill him since only elemental and time geared casters will have more than 6k buffed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1)  Cast diease cloud on urself, since a enchanter won't be able to dispell that dot off you.<br />
2)  Cast one dispell on enchanter, so after you pop his rune, it will always go in that first slot if he's not so smarts then u can always dispell it again right when he casts it.<br />
3)  Touch of inny/bash his brains in.</div></div><hr />

This guide is pretty much all you'd ever need to think about before a chanter duel.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Getting MR high is good, as are the pumices.  Disiese Cloud yourself instead of of the crimson potions.<br />
<br />
Shield is good too<br />
<br />
Joust him<br />
<br />
Hit, bash hopefully interrupt his spell and run away (can't remember right now what level shadowstep is, but use it if you got it)<br />
<br />
Use pet to distract him...the moment he tries to focus on pet move in and start beating the crap out of him.  He has low HP do dot's or anything you can land are good.  Keep him from recasting rune.  Pet may also help interrupt him.<br />
<br />
Good luck</div></div><hr />

at start of fight, cast invis to undead on him...poof pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keevel</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 06:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">just so you know chanter pets suck (for us not them).  They'll agro on anyone who attacks thier master, but they cannot be controlled by the chanter, and when they first get the pet it is usually white or yellow to the caster, so it's as if you are fighting 1 melee and one finger wiggler opponent...get rid of it as fast as you can any way you can and out pet stands no chance vs. their's</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arikash</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 10:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Or you could always fear the pet at the start of the fight, but this may give him time to cast a nuke or what-not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oagan</div><div class="date">03-31-2004, 01:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Chanters will try to stun and mez you, while sicking their pets (if allowed), and nuking.  MR is the most important.  If you have/can get it up over 200 and 250 is better, they're not going to be landing, or sticking for less.  A chanter that can't take you out of commission by stun/mez is a dead chanter, plain and simple.<br />
<br />
If pets are allowed, perhaps stick skinny on him just to distract the chanter pet.  They don't have the controls on pets that we do.  The pet will aggro the first thing that aggros it or the chanter.  Their pet will kill ours, but you can probably kill them by the time they kill skinny.<br />
<br />
Most of my dueling with chanters was with my wiz, pre-PoP.  His MR was over 250, and the stuns and mezzes often wouldn't land, allowing me to nuke the shit outta them, and they died quick deaths with his nukes.<br />
<br />
All casters are dead meat if they cant slow/root a melee, because we just hack them to death.  Also look to use quick casting spells, because that allows you to get one off before a possible stun hits.  Chanters only have root, and we can dispell it if it lands.<br />
<br />
Magic Resistance #1 in beating them, and all casters.  Other resists are important, too, but if you can get magic to 250, you're going to shrug off a lot of spells.<br />
<br />
BTW, to answer the other point in this thread, Bards are far tougher to kill than Chanters.  Chanters are doable.  A good bard will NEVER die, unless you put some restrictions on where/how the duel occurs.  Bard duels are a waste of time.  You'll just run around trying to catch them, while they drain your mana and laugh at you.  At lvl 20, it will come down to gear and skills learned.  There's a good chance that a newb chanter or bard won't know how to PvP.</div></div><hr />

Or you could always fear the pet at the start of the fight, but this may give him time to cast a nuke or what-not.  <br />
<br />
Fearing the pet causes it to agro you once fear wears off giving you a very limited time to get through his rune and kill him befor the pet comes back and becomes a serious issue.  And by that point the chanter probably has you slowed...</div></div><hr />

Ive always found enchanters to be extremely easy to defeat in duels.<br />
<br />
dont bother with that disease cloud rubbish, especially if you have decent regen it wont break mez. Just use one of our lich spells, Deathly temptation, Pact of hate. then you dont have too owrry about resisting your own dot :p</div></div><hr />

Is this different on blue servers? <br />

DC works for me always (with shaman regin on me), and last 10 minutes iirc. only problem is getting it to land sometimes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oagan</div><div class="date">04-01-2004, 12:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If your MR is not high, you spend the entire duel standing around mezzed/stunned.  Chanter nukes are not that powerful (1100 or so - PvP reduction) but you can't take them all day long.  You've got to have the worn/innate MR to shrug off their mez spells so that you can hack the shit out of them, and interrupt their casting with bashes.<br />
<br />
A good chanter is not a piece of cake to kill, and a session in frustration if your MR is low.  You will be standing around like a gimp if/when mezz lands, waiting for them to break the mez with a nuke/dot.  If you can't hack/bash, it's going to be a long fight.  If they have healing potions, they can heal your melee damage while your sitting there mezzed.  They also get another click buff up and cast a rune while your mezzed too.   Plate classes kill dress wearers by beating the shit out of them and interrupting their casting.  If you can't do that, you're gunna get beat.<br />
<br />
Go to any PvP forum and you'll see numerous posts on the importance of resists in PvP.  In PvP, resists are as, if not more important than HP's.</div></div><hr />

<br />
READ THE WHOLE POST PEOPLE, HE ASKS HOW TO BEAT A HIGH LEVEL CHANTER NOT A LEVEL 20 CHANTER!!!! :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
On a side note, don't joust casters especially if youre using a one hander and a shield (jousting is for minimalizing incomming melee which chanters lack and besides jousting is meant for high damage slow 2 handers not low delay 1 handers). If the caster is out of arms reach of you than youre doing something wrong. If you shadowstep from a caster unless you intend to try and run for your life than you are doing something wrong.<br />
<br />
DoT's work around runes and are not absorbed by runes so use them if you can.<br />
<br />
Never ever use your HT on anything but the player you intend to kill and don't use it unless it's going to be the finisher. If I'm playing a pet class and somebody blows their HT on my pet I'm laughing at the moron.<br />
<br />
Fear works wonders on pets, use it. To further bog a pet down you could potentialy dark it so it does nothing but shadow you while you beat his masters ass. Summoned chanter pets are often benificial by breaking mezzes since the chanter has zero control of his pet. Charmed pets should be dispelled so they turn on the caster.<br />
<br />
MR is king in pvp especially verus an enchanter. Chanters will always start out with a tash spell lowering your MR, if your MR is ok post tash than don't worry about it however if it brings your MR to a level that he can land spells easily than use a cure poison potion to remove it immediately.<br />
<br />
Rapture mezzes can be a real pain however self inflicted DoTs can break the mezzes. Plague is nice because chanters can't remove it however if your resists are good you may have troubles landing it on youself. Pact of hate is nice but must be kept far down in your buff order so that it takes a few pillage enchantments to remove. I've never tried crimson potions but after reading this thread I'm curious to try them.<br />
<br />
Using your pet is nice though a good chanter will park the pet very quickly. Anytime in PvP that somebody has to focus on something besides youself is an advantage and ant advantage is welcomed.<br />
<br />
Most of my fights with enchanters were ended fast spear/spear/2hander melee/2hander melee/lifetap/ HT. If the enchanter is good and is given time to work his debuffs and land spells than it will not be an easy fight.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Things vary a lot depending on the levels of the 2 characters dueling, gear advantages etc. EP/time/GoD gear has pretty much turned PvP into a total joke.</div></div><hr />

you can buy a 10 dose ethira's poison antidote potion or have an alchemist make one to get rid of tash. 2 sec cast. hope they don't notice it's faded.</div></div><hr />
