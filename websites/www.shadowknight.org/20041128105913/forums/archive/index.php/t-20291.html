<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaggnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nurga isn't too bad at 54+ because you can single pull the mobs in 2nd and possibly 3rd tiers without any adds.   The only downside that I can think of is there is no place to fear kite, and a quite a few of the mobs will Cancel Magic on you -- stripping your virtue and KEI.   Soloing in there without virtue/aego/kei is difficult without hella downtime. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Darkforge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There are LOTS of dispelling casters there.  It gets really annoying - the typical dispel will drop two of your buffs, and probably 60% of the mobs in Nurga are casters.  Fighting there without a group will be tough, because you'll quickly be buffless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">1) have good resists<br />
2) exp good solo form &quot;pit&quot; in<br />
3) find where named can spawn focus there<br />
4) Dispellser mobs usually have &quot;arcane&quot; or &quot;spirit&quot; in their name<br />
5) Blood knights are Sk's and they ht for anywhere from 400-500</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">What boots do you have?  There are some descent boots that drop off a blood thirsty rat in the room past the &quot;pit&quot;.  Plate boots of light,  not the greatest but serviceable, nice stats and you save yourself some money getting them.  The rat pops in the middle of the 2 tents on the right at the ent of the room and his placeholder is another type of rat.<br />
<br />
edit: I put the boots in my magelo inventory if you want to see wwhat they are like.  I've farmed about 6 pair for friends, you can generally get a  named pop an hour or so and these are his common drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Imgrunk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">MUCH better than POJ ,  MUCH .   I solo my beastlord here with 0 downtime and they take on adverage 1%  of my hp each and Im tanking whole fight as a BEASTLORD.  All you need is to buy loads of res gear.  I have 150+ in all of them and gobs cant get a single spell on me. Its like free exp. And its ALOT of it .    At 55 Im geting and AA an hour.  I feel like i was back in pal caves.<br />
NOT ONLY THAT  but the named drop great gear that if you dont need you can sell . In that hour I also killed 3 named and made 4k.  Also there are quest items that drop . and the quests are for UBER items , Veng items and such. If you realy wanna know how easy it is with res gear.  I have had 3 adds all dark blue and didnt even lose 30% hp.  the only ones who do any damage are the SKs because they HT you. I LOVE THIS PLACE.  Look Forward to seeing you here :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jaggnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm not sure what Imgrunk is smoking, but I want some of it.   The green mobs at the entrance don't hit for much, but by the time you get down to the mobs that are all dark blue at 55, they are doubling in the 75-100 range and have approximately 4-5k HP each.   Even if you're not having spells landed on you, you can run into trouble with adds if you're not careful. <br />
<br />
What works for a BST may not work for us SK - our pets are considerably weaker, and the 55 BST has a pet buff that is very effective at stunning/interrupting casters. <br />
<br />
Nurga still is excellent XP though - no doubts about it.   If you can handle the dispellers, the slows, and can provide healing for yourself that's effective (regen) then you're in good shape! <br />

<br />
Er...I'm 56th level partnered with a 56th level cleric and if you're getting an AA an hour I'd like to see how you're managing that. <br />
<br />
I will say that Nurga is a great place to hunt but I wouldn't count on an AA an hour unless I'm completely missing something in my technique - that is to kill MOBs non-stop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Darkforge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Nurga is indeed very good experience, but I can't fathom getting an AA per hour.  I 3-box there a lot, killing pretty much nonstop.  In the deepest tier, I kill around 17 mobs per cycle (I think the respawn timer is around 20 minutes), and don't average anywhere near an AA per hour.  <br />
<br />
Nonetheless, it is quite good experience.  Lots of casters, so prepare to be dispelled a LOT.  How I wish resists would somehow factor into whether a dispel lands or not . . .<br />
