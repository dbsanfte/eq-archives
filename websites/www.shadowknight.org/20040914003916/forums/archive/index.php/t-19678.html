<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>RaevaelDarkstar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Yes, Ill begin by saying Ive done a search.  Thus far, havent found anything.  If there is a thread on this somewhere (which Im sure there is) please point me in the right direction.<br />
<br />
Is there an issue with CD not working properly against some LDoN mobs?  Mostly inside MMC Im seeing some mobs not agro appropriately.  For example, I CD'd a mob 2 times on pull, once on engage and once around 50%.  4CDs.  Cleric (who is the same lvl as I) cast a CH on me and it landed when I was around 25%, mob was in same area. This was his first heal during said mob...and a few mobs previous.  The one CH took agro.  Cleric claims he didnt sit right away after casting~I didnt see...but either way that shouldnt have taken agro after 4 CDs and then meleeing the mob the entire time with my 1hander (Hammer of battle with 50pt lifetap proc) and bashing away with my shield.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>NorrynNoir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">cd is cd whether you are in ldon , pop , anywhere. aggro is influenced by many variables. i'll bet he sat down - that causes a lot of aggro. the only way clerics usually get aggro is on bad pulls where they have to CH the tank before crowd control can engage all the adds.<br />
<br />
4 times a mob is excessive for CD i think. you should be able to hold aggro just fine if your group understands what they need to do to avoid it.<br />
<br />
i do ldon all the time and have no trouble using CD when tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Although some people disagree with me, I maintain that there are certain mobs in some zones that react differently to spells, proximity, melee, etc.<br />
<br />
Mobs that react differently (harder to gain and maintain aggro in my opinion) from the rest of the mobs in LDoN zones are:<br />
<br />
MM: Spiders<br />
<br />
Tak: Bugs<br />
<br />
Mir: Bears, cats, dogs<br />
<br />
Ruj: Bears, dogs<br />
<br />
Guk: can't remember any offhand but NOT spiders.<br />
<br />
The above mobs I have a harder time gaining and holding aggro on.  This is after ~325 LDoN successes that I base this on (not bragging just saying I've had plenty of time to decide if it's my imagination or not).  *IF* I am puller or *IF* I am breaking mez on a mezzed mob listed above, there are zero issues with aggro.  If I am MT and I have to tag off of the puller (doesn't matter what class or what they used to pull with), I have a harder time peeling and holding them than I do any other mobs in the same zone.  These mobs may ping pong between group members who have hardly done any damage; whereas any other mobs in the zone don't even look at anyone else but me.<br />
<br />
This is for all-65 normal setting adventure groups.  While I open myself to a bit of &quot;you suck at aggro&quot; criticism by posting, I believe this to be true dispite anyone else's experiences to the contrary.  Staple spells for me = CD, CD and oh, CD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think it's  a pretty established fact that proximity affects aggro in funny ways, too.<br />
<br />
Festering to pull and CD on incoming, and still occasionally the slower will draw from me if he slows on incoming and is between me and the mob.  You'll notice it most with pets, and once aggro is drawn through proximity, it's very hard to pull it back, even if someone else runs up and draws aggro as the other guy is backing away.  <br />
<br />
Still, I've never had an issue with CD or any other darkness, never had an issue with Terror line at distance, and I am very much enjoying the new taunt failure messages.  We're in a good place, aggro-wise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ashrai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I went and did a search for &quot;LDON Spiders Agro&quot; (because I remembered seeing something about this before)<br />
<br />
And came up with this thread : http://www.shadowknight.org/forums/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=18625<br />
<br />
Here's the thing: there is never going to be 1 perfect thing that works 100% of the time. While there is the school of thought that says you can train a monkey to stand and spam CD and a taunt now and then and be a passable SK, there's the school that believes it takes skill. Most times, I think it's somewhere in the middle. While yes there are a couple of things we have that we can do every damn time and end up looking like an agro god, it's the adjusting for the situation without losing stride that makes the difference. <br />
<br />
There are so many variables all happening at once that it can be impossible to tell what went wrong. Someone sat, even tho they swore they didn't.  Proximity agro happened. The hamster that powers the server had to take a break and lag happened. Someone's got taunt bound to their forward key. The Druid doesn't know that chain snaring at 99% is going to piss the mob off. Etc.<br />
<br />
Whether CD isn't as effective on other mobs, I can't prove and don't really worry about. Because we still have enough at our disposal to just switch out for the adventure and use something else.</div></div><hr />

<br />
About 85 LDoNs in MM and still wonder why the spiders seem to bounce more than others.  Even when I am DPS rather than MT, I know as I start that first spear that it is likely that I will get a return on my investment...<br />
<br />
Have also been wondering if range is a stronger component during LDoNs.  It sometimes feels like you better have a nice battle formation if you wish to prevent slower aggro...<br />
<br />
Not a complaint, situational challenges are the way I view the LDoN portion of the game.  It does not bother me if some of the challenges are not as clearly identified as others.  Makes it more interesting reading everybody's impressions...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">klotar is pretty much on target.<br />
the difference is they're classified as animals... animals are noticably less agroed by CD for some reason. the wrulon guards in HoH are the same.<br />
<br />
i hate it when i get that one miraguls adv that's full of animals. for that one i load up fear and use both CD &amp; fear</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Huughr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">For that issue, in ldon i use both fear and either cd or festering. This way i can switch from cd to fear or add a second snap aggro spell if pulling breaking went wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Huughr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">For that issue, in ldon i use both fear and either cd or festering. This way i can switch from cd to fear or add a second snap aggro spell if pulling breaking went wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kalderic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">/agree Klotar</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Menon Lifeblight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Klotar and window are correct, for those mobs I need to cast CD approximately twice as much.  For some adventures I'll simply load Fear, because that seems to have the same aggro impact across the board.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'll also cuncur that some mobs react differently.<br />
<br />
There is a Time level LDoN raid where the dogs come red, hasted and seem to run at bard speed. Aggro on them is very different, and if you don't change what you are doing, one dog can rape 4-5 clerics before it's under control.</div></div><hr />
