<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Flakz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, I was fightin today in PoV and was using a WB (yes yes I know, get a WMBS, i have one, i like WB for defense) augmented with mirror 1.  Had mental corruption up, and with maxed DEX I didn't get a single proc in 1 hour.  I got the mirror proc, but no mental corruption.  I switched to 1hs and shield.  I use a Adjutant's Saber (un-augmented) which procs etheral stun.  I proc'd both the stun and mental corruption with this, regular amount 3-4 times a fight.  Dunno if it's cause of the aug on the WB or what, but if anyone else is having similar probs, post, cause this needs to be fixed! <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Savoline</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">procs for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Flakz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">with an augmented weapon?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grarg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ive noticed on occasion it stops procing, usually when i have chanter buffs up, i just re-cast it and it seems to fix it.<br />
<br />
Sometimes I have to click it off first.<br />
<br />
Else there is some stacking rule with innate procs and those of chanters that I do not understand yet.<br />
<br />
I read somewhere here that the order of casting, or the spell icon order is important, not sure and cant seem to get a definitive comment.<br />
<br />
I havent tried to definitively test it yet, its like &quot;Oh no! where's my mana gone! Fix it fast! 8)<br />
<br />
Hope i helped.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grarg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Typical, i read another post that explained that the MC buff has to be the earliest buff in the slot line up or NDT's proc will override it.<br />
<br />
REcommended to junk buff a slot first then click off and cast MC.<br />
<br />
Sounds like a plan to me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Flakz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">cool, thx for the nfo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ramgar SK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I 2 box with my enchanter, and I use Boon frequently.   If boon is cast before MC, MC doesn't proc, and vice versa.<br />
<br />
My WMBS procs just fine regardless though.  (I have it aug'd with the 50 pt lifetap.)</div></div><hr />
