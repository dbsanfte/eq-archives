QotD movie sucked, read more.</div></div><hr />

who the fuck asked you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shadowblade</div><div class="date">06-30-2005, 08:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That movie was fucking gay! If I saw George micheal, Elton John and Micheal jackson fucking in walmart carpark it still wouldnt be as gay as that movie!<br />
<br />
I think Aaliyaa pissed someone off up there when she made that movie and now shes dead cause of it.... They couldnt even give her &quot;correct&quot; vampire fangs.<br />
<br />
Lestat's Metal band &quot;Satans night out&quot; got turned into Nu-metal rubbish. Korn is shit period.<br />
<br />
Seriously, The movie was 100 times more gay than the book (which was actually quite cool, if you can forget the bi-sexual vampires.) Pitiful considering there is a wealth of homo-erotic shit that happends in the Vampire Chronicles, enough to make He-man blush in fact, and they didnt even touch it. Yet it still was thousands of times more gay than books ever could be. Quite an accomplishment<br />
<br />
What happened to the witches and all the ancient Egyption violent goodness?<br />
What happened to the biblical pokes, evil masterplan and good wholesome genocide masterplan exacted by &quot;the queen?&quot; <br />
What happened to Kayman and his penchant for ripping people to shreds and sucking on thier juicy eyeballs when he feeds? (arguably the best character in the book, who was excluded from the film entirely.)<br />
What happened to lestat with new found power bestowed on him by the queen. Murdering hundreds of people and making thier brains explode by thought alone at a vampire temple in africa? (Think it was africa read it along time ago)<br />
<br />
the list goes on .....<br />
<br />
Basically it was a cash in from the original film, a huge cop-out. I guess they thought the general populace could not handle the &quot;theme&quot; and yet another addition to the wealth of pathetic vampire films in existance. In fact Im still yet to see a decent one.<br />
<br />
Fucking gay. :mad:</div></div><hr />
