<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>drazilyob</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I honestly don't have the time and sometimes just don't remember to memorise these spells.  Remembering just as the mob is inc is so annoying, and then realising that no matter what I do, it wont turn up.  It's not as if I can exploit with it, if it has, say, a 1 minute, or half a minute, or 20 second recast time - oh no! You could VoT maybe two people a minute.  Big whoop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mystina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I agree with that.<br />
<br />
This spell is very NOT convenient to use atm, I'd like to be able to memo it just before a boss fight, not beeing forced to keep it memmed whole raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Liabach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i like the long recast, its perfect.  sure the first time you mem it its annoying to wait, but the 9min recast is like an eggtimer.  ungrey spell means you have 1 min to rebuff the worrier ma.  perfect.  dont touch it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jabbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">heh...  We used to keep an SK channel on raids for Guildies and guests to help coordinate casting Voice buffs.  Wasn't a very busy channel of course, since it was used just for that.<br />
<br />
I did, however, hot-key a line reminding SK's to Mem it if they could, and to definitely mem it about 20 minutes before a boss fight.<br />
<br />
Here was something interesting.  Last night I was MA'ing for a PoV WW group.  I was w/o KEI for the bulk of the evening, and actually cast Voice of Terris (I'm 61st) on myself for aggro management.  I was surprised just how useful it was!  I might just do that a bit more often.  <br />
<br />
One Terror of Terris, one snare, Black Bastardsword, and using my Taunt and I never lost aggro once.  No matter what the casters did (and we were a bit caster heavy) the mobs stayed centered nicely right on me. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Valkyria Grymreaper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">MAing or in a raid, my best voice spell is always memmed. Useful for me or whoever is tanking, or the MT for the raid.<br />
<br />
I'm happy with it the way it is.'</div></div><hr />
