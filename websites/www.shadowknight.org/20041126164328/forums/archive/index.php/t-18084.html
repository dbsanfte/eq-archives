<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Khat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A group of us had easily completed a Slaughter in MMC so we decided to grab <br />
another adventure.<br />
This time it was:<br />
<br />
Type: Assassination<br />
Target: Vandrelash the Wary<br />
Location: Mistmoore Catacombs; Asylum of Invoked Stone<br />
<br />
Group make-up:<br />
<br />
61 Cleric<br />
61 Bard<br />
60 BeastLord<br />
59 Enchanter<br />
59 Rogue<br />
58 SK (me)<br />
<br />
<br />
We managed to get to the boss mob reasonably well and none of us, (as far as I know), knew what to expect from him.<br />
<br />
In a nutshell, we got splattered in no time flat.  I haven't been able to find any info on this mob anywhere and wonder if anyone has had any experience with him.<br />
<br />
He did have a pet and was max hitting for 669 fast and frequently.<br />
Casters never really had time to get spells off.<br />
<br />
We ran out of time so decided to try again for the lesser reward but got booted from zone during the 2nd fight with him; which went a little better but only lasted a few seconds due to boot.<br />
<br />
Anyone have info on this guy?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ramgar SK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not on him in particular, but assassination targets are two to three times the mob as anything else in the dungeon.<br />
<br />
They hit twice as hard, twice as fast, and have a good 3-4 times the amount of health.<br />
<br />
A slower is a must IMO, and a chealer is too.  Warn your healer to heal early on the first one.<br />
<br />
Watch out for enchanter assassinations, they can be a lot of trouble with mez and charm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nambkab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Also it helps when the tank is the highest level in the group, or at least higher than the average group level.  In this case, you were doomed from the get-go unless everyone was on their toes and knew what to expect.  My first assassination I was the lowest in the group and the mob conned red to me.  We fortunately had two healers and when the mob finally dropped I had 2% life.  Second assassination I was the highest in the group by a couple levels and the mob was a dark blue con and was quite honestly a wimp.  So be very prepared or make sure you are the highest level in the group :) .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dester</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Assasinatins are very hard w/ out slow.  Doable, but your healer basicly has to chain cast CH and you life tap if you take any spike damage.  Still not pretty though<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ganaith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Its easier then it looks. Cleric need to spam fast heals till BL slows the mob, then its owned. without slow, nothing can really keep you alive. especially not if you get a lifetap proccing named which i once had.</div></div><hr />
