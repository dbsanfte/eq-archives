<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Duke Malagen Shai'Kar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes, we need focus effects that are not so limited (based on resists). We need focus effects that boost all DoT's, rather than Poison or Disease DoT's, we need focus effects that boost all DD's, rather than Magic or Disease DD's. So it means we would need more of those items to cover our spellbook than a Paladin would.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Skvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">So you think that <br />
Paladins getting 22 items with a focus on and SKs 14<br />
Paladins getting 30% spell haste focus and SKs getting nothing<br />
Paladins getting 30% distance focus and Sks 25%<br />
Paladins getting 30% duration focus and Sks 25%<br />
<br />
Isnt balanced itemization ? Your losing the plot Brael, its perfectly in balance and SKs are not at all getting the shaft from SOE ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rueeliar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Been watching it for a while.  Even our pallies see it and think the expansion is a little too &quot;paladin-friendly.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hsrool</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Sk can wear Shroud of Corruption, giving us 30% distance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Svartrot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I doubt the devs have made the kind of comparison Brael does for all the classes, if any.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Discordant Distance<br />
<br />
      1: Increase Spell Range by 30%<br />
      2: Limit: Max Level(65)<br />
      3: Limit: Spell Type(Beneficial only)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Discordant Distance is 30% to beneficial spells only Hsrool so it's a meaningless focus for us.  Sure we could increase the distance on buffing our pet or Resist Cold or something but that would be like a paladin complaining about the lack of Fire DD focus for them.  Discordant Range is the 30% distance focus we want, which if you'll look you'll see that it exists on 5 items, each pure caster muramite legs has it as well as a primary/secondary priest item.<br />
<br />
Malagen, if we got an equal number/quality of MR focus to their targeted heals, to all to their group heals, and distance it would be fine.  Really dot damage focus/duration doesn't mean a whole lot.  The main point was in the healing, but there are 11 types of focus there for each of us.  Theirs are all just more per category and better categories.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Visvires</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Agreed, focuses are way too specific for sk, need more &quot;blanket&quot; things.<br />
<br />
Pretty poor when I have to get 135hp qvic mask to bag, because it has vengeance of eternity on it &quot;for kiting&quot;<br />
<br />
However, stop with all the &quot;omgz soe h8s sks&quot; it looks childish and is unnessacary. Hopefully, it's a design oversight, and handling things in an immature nature isnt the way to get things &quot;fixed&quot;<br />
<br />
What I have personally found, is that replacing grimors boots and arms is very difficult, otherwise i find itemization as far as focus's go not bad. Conservation of xegony is hard to get, outside of the straited earring and cuirass from uqua or quarm neck. I know there are other items, but essentially if you dont grab one of those 3 your SoL.<br />
<br />
There simply is no replacement for burning affliction in GoD atm out of raid level gear, with the exception of the mask I mentioned before.<br />
<br />
Faerune and distance are hard to get, but not impossible.<br />
<br />
However, look at potime, focuses werent all that abundant there either..<br />
<br />
Have to take things in context as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Askeer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">25% mana pres - Rayin's Gauntlets of Abhorrence (Miasmic Spear only)<br />
25% mana pres - Trimdet's Gauntlets of Chivalry (stuns only)<br />
<br />
That means that in the eyes of the devs, Miasmic spear is as important to us as stuns are to paladins...really sad considering that most SKs use that spell maybe 15% of the time if that...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Scal4u</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Trimdet was a much better Paladin than Rayin was a Shadowknight :(<br />
I'd love to see Rayin's Gauntlets with 25%pres to Touch of Innoruuk and the Arms with 40% Magic or even Fury of Solusek. Atleast Chronoburn has a situational usage, tho I would rather see Druzzil's Range or VoE.  As far as the other items go, SoE didn't completely fuck up as the items are not SHD only.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Vermadas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yeah, it sucks.  I've been fortunate about some of my choices, but really do wish there were some more options.  Especially for the elusive MR DD focus.  We'll have to wait and see what comes out of Tacvi, but I'm not keeping my hopes up, that's for sure.  And does anyone else think that the loot out of Txevu is really bland compared to Inktu'ta?  Besides the boots that is :)<br />
<br />
By the way, for the sake of completion, Stained Threadbare Cape (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68954) and Stained Fur Mask (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=69069) also have the 45% poison DoT focus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Mawegda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Xxeric's Battleworn Bracer was the item that made me post on the official SK board, really fed up with it now; not that plate arms and gaunts are enough they add another plate item with an absolutely useless focus for us ....</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kether</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">At its core the focus itemization of GoD SUCKS.  The majority of the SK dilemma as it relates to foci are a result of that poor general design.<br />
<br />
Make a Magelo of what you would wear as a tank.  Then compare that to a 'focused' Magelo.  Then notice the shortcomings in shielding, avoidance, ac, and hp LOST trying to improve us in the all around fashion that should take place.<br />
<br />
Focus 'splintering' has broadened.  While still affecting SKs more than Paladins the latter are by no means happy.  I have gone from needing:<br />
<br />
Healing mod, distance mod, beneficial preservation mod<br />
<br />
To needing:<br />
<br />
Targeting healing mod, group healing mod, beneficial distance mod, detrimental distance mod, and preservation mod.<br />
<br />
The 'best tank' setup for us now has me with Targeted healing mod, a 30% beneficial haste mod, a 23% all spell haste mod (irrelevent for me) a magic DD focus (irrelevent for me), and general preservation.<br />
<br />
At the moment I am overjoyed that there are no great upgrades to RZ visor in GoD, lest I have to replace that general distance mod with yet TWO more 'bed/det' mods.<br />
<br />
As tanks:<br />
We are penalized by skill caps<br />
We are penalized by the lack of specialization<br />
We are penalized by lower value mana regen on the clicks we can use<br />
We are penalized by raw hp<br />
We are penalized by HP AAs<br />
We are penalized by AC tables<br />
We are penalized by DI mod<br />
We are penalized by lack of effective tanking disciplines<br />
<br />
But apparently that is not YET ENOUGH.<br />
<br />
Now we are to be penalized with itemization.  We either have to choose to keep our durability up and let our spells suffer, or we are play 'scavenger hunt' to bolster our spells and fall even further behind in tanking.<br />
<br />
Personally... I think they should nerf the crap out of endurance regen and the various 'pure melee abilities'.  Then place the regen and 'foci' they need to reach their full power on a slew of items and let them feel the sting of equipment selection.<br />
<br />
Nah, doubt that would happen.  Wouldn't want to alienate the elementary school mentality that is being pandered to with the current state of warrior uberdom.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Kether, thats nice and all but SK's can't even make a &quot;focused&quot; magelo, the focus effects we need simply don't exist.<br />
<br />
Theres no 30% distance focus, theres no upgrade from Fury of Solusek (for HT), theres no improved duration on recourses.  Infact the only 3 focuses which benefit us that are aviable on an item are 45% to lifetaps on ONE item, 30% to everything on ONE item (Ikkinz level item I might add), and 20% mana pres on 3 items.  Thats it, there are no other useful focus effects for us this expansion.  You almost have a bigger selection of 45% targeted heal items than we have of all focus effects combined.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kether</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I was pointing out that the focus itemization sucks for tanks, period.<br />
<br />
A general &gt;30% DD focus isn't found in the game.  Neither is a general healing focus beyond 30%.  The discrepency on range foci may be a sensitive point (nuke ranges would safely eclipe 250ft in range) as far as encouters go.  Recourses may for general balance purposes be something they don't want to focus at this time.  Other spells such as non damaging debuffs, stuns, CHs, fast casting spells etc. aren't necessarily 'focused' in all regards.<br />
<br />
You can put it to SOE any way you like, but focusing on shear number of foci or slots for said foci WITHOUT taking into account the 'tank opportunity cost' of their underlying item just gives them another vehicle to screw you over.<br />
<br />
Player: Itemization sucks, I want my other foci so I have options!<br />
SOE:  Hmm, ok.  We have added the missing/underpopulated foci now.<br />
<br />
Player:  WTF!  You expect me to give up 4% shielding and 10 ac for a 45% DD Disease foci?  Now I either have to loot TWO items for that slot, ignore it completely and resort to a Time item, or settle for being an even worse tank?  Wait, if I get all of them then I lose 20 avoidance, 14% shielding, 53 ac?<br />
SOE:  WTF, we do what you ask and still we get bitched at!<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't have a problem with them putting foci with 45% on items with some nonoptimal tank stats as long as there are 40% (and preferably general) foci on tank-optimal gear.  Some focus effects are flat out missing and that is a problem.  But just inserting them randomly won't fix the overall problem.  The number of current foci can not exist within the current 'general-specific' foci differential and maintain a healthy balance unless a 'trade-in' NPC was made to accomodate the various needs of the disparate classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">General &gt;30% focus has one important point: HT.  Thats the only type of focus that works on it.  Thats why it's important, if they were to include HT on regular MR or DR focuses then I wouldn't care but they don't.<br />
<br />
Range focus have no random component.  I think thats the reason they're lower value than other focus.  It's always a 20%, 25%, 30%, etc increase in range not a 1-30% increase.  Once again thats perfectly fine, the problem with range focus is that it's the single most important focus an SK can get and we not only don't get access to the GoD upgrades of said focus but out of the 3 items with 25% focus we can use two of them are poor choices for a tank to use and the other is an item from time.  Our 4th option is an earring from time with 20% range which for the era it comes from is good, but is quickly outclassed in HP/AC/Resists by GoD items.  The way distance focus is for us is similar to if Wizards were forced to give up 500 mana to upgrade their fire DD focus from 35% to 45%.<br />
<br />
Good stat tank items need to have focus effects on them however.  You're right on that part and I agree, I'm just more concerned with the focus effects that my class needs actually existing in the first place.  When I look at plate armor in GoD it feels like they itemized it by breaking effects down by how many can use it.  80% of plate users melee so 80% gets melee effects, 40% cast beneficial spells so 40% get beneficial focus, 20% sing so 20% get bard effects, 20% use detrimental items so 20% get detrimental focus.  Then on top of that the detrimental focus aviable isn't even the right effects.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Samir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Everything you say is absolutely correct Brael, but this isn't a new problem. Even back to the Ornate and Grimror's BP the spell and focus effects were just crazy and were never addressed nor fixed. When our top ten list came out, itemisation recieved this grand response:<br />
<br />
6. Itemization revision. (no change planned at this time) <br />
<br />
And shortly after it was removed from our list altogether. <br />
<br />
The whole idea of working through an expansion is to receive some sort of reward in the better loot that drops, but currently I see very little purpose to upgrade from Elemental or Time armor to Raylin's other than the 60 or so HP increase. <br />
<br />
It's not too late to rework the effect's on Raylin's - a range focus, mana preservation and a discordant magic or general dd would be a great start.</div></div><hr />
