<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kenshi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was wanting to know if Vindi was tankable by me(magelo linked on my name at bottom).  Have one cleric (65), 3-4 druids 62+, chanter (65), 3 necros (65), and a buntch of 50+ diff classes. I'm thinking no, but most the cleric and a couple of the necros are thinking yes. Was wanting to know from those that have killed him if it was doable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">how many pepel in the raid all together? im thinking you will go down during the fight if its a long one, but none the less it will be very tight on the cheal chain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kenshi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Varies between 12 to 18 people on the raids.  Next tanks are a 56 pally (not sure on hp and ac) and 55 warrior (not sure on hp and ac).  Is also a 65 ranger with about 5k buffed (not sure on their ac never asked them).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Cyrielle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">get 2K more hp and maxed defensive aa then maybe, otherwise it seems really close.<br />
Vindi would have at least 500 dps on you wich is barely your buffed HP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Soltisce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">as it stand now you have no chance. sorry but thats the blunt truth. my AC is much higher than yours and i can tank him barely. i tanked him a  bit when MT went down. i went down a few moments after,  but luckily one of the wizzies took him out so we didnt wipe. anyways, if u tanked Vindi with your present gear/aa youd surely go down in about 1 min, if that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kenshi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">No reason to be sorry.  I already had a feeling I wouldn't be able to.  Was asking to make sure I was right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Drifting</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Id say you'll need around 500 to 1000 more raw hp and 100 to 150 more raw AC.  At ur lvl, try for some BoT groups, try for some upgrades, start up some pick up raids, ect.  Should get some decent gear from just doing that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>cames</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I want to add a different spin on this a bit.<br />
<br />
I agree that you need more HP and AC.  On top of that you need more DPS out of your guild.<br />
<br />
Your going to run a 4 - 5 sec Cheal chain and then beat on Vindi.  In essence the guild calculation has to run like this...<br />
<br />
Vindi's HPs/Guild DPS = Secs to kill Vindi<br />
<br />
(Your HPs/Vindi's DPS) * Secs to kill Vindi = Number of Cheals you will need<br />
<br />
It looks like you will have a 3 person Cheal chain (leaving one for spots/Rampage healer) so, basically people will be chain casting Cheal.  Depending on there mana pool, you can give a good estimate of:<br />
<br />
Lowest mana pool Cheal Chainer/Mana per Cheal * Length of Cheal Chain = Max number of Cheals/Fight<br />
<br />
So, then its a pretty easy comparison.<br />
<br />
Why I am saying this is even if you up your stats, the guild itself can not make that equation work at the moment.  So, what I would do is find a copy of the old Mob Tier Chart (Vindi is a Tier 3 mob iirc) and see where you stack up as a a guild on Tier 1 and 2.<br />
<br />
So, can you guys do the Kunark Dragons including Trak?  If not, then Vindi is out of reach.  Set a plan to work your way up the chart (increase guild size, up levels of folks, add stats to your main folks [FT for healers, HPs/AC for MAs]) and you will get there soon enough.<br />
<br />
One last thing.  Expect at least 1 add during the fight and have a plan on dealing with it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>cames</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Whoops error in Formula #2!<br />
<br />
Should be<br />
<br />
Your HPs/Vindis DPS = Seconds Vindi Takes to Kill you<br />
<br />
Seconds to Kill Vindi/Seconds to Kill you = Number of Cheals<br />
<br />
<br />
Just as an aside there are 3 basic variables in the overall formula:<br />
<br />
1 - Guild DPS<br />
2 - Your Mitigation of Vindi DPS &amp; Your HPs<br />
3 - Healer Mana Pool + Regen (you could adjust the cheal chain to include KEI/VoQ regen estimates once you knew about how long the chain would last).<br />
<br />
Thus, guilds that are moving up the basic guild chart are working on those items.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>eansdad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I've seen a raid of 42 ave lvl of 61 get wiped by Vindi. Of course it wasn't a guild raid and most never had done him. On the other hand I have also been on guild raids with 3 clerics, 2 druids and 2 shaman for heals and it was more than enough to handle him. Raid had 18 people w/ 3 rangers with am3, 2 wiz, 3, clerics, 2 druids, 2 shaman, 2 warriors, 1 monk, 1 enchanter, 1 bard and a Pally. Ave lvl was 63 though and MT had 8k HP buffed. Most were in some ornate gear, high-end bazaar gear, Velious armor. I'd say try it out. Nothing to lose but alittle exp. Never know you might win.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Soltisce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">the point to a Vindi raid is this:<br />
<br />
<br />
get a good HP War to tank Vindi, kill Vindi before Defensive wears off. or get a good trio of heavy mana pooled clerics and defensive wont matter<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
get a hell alotta DPS. a few triple backstab rogues, some TS ranger, a wizzie, and mage. DPS is key with this guy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">he also rampages so if you dont have at least 2 decent tanks or enough heals on the rampage tank; he's just going to rampage your raid to death.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>cames</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I guess the others are posting in my vein, which is this.  Any main raid mob for a guild at any level is not an individual issue its a group issue.<br />
<br />
The main elements are:<br />
<br />
DPS, Healing, HPs of MTs<br />
<br />
If you want to grow your guild capability, you grow these stats of your characters.<br />
<br />
Raising your HPs alone don't fix the other elements and with Vindi create a Rampage tank.<br />
<br />
Even with that, you can lag lose (a cleric lags in the Cheal chain and you die - no tank switching/backup tank strategy).  So guild/raid size makes a difference.<br />
<br />
Now the issue is the most uber of us could probably 1 group Vindi (so he's a 1 group mob right?).  But those folks would never do Vindi, except to prove they could 1 group him.  So, he is still a raid target for many guilds and in the way to Statue/AoW for others.<br />
