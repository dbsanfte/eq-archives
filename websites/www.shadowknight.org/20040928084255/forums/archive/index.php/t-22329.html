I hope these reinstated accounts are flagged in some way so people know that they have been previously banned from the game.<br />
These people have gone beyond multiple warnings to the point that SOE deemed their actions so bad that they didn't ever want them playing regardless that they were paying.<br />
<br />
If this were to happen I'd want a way by looking at the char that they were banned at some point.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Manslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Its not like people that get banned don't continue to play.  Although this does save them the hassle of getting a new account etc.</div></div><hr />

Isn't the bright green color, the GM's color?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Khat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Maybe they could add, &quot;...The Tard&quot; to their name.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Lejina Bloodbath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If they cared about your game enjoyment, they would not put a label above the heads of the former banned people : they would keep them banned.</div></div><hr />

<br />
most of the ones I've dealt with would deserve it:P<br />
<br />
Seriously though, pick a color.   Just kinda sucks to see them let loose in the general population:/<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Belyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">They have always let banned people come back, all ya had to do was send emails...kinda like talking to a parol board.<br />
And for those that they wouldnt let come back or the person just didnt want to go through the email hassle, they could just make new accounts or ebay and get a name change.  I have seen banned people with new 65 toons right after they where banned appear in high end guilds with almost the same name of the toon that got banned.  I have yet to hear of an IP address ever getting banned.<br />
<br />
Nothing new here.</div></div><hr />
