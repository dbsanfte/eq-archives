Today at the fabled frenzy, someone went afk for 2 hours, we moved him to the back of the list, he came back, begged to get his spot back, we didn't give it to him.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>vilesoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">as gay as ninja looting is....really, look at it this way:<br />
<br />
There were many people there....most form other guilds, possibly many that hold a grudge....<br />
<br />
maybe he just did it to piss off whoever was behind him.<br />
<br />
Either way, this is what happens when a mob is way overcamped.<br />
<br />
Really, at the least I would have dealt with the person's guild leader to ensure that the event doesn't happen again.  Actually I know of someone on my server that got punted from his guild for a Ninja on the FFBSS....he can now enjoy his haste, considering a good 80% of the server won't accept him anymore.<br />
<br />
Funny part...paladin....defender of truth and all that is good...ninja looting....kinda ironic....but asshats come in all shapes and sizes anymore...</div></div><hr />
