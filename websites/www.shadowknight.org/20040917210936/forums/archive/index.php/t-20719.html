<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>gaeanin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been reading a few of the posts and have noticed that everyone seems to recommend doing either Combat Stability or Agility before Natural Durability.<br />
<br />
My question is simply: which is better and why?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any information you may be able to provide.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>nimic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Natural durability will give you aproximately 300 hp at level 3, which is likely less then 1 hit from the mobs you are fighting.  This makes it somewhat of a bad deal.  However, ND3 provides more hp which is useful for taking spell damage - so it has its uses.<br />
<br />
Combat Agility will prevent you from getting hit in some cases.  Not getting hit is better then getting hit for less in my opinion, as avoiding damage is always better then getting hit for lower damage.<br />
<br />
Combat Stability will help to alleviate damage spikes, which might make your health more predictable during a fight for the cleric to heal you.<br />
<br />
I personally went for CA3 before CS3...  However, the consencous seems to be to get them both, and just choose whichever one first that fits your play style best.  Supposedly, they are both about equal in improving your tanking ability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Daeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">CA=CS basically except for the fact that Ca causes the mobs to miss more so therefore less interrupt while pulling etc so most people go CA before CS.<br />
<br />
ND is good if your raiding that 300 hp is worth it for taking Ae damage</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>gaeanin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Firstly, thanks for the information you have allready provided, but I have just one additional question...<br />
<br />
When ND is calculated does it take into account buffs. I get the impression that direct hp buffs (like virtue) will not be effected by ND. What about stamina buffs though?<br />
<br />
For example if i had 3500 hp unbuffed, then ND3 would give me an extra 350hp.<br />
<br />
But if i had the shammy stamina buff on, and had, say 4000hp, would i then get an extra 400hp or only an extra 350?<br />
<br />
And a further question about CA and CS...<br />
<br />
Am i correct in assuming that CA gives you a CHANCE to avoid an incoming hit completely whereas CS mitigates a percentage of ALL incoming damage?<br />
<br />
Thanks again in advance :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>nimic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">ND3 is 10% of your NAKED HP including any stamina bonuses.<br />
<br />
So if you have 3000 hp naked, ND3 gives 300 hp.<br />
<br />
If you have 3100 hp naked with max stamina, then you'll get 310.<br />
<br />
It does NOT take into account any +HP items or buffs (other then STA buffs).<br />
<br />
Yes CA gives a greater chance of being missed, and CS mitigates incoming damage...  I am not sure specifically how CS mitigates, but I know its not as straight forward as it might seem.  Do a search on combat stability, I know there have been a few good threads on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dakkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">People usually recommend CA before CS and CS before ND for tanks (unless you're really low on hps to start with).<br />
<br />
CA reduces the overall amount you get hit by about 10%.  It also reduces the amount of proc damage you take from mobs by 10% (because mobs don't proc on misses), and ditto a 10% reduction in stuns.<br />
<br />
CS and ND only affect the smaller proportion of hits that aren't avoided in the first place, and don't reduce procs so they're slightly less effective than CA.<br />
<br />
ND only boosts your hps before pure hitpoint buffs by 10%, not your total hps, so is even less effective in reducing your overall damage taken while tanking than CS.<br />
<br />
/shrug, those are just the tanking arguments.  A raiding caster might well go ND3 before CA to be able to take more AE hits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">ND gives you 10% more hp, NOT 300 or 350 or whatever more hp..... this is important, because the more hp you have, the more it will help you.<br />
<br />
IT DOES affect hp on gear.  Look for yourself... remove a +hp item when you have ND trained and you'll lose more hp than is listed on the item.  A 100 hp item should give about 110 hp with ND3, even apart from any stamina on it (easier to see the effect if the item doesn't have any sta since that won't screw up the hp you're seeing).  IT DOES affect all stamina effects.  If you gain hp from a stamina buff, you'll gain even more hp due to ND.<br />
<br />
The only thing it does not affect are direct hp buffs (Virtue, Symbol, 9, Focus, etc).<br />
<br />
With that in mind, I'm not quite sure why someone would recommend ND more strongly if you don't have much for hp, since it'll be less effective when you have few hp.<br />
<br />
Not quite sure why people like to downplay this AA lately.  ND, CA, and CS each give about a 10% improvement to tanking ability... through mitigation, avoidance, or absorption (more hp to absorb damage).  My preference is ND first, because more hp insulates you more from damage spikes, while the other 2 do not.  The other 2 also only affect melee damage.  Not that it matters, you should get all 3 as quick as you can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">This brings up a question I had.<br />
<br />
I currently have CA1, CS1, ND3 and PE.  I've been tanking quite a bit for my guild recently (small raid targets; BoT minis, PoS nameds, Tower mini's, etc).  I have 3 AA banked at the moment and can probably grind out one to two more before the weekend, during which we have a couple raids scheduled (AoW for one).  I may or may not end up MA on these raids (we're running short on warriors).  At approximately 7300hp buffed (symbol, 9, focus and boar), would it be better for big mobs to decrease the damage spikes with CS2 or to avoid more hits with CA2?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">CA2 would be best, damage spikes aren't really going to be mitigated very well without better AC anyhow...for offtanking and rampage tanking avoidance might make more sense. You need them both asap anyhow, and the difference either way won't make a huge impact.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Menon Lifeblight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">For tanking with a CH rot, it's damage spikes that will kill you and wipe the raid.  Go with CS2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Having a MT with just ca1/cs2 and 7300 hp is probably going to wipe the raid anyhow(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>nimic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Tough question Groff... I think I'll second CS2, as more predictable damage is better for raid mobs.  Though I don't think either choice is likely to make or break you on AOW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Daeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">heh what kind of rotation would you have to run with 7300 hp tank/cs1/ca1</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>nimic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Dunno, but people seemed to manage AOW when level 60 was the limit and warriors only had 6k ish hp.  Maybe it was defensive, but I think an SK could handle this now somewhat trivial content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Dacronis did this a pretty long while back...there's a parse of it somewhere in here...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Menon Lifeblight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">No reason to do anything faster than a 2-second rot on AoW.<br />
<br />
With only 7300hp, you can be one-rounded regardless of the speed of the rot.  You just have to hope that you get lucky.  Either that or your guild has to execute the tank switch when you bite it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">You might stand a decent chance on the Statue though, good luck if you end up being the one to tank him. That'd make a pretty funny screenshot...Statue of RZ corpse with a WMBS wielding SK tank standing over it...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Statue couldn't 1 round you anyways considering he doesn't flurry... quads for what, around 1100?  Plus he's slowable.<br />
<br />
Get unlucky with flurries on AoW, and you're going down.  You've got some seriously badass clerics if you manage to live through AoW with that kind of hp/ac.</div></div><hr />
