<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kelefane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My guild is backflagging atm and ive seen some shit w/ the Corinav script that ive not noticed before...And thats bad LAG at the actual Corinav engage part which causes us to wipe and its actually everyone in the raid and its not some case where a certain few are having it...Peeps not being able to cast Spells until 10 seconds later and so on and I did my HT hotkey on Cor which has an emote and I died and Unholy Aura and the emote didnt go off until I was actually in PoT at the Time dial naked...Just wondering if this is happening on other Servers? Im on SolRo.</div></div><hr />
