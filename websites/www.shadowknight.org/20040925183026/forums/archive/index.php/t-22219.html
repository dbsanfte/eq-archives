SCS is broken and should be fixed but it is NOT a class problem and has no place in an SK top 10, its an in game description that is wrong or an implemetation that is wrong. Should either fix SCS so that it effects only spells (then people got what they bought a reduction in SPELL aggro) or should be reworded to say reduction in aggro and anyone that has already bought it refunded ...as they did with natural regen so long ago</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>cames</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">SCS is a Int Spell Caster Archetype.  Melee aggro generated by Wizards, Necros, Mages, and Chanters is not a good thing.  So it is actually GOOD for those classes that it lowers melee aggro.  It was given to SKs as we are Int based casters.  I can see Sony refunding the points but the other 4 classes that have this (and I think Priest classes get it in Gates) will not want to change it.  I think expecting this to be changed is rather laughable given the rest of the classes LIKE the way it works.</div></div><hr />

SCS won out over res slightly not by a huge landslide, chances are well be removing another item from the list next go (it gets updated every 2 weeks if you haven't caught on yet), considering the demand for res it pretty much gets a spot then in place of something wrong with our class we can actually get, so... if you wait 2 weeks you can see necro res on the list somewhere then a week or so after that and you can see no change planned at this time.

Out of these two choices, rez. If SCS toggle becomes one of our top 10 class things, it'll be a sad day, especially if they fix it for every class. Rez at least has some class relevance now that one group trials exist outside PoJ.</div></div><hr />

Alas, welcome to a Democracy and the life of an elected official.  Altough, you point out exactly why Aristotle (I think; maybe it was Plato) stated that a Democracy is the worst form of government.  To paraphrase, &quot;why would you want people who do not have a holistic image of the needs of many, voting on the needs of many?&quot;  <br />
<br />
At the same time, he recognized that it does help prevent corruption by accountability and does &quot;eventually&quot; get things done correctly ... something that doesn't necessarily happen in other forms of government.  <br />
<br />
Amazing the similarities ... <br />
Maybe Brael = Greek Philosopher ....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Dont have SCS, so its benefit right now for me would be nil.  Convergence would be nice, but those people who never need it, continue to say we dont need it.  Both issues are things that should have been resolved before.  Convergence should have been given to SKs when GoD came out, because of teh way the trials work.  SCS should have been fixed long ago, because its bugged in teh first  place, and its not a suitable AA as being on full time for SKs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Tillesia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">I'm not saying I think we're entitled to rez, or even that rez is a good idea.  I think the chances that it will serve as justification to water down the rest of our abilities are as high as the chances that it will cause us to be more desireable in groups, frankly.<br />
<br />
However, I am disturbed by Brael's disrespectful attitude towards the considered position of a large portion of the SK community.  As our community representative (appointed and not elected, I may add), Brael should at least attempt to present the community requests to Sony without delivering them to Sony still-born.<br />
<br />
All I'm saying is, if Brael delivers the request to Sony as - &quot;some Sks want necro rez.  I don't, so feel free to shoot this one down,&quot; then we shouldn't be surprised if it gets rejected.  Perhaps he should allow someone who is actually interested in the SK rez to compose the SK rez request.  When presenting a request for SK rez, it should be made clear, at the least, that:<br />
<br />
- SK utility has been diminished in the last year because of the ineffectiveness of FD pulling v. the increased effectiveness of other types of pulling and the non-scalability of our group-oriented taps.<br />
- SK rez doesn't have to be necro rez - i.e. it doesn't have to be a spell (could be an AA), it doesn't have to use the same component, and it doesn't have to recover the same amount of xp.  There are many ways to balance it.<br />
- the point of SK rez isn't to compete with other forms of rez, but to allow our groups to recover from deaths without wasting time calling in rezzing classes or waiting for the instance to finish.<br />
<br />
The point about aristotle is very appropriate.  When you've got an aristotelian &quot;philosopher-king&quot; at the helm of the government, you cannot count on his responsiveness to the community - he may benignly choose to abide by his own &quot;wisdom&quot; instead of fairly advocating for his charges.  But it is dangerous and condescending to assume that one is wiser than others.   Since Brael was not elected to this position, we cannot expect or even pressure him to respect our wishes - but we may ask him to fairly represent our views to Sony... something that I began to doubt when he posted:<br />
<br />
<br />
... considering the demand for res it pretty much gets a spot then in place of something wrong with our class we can actually get, so... if you wait 2 weeks you can see necro res on the list somewhere then a week or so after that and you can see no change planned at this time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If pallies get cleric rezzes, then we should get necro rezzes.  however...we should not get the  ability to make essence emeralds.  this would leave us to acquiring our own on other means.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">While necro rez would certainly be a very nice ability to have, it's questionable in terms of balance. The justification for giving us necro rez would be to parallel paladins' rez spell, which is potentially an important asset to a group. The problem is that giving us a rez spell would then swing the pendulum too far the other direction - we would be superior to paladins, as we have the tools to survive a wipe and they do not. For it to be balanced, they'd then need something like Escape or the like, and then you start a chain-reaction balance nightmare.<br />
<br />
It's really a sticky situation, and something should be done, as paladins' rez ability gives them an advantage over us (aside from that granted by stuns and such). The problem is that balancing it is far from cut and dry. Giving us necro rez would be equivilant to the warrior upgrades from the melee balancing - taking something from too weak to too powerful. I havn't really decided what my opinion on the necro rez situation is yet, but it's definately not as cut-and-dry as alot of you are trying to make it out to be.<br />

Either it doesn't achieve the desired effect (giving us parity with paladins) or it's just a cute way of having an equally unbalanced ability, but requiring countless extra man hours to impliment, depending on whether a &quot;re-animated&quot; cleric can rez himself or not.</div></div><hr />

I'm glad to hear that you feel you can be an impartial representative for the SK community to sony.  I was taken aback by your very strong opinions on this issue.  The manner in which one posts a request is very important as to how the request is received.  I'm concerned that if the request isn't phrased correctly it will be entirely too easy to dismiss.<br />
<br />
Fair enough about the condescending part.  I apologize if i sounded like I was accusing you of being condescending.  I merely meant to say that it's a trap that's easy to fall into, even with the best intentions.<br />
<br />
Again, I don't support rezzes because we have enough problems with balance already and rezzes will probably just fubar us more.  But the large number of people advocating the rez have a lot of valid points to make and their opinion is just as important.<br />

If the cleric can't rez himself, then it's pointless because it doesn't achieve the purpose of a rez or rez-like ability.  It doesn't give us parity with paladins for trials and the like, it gives us another reason not to get our offtanking role on raids fixed.  A rez spell would be used primarily for rezzing a cleric to avoid a total wipe and loss of progress.  In group content, where we need parity with paladins' rez spell, your proposition would be useless because you're still not going to have your cleric.  It would be useful on raids where the cleric can rez another cleric (though we have necros for that) or to return a fully buffed warrior or something, but it's not a quality raid role, not necessarily good for the game in general, and would primarily serve as another reason not to give us our offtanking role back.</div></div><hr />

Don't care either way on SCS.  NO, I repeat NO to the Rez.  <br />
<br />
Everyone read the next water down version carefully.  Think SOE.  Think Business Model.  Think customer satisfaction checklist.  Some of you think we will never get REZ.  I say it will be the first, and then subsequently, last tuning upgrade we get.  Think of it from Sony's point of view:<br />
<br />
1) It's extremly easy to implement and does not require any real time or effort to code.<br />
2) It gives SKs a unique ability for the tanking class that no one else has ... a combination of FD and Rez.<br />
3) It gives SKs a reason to be in groups and raids even if they cannot tank/off tank as well.<br />

I do not want rez to be my balancing, even with its usefulness, rez'ing is not a core ability w/ FD that I want to be known for .... snap agro and off-tanking are ... as well as being able to tank bosses.

FD+Rez is uniquely powerful because you can survive a wipe, rez a cleric, and save a raid/trial/whatever - you can't compare it to &quot;stun, heal, rez, buff.&quot;  FD+Rez would make us overpowered in some aspects, and be used (somewhat validly) as a reason not to fix us where we're underpowered.  We need something to compete with paladins' rez ability (primarily for GoD single-group content), but simply giving us a rez won't cut it.  <br />
<br />
It wouldn't help us in trivial XP groups and LDoN's, but we don't need help there by nature of why we're broken.  We're fucked because our shit doesn't scale and other class's shit scales.  That means our shit is powerful against weak content like LDoN's and pre-GoD XP mobs, but near worthless against trial mobs, raid targets, and the like.</div></div><hr />

Juding by the large, yet varied support on this board for Rez means either people are jumping on a bandwagon or there is a definate usage in multiple situations for the ability.

true, but SKs  are unique, we are the only hybrid that is not based off a &quot;priest&quot; class, instead we are based off a caster class.  This, I think is the root of our issues...seems caster classes especially necros have a lot of power behind them, and it's trying to make SKs powerful enough to stand on their own, while not making  warriors and pallies look like crap that is tough.  Priest classes all ahve some kind of healing ability.  pallies get  root, we get snare...they get heals, we get taps....they get stuns, we get terrors....etc.  Now, they have teh slay undead, which in that very narrow instance of usefulness is extremely  unbalancing, however we don't seem  to have such an ability.  That I don't mind though...asince it has RP value...however we are a trainee of the school of necromancy...to me a necro rez sounds reasonable...but I don't htink we should be able to make the emeralds...consider the rez the easy part of it...making the gmes would be the tough one.</div></div><hr />

The justification for giving us necro rez is to compete with paladins' ability to rez a fallen cleric in challenging single group content, which is fairly significant.  Giving us rez doesn't just give us parity with paladins, though - it gives us superiority.  FD + Rez &gt; Rez; we'd be able to survive total wipes, pallys can't.  Paladins would then need something to give them the ability to survive a wipe - Escape for instance.  Rogues would then need something... you get the idea.  It'd set off a bad chain reaction and we'd have a balance nightmare on our hands.  <br />
<br />
We do need something to compete with the value of paladins' rez, but giving us rez isn't the answer.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u84"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p84">It's valuable, but in and of itself, it doesn't really give us the added desirability that paladins' rez does.  <br />
<br />
Our pulling ability is more analagous to paladins' support role - group heals, buffs, etc.  It's a secondary role, and it's not so much something we can do in ernest while performing our primary role - tanking.  Our pulling role gives us something else we might be called on to do instead of tanking, not something we can do in addition to tanking.  <br />
<br />
Paladins' rez isn't so much a secondary role (except as part of the &quot;support role&quot; package, but that's not the part we need be concerned with) as it is an additional reason to pick a paladin for an existing role.  You're looking for a tank, and you know that with the paladin, if your cleric takes a dirt nap, the pally can rez him and you can keep going.  <br />
<br />
FD doesn't give us that kind of increased desirability in our existing role - it's simply a tool for performing our secondary role.  The fact that we can survive our group wiping doesn't help our desirability any - we can't accomplish anything with the rest of the group dead.</div></div><hr />

I agree that our ability to tank is more important but....<br />
In comparison to SCS, for me (in the also ran pleb division) rez would make us at least have a raid role.<br />
I admit im not at the high end watching my toon ive spent years on being bypassed by my friends cause I can no longer contribute effectively. I think this is one of the reasons why a lot of people have left the game recently. With GoD, SOE made it just toooooo dependent on the holy trinity.<br />
SCS - some people bought an AA when we were still very strong in agro holding because they had the ability to choose. Now its bitten them on the butt. SOE should refund that AA because its thier changes to the class that rendered it dissadvantageous. Look how quick they are to refund AA's they think make classes tooo powerfull.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u88"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p88">I thought this thread was just to PICK SCS or rezz and nothing else without any discussions so I picked rezz cuz I was given TWO choices. But this thread turned into discussion so I'll add mine. I, for one, never concerned about other classes thinking about our power, etc and balance cuz SOE never did it right for us for SO long so screw this. SOE just is being lazy. Cuz of laziness, getting necro rezz wouldn't worry SOE much cuz of low SK population already and they would just continue to screw us over. Even with very minor SCS fix, they will just keep screwing us over regardless. That's why I think getting necro rezz(or any equal version such as call player to corpse from anywhere and then clr can rezz his/her corpse) over SCS is a win cuz we know that we would still being screwed over even with SCS fix.<br />
<br />
Sure, we need to tank better but its already part of top 9. We only talked abot 10th item so don't need to &quot;vote&quot; for tank in place of SCS, necro rezz etc. <br />
<br />
Heh, Necro is only class with FD+rezz. Guess what happens? SOE never stopped making necros even more powerful even after they got rezz spell. Why can't we? :) Problem is that necros are way too selfish and hardly grouped in xp group. They seems to prefer soloing cuz I hardly had necro in my xp groups for so long. That means their value of rezz+FD is little in xp group content. Let SK have that cuz SK is *MUCH* more in need for group cuz of their nature of weak solo power compared to necro. When I go to places, I so much often seen necros soloing all over places. Their FD+rezz is largely unused unless they are in raids. So why not take advantage of that largely unused FD+rezz combo in xp group setting for SK when SK is better suited for this group content role than necro? <br />
<br />
Bottom line..   <br />
SK FD+rezz - group content<br />
Necro FD+rezz - group content + raid content<br />
<br />
Lot of classes are sharing their skills with other classes such as tanking (war,knights), CH (clr,druid,shm), Lull(bard,monk,etc),slow(bst,shm,bard,necro on undead), etc. Necro has full monopoly on FD+rezz. Why not SK get that to break monopoly? :)<br />
<br />
Many classes asking for other class skills haven't stopped being balanced. Monk got lull skill for the very first time last winter, I don't see them being penalized in other areas AFTER they got lull. Necro got rezz during ROK time and they haven't being penalized for it. They kept getting good stuff like charm, invisible to undead AA, so go on. Omg, we got REAL necro summon corpse way later after necros got summon corpse during POP. We STILL got other good stuff along with summon corpse. Even today, I never heard of classes whining about us having summon corpse ability. And, I hardly heard SOE or any other classes having excuse on SK balancing ALL cuz we have summon corpse ability at all.<br />
<br />
If you are soooo afraid that necro rezz will screw up our balance ability, give us anything better than SCS fix that was supposed to be universal fix instead of just SK fix such as FD hotkey, better FD, etc.</div></div><hr />

Druids get a version of CH, Paladins get rez when before they didn't. They get lulls, my point is the game evolves, classes get more powerful, characters can do stuff they couldn't before.

If you say that they will say &quot;Ok, you have rez, you are balanced&quot;, c'mon, let's not be ridiculous. A little extra utility to replace so much of our lost utility (via clickies) is in line. There isn't anything about it that would really make it unbalancing either. It would just give people a bit more reason to take us along in single group stuff and let us save a raid once in a while.<br />
<br />
SCS is a minimal issue. It affects a tiny tiny portion of SKs who made a mistake. You can say that at the time there was benefit, but even at the time, there was still detriment.

The game is dying a slow death and has been for awhile. And at this point, I think utility is more important than getting abilities that are 100% in character for SKs. Warriors, rogues, etc get spells and mana now, just under a different name. That's not particularly &quot;in character&quot; for those classes but it's been done anyway. I just want to be more useful in raids and grind groups and a necro-like rez will give that. It doesn't fix the SK class of course but it would give us what we all want - more utility, a way to be useful.<br />
<br />
As far as SCS goes.. well I don't think a toggle or refund is a bad idea but I just don't understand why anyone would have bought the damn AA in the first place. It very plainly says what it will do, a few bought it anyway and now complain that the AA works like it says it would.

The justification for giving us necro rez is to compete with paladins' ability to rez a fallen cleric in challenging single group content, which is fairly significant.  Giving us rez doesn't just give us parity with paladins, though - it gives us superiority.  FD + Rez &gt; Rez; we'd be able to survive total wipes, pallys can't.  Paladins would then need something to give them the ability to survive a wipe - Escape for instance.  Rogues would then need something... you get the idea.  It'd set off a bad chain reaction and we'd have a balance nightmare on our hands.  <br />
<br />
We do need something to compete with the value of paladins' rez, but giving us rez isn't the answer.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sorry bud--I disagree.  In my mind, SoE could easily balance this.<br />
<br />
One possibility might be adjusting the amount of XP gained.  Hell, if 93% was deemed too much, make it 50%--hell, even 0% would have been cool at times.  <br />
<br />
That surely is a drawback to me.<br />
<br />
HOWEVER---SCS on toggle vs. NEC rez is SO far down the list of issues, it's really not that big a deal to me as compared to other things.<br />

I fear that if we get a type of rez, any kind of AA feign death we could get such as that, or even a regular upgrade to death peace will not be given to us to prevent bypassing a lot of areas. Rez would be nice.. very nice. But I don't want it used as an excuse to not be given better pulling tools.</div></div><hr />

Prefer the Necro version of the rez, but if not then it should be merely a bail out tool. Hell make it something like a mini quest. Gotta turn in an EE to your Guild Master in your starting town (not just any ole trainer) they return a LORE emerald that returns a lesser amount of Exp. This way it is sort of a one shot deal (yeah easy work around but still a pain in the ass).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u124"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p124">Also need to remember that while we get Harmshield to help us get past places we might not normally be able to get to, necros get both harmshield and another DA, which can be used right after harmshield, meaning they get 36 seconds of invulnerability compared to our 18. And as for the horse, the 110k or Seru/Emp horse is basically the same, and depending on the length of the run, selo's is better than a horse, because of the instant start/stop that you don't get with the horse. Giving us a rez will not give us any game-breaking bypass ability, unless there is some place that we're all missing.</div></div><hr />

With the quick turn-over on the top ten, I think SCS. Then we can ask for the rez, hopefully more successfully than the predictions point to.<br />
<br />
It has to suck if ya bought it, and I can wait two weeks to get a few people fixed who were unfortunate enough to fall into the unforseen trap. <br />
<br />
Then I would have to urge rez.....<br />
<br />
One point hardly worth mentioning, but it isn't terribly unbalancing if we are on the Necro model, even with FD.  A pally can rez the whole grp, and in the case of an ldon, a pally and ANY other healer will suffice, as the pally can easily rez all. <br />
<br />
With the component cost, we would almost be required to have a cleric (or Pally) along, so that we could fd, then rez them....then let them rezz the rest.<br />
<br />
This gives us an ability in certain situations to compete with a pally or a warrior based on the conditions present. It might make us more valuable if there was a cleric in the group already, but significantly less valuable if the main healer is a druid or shaman.  <br />
<br />
I think the limited utility will keep it from being viewed as tresspassing on others domains and being overbalancing in ALL situations.  It would definetly provide an area where we would be better (as we can fd then rez a rezzer), but not be better in most scenarios.  It would just give us a little umph in the all-things-being-equal-desirability category.<br />
<br />
That said, it can wait 2 weeks I think. I never bought scs with my retired druid, and dont plan to (even toggled) with my SK main. But agro is I suppose broken for some,,,while rez, though it could be argued is a needed and long overdue upgrade is universally broken and thus doesnt put one sk at an advantage over another.  I'm Rambling....fix scs for the ones that NEED it fixed now, add rez in 2 weeks to help us all. <br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: maybe make the component Lore, you can use it once in say an ldon, but then have to return to your starting city or PoK to get another. Makes it good for a once an ldon oh shit scenario, but wouldn't impose on pallies. Could be used in raids (in a sequence-chain of sk's if needed) but wouldn't inpose much on necro's. And wouldn't have a high component cost to limit use.....making it similar to the thurg gate potion we all carry for awhile, use ful but you can't just go around gating all over hell's half acre.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u149"><b>PovarSK01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p149">Funny that this would be so overbalancing.  When was the last time you saw a necro res anybody but a cleric?  Just because a necro CAN res, I haven't seen it overbalance necros.<br />
<br />
If SKs could res, it might come in handy, but it's still inferior to paladin res.  Try explaining that to Sony though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As previously posted, giving us rez is a reason not to fix us as tanks.  If they put scs on a toggle, it shouldn't be for &quot;us&quot;, but for all the classes that agree with us in this department.  Again, as rez, it could be a reason not to give us attention where needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u153"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p153">By that justification, anything in our list may affect tanking fixes/upgrades.<br />
<br />
They tell us it's a list.  Each issue is unranked.  And that each issue is to be evaluated separately and independant of the others on the list.  Rez/SCS whether it's on the list or not will not affect our issue on tanking.  At all.<br />
<br />
Whether rez affects balance with other classes or not, or whether SCS needs to be fixed for all classes or just SK's etc., is another matter entirely.<br />
<br />
If we all agree strongly on tanking issues and want nothing else to affect the evaluation of that, we should submit a &quot;Top One List&quot; and leave it at that.</div></div><hr />
