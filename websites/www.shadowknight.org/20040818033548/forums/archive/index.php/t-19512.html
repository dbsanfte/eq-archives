<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>NorrynNoir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i never actually did the quest to get my adventurer stone augment and didn't realize it would allow me to port between ldon camps which sure seems useful to me.<br />
<br />
i've done some searching and determined that i'll &quot;hear a voice&quot; when i go to my hometown. now, i probably got the voice message weeks ago when i reactivated my account and ignored it but when i zoned into neriak tonite i heard nothing. tried going to the gypsy camp still nothing.<br />
<br />
anyway know off hand what npc i need to start with nerriak so i can get access to the camp porting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Khat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This (http://rpgexpert.com/317.html) should cover what you're looking for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>NorrynNoir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">thanx for the link unfortunately i knew about the voice thing and how the quest is completed, problem is i don't hear it in my home town so i have no idea who the npc for the quest is. i've tried hailing every npc i could find in the 3rd gate and commons so far but no luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Khat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Dug up an old log and found this since I couldn't remember:<br />
<br />
A mysterious voice whispers to you, 'Kwilrz Vn`Ycxa in the Cuisine Excelsior has just joined the Wayfarers Brotherhood and has some information about them, and how you can start doing odd jobs for them. You looked like the heroic sort, so I wanted to contact you . . . discreetly.'<br />
<br />
After talking to this guy, I eventually ended up hailing Vual Stoutest in Butcher Block.<br />
At this point, I said, &quot;favors,&quot; then, &quot;Morden Rasp,&quot; then, &quot;farstone magic&quot;.<br />
<br />
At this point I got the Adventurer's Stone.<br />
<br />
ADD: Oh, Kwilrz Vn`Ycxa is in 3rd Gate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>NorrynNoir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">thank you so much, i'll give that a try tonite.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">When LDoN first came out, I had a whack of alts to do this for, a couple at a time and it seemed like a hassle to go to each home town; and for one or two of my alts, I was KOS in my home town.  So I chose instead to just go to Rathe Mountains' gypsy camp close to the Lake Rathe zone for most characters.<br />
<br />
However, I forgot one alt (since I really wasn't playing him much) and decided to start levelling him.  I'd logged him on a few times to mule for me between LDoN release and now but ignored the 'whisper' messages and then they just stopped (it must have a counter).  Realizing I didn't have a stone yet to move around, I went to an adventure camp and thought I would shortcut the process and just get one there.  Nope, had to do the home town thing first... and do you think I could remember who the npc was or find it in my journal?  So I whipped him off to Rathe Mtns too and then back to the camp and all was well from there on.</div></div><hr />

Actually, they ask 4 questions and the answer to the first is &quot;adventures&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kizzestra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Actually, you can save yourself the trouble of answering the battery of questions by simply hailing the NPC that hands out the stones then say &quot;Farstone Magic&quot;. That cuts right to the nitty gritty and gets you your stone once you have completed the part in your home town.</div></div><hr />
