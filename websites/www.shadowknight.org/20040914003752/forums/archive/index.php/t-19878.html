<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">they're called geerlok's actually, if you search in bazaar you'll most likely find all of them for at most a couple hundred pp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Oagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Range from about 25pp for the brewing one - 500 to 1000pp for the Tailoring one, which has the hardest component to collect.  Also check with tinkering vendors, as some may sell them back to recoup some of the costs getting to trivial.<br />
<br />
Most server markets are flooded, keeping the prices down on all but the tailoring one.<br />
<br />
Also look at the collapsible tradeskill containers.  They make some tradeskilling a lot easier, too (especially baking).<br />
<br />
You put the geerlok in the primary slot, and it adds +5% to your skill level.<br />
<br />
The collapsible containers fit in regular bags, and you right click on them from an open inventory slot to summon a tradeskill container, which can be destroyed after use, or used to store items, since many are giant sized slots.  These range from 250-500pp per item.</div></div><hr />

Ask a friendly tinker to make one for you. There is one for every tradeskill and it gives 5% to your skill when worn.  <br />
<br />
There is one for each skill.<br />
Buy the appropriate one for your skill<br />
Place it in your primary slot<br />
Put your best INT gear on not neglecting your range nor secondary slots <br />
Find a friendly shammy to buff you (it may be psychosymatic but I find it improves sucess, not skill up, rates) <br />
Find a Chanter to cast an INT buff on you<br />
<br />
You are now good to go.  <br />
<br />
Tips- I have a bag in the bank with extra INT stuff I do put on for tradeskilling.  I also have a number of CHA items I use for the buying and selling of tradeskill items/components from NPC's.  With how much you are buying/selling the extra CHA does add up to a savings.</div></div><hr />
