<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kahel Everhate</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Heya all . I'm sitting here in the middle of Kuwait right now where I have been for the past 5 months with the Marines. I have had lots of time to read over this site and in the three years I have played EQ I can tell you this from experience....<br />
<br />
Be who ever and whatever you want to be. EQ is a great way to unwind and relaxe from a day of stressful work. Any class and race you choose is yours to use as you wish. Take Kahel, my 62nd level Human of Innoruuk. He was born in Freeport and by his 20th season was completely kos to my guild in EFP. One of the people I began grouping with played a High Elf Paladin. So that may explain why my SK is max ally to pally's and clerics of NFP and had to train in Neriak.<br />
<br />
Many say the Human race is dull, I disagree, With Kahel I was the first human on Terris Thule Server to wield a Greenmist as well as the 4th none iksar.  I've completed and mq's many 9th dain rings and am left off with just needing the final battle for my 8th shawl. I have done the Eyepatch of Plunder and as a lvl 59 tanked Gorenaire with mediocre armor. <br />
<br />
You can argue for pages and pages instead of spending time enjoying yourself on a good game ab out which race is better than what other race. I personally didn't put all of my points in sta when I built Kahel. Being only my second character I put most in int and then split the rest between str, sta and cha.<br />
<br />
Do I regret it? Not a chance! ;) I have an awesome time playing him. I still can get into most any group I want and I can solo just fine.<br />
<br />
So choose your race... but play it because it interests you not because so and so said ogres and trolls are better tanks, or that Dark Elves are better looking. Be your fantasy ;) not someone elses. The point is to have fun! =)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gaklaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">right on the dot sir i couldnt agree more, and thats why i chose troll :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Duecey Dooce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Agree on all points except one that I thought was missing:<br />
<br />
People play EQ for different reasons sheer entertainment value, social interactions, character progression and power growth, and some I truly believe may even still play this as a RPG and be playing for the immersion factor that their character brings.  The majority of people are a mixture of the above, I think I'm somewhere in the entertainment/social interaction field with just a little bit of character progression mixed in for good measure.  All of these different motives for playing will cause you to have a different approach to character creation in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Those looking for sheer entertainment put little into the game and ask for little from the game, the true casual gamer.  EQ is fairly sparse on these due to the &quot;just one more (mob/spawn/hour/uber loot/raid target) and then I'll camp&quot; mentality that it tends to promote.  These players would be more concerned with which race is the &quot;coolest looking&quot; in their opinion.<br />
<br />
Social interaction players are self-eplanatory, they log in and hit their #1 hotkey that has /w all friends, /w all GUILD,  and /gu &quot;Hiyas guildies!&quot;.  These players, as it was in my case may also be quite social outside of the game and were coaxed into the game by friends or co-workers.  This may weigh heavily with the social EQ'er when determining race.  They may consider what starting city will be most accesible for their friends to meet up with them, or maybe what race their friends are so they can pick the same.  <br />
<br />
Characters seeking progression and power growth are the type that will spend hours/days/weeks, contemplating and researching the benefits and detriments of each class.  They want to get the most bang for their buck, or more appropriately the most power for their time invested.  Any race with an experience penalty better have some great attributes to offset said penalty if they want to attract this type of player.<br />
<br />
RPG'ers are going to want to choose a race that they feel they can envelope themselves in.  The pros and cons of the different races may be a factor in their decision but not by far the determining factor.<br />
<br />
Wrong as all of these may be, they are just my opinions formed from the last few years playing and watching my guildmates/friends.</div></div><hr />
