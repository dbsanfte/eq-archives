Imo, it was well worth doing. If not for its usefulness, for a sense of completion and status.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Derraj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Angelfire is so teh suck, use this site (www.photobucket.com)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Khat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I don't wish to derail a thread and I never do so deliberately but since pic hosting is the topic du'jour here I have to vent...<br />
<br />
Am I the only one on the planet that uses the space afforded to them by their ISP to host their pics and other stuff?<br />
Surely that can't be.  FTP the crap to the space allotted to you by your provider.  Angelfire sucks, Strike9 sucks, et al.<br />
<br />
Cable users: You have space available.<br />
DSL users: You should have space available.<br />
Dialup users: That's iffy but if you do have a place to store your crap, remember that you're on dialup, not your ISP.  Speed shouldn't be an issue.<br />
<br />
This rant brought on because I was reading this thread and typing something when I realized my comma key isn't working right.  No, I don't understand the correlation either.<br />
<br />
Back-on-Track:<br />
Gratz on your accomplishment, Darkbane.  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
For awhile I had my own .com where I hosted a lot of pics for everyone, but eventually I got fed up with it.<br />
<br />
When I used Dial-up, I had web space.<br />
When I had DSL... nope Verizon doesn't think their users need it.<br />
<br />
And now that I have Cable, well, there is supposed to be web space... but the twads won't give me access. =o)<br />
<br />
So, I use angelfire. (Well actually only two pictures are hosted on angelfire)</div></div><hr />
