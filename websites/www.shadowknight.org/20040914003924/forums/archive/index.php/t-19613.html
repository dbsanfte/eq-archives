<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Squigle D'Muerte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Had interesting experience.  HT a mob with Unholy Aura and died seconds later.  When I repoped Harm Touch button was up again (of course) but Unholy Aura was also still running.  Cleric with quick rez could get you back in fight in time for multiple Full HT's.<br />
<br />
Or is that one of the things we aren't supposed to talk about? :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">rez kills UA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dester</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Not any more window.<br />
<br />
If you check your timer after you die UA is still up and usable, ive done it.<br />
<br />
Dester</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kormus the Dark Angel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's window, bear with him.<br />
<br />
Numbers &gt; in game experience for him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Krazaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It's window, bear with him.<br />

Do people even read anymore, or do they just sling insults around?<br />
<br />
UA does not go away when you die.<br />
<br />
UA does go away when you get rezzed.<br />
<br />
Yes, you can bind zerg UA HT, but if you get rezzed back in, you lose UA and can only deal the base 4800 HT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kahntun Derstand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">But if you run back, you can still use it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">good one kormus... too bad i'm right and you're wrong as usual.<br />
<br />
kahntun, i haven't tried it, but it probably would work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Soltisce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">no Window your wrong. ive done that tactic on several occasions, it works.  bind, UA/HT, Die, run back ASAP and, HT again ( UA is still up).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Lejina Bloodbath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Wow, nice one Soltisce, window just agreed that UA would likely work if you would just do a bind rush with no rez. So why are you saying that he is wrong? You are agreeing with what he just said in your next sentence.<br />
<br />
If you just ignored his last reply, then you just did the same error Kormus did earlier, even thought it has been showed why he was wrong.<br />
<br />
Ill resume it again for the slow bastard, he may get the idea at last : Death does not kill UA, but rez does, fucking illiterate.<br />
<br />
Jesus peoples, try to read the thread you're looking at before posting.</div></div><hr />
