<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jupke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">*The Poopie List* <br />
GHOST POOPIE: The kind where you feel the poopie come out, but there is no poopie in the toilet. <br />
<br />
CLEAN POOPIE: The kind where you poopie it out, see it in the toilet, but there is nothing on the toilet paper. <br />
<br />
WET POOPIE: The kind where you wipe your butt 50 times and it still feels unwiped, so you have to put some toilet paper between your butt and your underwear so you won't ruin them with stains. <br />
<br />
SECOND WAVE POOPIE: This happens when you're done poopie-ing and you've pulled your pants up to your knees, and you realize that you have to poopie some more. <br />
<br />
POP-A VEIN-IN-YOUR-FOREHEAD POOPIE: The kind where you strain so much to get it out, you practically have a stroke. <br />
<br />
LINCOLN LOG POOPIE: The kind of poopie that is so huge you're afraid to flush without first breaking it into little pieces with the toilet brush. <br />
<br />
GASSY POOPIE: It's so noisy, that everyone within earshot is giggling. <br />
<br />
DRINKER'S POOPIE: The kind of poopie you have the morning after a long night of drinking. It's most noticeable trait is the skid marks on the bottom of the toilet. <br />
<br />
CORN POOPIE: Self explanatory. <br />
<br />
GEE-I-WISH-I-COULD-POOPIE POOPIE: The kind where you want to poopie but all you do is sit on the toilet and fart a few times. <br />
<br />
SPINAL TAP POOPIE: That's where it hurts so badly coming out, you'd swear it was leaving you sideways. <br />
<br />
WET CHEEKS POOPIE (The Power Dump): The kind that comes out so fast, your butt cheeks get splashed with water. <br />
<br />
THE DANGLING POOPIE: This poopie refuses to drop in the toilet even though you are done poopie-ing it. You just hope that a shake or two will cut it loose. <br />
<br />
THE SURPRISE POOPIE: You're not even at the toilet because you are sure you are about to fart, but *oops* --- a poopie!</div></div><hr />

I saw the &quot;Suprise Poopie&quot; in effect this past Friday. I was on my way to the Hold'em tables when a security guard stepped in front of me and ask me to step around him. Lo' and behold, a huge piece of shit lay on the Casino floor. I almost lost when I passed by and cought a wiff. <br />
Appearantly the lady who shit on the floor couldn't make it to the bathroom in time. The shit slid down her pant-leg. <br />
<br />
Just imagine the aftermath of you shitting on a Casino Floor...near a high traffic area. What do you say? Oops?<br />
LOL</div></div><hr />

<br />
The chunk: When you do all the pooping you'll have to do for the rest of the day, flush it and one chunk floats back up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kebsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm having the Recurring Poopie right now.  Thats where you poop yourself to exhaustion, but you still have more poop.  So you clean up as much as possible, go drink some Peptol Dismol, and lay in bed in too much pain to move.  Just waiting until you have enough stregnth to poop some more of the poopie.  Repeat several times over the course of the day/days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Currently in Milwaukee (usually one of my all time favourite cities), we've had so much rain that it has flooded the entire Milwaukee sewer system and overflowed it into the Milwaukee river, which flows into lake Michigan.

<br />
Thank god it's still a cool spring, it would be worse if it was 90 degrees out.<br />
<br />
I thought perhaps the poopers might appreciate it and make Milwaukee and emergency vacation destination.<br />

Milwaukee - we got the good shit.</div></div><hr />

That's pretty sick. I live in SE MKE County(15mins from downtown) and I haven't heard anything about floatie turds. Does this mean Summerfest is litterally going to stink like shit?</div></div><hr />

OMG I live in SE MKE county (Oak Creek)!  <br />
Apparently there is something in the water here that makes SK's.<br />
<br />
No they'll have it all cleaned up by then.  They just flooded that &quot;deep sewage resovoir&quot; they built about 10 yrs back.<br />
It's been in the news.</div></div><hr />
