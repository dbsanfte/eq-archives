<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Trezzt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm curious as to whether or not Drusella is soloable by a 65 SK (48AAs) with an amiable VS faction.  I realize she's surrounded by friends, but I'm wondering if the faction would enable them to look the other way when I pull her to stomp a mudhole in her.  Or should I back off because she could possibly stomp one in me even if she was the only mob in the room?  Any information is appreciated!</div></div><hr />

    I was just down in HS on Sat Morning to kill Drussella.  As a 64 sk with 17 AA's she conned green to me, ready to attack as I have very bad VS faction, and was very easy to kill.   I used boner to pull the golem guards, they all came single, after the Monk I was with pulled 4 golems on his first try.  Do not know if you can single pull Dru from the middle of the golems but you can sure single pull everything else.  <br />
Hope this helps.<br />
Ohs</div></div><hr />

No she didn't. However, &quot;Drusella's pet&quot; may have. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shaithiss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Drusella's level 55 or 60, I forget which, she wouldn't even be green to a level 70. Her pet probably wouldn't be either, as she's a necro... it might be LB, but I know the pet's around level 50... it's the level 54 necro pet, the rogue.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Senladar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've soloed Drusilla 2x now and within 10 minutes of zoning in.<br />
<br />
I'm a 67 SK with 193 AA's but even with a few less levels and AA's you should be able to do this.<br />
<br />
First off, get buffed up and grab a SoW/lev or SoE.<br />
<br />
Zonein and kill the 2 zonein mobs, make pet before you go in if you have pet hold.<br />
<br />
From there wait for the wanderer in the east wing to show himself and pull him from the steps and kill him, the golems shouldnt aggro if you get him at the edge of the steps. If you are having a problem targeting him, stand on one of the 4 firepots when you zone in.<br />
<br />
After killing him, invis up and run to west steps and stand on one of the firepots. From there you can glide over to the east steps while paging up the whole time. It works with lev and run3, so sow is not a necessity.<br />
<br />
Open the door and go in, when you go in, do not uninvis yet. Check out the mobs ahead and see whether they are undead or regular. If 2 on the left or 2 on the right are undead, then use UI and run up that side and through the picture frame. If you get 2 golems on one side then use regular invis and run through the picture frame.<br />
<br />
Now before you change your invis go back to the door and while looking at the door just stand to the right of it and change invis so that the one golem behind the wall doesnt aggro you.<br />
<br />
Change invis(if necessary) and proceed through the picture frame. From here you'll need to UI. There might be a golem or a bottomless gnawer in your way but this is a chance you'll have to take. When you get up to the hallway with the 2 doors you can either go left or right, either way ends up at the same spot, the right side is longer but you can probably make it aggroing less mobs than left.<br />
<br />
After you make your call and run either way keep running until you get to around a corner, at that point FD. Mobs will have to be in visual range to hit you unless they were already in the process of casting, in that case it will hit you anyway. But by getting around a corner and FDing means they have to get up to you to start casting, this works, trust me.<br />
<br />
After you wait your 1.5 minutes or so to get the &quot;your enemies have forgotten you&quot; message you have 2 options.<br />
<br />
Since I have the master key I prefer to run to the hallway right past Drusilla. I aggro her and all her goons open the door run around the corner and FD. Once I even made it without any aggro.<br />
<br />
If you dont have the master key I hope you have a gate potion after your done. Pet pulling doesnt work for her as the golems assist and beat your pets ass. You will have to snare pull her but be sure to clear the 2 wanderers first.<br />
<br />
Snare her and run around both corners for 2 reasons, one if she's snared she is gonna move slow and if you FD too soon she might not be out of the room and 2, she is likely to cast right off the bat so you want to be around a corner next time she casts.<br />
<br />
After that wait for her goons to go back and u should have he solo, u can also wait for the &quot;your enemies have forgotten message&quot; to appear but festering darkness only lasts a few seconds longer than it takes to clear aggro. But at this point if you have a pet with pet/hold you can pet pull her the rest of the way.<br />
<br />
If you have the master key, that hallway past her is good for pulling and FDing. I run down the hallway and FD right in front of the door, the zoneout is also very close when you are done and you can usually make it to there without aggro.<br />
<br />
Drusilla is 55 I'm certain, as I've been xping with my drood there and she had been showing even until I dinged 56. She will lifetap and toss appropriate necro dots on  you of that level. Her pet is quite wussy and nothing to worry about but I like to kill it first.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if your going to try, make sure you have some one avialable to res you, because it can go wrong pretty quick if you stuff up, and all those little HT's mobs in there do add up. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ikrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">And of course the gimme is that she has only 10k hit points.  One good 8k+ Harm Touch and you have it easy.</div></div><hr />
