<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Eggborn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am looking I swear but I feel the need to pound this one into the ground.  I am Iksar, never did the Darkforge as a newb, I can't wear it, and I was a good lizard and stayed on Kunark till my mid 30's.<br />
<br />
1.  Running seals?  How?  Marl is on Kerra Isle--I know this much.<br />
<br />
2.  So I've killed a lot of epic mobs in the Hole and in CoM on raids...  the Shammy epic and the Ranger epic to be exact-- does this raise or lower truespirit?<br />
<br />
3.  How do wizzy's raise their faction?  Can we do this too?  Yes, I am Iksar.<br />
<br />
4.  Is it still possible to do it the same way Shammy's do?  Test of Paitence or something like that.. the truespirits who spawn in the Field of Bone after a certain outcast iksar is killed I think are the thing to turn into.<br />
<br />
<br />
any help is appreciated.. thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
You go to Kerra Island, mem gather shadows, cast it... (Kerrans will attack you and it gets annoying)  run to  Marl Kastane who is located in one of the huts.  <br />
Hail Marl Kastane. ( With invis off.. )<br />
Say, &quot;I have the will of Innoruuk.&quot;<br />
Say, &quot;What prophecy?&quot;<br />
He gives you the the &quot;Seal of kastane&quot;<br />
You will need to do faction work to get into paineel, just go to the warrens and kill there for two hours, that's all you need.  Hail one of the guards by the noobie area and he'll give you a key, go to Paineel and find Gerot Kastane.<br />
<br />
Go to where he is standing, then hide and con him, if you are indifferent then give him the &quot;Seal of Kastane&quot;. Once you have your faction good with him he will talk to you. Delete the letter he gives you. Go back to Kerra Isle and do the same thing that I just told you.  Once you get your faction fixed then turn the letter into Marl which you can get the rest of the epic quest from Marl.<br />
Just keep repeating till Gerot talks to you and call you his hero.<br />
<br />
2. So I've killed a lot of epic mobs in the Hole and in CoM on raids... the Shammy epic and the Ranger epic to be exact-- does this raise or lower truespirit?<br />
<br />
Just run seals if you're worried about it.<br />
<br />

<br />
But really you don't need to run seals at all, faction is more or less not needed because you can use the hide trick for all turn ins like noted above when doing the seal running.  Being an iksar doesn't make it any harder then any other race.  <br />

Almost all this was posted, I would use the search button a little more often.</div></div><hr />

I killed a bunch of Kerra looking for Marl, but never saw him up.  I found the guy who gives the Soulcase in Toxx, but haven't found Marl for some reason.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Silvershadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">When raising Truespirit for my wiz I did the first part of the shaman epic over and over (went between Butcherblock and Freeport in my case, made easy by me and a druid friend binding in Freeport and him porting me back to BB for each new gem). Had the help of my girlfriend's lowlevel enchanter as well.<br />
<br />
When raising Truespirit for my SK I ran seals.<br />
<br />
Sealrunning is easier for us as a non-gating class I guess, so I would recommend it.</div></div><hr />

It says Kerra Isle, is that the same as zoning into Kerra Ridge?  I killed a bunch of Kerra looking for Marl, but never saw him up.  I found the guy who gives the Soulcase in Toxx, but haven't found Marl for some reason. <br />
<br />
Yes.  Kerra Isle/Island/Ridge are all the same thing.<br />
<br />
If he is up, Marl will be located in one of the huts to the right of Location # 1 on this map (http://www.eqatlas.com/kerraislemap.html).  I believe it is the second little hut on the hill on your left as you enter that area.  He is not always up, so you may have to check back on him from time-to-time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Androsulach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Can I spawn Marl by killing the kitties in those huts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Stugein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">No.  Marl does not have a placeholder.  No kitty spawns in the little hut that he stands in so there is nothing to kill to get him to pop.  He's just either there or he isn't.  There is no way to get him to spawn other than just waiting and checking in on him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>yuggoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">SK epic NPC's take up to 72 hours to respawn after a server reset.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Doryshan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yep Truespirit faction is worth making sure of. I failed to kill Kyrenna because  Caradon conversed through every step of the cell key dialogue *until* I handed it in. Then he told me he wouldn't help me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
do your SK epic turnins<br />
<br />
INVIS/HIDDEN<br />
<br />
this will save you a world of pain.  Hiding now is trivial with the new UI setup.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kroolhand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">From all I've read on this and other sites, running seals takes a &quot;relatively&quot; short time to fix faction. One post said it would take 8 - 12 trips to become Indiff. Being a Troll/Cazic-Thule toon, I started as Apprehensive to the Kastanes. I did 12 round trips using the hide/turnin method and remained apprehensive. I got the truespirit faction gained message and the trumpet sound at the end of each turn in, leading me to believe they counted. I then tried a turn in without hide and was successful, again getting the message and the trumpet sound...repeated this three more times and now i have to go buy another SoW potion. With 16 turn-ins, I am still conning Apprehensive, and the epic quest npc (who's name escapes me atm) still wont talk. I have the DF helm and Chest but was hoping to short cut finishing the legs as that has taken a LONG while already. I am hoping someone can shed some light on what I am doing wrong if anything. Is Deity choice slowing my factioning, or was 8 - 12 trips an unreasonably low expectation? Even though Gerot accepted the seals with hide both on and off, did one of these methods not really work? Finally, with one of the 4 components needed for the Dark Forge legs in my possesion, and 16 &quot;seals&quot; trips completed, which of these two courses would be best to pursue to reduce the amount of time needed to get to an acceptable faction level to start the quest. Any help is greatly appreciated, and I humbly thank you in advance.<br />
<br />
EDIT: I see where someone stated that it could take as many as 30 runs, so gonna keep at it. I plan to not worry with hide as this will save time and seems to give the same result as far as faction message  and trumpet etc. If any think this won't work please post. Again thanks in advance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ashrai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hmm sounds like you are doing everything right. I started off dubious (I'm DE/Inny) to Marl and Gerot - and Gerot wouldn't take anything from me until I did the hide trick. Took me about 7 runs to get to where I was his hero- they will talk to you even tho they are still apprehensive. This was within the last week, by the way.<br />
<br />
However, I did do the darkforge quest and kill Kurron Ni so that may have something to do with it.</div></div><hr />
