<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bludge</div><div class="date">03-25-2002, 11:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We had a decent thread going at the old site that included a couple of folks posting their /hitsmode configurations.  I thought we might start something up here for people who haven’t taken the time to learn it or are looking for ideas on how to set up their boxes.<br />
<br />
I have been searching for good /hitsmode information lately and found a nice guide at steelwarrior.org.  I printed it off and sat down at The Outpost and figured out what’s what.  I was pretty happy with the results.<br />
<br />
First off, here’s the guide.  It was posted by Kaladornus, so hats off. <br />
<br />
For whatever reason, the board here wouldn’t show it as it was posted over there, so I’ve had to touch it up a bit. It was the &lt; &gt; I am certain. <br />
<br />
<br />
/hitsmode  consists of 9 values. me|my|other,  m2 - m5,  X, Y,  lines,  font,  head,  bg and width <br />
<br />
<br />
me/my/other = you hitting something, you getting hit, and others' hits.<br />
<br />
-This gives 3 &quot;temporary&quot; boxes where battle spam shows up instead of in the <br />
chat window. If you don’t want one of the boxes, simply leave out the me, my or other line. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
m2/m3/m4/m5 = level of detail given in the new hits boxes.<br />
<br />
- m2 = Highest level of detail. &quot;You punch a large bat for 2 points of <br />
damage.&quot;<br />
<br />
- m3 = Second highest level of detail. &quot;Punch a large bat for 2&quot;<br />
<br />
- m4 = You get the following text for a 2 point of damage punch, &quot;2&quot;. Just <br />
the number.<br />
<br />
- m5 = This can ONLY be used in reporting YOUR attacks. &quot;Punch 2&quot;.<br />
<br />
It works the same way for me, my, and other:<br />
<br />
&quot;You punch a large bat for 2 points of damage.&quot;<br />
&quot;Punch a large bat for 2&quot;<br />
&quot;2&quot;<br />
&quot;Punch 2&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A large rat bites YOU for 1 point of damage&quot;<br />
&quot;A large rat bites for 1&quot;<br />
&quot;1&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Guard Droolas slashes an orc centurion for 124 points of damage&quot;<br />
&quot;Guard Droolas slashes an orc centurion for 124&quot;<br />
&quot;124&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
X and Y<br />
<br />
Remember coordinates from math class? Well think way back. X=0 and Y=0 <br />
[origin = (0,0)] is the top left hand corner of your screen. Add to x and <br />
the text box moves to the right. Add to y and the text box moves down.<br />
<br />
<br />
lines<br />
<br />
This is a value between 1 and 10. How many lines of text do you want to <br />
appear in the new hits box? choose wisely <br />
<br />
<br />
font<br />
<br />
Font size. Yay! 0 to 3 I think...3 being the biggest...I THINK!<br />
<br />
head<br />
<br />
Displays a heading on the top of the hit box indicating which it is: you <br />
hitting, getting hit, or others' hits. 0 and 1 turn it on or off.<br />
<br />
<br />
bg<br />
<br />
Toggles transparent polygons. Either the box will have no background or a <br />
tinted background. 0 and 1 turn it on or off.<br />
<br />
<br />
width<br />
<br />
The width of the box. I dont think this affects anything other than the <br />
width of the shaded area. It doesn't make text skip down to the next line or <br />
anything.<br />
<br />
Since this guide was written, Verant has added the ability to make the new windows persistent rather than them fading away when you aren't in combat.  Because I don't know what Verant calls it, I'm calling it... tada!  Persistance. You can toggle it by placing a 1 at the very end of each line.  Adding the 1 makes the windows persistent.  Leaving it empty will allow them to fade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bludge</div><div class="date">03-25-2002, 11:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, when I went about deciding how to set up my /hitsmode, I decided that I wanted to keep as much as possible in the lower quarter of the screen. <br />
<br />
I play in 1024 resolution.  This won’t really work in any other resolution, so you’ll have to fiddle with it on your own. <br />
<br />
Me/my/others - I wanted to see my hits, my being hit and others hits  <br />
<br />
M2-M5 - I wanted names and dmg type for all three windows <br />
<br />
X/Y - I wanted the three new windows to sit right on top of my chat window.  Since my chat window wasn’t going to be as congested, I decided to shrink it down by a few lines. <br />
<br />
Lines - I wanted to have at least 5 lines of text in my combat windows<br />
<br />
Font - I wanted a readable font in the new windows. I was still not happy with the results, but couldn’t find a way to make the font larger.<br />
<br />
Head - I did not want a header at the top of each window.  It takes about 1 second to figure out which is which and once you know it, you know it forever. The headers are really silly if you ask me.<br />
<br />
BG I wanted a background to help me see the information. Some people don’t like it. It’s the default /transparant polygon set up that you can toggle in game for your other windows.<br />
<br />
width – I wanted to have My hits and My hits taken to be a smaller window.  The reason being is that both of these windows will have only one name. That of the NPC hitting you/being hit by you.  The Others window is the one where you’ll see “An orc punches Ikikikikibobob for 3 points of damage”  I wanted more room for the longer lines that would come with a two name text line, so I made it bigger than the first two. <br />
<br />
Persistance – Since the guide above was written, you can now add a 1 at the very end of the line to make the windows stay up all the time.  I haven’t decided for certain if I want them or not. For now, they’re always up. It is definitely a help when you are setting this up to have the 1 at the end of the line because it helps you see what you’re doing. <br />
<br />
So, what I came up with was <br />
<br />
/hitsmode my m3 143 595 6 3 0 1 195 1<br />
/hitsmode me m3 342 595 6 3 0 1 195 1<br />
/hitsmode other m3 541 595 6 3 0 1 217 1<br />
<br />
You can put it on a social hotkey if you like and then swap it around with other configurations while you are in game.<br />
<br />
Now, I had to fit my other windows around that.  I like things to be orderly, so I tried to find a set up that would keep everything in the lower portion of the screen.  I had a little leftover room, so I built a little buffer around my hp box just for grins.<br />
Anyway, you could drop the pertinent portions of my .ini file into yours if you want to see it.  Make a copy of your original .ini and if my version sucks, you can just swap it back.<br />
<br />
So, basically delete the following two sections from your .ini file and replace them with mine.<br />

<br />
Bludge I like your set up but I want the detail to be max, no just &quot;you slash for 182&quot; like you have it.<br />
<br />
And Can you see other hitting others and stuff like that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fezzika</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 05:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Where he has the &quot;/hitsmode my m3&quot; , you put in m2.  That will give you the highest detail.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here is what I have (m3) compared with what you will have with &quot;full detail&quot; (m2)<br />
<br />
For me being hit<br />
<br />
m3 = &quot;An orc pawn slashes for 4&quot;<br />
m2 = &quot;An orc pawn slashes you for 4 points of damage&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
For me hitting <br />
<br />
m3 = &quot;Slash an orc pawn for 92&quot;<br />
m2 = &quot;You slash an orc pawn for 92 points of damage&quot;<br />
<br />
For someone else hitting<br />
<br />
m3 = &quot;Guard Merkin slashes an orc pawn for 120&quot;<br />
m2 = &quot;Guard Merkin slashes an orc pawn for 120 points of damage&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
I wish I could post a screen cause it looks really sweet, but basically I have my chat bar centered at the bottom of the screen.<br />
<br />
Resting flush with the top of the chat bar are 3 boxes.  From left to right they are <br />
<br />
Me attacking ------ Me being attacked ------ Others attacking.<br />
<br />
I really don't see the need for the full level of detail. As you can see above, all you are losing are the words <br />
<br />
&quot;points of damage&quot;<br />
and<br />
&quot;you&quot;<br />
<br />
None of those are relevant imho and just make for longer lines of text. <br />
<br />
My set up most certainly shows others attacks.  Lots of folks turn off others attacks, but I find that I usually need to know right away when a caster is being attacked so I can go peel the critter off of em. <br />
<br />
Keep in mind, my setup will only work if you are in 1080 res</div></div><hr />

<br />
All that shows in the hits windows are hits, so it shouldn't hide anything else.  In fact the big problem I have with /hitsmode is that it doesn't effect misses.  I like seeing my/me misses as it give me a sense of how the battle is going.  With /hitsmode in use they still spam the chat window.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bludge</div><div class="date">03-27-2002, 08:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I play in the same resolution as you Mudoogul and I can't see going back.  <br />
<br />
My setup is similar to Zhomps.  My chat box is &quot;flatter&quot; than his becuase I figured if I was removing the hits, I didn't need it to be as large.  Instead of being stacked vertically, I have the hit boxes laid out horizontally on top of the chat boxe, with the bottom edges meeting flush with the top of the chat bar and the top edges of the boxes being the exact same height as the hotkey and spell gem boxes.<br />
<br />
Where hit hitboxes are on Zhomp's, I placed my buff box and in between the buff box and the chat window, I put my target, self and group boxes. <br />
<br />
My setup is is the exact same height as his, I just have a slightly smaller chat (7 lines shorter) window so I can keep everything on the lower 1/3 of the screen<br />
<br />
In any case, it's easy to change if you hate it. Just make a copy of your ini file on your desktop, change the 1024 and hitsmode sections in your everquest folders .ini to use what I posted before and voila.  If you don't like it you can swap it back.<br />
<br />
Or you could simply type in the 3 hitsmode lines above and build your other windows around it.  Just put the chat box below it.</div></div><hr />

There were screenshots of their /hitsmode and it really looked great. The only problem was that they were using 1280, howevere they said they were going to post the setup for 1024x768 but I think the boards were switched before this happened.<br />
<br />
 Anyone remember the thread? Was it copied over?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bludge</div><div class="date">03-27-2002, 01:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It wasn't copied over.  His setup is what inspired mine.  Mine is pretty much exactly the same except it's 1024 and has the buff box showing where his wasn't apparant.<br />
<br />
I e-mailed him, but haven't gotten a response, so I decided to just sit down and figure it out myself.</div></div><hr />

Damnation, do you have a 30 inch monitor?<br />
<br />
1080 is just about perfect for me on a nice 19&quot; monitor.  I can't imagine what 1600 is like.  Are the buttons only like 5 pixels wide?  I tried going up to 1280 and it gave me a headache.  I haven't known anyone to play in 1600, so you'll probably just have to make your own or find someone to do it for you. <br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe I'll fiddle with it tonight and if a don't have an anuerysm from the eye strain, I might have something for you tomorrow.  No promises though.</div></div><hr />

Think you could email me your .ini file with all your settings (or all the text copied into a Word document)? From what you describe, your interface setup is exactly what I'm trying to do. If you have one to email also, I'd love to see a screenshot as well. My email address is jelswick@attbi.com if you have the time. Thanks!<br />
