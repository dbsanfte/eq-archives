I noticed that the Coldain Faction was easy as hell.  I'm hoping I don't have to sit around all day soloing light blue giant for crappy XP.  Are there are any quests for raising faction?  Also where do I get the damn key anyway?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">darkmelusine</div><div class="date">03-30-2002, 07:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Easiest way is to kill or be a guest of someone killing Vindi/Statue/Idol/AoW.  All are large faction hits and sure beats killing giants all day. 8)<br />
<br />
Edit: Giant Warrior helms and Storm Giant toes also</div></div><hr />

SK debuffs make us one of the easiest classes to gain faction. Basically just tag tag tag every frickin' giant and drakkel wolf you see in action with a debuff. <br />
<br />
A lot of people freak out of someone runs up and starts hitting their mob. Sending tells and asking for permission to whack another groups mob seems to confuse and or 8 of 10 people. But no one has ever cared (or maybe even noticed) that I did a drive by debuff on their mob.  <br />
<br />
I have been told (never verified) that elites in GD give more faction than the scouts and berzerkers. Kael giants reportedly give more faction than the EQ and GD giants, and arena mobs reported give more than zone mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nephtu</div><div class="date">03-30-2002, 11:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Big guys (Statue &amp; Derakor), plus fighting in the Arena - the Arena giants seem to carry significantly more faction than the zone-in or WL ones.  You can turn in Giant helmets &amp; toes, also, but those aren't anything stellar.  <br />
<br />
You get your Shrine key either by doing a moderately involved quest with the Dragon's spy (Wenglawks) in Kael OR kill Ziglark Whisperwing - he's a Paladin and a majour wuss.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Skek</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 04:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">From what i'm led to believe Frost giants give 1 point cov faction and 5 points thurg.  Storm giants give 5 points of cov faction.<br />
<br />
Therefore you faction quicker tagging the storm giants in the wenglawks/arena/tormax area than you would the frost giants in the likes of GD or EW.<br />
<br />
Basically though, your best with the big guys mentioned above for a really solid hit.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shakeera</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 05:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Spend 2-3 days in the kael arena with a good, balanced, experienced group of 54+.  If you're not 54+ ask to tag along for faction.  One good group can take out all the Senior Guards, Legionnaires, Troopers, and Adjuntants faily easily; the faction hits are great, and you have a chance for some really good drops.  They also drop the helmets that u can use to speed up your SS faction once you are non-KOS.<br />
<br />
On our server, the kael zone is usually pretty sparse during the day, but at around 5pm CST it fills up fast.  So if you have the time to go early in the mornings and afternoons with a group, you can score some big faction hits and good camp spots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mynegon</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 06:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Skek is correct, Storm Giants (Kromzek) give +5 CoV,  Frost Giants (Kromrif) give +5 Coldian.  Most, if not all, giants in GD and WL are 'rifs, so if you want fast faction you have to go to Kael.<br />
<br />
Another thing to do is go to a 10th ring war in GD.   Most of the time the guild doing the ring will be happy to take help, but even if they arn't you can probably tap for faction.   Just run like hell if they loose (and not into Thurg!).  I'm not sure what the hits are on the giants who spawn for the war, but one war was a big bump with both CoV and Coldian.  And a hell of a time!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SpurniaVZ</div><div class="date">04-04-2002, 03:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Easiest way to raise the faction is to go on a Kael raid and simply hit all the mobs once! One raid took me from threatening to dubiously and then finally the 2nd raid took me all way to the top. I would say it was the most time efficient way of doing it.  Everyone on my server who raids ToV always does a kael raid the next day to fix their faction. Well then again tis up to you to decide how you would like to spend your time :) Good luck hun!<br />

Once they do Thrug is dead until the next server reboot, no vendors, no bankers, nothing but dwarf corpses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neq</div><div class="date">04-04-2002, 03:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It was mentioned above, but just to reiterate ... vindicator, statue, and avatar of war seem to be HUGE faction hits (supposedly Idol is as well, but he seems strange on the faction quite often I don't get any faction registered at all off him), so if there is any way you could get a hit off them that would probably be your quickest route to raise your faction. Of course don't just run up to someone elses raid and tag them without asking, that's just bad form</div></div><hr />
