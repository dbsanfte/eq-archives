From the posts here that I have been able to read, no magic resistance, and doesnt hit too hard, 160's, level 53.<br />
<br />
I was hoping I could take him with a 60 cleric , me (60 SK) and a 60 Shaman.<br />
<br />
If he is slowable, I would think this is enough... any suggestions?<br />
<br />
Now if that stupid stone key would drop...  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">velourea</div><div class="date">06-03-2002, 05:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i did him for a guildie and a motley crew of me (48 sk), 45 sk, 54 sk, 51 cler, 51 mage, 46 mage, &amp; 60 rogue. <br />
<br />
54 sk main tanked, was white to him, but needed to drop agro when his life got too close for comfort, so i tanked him for a few rounds. he doesnt hit very hard at all but does rampage the first few rounds. his resists werent very high as i got a shadow vortex through (but didnt stick obviously, haha), so i would imagine slowed and with a 60 cleric you would do fine. <br />
<br />
ours dropped fast with the 60 rogue ripping him to shreds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
He despawned on me at 10% health while I was DoT kiting him.  Had I known he was unfearable or that he was going to despawn, I could have easily soloed him using Cascading Darkness and Asystole.<br />
<br />
Your trio will have no problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Glowing Cliff Golem was a pushover after Shaman slowed.  Cleric never cast one heal on me.  In fact he went to nuking becuase he was bored.<br />
