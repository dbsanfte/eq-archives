I'm a lvl 65 sk moderatly well equiped (Drag haste 5k hp and 1420 ac unbuffed )<br />
<br />
 As far as MT'ing this really isn't a problem , since my gear can only get better,l but I would highly appreciate any insight as to how you all use your disc's as an SK MT.<br />
<br />
<br />
 Now on aggro I have a bit of a problem. In a nl group I can keep solid aggro ,even with a necro/ shammy/ &amp; chanter casting wildly, useing my fester/ asystol/ T of Thul.<br />
On raids though I have a tuff time getting quick aggro up due to premature casting. Whats the Most solid way to get and maintaine Aggro in a raid situation ?<br />
<br />
 Thanks again for your input <br />
Keep the world at your Swords Tip ! :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dakkin</div><div class="date">02-18-2004, 05:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mem festering, fear, and CD.  Forget asystole and terrors, for various reasons they aren't nearly as efficient.<br />
<br />
Turn attack off - on a slowed heavy hitter it's amazing how much of the damage you take comes from ripostes, and you can keep rock solid aggro just with spells.<br />
<br />
Drop festering on the mob at max range, then chain cast fear and CD alternately.  Festering and fear both have about 2 second cast times, so with luck you'll get two good aggro spells on the mob by the time it reaches you or very shortly after.<br />
<br />
If the mob's a slow hitter and well pinned you can alternate fear/invoke fear with CD for backup quick cast if you get interrupted; fear aggro is so huge that alternating chain casting 2 fear spells is golden, though invoke fear takes a long time to cast.<br />
<br />
Set up a button to /rs ENGAGING %t, DON'T ATTACK YET and use it the moment you start casting.<br />
<br />
Then position the mob (corner pin or whatever), get your 2 or 3 good aggro spells in and THEN hit your assist button.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps.<br />
<br />
As a side note, what you're doing in groups probably works fine but you'll keep aggro even better if you drop festering on incoming mobs at max range, then hit them with fear and chain cast fear every time it refreshes.  If you want even more aggro you can alternate fear and CD.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Turning off attack to MT is a judgement call...melee damage potential is a factor in building your aggro too. If you can't live through the ripostes as MT, your odds don't look great to begin with, but on long fights you need to do this sometimes. Also, unless you are using a Furious Bash shield, I think bashing can get riposted too, and isnt worth it...<br />
<br />
Before a mob is slowed it can sometimes be preferable to engage it using leechcurse, as its hits will interupt a large % of your casts at that point anyhow, which is why the faster casting/refreshing Clinging Darkness/Terror are key. Cleric spell haste buffs are useful if you are going to use Fear, which has a base casting time of 3.5, as well as other spells you might cast that have a base over 3 seconds such as ToI/Festering. Fear has a refresh time of 7, so it is great to land it once before you start taking hits...Invoke Fear is 100 mana which would probably be wiser to spend on 5 clinging darknesses...<br />
<br />
Seeing a sucessful taunt message after the slow/debuff stage is also important in managing aggro and knowing that you can safely call assist.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Culdahl</div><div class="date">03-01-2004, 12:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have compared fear with terror line and terror seems to grab aggro better for me every time.  I agree that you should assist puller and cast darkness line at max range.  Also, i have found it better to use your two lowest terror spells as they have 1second cast times as opposed to the 1.5 second cast on higher terrors.  Typically I use just one terror, but when im in a group/raid with folks that don't understand aggro-management, I chain cast both of my lower terrors with almost no interruption in melee DMG output.  Also, as an SK, we hold aggro as good if not better then anyone, if you are having problems with maintaining aggro perhaps you should have a discussion with those whom you are raiding with.  I am level 61 ATM and have had no problems holding aggro with groups where everyone is 65, but have had problems keeping aggro from groups where everyone is around 55 and poorly equiped.....a GOOD group/raid knows how to keep aggro on MT:-)<br />
<br />
P.S. - if everyone only knew that you could actually turn auto-attack OFF during a fight.....:-)</div></div><hr />

Double the delay of your defiler means half the ripostes.  You can still attack, just take half riposte dmg.  I own a WB besides my 1 hander because of this dynamic.  Higher weapon delay when chain casting is more efficient also.</div></div><hr />

Sure, it isn't great dps, but if my job is to keep the mob focused on me I want to use every possible means at my disposal.   <br />
<br />
Just something to consider.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yaz</div><div class="date">04-05-2004, 03:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">On incoming mobs, I know people don't want to wait forever to engage so I land Fear off the bat, just level 15 fear makes huge aggro.  Mob comes then I land Festering Darkness on the bastage also creating superior aggro.  Only time I ever use Terror of Thule anymore is to break chanter mezzes in LDoN's so I don't break the mez premature with Festering, i.e. Cast Fear, then Terror of Thule on the mezzed mob then break with Festering while the current target is at running health like 15 or 10 percent depending on the DPS of your group.  Then the adventure goes fast and smooth.  On raids all I ever use is Festering and level 15 Fear starting with the Fear cast as mentioned earlier.  They just seem to hate that spell the most over snares and terrors.  So if you do get interrupted casting any other aggro spells that Fear spell already has their attention so you don't lose it.  I've tested this out a lot and it works best so far.  If I am puller as well as tank, that's right, start with Fear so the group doesn't grow impatient waiting for that bastage to FINALLY get there.  Fear is a great aggro spell as it doesn't use nearly as much mana as the gimp terror line and creates way more aggro.  Hope this helps, flame away.</div></div><hr />
