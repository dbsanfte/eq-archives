Not very many item's are &quot;diety&quot; specific. There is really nothing that is so compellling to make you chose one diety over another unless your a Ranger. That being said the Rallos Zek Diety armor is pretty nice I believe you may wish to look at it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jobrill</div><div class="date">11-19-2002, 11:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Deities matter for 3 things:<br />
<br />
1. Rallos Zek Ogres cannot do Greenmist.<br />
2. As mentioned above, Different Dieties have different cultural armor choices. <br />
3. Your faction may be slightly better/worse in some places depending on which god you worship</div></div><hr />

Even at that you only need like one charge of it.  And the rallos zek armor is VERY nice, beats all velious armor hands down in terms of raw tank power, though it doest lack a little bit in saves and some stats like dex, not enough to make it not worthwhile replacment for those who dont want to, or cant do velious quests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Groff Gorespiller</div><div class="date">11-20-2002, 03:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ogre cultural armor is better than most of the velious quest armors anyway, and there isn't really a significant difference between the stats on the Rallos Zek, Cazic Thule and Innoruuk versions, from what I've seen...<br />
<br />
Been trying to get an Ogre smith up for this reason, so I could make my beloved Troll a set of the armor, but it's just too expensive to get to 242+ skill in smithing only to fail and use up tempers that require blue diamonds...<br />
<br />
Thankfully, the Darkscale armor is coming down in price a bit in Bazaar...</div></div><hr />
