<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wienaman</div><div class="date">04-09-2004, 07:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Can I get a few tips on what it would take and how hard it would be to one group him?  No offense to my guild or anything, but if I can take one group up there and get a Mantle of the Rainmaker solo, would be a lot easier on me than having to wait for every other hybrid in my guild with lesser shoulders than mine get one, which since I have Strength of the Elements could be a long time...at the moment I almost feel like I'm being punished for being one of the few in guild that actually took the initiative to do that easy quest</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Inferna</div><div class="date">04-10-2004, 12:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Get some classes that can charm up there and its easily done with one group</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wienaman</div><div class="date">04-10-2004, 02:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">k thanks...pets more for tanking, dps, or both? and does it need to be charm, or can DC work?  I honestly don't know a whole heck of a lot about BoT<br />
<br />
*EDIT* on second thought, if I can find the friends willing to do it, I'll just experiment...damn zone has a gy, I can afford a wipe or two</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brael</div><div class="date">04-10-2004, 02:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's doable with 1 group with ele gear no problem if you have some friends, it's probally doable with much less than that... I didn't start farming BoT with 1 group until I was time geared so tough to judge really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Inferna</div><div class="date">04-10-2004, 07:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The charmed pets are for DPS since with one group your going to need to kill fast so that your healers don't run out of mana.  Keep the healers out of his ae range because his ae has mana drain.<br />
<br />
Two healers prob would be helpful.  He can be hard to get slowed and he does some decent dps until he is slowed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dyrkk</div><div class="date">04-10-2004, 07:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is mostly about keeping Cold resists high and keeping clerics out of his targeted AE nuke/mana drain...in a single group the fight will go for a long long time, so manapools of the healers need to remain intact. You're pre-elemental, so up to 2 full groups would be best, Warrior/Bard/Cleric x2/Druid/Shm then add dps and healing as you see the need...<br />
<br />
Fight can run long enough that repops will start if you are low on dps, but the ones in the recessed guard posts will not aggro if you are in control of the named and the raid party.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tomic</div><div class="date">04-16-2004, 04:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tanked him with 1 group when i was only at like 8400 hp,  1600 ac or something.    Group was myself,  bard, enchanter, shaman, cleric FT15, wizard. <br />
<br />
Mana wasn't a problem at all.  Went in and just dumped agro quickly.  Was slowed like first try.  Cold was at 500 so had plenty of mana for the fight.  Charm broke 2 times during fight but was handled, pet was fully buffed. .  Cleric had like 50 mana when we finished had bard song i think, /shrug.    <br />
<br />
BoT mobs really are effected by AC a ton.  I consistently was quaded for the minimum dmg.  Think it is like 320 or 416 or something.    To have 13 hits in a row all at the lowest dmg possible makes a huge diff.  Of course had all defensive aa's.<br />
<br />
Had a warrior tank this same guy when he next popped and cleric ended  at 10 mana with exact same group despite warriors dmg added in.    *edit,  forgot to add why i added this line.  Warrior was only at 1400 ac 8k hp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Should be easily doable charm or no charm.<br />
<br />
Have the healers CH from max range, nukers stay at max range as well.  Pin him against the wall at his spawn point... sorta walk him back and forth in the 'U' shaped area he spawns in.<br />
<br />
1 healer CHing once he was slowed seemed like it was plenty to me, but of course that'll vary with gear.  Another priest to help bridge before he gets slowed is a definite plus.  Doesn't have to be a cleric.<br />
<br />
Build a lot of aggro early, as unless you have a bard in your group you're gonna be OOM rather quickly.</div></div><hr />
