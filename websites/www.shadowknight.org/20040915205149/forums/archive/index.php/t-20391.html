<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jergory</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i am to the point in my epic where all i need is the decrepit hide, blade of abrogation, and soul leech.  i pretty much have a MQ of the BoA locked down (10k).  my next stop will be Hate.  i have never been to Hate.  is it true the only way to get in is by a wizard port?  cause i seem to remember a zone in to hate i think in feerrott.  also, where in zone are the drakes at?  im not interested in anything else in Hate, i just want to start work on my hide.  also, i always hear people talking about raids in Hate for the drakes.  im not in a raiding guild, are the drakes effectively one group doable?  thanks for any advice/info</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Messer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1.  You need a wizard with a stone from Neriak to get you to Hate (and a way to port back out again as well).<br />
2.  Drakes are all over in Hate.  You can't miss them.  Pick one (or a few hundred, lmao) and kEeL them.<br />
3.  One groupable around level 60 for sure.  Mid 50's if you have good gear &amp; player skills.</div></div><hr />
