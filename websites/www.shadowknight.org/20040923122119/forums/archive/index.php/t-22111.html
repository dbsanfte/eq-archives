<br />
1) Do you have access to or input to the definition/role of an SK as the developers percieve it?  It seem to me that many balance issues (not just SK) are born out of a perception of class role.  <br />
<br />
2a) With OoW spells as they are currently listed some current 65 spells with focus effects will be more effective than they're lvl 70 counterparts w/o focus effects, has this been discussed among class coorespondants?<br />
2b) Will focus effect IV's: stop at 65 with a Focus Effect V added; go to level 70; or follow the VT pattern and some effects for certain spells will scale all the way up?<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well... the pattern pre-PoP for focus effects.. they went up to III, then with PoP they added IV.  So expect that with OoW the focus effects will be V, and the ones you have now won't work.  Maybe tribute will help, dunno.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kyfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The pattern pre-PoP was focii lasting 20 levels. Making the IV focii last only 5 levels would be pretty stupid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">1) Focii levels are hard coded (that much I did get out of the developers posts on the SOE boards)<br />
2) I remember some VT focii scaleing (though they had specialized, specific spell effects, not just a blanket effect)<br />
3) Would limiting focii kill the end game with player quitting because they didn't want to spend a year re-gearing?<br />
4) As the spells are listed there are a number of 70 spells that will be worse without focus than the current 65 spells are now with focus<br />
5) Is the small increases in spell power (10-15% between 65 and 70) because they are assuming focus and figuring out the spells power with the appropriate focus (whether it be IV or V)?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Keevel, all I do pretty much is find issues that our class has and bring them to their attention they then look and give a response which I then give back to the community.  Thats why I haven't really reported a whole lot back, we have one major issue which is tanking and a couple other ones which I have brought up and reported back on.  Nothing else for me to do really.<br />
<br />
They're still deciding on focus effects at the moment I think.  Personally I hope they make existing ones from improved level 4 up to 45% focii all goto level 70.  When I hear something on that I'll let you know.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kyfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Personally I feel it would be a huge mistake to have focii IV last only from 61-65. What this means is that except for the absolute cuting edge raiding guilds, people will be raiding in order to obtain focii that don't help them with their current spells, which is quite ridiculous.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kahntun Derstand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">VT level stuff went up to 65.  I see no reason why Elemental / Time level stuff can't go to 70.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Brael, when you look at SK's to determine what issues problems are, what definition of the class do you have in mind?  (I.E. tank, off tank with better DPS than warriors, utility Death touch bitch, etc.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
That kinda bugs me not everyone can afford tribute i love how they did foci 4 i mean they scattered enough ID4 items throughout the game so it wasn't too impossible to gain and then they had the Crafted foci 4 items which while could be expensive were attainable to everyone. They just need to design better foci for raiders (some suggestions in OoW make (20-40% or other variables you know not 1-45% but with higher average) foci) not replace foci 4.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Rueeliar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Different question - <br />
<br />
The OoW spells for SK's currently listed on Lucy seem pretty focused towards DoTs.  Granted, this means that we should be able to stack up significant added damage through them, but GoD was focused around shorter fights.  DoTs are pretty useless against trash, and when encounters are built around being fast, I wonder about the uselessness of the dev's possibly trying to bring our DPS up to par with spells that have no place in most fights.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Grem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The definition of a shadowknight has traditionaly been to ride a shark with frickin' lazer beams into battle.  This no longer seems to be the status quo.  I'm rather upset.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What you have to understand in the first place is that the dev's themselves don't know shit from shoe-shine.<br />
<br />
And what they don't know about shit and shoe-shine is infantesimally collosal compared to what they know about shadow knights.<br />
They fucked up before, they're fucking up now and they don't give a shit about the player base - leastways no anyone in an &quot;SK suit&quot;.<br />
<br />
Hell at that smoke and mirror summit fiasco they even had two devs arguing with each other re shaman slows.<br />
Premise put foward by a shaman player was that shaman slows were being resisted so much in the endgame now that by the time they land the fights over and they've done nothing apart from potentially ping-pong aggro.<br />
<br />
Dev'A' tells the player they are being riducullous and that even if shaman slow lands after 3 or 4 resists it still makes a different to a long fight.<br />
Dev'B' turns to Dev'A' and informs him that the current trend now is to have fast frantic all-or-nothing fights that are over very quick.<br />
<br />
Giving us more DOT's is just highlighting their ignorance of the game, continuing the same old out of date perception of what a shadowknight is and contributing even more to our current demise.<br />
<br />
Like I said &quot;Shit and Shoe-shine&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Androsulach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">That's very telling.  No wonder they act like they have their heads stuck up their asses.  Their heads ARE stuck way up their asses.  It's sad that the devs that do the encounters and the devs working on our spell books aren't discussing what they're doing.  The spell/skill folks are SO disconnected from the encounter developers that it's a wonder the game has lasted this long.<br />
<br />
It's also rather discouraging to know that the pure melee classes are better looked out for by their devs.  Wish the devs responsible for us would wake up, pull out, and take in some fresh air.</div></div><hr />

Good for you, you're perfectly entitled to your opinion.  Unfortunately many SKs disagree with you and feel they've been ignored while the devs focus on other classes.  Just because there is a difference in opinion or perception doesn't make either viewpoint &quot;bullshit&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Have you seen anything in the last year to give you a lot of optimism that they're going to do anything about fixing the imbalance THEY introduced to the game?  All they have seen fit to tell us is that we need to gear up.  They are oblivious to the idea that Warriors with lesser gear are now doing what is still difficult for the other 2 tank classes with high end gear to do and doing it easier.  They never gave us a discipline similar to Defensive, so that was the first major gap.  They put Warriors on another table and still don't realize that it was too big a step, without giving the other 2 tank classes something similar.  I'll pay the next 6 months when it comes due next month, but I don't know if there will still be an Everquest to play in February.</div></div><hr />

I just wish I could hit my pet with a levitate effect.  I had to summon my pet up to my usual camping perch.  But it was nice to have him follow me around through a few zones.  Just wish the Torrent recourse would apply to the pet.</div></div><hr />

Just another issue that needs fixing if a bard can reconize it, WHY THE FUCK can't a dev reconize the problem!?!?!</div></div><hr />

In some thread I read, (I can't remember which one), somebody (I can't remember who) quoted a dev (can't remember which one) acknowledging that the Terror line was broken, but that it would be very difficult to fix at the moment (or something along those lines).   Maybe someone can pull the quote/reference I'm thinking of.<br />
<br />
I don't know how much validity there is to this claim, but in any case, I have to agree that it's a pretty sad state.  They are able to accidentally give us some great aggro spells, like Disease Cloud (pre-nerf/fix), Clinging Darkness and Fear, but when they actually make an effort to give us a line of spells entirely devoted to generating aggro, they fail utterly... and years later, they still either can't tell the spell line is broken, or know it's broken and can't muster the dev know-how to fix the spell line or replace it with something that works... or just don't care enough to fix it.  Pretty damn pathetic, no matter which way you look at it.</div></div><hr />
