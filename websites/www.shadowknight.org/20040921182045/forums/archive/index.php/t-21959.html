<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thaln V'Orro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">&quot;- Made it so that pets now follow the same rules as players when it comes to buffs. If the caster is not high enough level for a spell to land on them, then it also will not land on his pet.&quot;<br />
<br />
Heard this happened on Test.  If this is true, it will make Pet Affinity even more useless.  Cool SoE, very cool!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The way I read it is if it can land on the owner it can land on the pet, which wouldn't be a problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nathus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I believe caster refers to caster of the pet. So if a spell is too high to land on you it won't land on your pet. How many low level sk's do you know with Pet Affinity?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>DConquest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It'd be dumb if they DIDN'T do this.  Imagine all the fully buffed low lvl pets running around tearing up everything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Made it easy to level up a mage at level 8, with a pet that can have virtue, focus, and FA.  Amazing the shit it can tear up at low levels.  I used a mage pet, with minor healing on pet, and pet took it from level 8 to 20 in about 2 hrs, pet tanking and killing all in PC.  All with a level 8 pet.  Its a good fix.  Just will make some things more difficult for those who depend on the pet for PLing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Neric Ikolis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">They already do atm.  Just can't got to PoK get buffs then hit your xp zone.  This new change will be good though since like stated you'll be high enough level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Laronx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">THis is about buffs that you need to target the pet to cast guys, has nothing to do with pet affininty...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Klaaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I could be wrong, but since you have to be level 50 to get any AA's including Pet Affinity, and since there are no spells with a level requirement higher than 50 to land, I don't see how this affects pet affinity in any way whatsoever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">PA is also required 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Thaln V'Orro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Right, Im an asshat and misread it.  Game on then.</div></div><hr />
