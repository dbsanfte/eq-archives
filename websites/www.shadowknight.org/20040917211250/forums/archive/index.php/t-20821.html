<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xorraiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey everyone. This post is for any Newb SK's out there. I had a lvl 32 SK as my 2nd character but I could never really use spells since I never worked on them. Well, I re-created him as the same character but with better equipment. His name is Xorrazi on Cazic Thule, send me a tell! 8)<br />
<br />
Well, any of you that get to lvl 9, i would do the following...when i got to lvl 9, i immediately bought my spells, went and got a &quot;Breeze&quot; from a nice enchanter and sat back for 45 mins to max out my Alteration, Divination and my Conjuration to 50. Every level after that, if they aren't already maxed, i max em again which take smaybe 8 mins. (Max increases by 5 every level)<br />
That is just one trick you should keep doing because later on, spells will save you. My BL is lvl 46 and his spell skills SUCK! He would be so much better if he hads those up. <br />
<br />
Oh, one thing, when ur working on those spells, Summon your pet, and cast them all on him. He won't take any damage but your skills will go up just as if you would be fighting an angry Burynai or sutmhin. Welp everyone, that is my 2 copper.<br />
<br />
Like I said, send me a tell sometime fer all you Cazic Thulers to Xorraiz. (Lvl 12 SK) if you ever wanna group or just chat! Your always welcome!</div></div><hr />

Get your int up, it will help with spell skill increases.  Dex helps with weapon skill increases.</div></div><hr />
