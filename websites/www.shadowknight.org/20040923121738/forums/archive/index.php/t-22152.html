<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Culdahl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Saw this today and thought about the SK Vs. Warrior debates - (from EQ2 website &lt;note on Dev. beta testing&gt;)  &quot;The most-played adventure archetype is the fighter, followed by mage, priest, and scout. The most-played races are dark elf, half elf, and kerra; the least-played races are ogre, halfling, and troll.&quot;.... Seems that the Devs prefer warriors.  Perhaps the majority of those fighter archtypes will progress down the knight paths, but my money is on a bunch of warriors and rangers running around.....sounds like EQ1 to me:-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Androsulach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ranger types all start from the Scout archetype.  There are three choices on the Fighter archetype.  I doubt many will go the Crusader route.  They'll probably split on the Warrior and Brawler lines.  But most will go Warrior, which means we'll see a number of Berserkers and Guardians, as they finish out the Warrior branch.  Out of the ones who choose to go down the Crusader branch, we'll see more Paladins as opposed to Shadow Knights.</div></div><hr />

Keeping in mind that those observations were made based on the player base which includes friends and family of the devs and others involved in the game - like 600+ people as I read it.</div></div><hr />

That was actually from pre-friends and family...so only soe employees.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Keep in mind that the &quot;fighter&quot; archetype eventually branches out into monk, bruiser, warrior, guardian, paladin, and shadow knight.  So just because &quot;fighter&quot; is the most popular archetype doesn't mean the devs prefer warriors, they could just as easily prefer monks, paladins or shadow knights, or none of the above.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Trysbrina67</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">To be honest you don't want the devs to prefer any class, that makes for shitty balance and groups of people that seemingly get ignored for very long periods of time (hello us).  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vincente</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Who cares, not like anyone is gonna play EQ2 anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">And this is based off of?  While you might not, and many others might not, there is still a lot of interest out there for EQ2.  Just look at how many people applied for the beta, the number was well into six figures.  Wish I could recall more accurately, but even 100k people applying for beta implies that there is a goodly amount of interest in the game.</div></div><hr />
