<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>TwobittRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was pvping the other night on Rallos on my wizard and noticed that not only was root working but Strike of Solusek was hitting for full damage with no debuffs on well geared people that were grouped with a bard playing resist songs. Matter of fact I had it crit 2 times in a row both for kill shots just under 4k in dmg . I know they mentioned looking at pvp to retune it but their was no mention of it in the patch. I'm curious to see other peoples views on resists with recent pvping.</div></div><hr />
