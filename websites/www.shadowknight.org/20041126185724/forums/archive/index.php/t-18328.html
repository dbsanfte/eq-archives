<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Maxxpain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">dusting off my SK, he's 55 pretty well equipped.  Question is where to go exp?  My main is a 65 SHM with full spells, so I have a built in PL.  Exp is the only goal, no need to sweat loot (well, if there's easy loot to be had, far be it from me to turn it down).<br />
<br />
Suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Silvershadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Tier 1 planes, various zones with good exp mods... you can do a lot with that combo. Just try whatever you want and see if it works, too many places I could think of to list really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xikuliz Litecleaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">PoJ first, then PoI if you can.<br />
<br />
Or at 55 a murder rampage at chardok can work wonders for solo XP with constant pulls and good kill rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wolff-Kishner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">PoI or PoD.  You can kill goo's and rats before the courtyard in PoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nixpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Personally I liked PoN better than PoD... but I guess any tier 1 PoP zone will do :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>yadaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">PoN goos near the CY<br />
velks <br />
PoI<br />
PoJ (very low hp)<br />
HoV (chardok B)<br />
Sol C<br />
<br />
thats only i could think of atm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gaklaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Velks would be good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Reflan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I was in the same spot, 65 shaman with all his skills and plenty of AA, and a mid-fifties SK, nicely buffed, using a SoD and a windblade and WMBS and black bastardsword, sometimes wearing fungi, sometimes not.  We were pretty well set.<br />
<br />
I didn't care for POI experience much.  Actually, experience at that level is fairly slow everywhere even when powerleveling with a shaman because it's pretty easy to KS your SK at that level, and SK damage isn't exactly huge.  For instance, leveling my monk was much faster and leveling my warrior was also significantly faster.  You just have to suck that up a bit.<br />
<br />
I found the best results in PON.  Trees, spiders, birds.  Relaxing enough and always plenty of them.<br />
<br />
But you might want to consider doing kinda slowish experience in POI, POJ, and POD.  That's because eventually you will probably want to go raid or get great(!!) experience in the Sol Ro zone, whether two-boxing or not, with your SK.  You can get ornate there, spells, etc.  But...you can't gate out!  Problem!<br />
<br />
So you can either spend like 500pp for a single gate potion, or go get thurgadin faction and build up pottery to a bit over 100 to make thurgadin gate potions(the reagents are getting harder to find because nobody really farms Velks/CC anymore), or you can kill the mobs in POI/POD/POJ that drop some of the pieces you need for the talisman gate necklace.  Final product is the Binden Concertina -- very nice neck, and gate is a must-have for a non-gating class.<br />
<br />
Anyway, since you very well might go back and camp those same mobs for almost no experience whatsoever later, you might want to kill two birds with one stone and go experience in those zones now, when the experience may not be the greatest, but at least you'll see slow progress.  You're going to feel like you're really wasting your time if you come back there at 65 to camp the exact same thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Squigle D'Muerte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Gate potions for 500pp!?!?<br />
<br />
Never heard of prices like that.  They are around 100pp on Morelle-Thule.  Not worth the trouble of even doing the shawl quest for that much money.  Also if you are a race who can use it, GET OVERTHERE HAMMER.  Great item for getting around, dual someone or kite easy mob and BANG you are in Overthere.<br />
<br />
Not sure how exp compares anymore (I was 55 before PoP) but Fear kiting in Scarlet Desert can get you some nice exp, money and a few named drops from tribals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Maxxpain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">What is the overthere hammer actually called?  I need to look it up, that's a good way to get around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kromglon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Workers sledgemallet i think . Check out alakazzzzaaams and search for quests for OT. Godamn thing rocks, nothing like being deep in Dulaks and bam right near a pok book.</div></div><hr />
