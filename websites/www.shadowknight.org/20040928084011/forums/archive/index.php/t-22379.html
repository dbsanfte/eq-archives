Wrong, what fucking good is this with a 3.0 second cast time?<br />

<br />
Considering the hate on either of those is nowhere near 1:1 in my research, you really should investigate before you question things...<br />
<br />
For starters, crits DO NOT cause any extra hate, hate is only determined by the base amount of nuke or heal.<br />
<br />
Second of all, for the ratio of Hate:Heal it's about 600-700 hate per SL/HL from what I've been able to determine - CH is like 200-300 - WoR and the other group heals might overdo 1200 hate, but no one with a brain uses those early in a fight with adds.<br />
<br />
As for the Hate:Nuke side of the equation, I'm less sure (mainly since I've never owned a nuker to test it) but a wizard can outaggro anyone if they play haphazardly anyhow - it's their job to manage their aggro, not yours. (Not to mention nuking only gives substantial aggro to the target - so barring low HP aggro a stupid nuker would pull 1 mob on himself, not a swarm)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Parasite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Cast Terror of thule 2 times... 1200 Hate... does this keep the mob on you if you dont push a succesful taunt or do any other action?.. Try it, try to keep a mob on you with 1200 pure hate when a cleric casts a fastheal on you in a tipt expedition or in KodTaz.. you will find the mob is still on your Cleric and not on you.<br />
There you have your 600-700 hate for the holy light.. strangely 1200 pure aggro didn't outtaunt the 600-700ish holy light aggro..<br />
<br />
it's their job to manage their aggro, not yours.<br />
Partially right, its their job to do damage as well, or would you want a wizard in your group who can't nuke to his full potential? It's like asking a rogue to not backstab so often because it could cause him aggro...~<br />
Its our job in exchange to provide enough aggro so they can play their class to their full potential. And this spell is insufficient for that job, and insufficient for our role as offtanks in the whole. If youre capable to offtank in KodTaz+ encounters, youre almost dead already on one mob.. want 3 mobs on you to have a certain death?<br />
This is a bone and a toy thrown at us.. We need a single target high aggro Spell.. and 1200 hate is not high aggro. its &quot;above average&quot; but nothing wonderful.<br />
And AE is nothing but suicide when youre on a raid where 1 mob almost one-rounds you already when hes lucky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">For hybrids: 3.0 &gt; 2.0.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Tukka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Those of you who like this spell, under what circumstances do you think you'd be using it?<br />
<br />
The only one I can really think of is in areas with relatively weak hitting mobs (LDoN, pre-PoP content, some PoP) when more than one add is pulled. You hit this spell and hope it generates enough aggro that if mezz/AE mezz is resisted, you get attacked instead of the enchanter.  Or I guess I could use it in areas where the mobs hit harder, but that essentially makes it suicide, sacrificing yourself for the more &quot;vital&quot; party members, in hopes that they can manage without you for the fight.  Or, it could be used in 3+ pulls in areas with weaker hitting mobs if no crowd control is available (however, usually you will have at least effective ghetto CC available).<br />
<br />
That's okay, but how often does your party unintentionally pull trains anyway?  I know my parties don't get more than one add very often, and if we do, it's because we know we can easily handle it.  I don't think this spell is going to cut it to hold aggro in an AE nuking party, so that makes it nearly useless for intentional trains.<br />
<br />
So I don't think I could find a place for this spell in my spell lineup for normal groups.  I am still largely familiar with the situations that arise during raids, however... maybe a raiding SK can give me some perspective about how it might be useful in that scenario?<br />
<br />
Of course, nobody knows completely what to expect from OoW, maybe, as someone in another thread mentioned, there will be scenarios where there are tons of unmezzable (or difficult to mezz), unavoidable weak hitting adds, and a spell like this may be a useful way of dealing with them.  I guess we'll have to see.<br />
<br />
The changes made to this spell are good, but still probably not enough.  At least at 150 mana we won't blow half our mana pool on a string of fizzles, and a 1.8 cast time is slightly better than 2.0, but I still think 1.0-1.5ish is more appropriate.  The fizzle time reduction helps a little also.<br />
<br />
Another problem I have with this, is that I'm not really that used to using AE spells.  This is the first AE spell we get aside from some lame AE nuke we get that I never used except to fool around with.  And this spell doesn't seem to be shaping up to be something I'd memorize or use on a regular basis.  This presents as a problem, because, as I understand it, AE spells in the hands of someone who isn't familiar in their use can be quite dangerous... you can unintentionally aggro nearby rooms and assure a wipe for your group.  So we have the fact that this spell is a liability if not used carefully to add into the equation when evaluating this spell's usefulness.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Xanathol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">In the event we get a short run / reuse immunity disc this would be pretty damn good for certain situations. Ever watch a few casters die on Coir bc the AEers didn't all cast at relatively the same time? So I don't fault SOE in theory...as long as we get our disc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Rueeliar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Our spell-haste is level-based.  It should continue to increase at level 66 and reach the 50 percent spell haste cap at level 67, which would render the spell a 1.5s casting time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Which is why every dps class in the game is given ways to manage their aggro and still &quot;nuke to their full potential&quot;<br />
<br />
From concussion to memblur to FD to that boggle thing berserkers do, to evade.<br />
<br />
Quite simply, if a wizard or rogue is pulling aggro from you, they arent doing their job right, not the other way around.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>aspit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">You would be amazed how often hitting rampage with DBoTW pulls aggro on trains in ldon for example, and i would venture to guess it would be marginally below 1200 hate.  As for complaining about AE taunt and how much worse this spell is dont bother.  If you had an ae taunt type spell you would bitch about dying every time you used it.  Any high end zone you have to be in disco when you area taunt or its pretty much instant death.  You can get away with it in uqua for example on death adds, but even if you manage to pull 2 statics past the entry golem you have a chance of getting destroyed nondisc if your healers arnt on their toes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Krushum Gudended</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">well if it works the way terriors do you would need to be aggroed on all of them first, which means wave of enfeeblement or being the pullers, so it doesnt do as much for raids</div></div><hr />

<br />
Second, hitting Rampage with a DBotW is not a terribly large source of aggro.  Social aggro on a stun is a joke.  Those mobs which were procced upon will be on you like white on rice.  Those which you did not hit with a proc will only hold a flimsy amount of hate towards the tank.  For that situation, where you -really- want to get aggro on them all, use something that procs a Rune.  SEWS, Forgotten Greatstaff, or a Staff of Shattered Dreams.  That, on Ramp, will show you solid aggro.</div></div><hr />

First of all before you post you should learn about everquest.  Nobody gained shortened disc timers from level 60-65.  That means evasive is still 7.42 and defensive is still 10 1/2.  What does this mean?  It means taht your first paragraph is completely wrong.<br />
<br />
Secondly rampage with dbotw is about 1200ish hate give or take depending on damage dealt.  I used this because its fairly comparible to 1200 hate generated by your beta ae aggro spell.  Secondly dbotw proc isnt only a stun, its also 650 direct hate + anger 3(another 600) and dps.</div></div><hr />

and yea, aggro/swing without proc is based off of damage potential, not damage dealt</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not exactly true but you are close.  For example crit melee adds 0 hate.  And by damage i mean number of swings as you can flurry for 6 on one mob and single on the next.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Rueeliar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">No shortened disc timers?  Good.  They're already too goddamn short, already, since all the hybrids are sitting at an hour for discs that never last more than four ticks unless you pretend that Resistant is actually a viable disc when sitting at 500 in every resist (when it's important) is more or less important than 500 plus resistant disc.<br />
<br />
Yes, it has more than a stun component...  Direct anger procs create zero social aggro.  This is why there were so many warriors using SEWS and preaching about the glories of the AE aggro the proc creates and pretending it's better than BoW.  That Anger 3 augment, and the 650 direct hate on Anger itself will do nothing for mobs which you do not hit with the procs.  The stun at least will have minimal social aggro.  About as much as a sneeze.</div></div><hr />
