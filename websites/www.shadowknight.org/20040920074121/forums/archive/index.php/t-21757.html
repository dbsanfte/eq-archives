<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>SkaithS05</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok,I have camped Rharzar in RM's for 6hours + straight,anyone know what i am doing worng? I killed all the &quot;A Drake&quot; and &quot; A Basiliks&quot; and that Zazamouhk guy over and over,all I got was Blackwing(bard epic) about 20+ times,lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ashrai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Just takes time and killing everything. First couple nights I gave up and then a month or so later went there and just killed every single drake and basilisk and everything that would stand still log enough. Got a lot of Blackwing, and finally after a couple of hours, my little drake popped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shainaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Killing Zaza wont help.  I slaughtered drakes the whole time and got him to pop after about 2 hours.  Left the lizards and basks alone.  Make a pet and just target everything and queue him up to attack them all as you run by and kill others while he is on his little rampage.  Also, Rharzar seems to pop when servers come up from a crash or patch i have found as well.  Killed him 3 other times for friends that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gargar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I had the same thing..  camped for prolly 25 hours total.    Get enough people to wipe the whole valley clean at once. He popped for me twice this way.  Could have been coincidence..  but eh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>sluggas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">hi, basically go to the &quot;drake hill&quot; where the sphenix or whatever dude is  kill all the drakes over and over, took me 1 hour and i noticed a green small drake who came right at me, meaningless to say i HTed em killed em in a few min. was cake to the rest of the quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kaledine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I got lucky.. I walked into Rathe Mountains.. killed 1 drake and he popped on top of me lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Adomander</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Im still waiting for this rat with wings to pop. When he does im gonna take him to a world of pain  :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kalendrox Grimblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Probably spent about 60 hours total camping this bitch~  First back in Kunark/velious, and now again since i'm trying to solo the epic (minus soul leech)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kierna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Does Anyone know if the Drake SPine can be MQ'ed?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gargar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">MQ'd? Yeah.. same shit....   Have the person open trade window, have someone cast invis on them... con to make sure that they're indiff... then click trade...  should be good.    Then just turn in the rest of your shit. <br />
