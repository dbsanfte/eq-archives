<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>TooCrooked</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">anyone who's quested the Life Leech spell, do the following:<br />
<br />
mem a spell that you cast on yourself that procs. keep life leech cast so that the gem is in its &quot;reuse&quot; time and greyed out.<br />
<br />
watch that gem closely as your spell procs..<br />
<br />
<br />
WTF, the gem is back? OK, click!<br />
<br />
You haven't recovered yet...<br />
You haven't recovered yet...<br />
You haven't recovered yet...<br />
You haven't recovered yet...<br />
You haven't recovered yet...<br />
You haven't recovered yet...<br />
<br />
Ok, fine. the chain casting problem isnt there. wonderful.<br />
<br />
now, considering i need to cast this spell again in a life or death situation, how the HELL am i supposed to knwo its ready? that is, without spam clicking it.<br />
<br />
I /bugged this before, and guess what? i got back... here, let me paraphrase what happened after i /bugged it...<br />
<br />
&quot;                                                                &quot;<br />
<br />
NOTHING.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Warmaster Xsavuung Llaahh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Is that particular spell in the first spell slot? If so, this issue has already been brought up. It's not the spell itself, it's the first gem slot. Just put it in a different spell slot and you'll be fine.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>TooCrooked</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">oh! well, /rant off</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ramgar SK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">This happens a lot with my spear spells and I have more than one memorized.  <br />
<br />
I try to cast the second one as soon as the gems refresh (all of them, not just the first) and it says a couple times that I haven't recovered yet.<br />
<br />
Kinda annoying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kizzestra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Aye, happens all the time to me too, we get fast-cast spells and no matter what spell slot the gem is in there is a delay between the time the gem pops and the time you can actually cast the spell. Heck I have even had the spell cast and the bar tick down and the game waits until the casting timer is done before informing you of &quot;You haven't recovered yet.&quot;. Happens all day long. Not a good thing imho.</div></div><hr />
