I'm curious how you SKs go about whacking us in PvP and what things we (Enchanters) do that make it more difficult for you to kill us.  I know many funny answers can be given, but I'd be interested in a serious answer or two as well.  How can we stop you?<br />
<br />
Kane Bayle is playing Assassin and my first target is a 65 SK.  Thanks in advance . . . and enjoy the opportunity to make fun of us Chanters. :-)</div></div><hr />

how can enchanters be so hard to kill when they can't even read?</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can't outrun him, cant land anything meaning ful on him, and a strong wind is enough to kill you...<br />
<br />
SK's just going to ToI (-500 resist check) you till your low enough for HT to finish the job, and blow you up.  Could probably kill you about 20 other ways too, depending on your gear, but that's the easiest - chanters aren't a very good PvP class unless someone's dumb enough to fight you somewhere you'll have a charmed pet badass enough to pulverize them before they can do anything.</div></div><hr />

There was only 1 of my friends that EVER beat me in PvP once I got some raid gear and decent amount of AAs.  He was an Enchanter. ( Keep in mind I don't HT when I PvP, I can beat anyone except for Bards regardless )<br />
<br />
You forget to mention the multitude of Runes that Enchanters have at their disposal ( both casted and AA Runes ).... Runes = bad for SKs, since we can't Heal from Lifetaps.  Powerful dispell, and  Tash to lower our MR so their nukes can land.  <br />
<br />
This is a Time lvl 300aa+ AA Enchanter, so he would crit quite often when his nukes did Land.  Not to mention his HP wasn't anything to laugh at.  Just due to Runes though, I just can't see them being a &quot; walk in the park &quot;.</div></div><hr />

J boots and any combination of the dozens of clickies out there and it's a non issue.  <br />

I did find a way to beat my chanter friend, but it was a long fight.  Just have to know your enemy and plan accordenly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
#1 DoT onesself prior to fighting a Bard or Chanter (dont let him see you do it so he will blow mana trying to mez you). Disease Cloud..does like no damage and last forever.<br />
<br />
#2 Nullify magic on him, strip off his KEI/tranq<br />
<br />
#3 User your DDs and spear the poo out of the chanter. Load all your spears, and cast them one after another<br />
<br />
#4 Lifetap him (Life Leech and Touch of Volatis work best because of their relativley quicker cast times)<br />
<br />
Other stuffs<br />
<br />
Watch Others spell messages..if you see him winding up a nice, big, high mana nuke, toss up Harmsheild and let him blow the mana (go ahead and have a seat for the 18 secs and get a lil mana back, your spells cost a whole lot less than his manawise)<br />
<br />
Have Mental Corruption up (especially the high Dex SKs), leech off his mana while you beat on him.<br />
<br />
USe augs on your weap that have DD procs and lifetaps or use weapons that have those abilities. <br />
<br />
USe your own self-imbued DD/Lifetap procs.<br />
<br />
Use only the quickest casting and low mana snares (dont use Dooming Darkness and above, they take too long to cast and too much mana, you will get resisted a lot trying to snare the chanter, and thats time you could be beating on him). Clinging Darkness is your best bet.<br />
<br />
Dont waste time with your pet, hell just fear it and make it run away or mez/charm it and make it hit you.<br />
<br />
USe your discs. Leechcurse is a great one to hold on to till last. You can turn the tide of the battle with this one. I wish I could see their faces when my health suddenly starts going up the more I hit them. use resistant disc as well. Dont waste time on fearless, PCs cant be feared anymore anyway in PvP/<br />
<br />
Then of course there is HT :-) I like to save it for last. I dont like my opponent to have a clue as to wether I have HT up or not. Sometimes its good PsyOps to hit UA even when HT isnt up just to mess with them and perhaps get them operating defensively. HT is best as a finisher.</div></div><hr />

Get MR over 200, and little will land on you.  If they can't cast on you, they sure as hell aren't going to beat you down with melee.<br />
<br />
With some, it's been a game of dispells.  Eventually, it comes down to MR, other resists, and HP's...which we have a hell of a lot more of, and you have very few, and little means to get any back, like we do with ToI.  Once the mana bars are empty, and spell buffs are gone from dispell, what'ya gunna do?<br />
<br />
<br />
Die.  Bah, I gotz jboots too.  But I got a big ole'  sword and you are weak, and have no armor = death.  Don't need HT if your resists are high.  With HT, you're dead quick.</div></div><hr />

Don't fight sks?<br />

No, nullify magic uncharms pet and makes it hate you.<br />
Animation pet only gives us something to heal off more efficiently.<br />
<br />

<br />
No look at the magelos of well geared sks. Is a 7-8k manapool little to no mana?<br />
<br />

We have levitation too.<br />

<br />
I think what enchanter was asking here was if an SK goes LoM or OoM is the Sk then in danger?  I don't think theres was an assumption of us having small mana pools.<br />
<br />
Take a quick look at all the recommendations so far, they've been very conservative on using mana, while still disabling the Chanter.<br />
<br />
Even a LoM SK is dangerous, but they'll be limited in how much they can hurt you (HT aside).  If you get an SK to LoM...expect to play a hide and seek game and have them buying time.<br />
<br />
Is Kane Bayle a PvP server, or what's the rule set?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Amphitryon</div><div class="date">06-11-2004, 01:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kane Bayle is the UK server, and is standard bluebie rule set<br />
<br />
Yes a LoM SK is still very dangerous, expecialy if he has a wep that procs, and it doesn take much mana to launch a Spear ( a SK w/ decent mana regen could launch another Spear very quickly after going OoM<br />
<br />
Also watch for one carrying an extended range item, that would make hide and seek more dangerous, as he could stand outside your casting distance but still hit you.<br />
<br />
Tributes add a new dimension too, especially with things like Regen X, and the added Mana regen, etc etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks again for taking some of your time to answer my questions.  I'll give it my best shot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">window</div><div class="date">06-11-2004, 02:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">no idea your level of play, an enc you want 2 instaclicks in your first two slots. otherwise SK should nullify you and you'll be hurting.<br />
you can rapture the SK, tash, and test out resists. use recant magic to disspell completely, and you might need to for rapture to hold if the SK is dotted. if he's got sucky MR you can use color flux/cloud or whatever, your low level AE stuns and let your animation kill him. if he resists some and starts breaking through your rune you can rapture, redo rune, and resume.<br />
<br />
if he's got 250+ MR, about all you can do is keep him raptured till he dies of boredom, or find something nasty to charm and hope he doesn't manage to disspell it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AThousandYoung</div><div class="date">06-26-2004, 06:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First of all, DConquest, you're making up special rules to gimp yourself by not using HT.  The question was, how does an SK fight an ENC and vice versa, not how do they fight each other if the SK is handicapped.  An SK will generally rape anyone except a Bard or in some cases a Paladin in a duel.<br />
<br />
Now then, on to the main post.  <br />
<br />
You say it's a game of Assassins on a blue server.  How exactly is that going to work? I will make some assumptions and then give you my advice.  Keep in mind my specific experience here is limited...I've never played a high level anything, and I've never played as an Enchanter or SK...and I haven't played since before LDoN came out.<br />
<br />
I do have a lot of general PvP knowlege though from playing on Tallon Zek and Sullon Zek for a long time, and I am pretty imaginative in squeezing the advantage out of every small detail.<br />
<br />
The first thing I am interested in is how this Assasins game is going to be organized.  Here is my assumption: I am assuming that you can challenge him anywhere, any time, in a duel, and he must accept.  This gives you a big advantage...even bigger in most ways than you would get being the attacker on a PvP server.  Of course the guy who's coming after you has that same advantage over you, so that's something you need to keep in mind defensively.  But you're asking about the offense here.<br />
<br />
Before I forget, the second big advantage you have is that you know what class you're going up against, and he doesn't - not only that, you know exactly who this guy is and can figure out what gear, personality and skills he has before hand.  Again, your attacker has this same edge on you.<br />
<br />
Now then...remember some of the things these guys are telling you - <br />
<br />
&quot;it doesn take much mana to launch a Spear&quot;<br />
<br />
Spears are disease resisted.  I've resisted many spears easily in gear that was modest (though resist oriented) for a level 52.  I don't know how resist rules have changed since then, or how things are different at 65, but one idea is to pump your DR through the roof.  You won't be able to stop his taps unfortunately unless your MR is insane (or DR or whatever the appropriate antitap resist is).<br />
<br />
The charmed pet is the best thing you've got on him.  Pick a zone with an absolutely brutal pet you can charm with DC and attack him there.  Wait till he blows his DT (Death Touch, that is, AA'd Harm Touch)- otherwise you WILL lose.  Try to get him injured and LOM and unsuspicious.  Also try to get him when he has poor spells up, and doesn't have good MR gear up, or many buffs on...you must keep him from dispelling your pet.  Ask the Enchanter boards how to do this...it involves charming the pet, buffing the pet, breaking the charm, rooting the pet and then recharming the pet I think.<br />
<br />
One possible trick too is to attack him in a zone he has bad faction in...or you can charm the mobs he's exping on, buff them, break charm and then memblur them so they are stronger than he expects.  This isn't likely to be a great plan though since it won't be that effective and once he catches on you'll have lost surprise.  Plus the blue server GMs might give you a hard time for doing it.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately he'll probably know to raise his MR since most classes use it for their best spells.<br />
<br />
In general, get to know the zones he likes to travel through and fight in, or tradeskill in, or whatever, and use them to your advantage.  Faction farming might be helpful.<br />
<br />
You will absolutely need stellar MR.  This is clearly the number one priority.  Even though I'm not discussing PvP generalities so much or the classes specifically so much as ways to take advantage of the format of the game, this is one you MUST not neglect.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />

If they wont land just chain zbite/toi/tov melee and 2hbash your best to avoid them from getting off more runes after you know down their initial rune and their aa rune...do this till 75% make sure your in melee and your landing hits on them and they aren't getting a spell off in that case HT them. Quick and to the point, enchanters are valuable in mass pvp so dont break a sweat when it comes to blowing ht on them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dyrkk</div><div class="date">06-27-2004, 03:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The other thing that is interesting with enchanters nowadays is their ability to reflect spells. Hitting them with ToI will tap you and heal them in those instances, which is also worth being on the lookout for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zero</div><div class="date">06-27-2004, 05:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If your dot/lich happens to get dispelled as a lower tier sk, and an enchanter gets rapture off on you - things can go down quickly. Zero mana sk can be hauled around easily if their mr is low enough to have ench nukes land. Our melee is pitiful really, and without dots to go through your runes (no mana to cast) we will do very little damage to you.<br />
<br />
Ench: test his resists, if you can land nukes - go for the insano dispell, get off rapture, suck off his mana, and slow beat down. Animated pet will help for the slow beat down.</div></div><hr />

I could of definetlly done better but was a real bitch cuz he had a mana drain procing weapon heh. Eventually just out healed me after like 16mins, though without ht i managed to get him to like 40% a few times before he was able to channel a heal (went full burn early which was why i probably didn't last 20mins&quot;)</div></div><hr />

Let me get this right.  You are an SK, and you told a Cleric he couldn't kill you in 20 minutes, without you having horse or HT, unless you let him - which should be true - and then he killed you in 16 minutes?<br />
<br />
LOL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dhantes</div><div class="date">07-02-2004, 07:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Now you do realize he's time geared and im like an ST keying guild. I do regularly kill his members and had killed him before this pvp incident one on one via HT. Also please reread my post i know what i did wrong in that pvp encounter, i realise i make mistakes in pvp and i correct them in the future. Did i mention i killed the best cleric on our server in a duel (he's post time) he gave me a shot cuz we have a personal fued and he does realise i do have skill just like i realise he does also (not to mention the fact that i 2box a cleric in pvp now so recognize and appreciate his abilities)?<br />
<br />
And btw i brought that duel encounter up because 1. the guy before me posted about mana draining weapons and this cleric had one and 2. i enjoy talking bout pvp even when i lose.<br />
<br />
Oh and btw caffron if you want me to tell you how to pvp as a wizard just ask, my wife is one and i do play her in pvp now and again a have been told im good at playing a wizard also (though i cant stand not being able to heal least sk's have lifetaps well might still have lifetaps will depend on pvp changes)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dhantes, I just thought it was funny that you specifically told the Cleric that he couldn't kill you.  My guild - a ghetto gear guild - has a Ranger - a class with a reputation for dying easily - who got ganked by a Cleric while badly injured and he got ribbed for that soooo much.  You die to a Cleric, you get laughed at.  When you're one of the premier PvP classes with heavy defensive capabilities including buffs, evasion, heals and raw HP/AC and you specifically tell the Cleric &quot;I'm ready for you, come get me, bet you can't kill me&quot; and then he kills you it's just kinda funny.  Sorry if it sounded offensive, but your post was funny.<br />
<br />
Sure, I'd love to hear about your Wizard PvP insight.  I know I'm not perfect in PvP.</div></div><hr />
