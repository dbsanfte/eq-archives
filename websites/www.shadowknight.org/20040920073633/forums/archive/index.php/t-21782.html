<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kroolhand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I noticed in a thread here once that someone stated that they did 300dmg in  a swing with their WMBS. I've owned one for awhile now and haven't aproached that number and so have been waiting patiently for 65 to see if that was part of the problem. Nope not it.<br />
<br />
I have no offensive AA's, and will be working on defensive ones first, so if that's the answer, I'm still along way off.<br />
<br />
2hs maxed and so is offensive far as I know.<br />
<br />
With any str buff my strength is at it's current cap of 280, no AA's here yet either.<br />
<br />
I think the highest I have ever hit for was 215 with the WMBS.<br />
<br />
I'm 2 missions from 1492 Tak Plate, and i have enough points to buy and more or less aug 2 pieces of it right away and so...<br />
<br />
Is Vengeance III, IV etc a good choice for some of the aug slots? <br />
I will be going with the recommended stuff like FT II, but after that, is this the path I chose to raise max hit cap?<br />
I have seen posted here that 10 atk has minimal usage and is not as beneficial .....hmmm hard to form the question(s) exactly...I think what I want to know is, how do I hit harder, consistently with this weapon? Was 300 an exageration or am I hitting like a pansy, because of ignorance and misgearing?<br />
<br />
EDIT: Just looked at magelo and realized I haven't updated my skills in awhile, am at work atm and will do it in the morning once I get home, so that they will more accuratley reflect that factor of the equation.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Max hit is solely dependant on the weapon, not your atk.<br />
<br />
The distribution of hits is dependant on your atk.<br />
<br />
Max hit with a WMBS IIRC is  218.  With low atk, you won't hit for that often, but you'll still get it now and then.<br />
<br />
With high atk it just means your average hit goes up, and you hit for max more frequently, but you still can't hit for more than that.<br />
<br />
The only way you'll hit over 300 with a WMBS is with a critical, it doesn't matter how much atk you have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">218 is indeed the max hit at 65.  5.9*dmg+DB=max hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Oh yeah, and wrong forum...  You're a naughty naughty boy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kroolhand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks Josahd, I think I'll skip the Veng augs for a bit then.<br />
<br />
Hehe and thanks Slein.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">AC augs &gt; HP augs &gt; veng augs... FT augs are a good use of aug slots until you can cap it.  Leave vengeance for stray type 3 slots after you've got FT &amp; any foci you find necessary worthwhile.  Once you're past LDoN armor (I.E. elemental plate/whatever) you shouldn't have to worry about it anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Just to reiterate, vengeance is definitely worthwhile, it'll increase your damage output a lot once you get a decent amount of it, however, as Slein said, it's secondary to our tanking role, and in general FT &gt; veng.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I really like the AC augs alot. I use them whenever I can. The only drawback is that the vendor purchases augs are for the non visible slots only but it all adds up and helps.</div></div><hr />
