<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nyckademus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I recently lvled just outside Cazic Thule (Temple)  and I had all but the Decayed Right Vambrace and the Right Legplate Drop.  From what I understand that was absolutely an amazing Feat.  anyway.  I have looked everywhere and can not find what I need on any site that I am aware that tells you what other components you need and where you need to take them after you have them.  Any information you may ahve regarding this is Greatly Appreciated<br />

<br />
(obviously all decayed drop from crusaders or the spirtulist outside CT)<br />
<br />
Darkforge Breastplate:<br />
Deycaying Breastplate<br />
Deycaying Mail<br />
2 enchanted Platnium Bars - 120pp (buy plat bars from vendors and have an enchanter enchant them, or buy them from the bazaar for around 200pp)<br />
<br />
Darkforge Boots:<br />
Decaying Left Boot<br />
Decaying Right Boot<br />
2 Faerie Dust - Found on the fairys in lesser faydark (the fairy ring is the best location there, tons of them)<br />
<br />
Darkforge Greaves:<br />
Decaying Left Greave<br />
Decaying Right Greave<br />
2 pieces of Melatite - Drops of numberous clockwork models in Soluseks Eye (or buy it in the Bazaar, or from players and/or vendor inside Soluseks Eye)<br />
<br />
Darkforge Gauntlets:<br />
Decaying Left Glove<br />
Decaying Right Glove<br />
1 enchanted Platnium Bar - 120pp<br />
<br />
Darkforge Vampbraces:<br />
Decaying Left Vampbrace<br />
Decaying Right Vampbrace<br />
Qeynos Guard Kite Shield - Guard Fredrick in North Karana (This item seems to be in question because of the name, but i know for a fact that he does drop the shield that is needed.  He hangs out around the tower in NK, close to the zone to SK and the Luclin spires.  He sometimes wanders, and make sure to look ON the spires in NK, somtimes he is sitting high on one of the pillars)<br />
<br />
Darkforge Bracers:<br />
Decaying Left Bracers<br />
Decaying Right Bracers<br />
Broken Minotaur Lord's Horn - Minotaur Lord in the Mino Caves in Steamfont (Have to make him spawn, forgot his placeholder's name, but kill all the mino's and i think this spawns him.  This is a LORE item, so if you want 2 Darkforge Bracers, you have to make one 1st, then go get everything again and make another one, what a pain)<br />
<br />
Darkforge Helmet:<br />
Decaying Helmet<br />
Decaying Visor<br />
2 Freeport Damaged Millita Helmets - Dropped of East Freeport Guards (Dreiken, Fentallin were the 2 easiest guards, Zone in from west freeport by the armor by ikthar building, they both wander close to the area)<br />
<br />
Hope this helps, and trust me on this, i would not spend the time writing this if i was not sure on all the items.<br />
