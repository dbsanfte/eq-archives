<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kromglon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guys,<br />
<br />
I hear theres a 7 level LDON limit for grouping. Is 7 the max or is it the cut off. Say I got a level 21 friend and Im 28. Would that work? OR does it need to be 21 friend and me 27.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Morgrist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Actually, it's seven levels at best. At your level,it's more like a five-level swing- if one of you was 20,the others would max at 25.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Khat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My understanding is the limit is 7.  Guildie of mine believes that to be the case, as well.<br />
Not entirely sure, but I think it is up-to-and-including 7. <br />
<br />
Like you, though, not sure which of these would be the limit:<br />
<br />
20 &amp; 27, or<br />
21 &amp; 27.<br />
<br />
Haven't yet been in a situation where this was an issue.<br />
<br />
EDIT: misspell</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>TelimTor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I ran a dungeon this week low end was 42, high was 49.   So it's less than or equal to 7 levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kromglon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Good deal then. Thanks for the input.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Yabyab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">confirmed its 7 or less. This means a 20 could group with a 27 or less players.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kromglon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Welp didnt work for me today. Had a 21, 25, 26 and 3x 27 woudlnt give us a mission because of the level 21. Wonder if it was bugged?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Morgrist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Not bugged. The level spread gets broader as you get higher in levels.<br />
 <br />
At 20-30ish or so, it's a 5 level spread. By around 50 or so, it's 7.<br />
<br />
27-5 = 22. There's your problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kromglon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Guess thats what I get for trusting the game manual :)</div></div><hr />
