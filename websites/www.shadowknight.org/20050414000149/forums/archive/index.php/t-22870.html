<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Corurum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I didn't see a topic dedicated to this, I didn't find ANY thread dedicated to it.  I did however find a couple of posts in random threads describing aspects of it. I think i have it figured out.  Let me know what you guys think.<br />
<br />
Get pet buffed up with as many hps as possible.<br />
FD<br />
Send pet in<br />
once pet attacks once spam /pet back up<br />
pet comes runnin back with only one mob on him.<br />
Stand up and start whackin away at the mob.<br />
<br />
Is that the general idea?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nikl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I do that exact same thing except FD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Paradox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes, that's the idea.<br />
<br />
There are times that you can pet pull with or without FD.  It depends on the aggro radius of the mobs your splitting up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Branuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What kind of level difference between the pet and mobs are we looking at?<br />
Is pet pulling a feasable stratagy for under level 50 or is it only 65+?<br />
If my pet con's green and the mob cons blue is that good?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Marruk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I believe the general idea is to have the pet con green to the mob.<br />
If your pet gets adds, you can let him die and try with a lower-level pet to see if that helps (it won't always help, but frequently does).<br />
<br />
Pet pulling definitely works prior to level 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Covi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">have your cle cast a HoT on it and that usually keeps ol' Jabober kicking for another pull.<br />
<br />
I have noticed sometimes when my pet dies during the pull, the mob will still come and brings adds with it. Maybe my FD failed and I didn't notice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ravenar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Esp now that your higher end cleric spells do not cost a dot, Virtue should be a must for Goner the super monk puller.  I almost always get a set of mage summoned plate mail as well.  <br />
<br />
Of course like someone said several months ago, Pet Discipline and Pet Affinisty makes this so much easier.  In fact when you get both of those two, you will wonder how you ever got along without them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>StPatrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have noticed sometimes when my pet dies during the pull, the mob will still come and brings adds with it. Maybe my FD failed and I didn't notice.<br />
That's might be a problem (I always /con MOb when FD to see if it is indiff now or not) or maybe just groupies were too close and got aggro</div></div><hr />
