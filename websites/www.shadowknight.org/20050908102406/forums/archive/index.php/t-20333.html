<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Skyclad</div><div class="date">03-01-2004, 08:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been playing a Mage on Firiona Vie for the last 18 months or so and decided to kill her off after 62 seasons due to the constant /pet attack, nuke, summon &quot;stuff&quot;  - rinse and repeat routine.  I just got so bored I was gonna quit EQ.<br />
<br />
I have enough money to decently equip my new SK and dont need any assistance on 'what' to buy.... however this is my first melee character since I started playing EQ and realise this will be a whole new learning experience as I want to &quot;learn&quot; this class from the ground up. (I am deadly opposed to PLing - as it creates characters who are 'dangerous' in raid groups and high level encounters.   Soooo I have a few questions.<br />
<br />
1.  Lots of posts on this board seem to perpetuate the rumour that SHDs cannot solo past a certain level.  Is this true or can you successfully fear kite your way through levels using outdoor zones?<br />
<br />
2. Where do SHDs stand in the ranking of melee characters?  Can they tank / melee as well as Paladins and Beserkers for example - and how far behind Warriors are they in the grand scheme of things.<br />
<br />
3. Based on question 2, will my new SHD be overlooked in favour or Warriors / Paladins etc as MT in a group?<br />
<br />
Basically I dont want to become frustrated with a class that has no solo potential whatsoever (due to some of my play times), or is going to end up being a 'paper' tank at higher levels.  As I said, I know nothing about this class so any help would be welcomed.<br />
<br />
I've sort of toyed with the idea of playing a Necro too - but after spending 62 seasons with the old /pet attack, nuke routine I am loathe to go down that route until I've had a few questions answered.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cames</div><div class="date">03-01-2004, 08:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. Soloing beyond a certain point is very inefficient.  Grouping is much more effective for xp now.  The low spot for soloing is probably 50s - early 60s.<br />
<br />
2.  Berserkers can't tank effectively.  SKs/Paladins are similar and are behind Warriors of similar equipment in 2 places:  Boss Mob Raid fights and GoD Trials where the benefits of Defensive outweigh everything else.<br />
<br />
3. Nope, I get plenty of tells when I am LFG for tanking.  It has gotten harder as people scoured the server for Pallys and SKs until recently.<br />
<br />
If your reading the boards here, please understand that the current issue (GoD Trial Tanking) is really an issue for those Elemental and Beyond.  Unless you are going to be there soon, then it doesn't matter.  If you are planning to be there soon, make a Warrior.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Skyclad</div><div class="date">03-01-2004, 09:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you for the information - but could someone enlighten me as to what (GoD Trial Tanking) is?<br />
<br />
Are we talking about the obscene amounts of damage some of the GoD mobs do? .... even as a 62 Mage some of those mobs scared the living daylights out of me :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cames</div><div class="date">03-01-2004, 10:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well at 62 you are not likely in GoD trials with your mage.  They are 1 group events that are required to progress through the GoD expansion.  Most of the SKs attempting to tank them are Time/Elemental.  Most are finding it hard/impossible to tank the hardest of the boss mobs without defensive.<br />
<br />
So, are you headed into a hardcore raiding guild?  If not, then don't worry about this.<br />
<br />
If so, when you get your character to 65 (with sufficient AAs and farming of EP/Time) then you will likely have difficulty with these trials.<br />
