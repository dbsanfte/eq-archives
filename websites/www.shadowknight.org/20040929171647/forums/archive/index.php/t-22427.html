<br />
though I agree, it probably would have been better to give it to shammies<br />
<br />
and some of that stuff looks really nice.  our improved FD seems to be like fading memories in that it auto-blurs... that will be huge.  hopefully the rest of what we get is nice too.  sony knows that our class is hurting, even other classes admit that SKs need tuning more than anyone save berzerkers (who seem likely to finally get some love now too).  They just need to figure out what they can do to make us more useful without turning us in to warrior or paladin clones<br />
<br />
now, give me a riposte/parry disc, double the amount that shields raise your AC softcap, a few channeling AAs, maybe something that allows spell haste to work on sub 3 second spells, and that auto-blurring FD and I'll be a happy camper as long as they don't give pal/warriors any other tanking upgrades that exclude SKs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Blackeagle Dwimmerlaik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">oh.  and fixing terrors would be nice too.  and if someone comes here to say terrors aren't broken, I'll tear your leg off and beat you to death with it.  they are less effective than cheaper casting cost aggro spells, especially on initial agro = broken.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>kharan_zechts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Rez is one of the main things that make clerics so manditory in certain xp groups. Druid rez wouldnt be horrible.</div></div><hr />

%1 is attempting to return you to your corpse. If you accept this, you will still be able to get a resurrection later. Do you wish this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Envoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">regaurdless, as a splitoff class of the necromancer, we should have this ability before its introduced in a new class altogether.<br />

while this would allow druids alot more oppourtunities in groups, its still an unfair and rediculous idea.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Ha, it would be true in the future.. Look at the pattern.. Necros got rezz few years ago and now we are asking for one cuz necros have one! Once druid gets rezz soon, few years later, rangers will start to ask for one! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>cames</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Rangers will require summon corpse as well.<br />
<br />
These spells will be:<br />
<br />
Chained to Chain - The Ranger is &quot;chained&quot; to his chain armor and can summon it to him along with his rotting corpse.  One hopes the blood and guts oozing over the armor doesn't detract from their ability to track.<br />
<br />
and<br />
<br />
9 Lives - Like the tale about cats, Rangers have more than 1 life and are capable of restoring life to corpses.  Of course, most 8 week kittens have more hitpoints than a ranger.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
<br />
If you give it to one, you almost have to give it to both, especially if shammys gain ground on the healing front.  If it had to be one or the other, shammys would probably be a more logical recipient though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Leflion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Personally I would be happy being able to tank better (read: mitigation) and FD better (read: hotkey)  <br />
<br />
I seriously never want to see SK's with rez abilities.  I don't think we as a class are a revival type.  Leave that to the goodie goodies out in the world.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Shadoh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">It says you regain experience so in my book that is a rezz and not a call to corpse.  SoE would give a porting class a rezz before giving one to the SKs?  I would think Shammy would get a rezz before a druid would.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I think it makes sense for all the priests to have one version or another of res.  If they're going to give it to somebody, it should be to both Shamans and Druids.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seriously, while roleplaying is nice, and I know some people enjoy it and all that; you can't not want an ability that will give our class a huge chunk of utility and usefulness just because you think it's a &quot;goodie goodie&quot; ability. &quot;We shouldn't get a better feign death, that's just for scardy wimpy monks!&quot; and &quot;Who needs a mitigation disc/invuln disc? They aren't evil! And we can cast spells, so screw that!&quot; don't exactly sound very logical, do they?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Powa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">all i can think of when i see the post, FUCK</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Powa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">how bout next stage we'll see cleric gets riposte disc?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">No, i'm sure next it will be pallies get a defensive/ripo disc while SKs get memblurring FD and another Harmshield to balance it out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Noctix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I don't really mind if SOE decides to give rez to another class.  What I do mind is that they just seem to flat out ignore that we even exist.  We get ignored in caster balancing, ignored in melee balancing, lumped in with paladins and ignored in tank balancing, and we're flat out not even mentioned by SOE except for the occasional tweak to the drop rate on some archaic epic drop.<br />
<br />
I can't recall them giving one ounce of creativity or attention to the SK class since the introduction of z-bite.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Leflion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Actually I don't roleplay at all.  No necro's are not goodie goodie. However, SK's getting rez .....welll hell give everyone else one too.  I don't want anyone to ever /tell Leflion I need a rez please.  <br />
<br />
I don't think SK's need to have rez, it is stupid.  What is the point...OMG we are off the necro path.  If you want to go that route I will take more DoTs and Lifetaps overtime...I will take a better pet....<br />
<br />
If you want to go the SK's are off the warrior path, great give me better mitigation, better dodge, better evasive.<br />
<br />
I don't want to have the warrior discs, I don't want the necro rez.  These classes both need to have something that is &quot;them&quot; (Yes there is more to necro class than rez and more to the warrior than their discs...or is there?).   I want a fair mix and be able to be a usefull class on raids.  I want to be able to do my off-tanking and be able to do my soloing when I am not on raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Chayde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">However, SK's getting rez .....welll hell give everyone else one too.  <br />
<br />
I seriously am not happy about another class with a res. What will be the point to the game anymore. It will become more monotone than it already is. <br />
<br />
<br />
Share the wealth, give clerics the druid snare, or maybe the self ports, or how about invis? Clerics should be able to invis, after all they are the ones who track back to their groups body to res them.<br />
(and not that invis to undead either, that is just about worthless considering there isn't many undead)<br />
<br />
Might as well give bards the power to res, after all they can do everything... why not just &quot;Sing&quot; the person back to life? <br />

If it's a long-refresh AA rez/summon, then I don't see that as a problem myself.  Sorta like you don't see many peeps ask for Divine Res (or get laughed out of the zone) from clerics kinda thing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>zaistikaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">REZ , hell ya every class wants a rez but what is every classes angle at getting it .  Why and how is our angle ?  Personnely I see a rez for SK as not a click stick which we frolic around with saving a raid , 10 sacrifices needed per rez attempt or even a 0 experience summon corpse norrath wide but as something even more personel , more sacrificial .  Heck man the reason i would want any form of rez would be to get a cleric back to do there job and  click away much like the Necro's do , we get lucky enough to Fiegn off and survive a raid wipe and click in the cleric but at what cost to US ? Make it hurt , make it a personel sacrifice death to the SK as an EE payment with no rez experience gained back , make a 20 point AA , make it usable much like the harmtouch timer of 72 minutes. i dont want to be a freaking cleric , i dont want to be a necro a drOOd or a shammy , i want to be what i was intended to be , the master of the dark arts  able to summon and control the fallen creatures of the land and use them as my undead minions and revel in delight at the pain i cause to my foes as i tap and drain there sorry azzes to the ground . If i wanted no pet,  no spells and no variety i would of made a warrior     ;)    NOTTTTTTTTTTTTT<br />
