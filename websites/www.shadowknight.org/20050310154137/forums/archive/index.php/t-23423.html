<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Blacklife</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been camping the breeder for 3 days now and have not seen him spawn.  Did they nerf the spawn rate?  And also are the add he spawns snareable/ rootable/  mezzable?   Plz Help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Voch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Did breeder 2 days ago.  Spawned after about an hour of clearing.  Adds are mezzable and snarable.  I just set my people up at the top of the stairs, agro'd the whole room and ran all the way out to the opposite end of the caves and feigned.   Dropped agro and repeated 2 more times to get all 6 adds to pop, then on last run someone tagged breeder at the other end and I ran back to help finish him off after agro dropped.  He didnt spawn any extra adds during the fight.  <br />

Voch</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">He's always had a shitty spawn rate.  I camped him 15-20 hours before he popped for me.<br />
<br />
How to deal with the spawns is thoroughly covered in other threads on the breeder subject.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I must have gotten extremely lucky. <br />
<br />
We moved to RCoD (its empty on my server) just for a change of scenery. I convinced the people with me that there was a great exp spot in the caves. <br />
<br />
The breeder popped after a single clearing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">We did the Breeder last night for a guildmate, was kind of fun.  Not sure what the spawn rate is, but it was up when we got there.  The pullers were lazy and only kited long enough for one baby to pop out, and then pulled it.  The enchanter said he burned something like 8k+ mana mezzing the little fucks, but we did win.  I just can't wait to go camp it for myself...  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lynxal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I wouldn't recommend mezzing as the number one option.  We tried mezzing the first time and 5 resists later our chanter was dead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">yeah our chanter told me they had to tash in order to mez... which means extra aggro, dead chanters, more time before they can get them under control, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Moardok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Bring A Bard!!! <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">OMG like... nerf bards!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Menon Lifeblight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yeah, it's really freaking hard to HS train the Breeder to the zone while he spawns the adds.  What's up with you people?  Read these boards.  Mezzing?  Bards?  Duh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>relf the relentless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">i ran in room to check him.. he was right in front of me called in bunch of people. fairly easy fight if u know what ur doing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I've camped him a couple days now.  Hasn't spawned yet.  Got deathsting once so far.  won a level 70 rune, woot.  Would much rather have had the egg from breeder.<br />
