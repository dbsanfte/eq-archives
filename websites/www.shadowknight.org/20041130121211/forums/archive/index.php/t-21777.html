<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Havn't decided whether to include all/some/none of the first bit... guess I have 1440 minutes to decide (/curse edit time limit) - opinions welcome.<br />
<br />
<br />
Largely an overview/condensation of previous posts...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
First, an overview of the issues SK's (and to a large extent, pallys) are having.<br />
<br />
1) Knight desirability during the PoP era stemmed from their reliable snap aggro. This was an effective counterbalance for warrior superiority in raw tanking. Warriors are now sufficient (even exceeding knights at the high end) in this category, and even further ahead in raw tanking, dramatically reducing value of shadowknights, as warriors do the rest of the job notably better.<br />
 <br />
2) Knights' raw tanking power is well behind that of warriors. Disciplines aside, warriors are roughly 15% better tanks than knights. This gap is then widened further by defensive, making warriors the only viable tanks for many encounters, and highly preferable tanks for most raid/named mobs. While there are many things a knight can tank, warriors can almost invariably do the job better. There are many situations where content is doable with a warrior, but not with a knight (or only by adding more to the size of the party).<br />
 <br />
3) Non-tank classes come very close to knights in tanking ability for many situations. Opponents of knight upgrades often point out what knights can tank. DPS-oriented melee classes, rangers in particular, can fill many knight tanking roles.  Rangers are very close in raw tanking power to knights, have equivalent aggro capacity, and even have a distinct advantage in the form of weaponshield. As such, rangers are sufficient in terms of tanking for nearly anything a knight is - they aren't the best, but then again, neither are knights. Additionally, rangers can fulfill tank roles that knights cannot due to the power of weaponshield. That said, non-tank class tanking abilities are largely fine in my opinion.  The problem is that the gap needs to be moved in between knights and non-tanks, rather than being between warriors and knights/non-tanks.<br />
 <br />
4) Shadowknights have effectively lost their pulling role. They are still capable of pulling, but other classes can do it more effectively. Bards, and to a lesser extent, clerics, enchanters, rangers, and druids, can pull much more effectively in many situations using different techniques than SK's. Monks, using exactly the same tactic employed by SK's, can pull more effectively in nearly all situations (especially those encountered on raids). While some shadowknights still pull for their groups/guilds, this is generally because of the skill of the player. Given an equivalent monk character, that same player would do the job more effectively.<br />
 <br />
5) Shadowknight utility is no longer a valid argument against more real power (if it ever was). Aside from the fact that utility is a poor substitute for raw power in most situations, SK's utility has been largely trivialized by item effects and endurance based skills.<br />
 <br />
_________________________________________________<br />
 <br />
<br />
An often proposed fix for knights is a defensive disc. Some among the knight community, along with a number of warriors, oppose this change, especially pre-GoD. Reasons sited generally revolve around the following:<br />
 <br />
1) Warriors only have one role (tanking), thus it's &quot;fair&quot; that they're significantly better at that job than knights.<br />
Knights have always shared that same job. It is the core function of the knight classes. The difference is that they have traditionally been balanced in that role by having an advantage over warriors in one area (aggro) to counterbalance their deficiency in another (inferior raw tanking and the lack of disciplines). Warriors have made significant gains in the traditionally knight-dominated area, thus to maintain the balance, knights need to make gains in the other.<br />
 <br />
2) A defensive discipline for knights would make warriors obsolete as raid MT's.<br />
On account of the fact that warriors have moved in on the conventional knight strengths of offtanking and small group encounters, it would not be unfair for knights to have some functionality in the established warrior role of raid main tanking. That said, giving knights a defensive discipline would still leave warriors as the preferred raid MT's. Knights lack such invaluable tools as furious and AE taunt, are roughly 15% behind in raw tanking, and are actually worse in aggro over time. Furious and AE taunt are hugely important for tank switches - AE taunt makes the point at which aggro is transferred predictable, and furious allows for a lot of added stability. Lacking these tools, the only spot in the tanking order knights could compete for would be the first spot. Warriors would still reign supreme for the latter spots due to the ease of tank switching, and being better overall even for the first due to better overall tanking and the value of furious in comparison to the slight knight initial aggro advantage.<br />
 <br />
3) Knights already tank fine pre-GoD outside of raid main tanking.<br />
Sure they do for the most part; they tank exactly as well as they did when they were content, during PoP. The problem is that warriors now tank significantly better, making knights' sufficient tanking abilities obsolete. That said, there are some things that knights are insufficient for even pre-GoD and outside of the raid MT role. To kill the Daiku Overseer with a single group, a warrior is effectively required. For many bazaar/LDoN-geared groups (which are not out of place progression wise) in BoT, the wing-bosses are nearly impossible with knight tanks, especially compared with defensive warriors.<br />
 <br />
The areas in which knight tanking is &quot;fine&quot; already would not be significantly affected by a defensive discipline. Defensive would have little bearing on XP mobs, where knights are fine and to which warriors often point to try to say that knights are balanced. Defensive would have a limited effect on offtanking in pre-GoD content, as offtanking often requires tanking for much longer than the duration of a discipline. It would, however, have the positive effect of bringing knights into the same league of warriors in areas where defensive is relevant. If you look at where the balance problems exist, they are where defensive is applicable; knights aren't in bad shape where it is of minimal use.<br />
 <br />
4) Knight tanking inferiority is justified by their spellbooks/utility.<br />
Most knight spells add minimal raw power. Many are nearly useless, and many are merely utility based. Utility does not make a class - it is nice to have, but it is no substitute for real power. Furthermore, much of that utility is available to other classes through item effects and endurance based skills. Many of those spells which do add real power are greatly overshadowed by the outright superiority of warriors in that to which they contribute. Others, such as feign death and healing, yield secondary roles, but still leave knights lacking as those roles are as dominated by other classes as tanking is by warriors.<br />
 <br />
Shadowknight spell DPS is not sufficient to be a valid balance issue with regard to tanking. Warriors are vastly superior DPS while tanking. When not tanking, they are better at the high end and at least comparable at the low end, particularly over longer periods of time.<br />
 <br />
5) Giving knights defensive would trivialize many old encounters.<br />
Quite simply, it wouldn't. It would not raise the available tanking power, it would simply distribute it a bit more evenly among the three tank classes. Any content that would be &quot;trivialized&quot; by giving knights defensive can already be trivialized (and to a greater degree) by replacing that knight with a warrior.<br />
 <br />
_________________________________________________<br />
 <br />
<br />
Advantages of a defensive discipline as a fix:<br />
 <br />
1) First and foremost - scalability.<br />
Defensive scales extremely well to content. Lifetaps, leechcurse, runes, etc. do not.<br />
 <br />
2) Would not dramatically impact the areas of the game where knights are fairly well balanced with warriors.<br />
Knights are generally in reasonable shape in comparison to warriors where defensive is not a factor. Where defensive is applicable, serious issues are evident, however.<br />
 <br />
3) Would set knights apart from non-tank classes to some degree.<br />
Non-tanks would retain the advantage of melee immunity disciplines for very short term tanking tasks. Knights would open the gap with non-tanks and close the gap (without overcoming it) with warriors on longer encounters, and remain largely uneffected in XP grinds and long-term offtanking roles.<br />
 <br />
_________________________________________________<br />
 <br />
<br />
Other things of note:<br />
 <br />
1) This is not a GoD problem. This is a class balance problem, which was highlighted by GoD.<br />
Knight-warrior balance became an issue when the aggro gap was closed. A logical way to re-establish the balance would be to close the tanking gap. Hard-hitting GoD mobs simply serve to make this more evident.<br />
 <br />
2) There are supposed to be three tank classes: warriors, paladins, and shadowknights.<br />
Right now, warriors are far and away the best tanks. Knights are situational seconds, with DPS-oriented melees filling the #2 spot in others thanks to their melee invulnerability disciplines.<br />
 <br />
3) Shadowknights are also facing an imbalance compared to paladins as a result of paladin stuns.  This will be compounded by the powerful stuns that will be available with Omens of War.  Shadowknights need something to parallel the spell-based damage avoidance offered by paladin stuns.  This is far more limited in application than a defensive discipline, and would have no impact on raid MT'ing and even many group/offtank mobs.  The combination of this spell-based avoidance and the knight-defensive disc should make knights powerful offtanks, but leave warriors as the undisputed maintank of choice.  <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Second, how to go about fixing it.  <br />
 <br />
1) A set of two disciplines available to both knights at 65 (separate timers from eachother and unholy aura):<br />
 <br />
One similar to weaponshield/furious/etc. - a short duration melee immunity for &quot;oh shit&quot; situations, fight stabalization, etc.<br />
Parry or a shield block would be ideal - giving us ripost would be encroaching on warriors, especially considering its burst damage is somewhat analagous to HT.<br />
Duration of 2-4 ticks.<br />
Reuse upwards of 30mins.<br />
Endurance based, vendor purchased tome.<br />
 <br />
A &quot;mini-defensive&quot; - notably less effective than defensive, but enough to put knights well beyond anything else; 30-35% off the DI.<br />
Much shorter duration than defensive - approx. 60-72seconds.<br />
Short reuse, in the area of 4.5 minutes.<br />
Endurance based, vendor purchased tome.<br />
<br />
This would be of minimal use as a raid MT, as it's simply too short, and warriors have comfortably better in terms of raw tanking. Add tanking doesn't generally require much more than a minute, however, and its short reuse would make it ideal for offtanking - it would be readily available as more adds came in. It would also be sufficient in duration for 1-group named.<br />
At 72 second duration and 4.5 minute reuse knights would spend less total time under discipline than warriors, assuming both classes were using the disc every time it popped (warriors can spend 1min/3.5 disced, knights would have 1min/3.75).<br />
 <br />
<br />
These combined would still leave us well shy of warriors overall. They would, however, put us clearly above DPS classes in virtually all tanking situations. Their specifics would be more tailored to the traditional roles of knights than would other options, implimentation would be fairly simple, they scale marvelously, etc.<br />
 <br />
Content trivialization would not be a problem, as anything that would stand to be &quot;trivialized&quot; by knights tanking with the new abilities would already have been trivialized to a much greater extent by warriors.<br />
 <br />
Do NOT put an aggro or casting time penalty on it. (Casting time penalty would basically be an aggro penalty anyway.) We need our aggro to perform our offtanking roles. Requiring a shield is fine; warriors are required to have two, sometimes 3 weapon sets for different situations - it's perfectly fair that we need different weapon sets as well. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
2) Especially in view of the OoW pally stuns, there are two clear gaps between the tanks, one between SK's and paladins, and another between knights in general and warriors. The above discs would rectify the warrior issue quite well, but leaves SK's inferior to paladins.<br />
 <br />
To fix this:<br />
 <br />
A 100% vie-line/or super-high damage rune (I.E. effectively invlunerable) or a high percentage avoidance buff. Would be a recourse effect on either a meaningless spell or an aggro spell.<br />
 <br />
Minimum level 40-50, whatever. Low enough that it's usefull on anything that matters, but high enough to prevent it being used on Eye of Zomm or anything of the like.<br />
 <br />
Maximum levels paralleling paladin stuns.<br />
 <br />
Addition of a &quot;Recourse Box&quot; for recourse buffs. This would be important for this change, and would be resolve several of the common complaints by SK's and necros... How many times have you heard someone say, &quot;Put [XXX recourse] into the short buff box!&quot;?<br />
 <br />
Durations/recasts such that total damage avoided from the new line, in addition to the damage mitigated by Aura of Pain, would be roughly equivilant to a paladin stunning.  <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
3) Add disease debuff to the malo lines of spells.<br />
It is currently the only line which is not debuffed by the malo spells, and it is relied upon heavily by shadowknights. This hurts us pretty badly as our spears and, to a lesser extent, a number of our other spells, are disease based with no resist mod. Adding disease to the malo line would greatly improve their functionality. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
These changes would bring shadowknights into line with pallys, and return knights collectively to their established offtanking role. Warriors would remain the undisputed MT of choice on raid bosses.<br />
<br />
We (knights collectively) would have at our disposal damage avoidance via spells, burst mitigation discs, and group-friendliness. Warriors would have superior tanking for longer durations and against higher level mobs. Knight damage avoidance spells would not be a factor on raid bosses, and knight mitigation discs would be too short for raid MT'ing, while still being less powerful than the warrior equivilant.<br />
<br />
We would be ideally suited to offtanking/trash clearing, with a more readily available tanking disc and spell-based avoidance. Warriors, with higher raw tanking power, furious, and AE taunt would remain the preferred raid maintank. Both classes would be valid tanks for single-group encounters.<br />

<br />
You pointed out there is a 15 percent gap in tanking abilities outside of discs between knights and warriors.  You didnt point out however that the 15 percent gap makes the gap on the relative powercurve wider as the wattage of the mobs increases.  If you plotted the difference in trash mob dps done between a warrior and a sk vs teir/zone, it would look more like an exponintial graph then a linear one...and honestly to maintain a balence it should be a flat line with a constant multipier for equipment factored into the equation.  The constant multiplier would mean if the dps differnce was 50, in the next expansion/era of loot, if the equipment available is 10 percent better the dps difference would increase to 55.  Keeping the tanking gap at a strait up percentage is just laziness on the part of the developers.</div></div><hr />

Runes and Vie will not scale well. The only comparable solution would be a Fear2 line or something similar. You might link the post from TSW showing the imbalance, or relevent info from it.<br />
<br />
If you are going to champion the defensive solution as our way of being balanced, you need to present parsed data of both knights and warriors. Listing two examples, however worthy, without specific data to back it up leaves far too much to the subjectivity of the aa's and gear of both the tanks and the supporting group.<br />
<br />
We could have used Ikkinz/Tipt, but that is no longer an option.<br />
<br />
There are some other options to improve pulling, and I will try to post them when I have a bit more time. As well as some more input.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The runes/vie would scale if implimented as I suggested - as I said, effective invulnerability.  Make it a 50k rune for example - if the game were to eventually progress to the point where that's insufficient, it could always be retroactively changed like deathtouch recently was.  It would scale identically to stuns if implimented as such.  <br />
<br />
The advantage of this over something that essentially mimics stun (Fear2) is that it's unique and therefore less objectionable by pallys (it also wouldn't interrupt spells, leaving them that advantage, which is quite fair for them to have).  <br />
<br />
<br />
As for backing it up with data, I'll do what I can to collect info - anything anyone else can contribute can be posted/linked here, PM'ed to me, emailed to me (sleinjinn@cinci.rr.com) or IM'ed to me (JWebster2006).</div></div><hr />

Yes, that would be great Siilvir.<br />
An update/retuning of our pulling skills would be great.<br />
A chance to resist spells and also either a generally faster FD spell or a seperate longish hotbutton &quot;insta FD&quot; would be great.<br />
<br />
The only arguments I see against it (from our discussions in the guild) is monks complaining. But if you look at their petition draft on the MB you find that they list pulling as their secondary function after melee DPS. I think it's or if we are in the same league as them at our secondary function.<br />
<br />
P.S. I like pulling :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Synapticus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">As long as you limit one class to be the very best at one particular role, this game will never be balanced.<br />

<br />
Why the hell is it ok to have 8 or so different choices for DPS, but not ok to have 3 choices for Tanking boss mobs, or three choices for Raid main healing?<br />
<br />
The only way to fix this is to roughly equalize tanking ability amongst all the tanks on all levels of the game and have widely divergent utilities/abilities/specialties.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thats my right wing opinion.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Xanathol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Ya know, reading the Steel Whiner, I am starting to slip from the 'knight defensive' idea too. SoE clearly doesn't want to give it to us anyhow. IMO, I think we need to push *really* hard for Fear2. I mean, we've mentioned it, but *really* push for it. Pally's don't seem to mind the us getting stun type spells; most are in agreement we could use the effect. If we could push for Fear2, then couple with Pally's so that stuns stick on nameds to some degree, we may be better off. Still doesn't solve one rounding, but maybe we can sneak a vie type buff request in there. Just my latest opinion on the matter...if warriors think stuns are overpowered but won't support mini-def, fuck em - give us stuns too and let them cry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Stuns aren't the glorious solution they're portrayed to be on TSW.  They're rediculously overpowered on some mobs, yet entirely useless on others, and for some they help, but don't really do what they need to (1-rounded...).  <br />
<br />
I'm starting to lean toward removing the &quot;XXX Command&quot; line and replacing it with something useful (and I'm working on that, but I'm not a pally, so I can't easily just whip something up heh) and linking the Force of XXX line so that they can only effectively use one high-level stun.  At the same time, implimenting a tanking disc to make up the lost territory would mean that pallys wouldn't have much grounds on which to scream and cry about a nerf.  <br />
<br />
SK's would still need something to bring them up to par with the pally's - chain stunning (assuming no interrupts/fizzles, which obviously is overly idelic) they can knock ~30% off the mob's DPS even with only one stun.  As for how to do that, I'm kinda leaning toward a 25% avoidance buff implimented in the fashion described above, with say a 5tick duration with a 20 sec recast or a high-aggro, short duration 25% accuracy debuff with limitations equivilant to stuns.  Both options have advantages, the latter might be the better solution overall...<br />
<br />
This would remove the main argument warriors have against knights receiving a tanking discipline (aside from &quot;But Defensive is a warrior ability!&quot;) and constitute a definate large step in the right direction in terms of balance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Xanathol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">2 problems with that...<br />
<br />
1. majority of warriors will NEVER agree that knights should even exist, much less tank anything non-trivial. Trying to reason with most warriors is pointless.<br />
<br />
2. SoE obviously doesn't give a rat's ass. How many suggestions have been made? How many times have we asked content and warriors to NOT be nerfed? And SoE? They do exactly the opposite, and pay no mind.<br />
<br />
I'm really losing hope on the subject of class balance. Its seems all SoE cares about is how many cry loudly enough; they don't even care how ridiculous the requests are, and surely don't have the balls to do what's right. At this point, I wouldn't be surprised if warriors did another fag-day strike shit, that they could get CH and slow added to their abilities. Its getting beyond broken...its getting gay.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't necessarily agree.  I'd much rather see knights and warriors tuned in different directions than being exactly equal tanks.  Let warriors keep their title as unabashed raid MT of choice, but make knights unparalleled offtanks, and leave them both adequate for anything single-group oriented.  We're still all &quot;tanks&quot; but we're not exactly equivilant.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. 12 sec duration, 72 sec recycle, 65% mitigation discipline (oh and don't give to pallys, this is our scaling damage reducer+enhancement to pulling)<br />
<br />
2. Two step approach to lowering DR across the board.<br />
2a.  10% decrease in DR of every mob in EQ.<br />
2b.  Increase how often DR is debuffed.<br />

3. Increase the aggro generation of our Darkness, Asystole, Terror, and Fear lines of spells.<br />

4. Put SCS on a damn toggle already.<br />

Simple, and far less wordy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">brael has a good point...<br />
its doubtful long write ups will accomplish much.<br />
if you want people to pay attention you need to get your point across as concisely as possible. no matter how valid and well spoken you make your arguments, it doesn't matter if they're not read, and the long write up style is not conducive to being read. the least you should do is begin with a brief summary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Crimson Tears</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Ive been kicking the idea around of a massive cripple like short duration debuff with a group recourse to sort of cut down a mobs dps.  Say 3-4 tick duration with a 30-45 second recast.  I really suck with tossing numbers around, just isnt my strength, but it makes sense when combined with fear2 perhaps to close the gap with pally stuns while improving our group desireability at the same time.  The short duration would also make us stack somewhat on raids, and would be really helpful if we get a short duration debuff box like SJ proposed.<br />
<br />
Of course Im sure my idea is horribly overpowered and will be torn apart by SJ or Siilv in the next couple replys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Pyrthin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I could live with the following:<br />
<br />
1.  Add a 50% avoidance recourse effect to our terrors that lasts 2-3 ticks.  Make sure terrors generate plenty of hate.  As with paladin stuns, the same spell we use for aggro must be the same spell that gives us this effect.  This effect would also help us when pulling multiple mobs.<br />
<br />
2.  Add a 1 minute, 30% mitigation discipline, usable every 4 minutes.  Maybe 1.5 minutes usable every 5 minutes.</div></div><hr />

It can't be that simple - it has to be limited the same way pally stuns are.  Easiest way would be to stick it on a 0.0 second stun, but that's not necessarily ideal.</div></div><hr />
