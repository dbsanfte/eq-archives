<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Lynxal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I just don't find these extremely situational abilities always being made a spell very fair.  Why not just make this an AA like AE taunt.  It's not stepping on Warrior's toes since 1200hate isn't enough to do anything in a tank switch situation.<br />
<br />
I would have used this spell exactly zero times in the last week..so why would you keep this up?  Unless I was doing PoE or PoA where I KNOW 3-5 little bastards I can tank are going to spawn at the same time, this spell would get memmed as often as invis to undead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Noctix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'm also getting pretty sick of getting situational stuff.  We already have tons of &quot;utility&quot; that's only useful in situations that never happen.  Give us some friggin' core tanking abilities that can be used on every pull in every group.<br />
<br />
All these worthless situational abilities only give them more excuses for not giving us avoidance discs, increased mitigation, or more hp AAs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I could not agree more. I honestly wonder where they are getting these crappy ideas. We all know how much 1200 hate will help...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Skvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I can see how in some situations this would be pretty awesome. It allows you to create aggo on mezzed mobs for example while fighting the main target. So much better if a mez breaks early for the mob to come and hit us than to hit the enchanter.<br />
<br />
On imcoming ...yeah hmmm suicide in a lot of places, but very handy also in a lot of places. Even with 8 gem slots I think I could find room for this one.... even it meant not memming uberly resisted, crappy damage spear for it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Skoggel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hrm. Could maybe be useful for the rare times raids AE stuff. Currently there isn't much we can do to help out, just cycle through mobs and find one with a caster in HoTT then do your best to taunt. Not that I'd expect this to be 100% full answer to keeping aggro off casters in these situations, but it's a step up.<br />
<br />
Also could have great uses PLing, but erm.. you don't design spells for that purpose.<br />
<br />
I like the spell anyway, but I've a feeling it may ultimately end up taking the place of a spell that can help out for real issues rather than rare situational uses that to my knowledge no one has complained about lacking.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ya, xp grinds is where we need help... Although you are correct, it will make us even more powerful there, while ignoring our real issues...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Krazaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">It's not enough hate to make a difference, note the 30 second recast.<br />
<br />
I doubt it'd generate enough hate to keep mobs off healers even short term, definitely not enough to keep them off while you wait for recast.<br />
<br />
These pure aggro spells are fine when combined with melee aggro, but without actively meleeing, they're practically worthless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Temet Nosce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">This is the first spell that they have given us which surpasses our level 15 spells for aggro. I was going to sgguest it, but now there's no need. There's plenty of situations with trash mobs on raids where I want to say &quot;hey, ignore the clerics, look at me!&quot; and this fills that niche nicely. Just cast it with no targets, and if a mob turns to you and starts hitting, tank mezz it as normal. Of all the spells that add straight aggro, this is the first one that provides any use at all.<br />
<br />
With the recast time, though, they may need to adust the total hate added.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Leafweir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">30 second recast is kinda lame. What're you supposed to do with this?

I'm sorta thinking the same thing.  One CH or crit blast by random_wizzie_01 is going to have more than 1200 hate.</div></div><hr />

Its just a change to the upgraded voice line they were going to give us. WAY better for it to help us rather than how it was with us being able to give it to a warrior.<br />
<br />
Who knows maybe this spell has been altered to fall into line with the yet unnounced other changed to SK... you know the class defination that says we are a tank and actually gives us the tools to be able to tank  :eek: .......nah im being silly SOE wouldnt do something sensable like that ............................</div></div><hr />

<br />
How is creating a new spell ignoring our real issues? This sort of tag line is getting real old. It could be that the guy/gal that is creating some of these spells should have nothing to do with balancing our tankability. Adding to our utility does not mean that it will detract from what we want/need.</div></div><hr />

Read what Krazzak wrote, about the value of this spell, as it currently stands it will do basically nothing. One heal, One Nuke, One slow, One stun and we will loose aggro. Terrors are broken, making a new spell line based on Terrors, will also be broken...<br />
<br />
And all this time SK's are worrying about a silly situational spell that may help us occasionally, vs. why we can't enjoy the same challenging group content that warriors can...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Considering this could just as easily be an AA that did not take up another spell slot I am less inclined to hope they give us a useful /disc.  They will give us a mitigation spell that uses a buff slot and has an additional recourse take up another buff slot....but.. but.. we gave you more buff slots in this expansion...thanks, I bet every mob procs two 10 minute duration detrimental effects too.<br />
<br />
Shriva the range is half the distance from you to your cleric on a raid who is hovering around his 100 range healing to stay out of your way and away from the AE rampages, g-fluxs, etc.  So when that mob goes tearing accross the room to the cleric if you are fast enough you might hit the mob.  But considering you probably had the mob targetted anyway..why bother with an AE and just use a normal agro spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Bunk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">We are only going to get a few new spells in this expansion.  Getting one like this one that is marginally/situationaly useful means we now are going to get at best (X-1) spells that could actually be worth memming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Keyan Aubaine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Although there is some tweaking required, mostly the recast, it's all an all around good spell, and definitely much better than the oh-so-awesome upgrade to the voice line it used to be.<br />
<br />
Unlike the single target terrors (which btw work fine as they are, at least at the higher levels of play), it isn't meant to hold agro by itself, but be a more generic agro help.<br />
-Group situation: Helps with single target agro, while boosting agro with mezed mobs/adds without costing us any combat time<br />
-Raid situation: Multi-mob situations, both helps with raising agro with every mob around so we get whacked rather than random healers/debuffers when a mob is loose, and allows for much more control in our CCing duties.<br />
<br />
Now, of course, some posters on this board are not capable of grasping that with the current shape of the game, giving us defensive would do pretty little as our agro generation abilities are lower than that of a warrior, and that even then our tanking would still be inferior... But there is no spell that could fix the low average IQ =x<br />
Curse disease cloud/shadow vortex for breeding so many agro knowledge impaired gimps... And curse SoE for giving warriors the same brainless taunt we used to have, weeee.<br />
<br />
Basically, one pretty decent step towards fixing our agro issues.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree, but that has nothing to do with weather they are ignoring other issues. This is more on topic.<br />
<br />
And all this time SK's are worrying about a silly situational spell that may help us occasionally, vs. why we can't enjoy the same challenging group content that warriors can...<br />
<br />
This thread started as a discussion about a spell. We have other threads that discuss our tanking abilities and what needs to be fixed. I personally like having some situational abilities, it makes the experience a bit more full.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Tillesia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">I don't like this spell at all.  First, the Sony devs have not addressed the problem that our spells don't scale with content by having a fixed hate of 1200.  Second, this is a SPELL ability which means it will take up a spell gem and have a fixed recast time of 30 seconds.  This spell has such a miniscule use (basically, an oh @#$% too many mobs on that pull, hit AE taunt until CC can get them under control), that I can't imagine having this spell up in any group.<br />
<br />
two things need to be done to make this ability useful<br />
1.  Make the increase in hate like an unfailing taunt + X amount of hate so that when the ability hits it actually does something (casting 2 terror of thules, i.e. 1200 hate, on a mob sometimes does nothing to get its attention in my experience - i know i know, not a precise example, but illustrative nonetheless)<br />
2.  Make this an ability button and not a spell, so that it doesn't take up a spell gem.  If we get this ability, we need to have it available to press in emergency situations without stealing a spell gem from us.  Its general uselessness does not justify having it memmed &quot;just in case&quot; over a spell we would use during every fight.<br />
<br />
I for one would not have much use for an AE taunt unless these two changes were made or I was EXPECTING a large pull (hardly ever).</div></div><hr />

Our agro sucks now relative to warriors...so Defensive doesn't do anything for SKs.  Warriors tank better than us.  I am better than you....screw SoE.<br />
<br />
Just want to make sure I got that right.<br />

Explain to me again the part where we wouldn't see a benefit from /disc defensive because warriors hold more agro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think this is a cool idea, and it's certainly better than another upgrade to voice.  So what if you only mem it once in a while... there's several raiding sitautions I can think of where this thing would have uses... in addition to the ldon's brael mentioned.<br />
<br />
It does need to be changed to either simply massive hate or have a much shorter recast time though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Trysbrina67</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Up the hate a few hundred to 1k points and it would be good I think.  For fucks sake its alot better in this form than the previous forms.<br />
Now if only theyd tweak a few more spells.  :p</div></div><hr />

Joy.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Now if its content I could tank well, or if I had a disc to fire off and keep agro... things might be different.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Rueeliar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">This is probably the best spell I have seen for us for OoW by a longshot.<br />
<br />
Terrors dont work as well as CD/Fear.  But 1200 hate &gt; 800 hate.  Big difference.  Fifty percent boost.  That will probably but it ahead of Fear for aggro production, though likely behind CD still (I use Festering, anyway).<br />
<br />
1200 AE hate is ALOT of hate.  Do not forget the social aggro aspect of it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sure thing.<br />
<br />
Warrior + defensive = Knight + defensive + a little more damage dealt + more agro + more damage taken<br />
<br />
Therefore, defensive would not change the current order of things. It would close some of the gap, true, however adding defensive would be a huge change that still would manage to miss the mark. Unlike you i don't want to get a huge failure, i'd rather get an upgrade that, you know, will work right~</div></div><hr />

If they made this spell a targeted AE instead of PB, would it still be exempt from the aggro scaling ?

Wow, talk about becoming the agro gods again. 0.5sec casting time, no recast time? The only way to get agro from us would be taunt. And that's on an AE. Unless the mobs killed us, that would be insane, and therefore, will never be done.</div></div><hr />

I can think up of some situations where such a spell would be helpful.  Mind you, im not raiding player, just a casual 5hour per week type player.  I do lots of LDoN and silly zone that can be managed by 2-3 players of my caliber.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For a class with no defensive disciplines, AE taunting mobs raid trash on incoming, is a death sentence.<br />
<br />
It is not going to be that useful for maintaining aggro on mobs mezzed in camp, since there's no way 1200 aggro every 30 seconds is going to stay ahead of healing aggro.<br />
<br />
If they are planning raids that involve swarms of very low damage output adds with some annoying proc, then maybe the spell will have use.  The recast time definitely needs to be revisited though.  Try chain casting Terror of Shadows on an unengaged add on your next raid.  That is over 30% higher hate than this spell will generate.  If you can't hold aggro with that, without meleeing, then what good will this spell be?</div></div><hr />

You all bitch about SoE needing to fix our class problems, when I bet that the majority of you can't even name the problems.<br />
Terror spells work fine, but you all have been bitching about them for so long, you automatically assume that they dont do shit.  Yes, in the long run they probably arent worth using to hold aggro.  1 cast is like 1 proc from a warrior with decent gear.  They were never intended to be instant, godofallaggro spells.<br />
SoE dosen't listen to SKs for the simple reason that most all of you do nothing but bitch.  This is a GOOD spell.  It's a hell of a lot more useful than its previous incarnation, but all you people see is the word &quot;terror&quot; and automatically assume the spell is going to totally suck ass and not be worth using.  Yeah, maybe its not as nice as the AE stun/mana drain that clerics or pallys are getting, but its still nice.</div></div><hr />

Don't think I've seen a single statement on these forums, that I agreed with more than this. <br />

Those who say Terror line is broke are sadly mistaken.  These spells are great for holding agro, and for grabbign fast agro.  I've used them to agro lock many bosses I've tanked and for fast agro on things like the AoW when our tank has died unexpectedly to keep him off the clerics.<br />

Sure, our spell can be used situationally but it really doesn't address any of the important issues that have been brought up relentlessly for the last couple of years or so... not to mention our &quot; sister class &quot; version of an AoE blows it away on many lvls.</div></div><hr />

I think its kind of wierd that so many are complaining as well, hopefully this spell will get tweaked a bit more before being finalized (as well as perhaps some type of discipline to help with damage).  Its not a horrible spell and its eons better than what was in the VoDiscord slot before.  Perhaps the other voices could get this change retroactively.</div></div><hr />

However, effects like Stun, Snare and Fear don't get their hate scaled based upon the range to the mob in my experience.<br />

What is broken then? Terrors certainly cannot generate close to the aggro that Stuns, Ranger Snares, Or most Teir 3 Warrior Weapon procs. So I don't really understand your point. They don't work well enough to use but they are not broken? I don't understand.</div></div><hr />

Terrors are great for additional aggro on something you're tanking.  They're practically worthless as the sole source of aggro on a mob.  In it's current form, this spell will not allow us to hold aggro on multiple mobs.  Lower the recast to 6 seconds like the other terrors and it might work.<br />
<br />
I still fail to see where this will be useful though, maybe LDoN?  I'm lucky to survive tanking one mob at a time in Txevu.  AE taunt 3-4 mobs off the healers and they'll be back on the casters less than 2 seconds later when I'm at bind.<br />
<br />
This is a level 70 spell, not some class upgrade thrown in for people raiding PoTime.  It should be useful to us in Omens content intended for level 70 people.  Unless our issues tanking 1 mob at a time are dealt with in OoW, the ability to AE taunt several, even if it does work, is not something useful.</div></div><hr />

Terrors work fine, they do exactly what they are coded to do.<br />
<br />
Problem is, they're designed to work in conjunction with other forms of aggro.  Melee a mob and chain cast Terror of Thule and you'll hold aggro pretty much as well as a warrior procing Anger every 10 seconds.  Try and aggro from a distance with Terror though and you'll never surpass the aggro generation of somebody meleeing, nuking or healing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Broken implies they don't work at all (at least the way I understand it), terrors do work, but they just suck in current form especially compared to CD etc.  If SoE would just listen and raise the hate generated people would probably start memming them in greater numbers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Terror of Thule has a lower cast time, faster recast and negligible difference in mana cost, compared to Fear.  I couldn't say which one is really higher aggro, but busted aggro on a resisted (immune) spell doesn't mean that Terror is the broken spell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
EDIT: If SOE changed all the Cleric spells from 66-70 to be half as efficent as the 61-65 spells, they would not be broken by many of your definition, because they would be working as designed, even though they would be useless compared to other means.</div></div><hr />

Actually, I did.  Check my old last month post found here (http://www.shadowknight.org/forums/showthread.php?t=21456&amp;page=2&amp;pp=15&amp;highlight=Taunt)<br />
<br />
<br />
Don't flame me. :) I only thought out of my simple wish as knight in some situations where casual gamers can shine such as regular LDON runs, etc and in AEing groups or any emergency AE taunt to save cleric's life etc. It seems that whatever I throw some ideas around, SOE seems to take on that and change so far for years. I just gotta be more careful of what I say.<br />
<br />
Honestly, Why we complain about it?!?!  It was a useless upgraded voice line that we never used anymore cuz warriors never need it anymore. Do you rather to have useless upgraded voice line or a brand-new taunt AE spell for SAME darn spell slot for upgrade?? I rather the latter use. We lose NOTHING out of it. We gained nice extra situational tool over useless voice line. I am willing to give up entire damn voice line for AE taunt spell. Thanks. It *WILL* have NO effect on our top 10 list at all. We still will see same changes to us with or without AE taunt upgrade.  Once we have top 10  fixed, AE taunt would be little more useful cuz we can survive little better in harder area just to save some other people's life. You see how warriors used AE taunt many times in xp groups to save ppls life? Now, SK could but at lesser degree cuz of lousy 3.0 cast time and it behaves differently from warrior AE taunt.<br />
<br />
I used to train 5-6 mobs to myself in LDON normal without any form of CC and no secondary tanks most of the time. I kept switching 3-4 mobs to keep them all on me and have my deadly DS of 74 with druid DS to chew them dry unslowed.  With AE taunt spell, I won't need to switch mobs too much and it'll make my job easier and time to pump up DS even more to do the job better. :) DS+AE taunt is nice in easy zones. :)<br />
<br />
Only thing I wanna see is that cast time gotta be reduced to 0.5 sec like spear line then it'll be useful for us against multi-mobs.  1.5 sec cast time modifed won't even cut it against many mobs hitting us and will interrupt our AE taunt.  However, changing voice line to AE taunt spell line is a good first step in my opinion. DEATH TO VOICE LINE!!</div></div><hr />

I use it weekly, and the Warriors I group with notice when they don't have it. Granted we are still pre-elemental, but it does get used. I'd expect this will change when the Warriors get their next set of 1handers.<br />

Do we have any indication that it will be fixed? This would be a different conversation if Terrors worked reliably. I'd still argue that this would have limited use, but it would at least have a use occasionally. However, at this point in time, it has NO use because Terrors are not fixed, and worse we have no indication that they will be fixed. A new spell based on a pretty much useless spell, is going to be pretty much useless.</div></div><hr />

Terrors work without doing damage, you cast Terror of Thule and unless you're using it to pull (thus hitting the initial hate cap possibly) you're getting 600 aggro wether or not you're meleeing, far away, on top of it not meleeing, whatever.  600 hate is 600 hate.

Sadly you have proven that 90% of the peopel here are idiots.  As Brael said they generate hate the exact amount shown, whether your next to the mob or across the raid from the mob.  One of the great things about Terrors is they WORK WITHOUT DOING DAMAGE.  <br />

I actually agree with you on this. I just have no idea why you would use Terror over Fear, when Fear gives more aggro. And works much better on initial aggro. I've never been able to pull with Terrors and not have the mob make a bee line to the shaman when they slow. With Fear thats not an issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u95"><b>Belyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p95">My biggest concern with continueing with the terror line is that the oow upgrade is something that we should have right now, once we get into omens we may find out that it is inadaquate for the new content.

What places are you pulling?  Tactics, Ssra, BoT Towers and Hard LDoNs,  I've had no problem pulling with Terror,  and tanking it while the shaman does their best slow.<br />
<br />
If I'm not pulling but I'm tanking I'll drop a terror on the mob as the puller brings it in and engage it immediately, while the shaman is doing the slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u98"><b>Belyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p98">I know its already kinda on the top 10 list but maybe something more specific like a complete retooling of the terror line for the hate values would be more appropriate.  Have terror of thule = 1200 hate and work backwards.  Far as the new spell goes only the devs can know if 1200 will be enough for the new content, and thats if they even care enough to check it which i wont hold my breath on.  A reduction of cast time and recast time would be appropritate too.  To be quite honest i dont know if 1200 would be enough to give the edge we are looking for or not.<br />
<br />
On a side note, does anyone know the difference between hate and modified hate ?  The descrition of the hate on lucy is different for voice of discord and all the terror spells.  If you also look at the warrior tuant abilities they have 2 lines in the description for most..both create hate and create modified hate.  Im wondering why terror spells dont have both.<br />
<br />
edit: Looking at the terror line it seems they are using the same basic math for determining how much more hate each new terror should have then the old one like it was a dd dps spell.  Its so obvious thats not the way aggro scales.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The shaman I group with tend to slow before the mob is in camp. Once mob is being tanked, you are no longer talking about just Terror aggro. But at that point gear makes a difference also.<br />
<br />
Currently I'm talking Ferubi, Sewers and Hard LDoN's... But I initially discovered this back in our tactics days, I simply could not keep mobs off of &quot;agressive&quot; shaman (Slow + several Dots) with our top Terror spell.

terrors are a waste of a spell slot up the hate to more then a CD, fear or even stuns and ill think about it. terrors may do what they &quot;say they do&quot; but the agro generated is seriously not worth the effort to mem it.<br />

<br />
/boggle :P<br />
<br />
The level this spell is geared at, actually fearing a mob isn't a real big concern. I use fear mainly, terrors have never done much for me. When I can't use fear (Uqua) I generally put up Astyole and use that and snare.<br />
<br />
It's an interesting spell, but it needs to be like.. 12000 hate.. for it to be useful :p Thought I doubt i'd waste a spell slot on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u104"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p104">we're talking about the terror line<br />
It's great at my level (hence &quot;at this level&quot;)<br />
At this level there are fearable mobs<br />
ALSO can you say for certain that the fear level cap won't be raised?<br />
<br />
Edit: now with more anger management</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u105"><b>Kemora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p105">You obviously have some anger issues :P Are you sure you're not casting Terrors on yourself?  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u106"><b>Rhumba_Kween</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p106">Keevel, We're talking about mobs we'd fight at level 65. No doubt that terrors are the best option for not breaking mezz at your level. CD is better if mezz is not an issue. But be careful not to confuse the issue. When you respond to me about Terrors, you are talking about at whatever level you are at, NOT 65. Be careful not to confuse the issue. Just like I can't talk about the mobs in Uqua, because I've not seen them, although I can talk about Terrors vs. Fear/CD on other mobs.<br />
<br />
EDIT: and please note that my angry moment, occured after Vorath said that 90% of the SK's on this board were idiots for using Fear over Terrors. It was meant fairly sarcastically for someone so eager to generalize, especially when he's wrong about something. (Relative aggro of fear)...</div></div><hr />

Do you play a SK? If you did, you would know that Terrors do not work at all without doing some damage. <br />
<br />
You're right it's a statement that specifically lists this spell, not the line as being discussed as well as zone, MOb and level limits.  <br />
<br />
Yup you're right I must be the one that confused the issue.  <br />
<br />
How stupid of me not to realize you were specifically talking about the new spell's use in GoD trials and not the line of spells by your specific use of the term &quot;Terrors&quot;.  <br />
<br />
Also &quot;Whatever level you are at?&quot;  It's listed in my sig.</div></div><hr />

My question then does incite scale?  It does have a hate dot component?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u110"><b>Trysbrina67</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p110">Fear and CD scale?  Hard to get an approximate value on them (fear is &gt; EB, and CD is &gt; tash, but thats about it from what I can tell) but it seems like these spells are flat hate that at the moment is huge compared to what other classes can generate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u111"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p111">Go back and to some newbie mobs and test.

<br />
All &quot;detrimental&quot; flagged spells scale unless the hate values are hard-coded.  Four years of using SV/DC/CD/Fear for agro has shown it to me.</div></div><hr />

So basically I sit in the back, DD'ing/meleeing, waiting for that moment when a cleric is paying attention so I can actually tank a mob for a few seconds.<br />

That AE hate spell is a slap in the face, its 100% useless in the end game, unless they throw in a mitigation spell/ability.<br />

<br />
My definition of &quot;broken&quot; when it wasn't doing good job compared to current CD/Fear. If you imply broken as not working at all. That's fine. People has different opinions which is fine but we get the picture overall heh. Heck, people called GoD broken content and yet it was working ok but not donig right job. I probably would call CD broken based on Absor's old famous saying, &quot;You weren't supposed to use any low level spells&quot; when D.C. was nerfed. I sure never forget his idioticy statement while paladins and others still use low level spells for many reasons and attacked SK that they weren't supposed to use low level spells...

Better hope so. Sure looks like something that would benefit a class with a disc.<br />

Too funny to see Keyan weigh in and mention disease cloud.......despite two lines of spells meant to essentially create the same result. Imagine the other attention the class could have gotten through those two lines of spells considering they create suicide now at the top levels.<br />

Terrors work just fine at range, on incoming with a shaman slowing, even when that wizard is overnuking. (although it is fun time to time to let the npc run over and smack the wizard around a bit)<br />

Nocifer does have a good point that AE Hate is for another 5 levels, there will be a big difference in a lvl 65 sk and a lvl 70. Even as we are now there are many uses for this.</div></div><hr />

We'll just have to wait and see if it needs any tweaking for actually acting like a taunt. <br />

Quit bitching about hard hitting mobs btw. SK's can tank anything they want to - so much just depends on your healers being on the ball.</div></div><hr />

Yeah... and not only we will get the upgrades, other classes will also increase.. Same gap between the tank classes, just at lvl 70 now. Wuwu we will be able to tank without 2 healers in Tipt but with only one cleric &quot;perhaps&quot;.. wait.. Warrior only needs a shaman any more to duo Kyv Heartstriker Jhiru... EEEP..

Actually the tanking gap has gotten wider by design with newer expansions not stayed the same.  Since soe has refused to even acknowledge that the gap is too wide now im expecting more of the same.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u123"><b>Tukka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p123">This spell doesn't look that great to me, and to think, there are probably paladins and warriors out there who are up in arms over it. ;)  At level 70, if it's a taunt spell and only a taunt spell, there should be absolutely no doubt about its ability to pull aggro off a mob that has had a slow type spell cast on two or three times, keeping in mind that this spell will likely be at least as difficult to obtain as glyphed rune words, probably a lot more difficult to obtain.  If they redesigned the spell to scale and made sure it produced sufficient aggro (that is, aggro equal to or greater than 2-3 slows), the 30 second recast time is acceptable, but the cast time still ought to be reduced to 1 second or less.<br />
<br />
I can see it now:<br />
<br />
You begin to cast Voice of Discord.<br />
Your spellcasting has been interupted.<br />
Your spell fizzles.<br />

<br />
So yeah, a shorter cast time would be good.<br />
<br />
If this spell is a placeholder for until our entire line of aggro spells is reevaluated, then that is okay, it's certainly better than getting another worthless &quot;aggro buff&quot; voice spell, which only seems to be useful these days if you're grouped with a sub-optimally bazaar geared warrior.  If they replace the flat aggro on VoD and the Terrors with something that works (on our Top 10 list), then this is useful, albeit only situationally.  The fact that we have other issues/problems shouldn't be a point against our getting situationally useful spells, those other issues/problems can and should be addressed separately from this particular line/theme of spells.<br />
<br />
And while it is lousy that paladins can hold aggro using a line of spells that actually serves another (very) useful purpose, but we've all become accustomed to having to devote a mem slot to a spell that serves no other purpose but to produce aggro, and with an extra mem slot coming with OoW, this issue is mitigated slightly (it's still a little unfair, but oh well).  If they give us a powerful line or lines of spells that produces aggro by design and does it undeniably better, more efficiently and more reliably than any other spells in the game, then I'll be through complaining/criticizing the Terrors/VoD.<br />
<br />
Until that happens though, I just have to shrug my shoulders at the prospect of getting this spell.</div></div><hr />
