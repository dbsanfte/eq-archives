--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
First of all this info has been gathered from here, and from Allakhazams.. all I have done is consolidated and opened up discussion about a connection...<br />
<br />
Please read on<br />
<br />
Stage 1 - The Small Clockwork Talisman<br />
<br />
<br />
Quote:<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
You say, 'Hail, Jimlok Keylifter' <br />
<br />
(PoTranquility n540 n1390)Jimlok Keylifter <br />
<br />
Jimlok Keylifter says 'Well met, traveler. Can I be of assistance to you? Can't say as I got much to do at the moment. <br />
I'm just attending to a little fishing while I wait on my friend to get back to me. Hopefully he doesn't keep me waiting for <br />
too much longer. I can only stand so much of this place.' <br />
<br />
You say, 'what friend' <br />
<br />
Jimlok Keylifter says 'This is the situation. My friend Gilor Swiftfoot and I were going to try our hand at breaking into <br />
the Plane of Justice. Yeah, yeah, I'm sure you're thinking that's silly and all, but how many people do you know of that can <br />
say they've broken out of the Eternal Prison, let alone in? 'None', right? So, we were all ready to go in when I got word <br />
that something else needed re-appropriating all quick like. I told Gilor to wait until I got back, but no. He had to run <br />
off, eager as always and as patient as a gust of wind. Now, I think he's in trouble.' <br />
<br />
You say, 'what trouble' <br />
<br />
Jimlok Keylifter says 'People here seem to think that he tried to make the prison break by himself. They've found another <br />
way in, so maybe he took that route. I'd like to check on him, but if he isn't in there, I'm liable to get myself in trouble.<br />
I think I'd be much better off staying here and waiting for him. If you want to go look for him, I'd be quite grateful. <br />
I doubt you have the skills to get far in there. You don't look like the burglarizing type, but I'd even be willing to give <br />
you the document that I picked up on my last job if you look for him.' <br />
<br />
You say, 'what document' <br />
<br />
Jimlok Keylifter says 'Don't you worry about that unless you bring me some word of Gilor's condition. Trust me, it's a <br />
strange and mysterious document. Just the sort of thing you adventuring types love. Find Gilor and it's all yours, I give <br />
you my word.' <br />
<br />
You say, 'i will look for him' <br />
<br />
Jimlok Keylifter says 'Alright, friend, you need to be on the lookout for a gnome about my height, with one bad leg. He's <br />
got a bit of a limp, but he's still a hard one to chase down. If you can't find him, be on the lookout for anything that <br />
resembles a small bottle. He's got a way with rodents; so if you see some little pest carrying a bottle of some sort, grab <br />
him! It will most likely be a message for me. Bring it back immediately. It won't be of any use to you anyway, since you <br />
can't read our code. Be quick and good luck!' <br />
<br />
Go get a bottle with a note in it from “a festering rat” in Plane of Justice. <br />
<br />
Jimlok Keylifter sighs deeply as he hands you an intricate schematic of some device. The notation on the document is written <br />
in a strange language that is completely foreign to you. 'This doesn't bode well for Gilor. He says he's found a secret <br />
tunnel and he's going to go in deeper. I guess I'll go in and find him if he doesn't return soon. Well, a deal is a deal. <br />
Here is the document that I mentioned.' <br />
<br />
Jimlok Keylifter says 'The person that I was supposed to lift it for was a jeweler of sorts, but he mainly dealt in <br />
mechanical devices. I wasn't able to track him down to get my coin, so I don't know what you'll do with it. Maybe my cousin <br />
Tabben will give you something for it. He's got himself a little tinker's shop in the Jeral section of New Tanaan. Show him <br />
the map thingy and see what he says.' <br />
<br />
(PoKnowledge n380 p530)Tabben Bromal , Give the note Jimlok Keylifter gave to you to Tabben Bromal<br />
<br />
Tabben Bromal says 'What is it? What do you wan. . . Oh bloody underfoot, do forgive me, traveler. I'm not used to all this <br />
bickering and flittering about -- you know, the bustle of the 'living' city. The racket, the noise, and the wails of the <br />
children. Bah! I came here to escape it, not to relive it. But if I survived it once, I sure as Brell's holy bottom will do <br />
it again! In hopes of getting you all out of here as soon as possible and the peace and quiet being resurrected out of your <br />
blessed absence, I've agreed to lend some of my knowledge of the more inferior levels of tinkering to those who have an <br />
interest in this art. If you don't intend on purchasing any materials, then be off with you and leave me in peace. However, <br />
if you have coin in your pocket and you plan on spending, then do so quickly. I have more pressing things to do with my time <br />
than wait while you leisurely browse my wares.' <br />
<br />
Tabben Bromal takes the document from you and looks at it for a moment. 'Well, this is a beautiful looking schematic. I <br />
wonder what they are trying to make with it? Where did you get this? No wait; don't tell me. I'd rather not know. I can make <br />
some of this writing out but just barely. What I can read leads me to believe that I'd be better off not knowing.' <br />
<br />
Tabben Bromal falls victim to his curiosity and grabs a small kit from the table behind him. 'Take this kit and look for <br />
the following parts,' he says as he scrunches his nose at the schematic again. 'We'll need a Tri-coated Metal Casing, one <br />
Size C spring, some Creeping silk strands -- whatever those are -- and some Congealed Bile-based Ooze. I'm not sure if this <br />
thing is wanting us to make a device or some sort of nasty cocktail, but that's what it's asking for... ewww!' <br />
<br />
Tabben Bromal says 'Seal those things up in the <br />
container that I just gave you and bring it straight back to me. I'll wait here for you and see if I can decipher anymore <br />
of this schematic.' <br />
<br />
Tri- Coated Metal Casing – clockwork spiders in PoI , <br />
Size C spring - from models in PoI, <br />
Creeping silk strands - oozes in PoD, <br />
Congealed Bile-Based Ooze - Virulent Arachnids in PoN. <br />
<br />
Tabben Bromal says 'Oh, you've returned! Very good, Tiggil! Saria and I have made some real progress on the document that <br />
you brought us. Watch this and you'll see what I mean!' <br />
<br />
Tabben Bromal quickly opens the small case and removes the parts. He takes a tiny spanner, several small bolts, and a long <br />
wire and quickly pieces together what appears to be a small clockwork talisman. He pulls a leather string through the top of <br />
it and offers it to you. <br />
<br />
This gets you the “Small Clockwork Talisman” <br />
<br />
Tabben Bromal says 'That should work for you, but from what we gathered, there's another layer of mechanics that works to <br />
shield and envelope the existing talisman. It's going to require more parts. So take this container and let me know when <br />
you're ready to write down the names of the next set of parts.' <br />

You say, 'I am ready' <br />
<br />
Tabben Bromal says 'Very well. You'll need to <br />
gather up a dense hammered casing for the outer shell; a crystalline carapace will act to protect the face of the device; <br />
and it requires a fiery power source to propel the rotor mechanism. The device is then attached around the neck, <br />
much like the one you are wearing. The only difference will be the strands of living chain that will keep it from slipping <br />
from around your neck. Place those four items and your talisman in that box and return it to me. We should be able to get <br />
this thing built for you without much fuss at all, should all things go well on your end of the task, of course.' <br />

(PoTranquility n390 n1260)Elder Clinka, Give the note Tabben Brommel gave to you to Elder Clinka<br />
<br />
Elder Clinka says 'it is a pleasure to see meet you. I've heard a great deal about you from the other elders. Please give <br />
me a moment to scan ofer this for you.'<br />
<br />
Elder Clinka scans the schematic fora few seconts, mumbling s she reads, 'This parchment states that you are to place a <br />
small shard of concentrated elemental matter into each of the holes in your talisman.' She points a finger to the diagram as <br />
she begins to recount what she has learned from it, 'They would then need to be locked into place, as the diagram indicates <br />
here.'<br />
<br />
Elder Clinka says 'If you bring me a fragment or shard of some living creature from each of the elemental planes, I will see <br />
if we can make this device work. Place them in this lined box and return them to me immediately with your talisman. Int he <br />
meantime, I will continue to translate this document from it's origional language. <br />

This indicates that the 4 items needed for step3 are 'a living fragment of &amp;lt;element&amp;gt;' from each of the elemental <br />
planes. where &amp;lt;element&amp;gt; is fire / air / water / earth <br />
<br />
the 4 shards of elemental matter needed to put this together drop off mephits in the elemental planes. And yes, it still <br />
does use a reagent.<br />

Quote:<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
Elder Clinka carefully opens the small box and takes several small tools from the pocket in her robe. Her nimble fingers <br />
place the glowing elemental pieces into the appropriate sockets and covers them with several small caps that she must have <br />
made while you were away.<br />
<br />
Elder Clinka then looks up at you and says, 'This device is called the Binden Concerentia. It's true power will be revealed <br />
to you soon. This Document describes it as a device that is meant to convert the energy that can be found in true prime <br />
elemental matter, into an entirely new form of energy. The schematic states that this energy will 'bind you to the now'. I <br />
am not sure what that means but I believe you will soon find out.<br />
<br />
Elder Clinka says 'Take care of it and keep it with you at all times,. I feel that your journey from this point wil only <br />
become more dangerous. Perhaps this device will play a role in all of that. Move forward along the path of enlightenment. <br />
May the Balance guide your fate<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Nasiir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The proc on this really isn't much of a draw in my opinion.  Anyone can spend relatively miniscule amounts of time in comparison getting yourself an OT hammer. Hell, given the cost of the reagent needed for each use of the item- less than half what a gate potion would cost, why not just use an actual gate potion, or invest in thurgadin gate potions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Puurrdy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Why get it?<br />
<br />
1.  Not everyone had the foresight/realization you could get a port hammer.<br />
<br />
2.  There are times using a port hammer won't or can't be feasible.<br />
<br />
3.  Gate potions cost more<br />
<br />
4.  Not everyone has good faction with dwarves.<br />
<br />
Besides, it's a quest, and there may be something beyond the 3rd one in the plane of time.<br />
<br />
But no, it's not a quest everyone will want to do becuase it does stink to gather all the parts for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>gorluk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">somewhere embedded in the allakhazam messages after one of the portions relating to this item (not sure if it was after the items themselves or the quest portion, read it a while ago) someone said you could recharge it with a 5 or 6 mana battery, anyone verify this? if so its not so bad since you can recharge it (no idea price on those mana batteries, never used one)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Darko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Got all my pre elemental parts in 1 day =P and got the elemntal stuff from raids, so wasnt much a timesink if you know where to go and got a couple ppl with a few hrs to burn :D</div></div><hr />
