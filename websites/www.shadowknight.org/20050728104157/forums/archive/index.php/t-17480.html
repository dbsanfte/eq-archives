<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Synapticus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">There should be an AA that makes our disease-based spells less resistable or irresistable, kind of like improved HT for spears, dots MC procs, and Zbite.  <br />
<br />
maybe <br />
<br />
12aa = makes all of an SK's disease-based spells irresistable.<br />
<br />
or <br />
<br />
3/3/3 = makes an SK's disease based spells land regardless or the NPC's resist, 25, 50, and 75% of the time (Kind of like Tactical mastery for our disease spells)<br />
<br />
I don't think this is overpowering because this will not really improve our maximum DPS, but might improve our overall DPS in disease immune NPC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ziglug D</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">That sounds cool, Our HT is disease-based right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Makkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">/disc unholy ht is dis base. i think undisc its magic.<br />
<br />
however i believe it's IHT that entirely removes the resist check. so even with 1 million disease resist the mob couldnt resist it..my sk doesnt have it so a /disc ht is totally resisted on a lot of disease resistant mobs<br />
<br />
and i agree. nothing sk get is overpowering enough to be resisted much imo, especially mc and crap. not like paladin heals are ever &quot;resisted&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sithanator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Nah they just need to give necro's an upgrade to there scent line to make it group useful. Other then arua of darkness, I believe that the only other disease resist debuff.<br />
Later<br />
Sith</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Synapticus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That sure helps out necros, but this is the SK forum =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jinsei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I would LOVE that. My spears and torrents get resisted far too often on PoP mobs. Hell, even when I'm in Kael my torrents and spears get resisted  half the time. It vexes me to no end, considering one of our strong points is to increase the ATK of the group. If this was an AA, I would purchase it in a milisec</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Morgrist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Aura of Darkness debuffs resists slightly- course,that's a whopping -10.<br />
 <br />
*shrugs* Such is life.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Synapticus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Aura of Darkness is not really intended to be a resist debuff, it is more of a group resist buff.  In addition, AoDarkness is disease based spell itself.</div></div><hr />
