<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kelefane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can he be done w/ a group or less?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sarrasis Darkmist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Easily.  His max hit is high but rarely ever hits for it.  He spends the last part of the fight chain casting.  Just get him slowed early and you will have no problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cryptia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Did him with 5. Warrior, Druid, Shammy, Rogue and me. We had him dead in less than a minute, which was good since we got some unexpected aggro from the tents when he was at 5% or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tyrs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Best way to pull him is to go into the tent where he is and target the 2 mobs that are at the far end of that tent he is in, then go outside the tent behind the fence and pull those mobs Fraga will not agro with them.<br />
<br />
Then you just train those mobs to zone, when person training has zoned you the SK can go into the tent target Fraga go behind the same fence and just agro him, he should come alon that way, just make sure to path him to your group without training into the mobs that were just trained to zone.<br />
<br />
Can btw be done with a SK,Cleric and Enchanter all pre elemental. Might be close calls from time to time but just Cod a pet with the chanter and have it beat on him, but its better to tank yourself pet dies to fast.<br />
That trio + ranger = one dead Wussadin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>ootoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">why is that the best way? you can cast on him and the other mobs dont assist</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kelefane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Can you kill Fraga and get his piece before you do the Tailoring combine? Will it hurt anything?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>runcade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You can kill fraga out of order but you cant turn in the piece till the tailoring is done</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kelefane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">*Whew* ok good...I just killed Fraga too...Was hoping I didnt do something wrong there =x and Yeah, I was just gonna keep the turn in piece until I get done w/ the Tailor combine...I havent even gotten my PoG/Fear pieces yet...Will soon however.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tyrs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">why is that the best way? you can cast on him and the other mobs dont assist<br />
<br />
Did you not read any of the other posts there but mine??<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Did him with 5. Warrior, Druid, Shammy, Rogue and me. We had him dead in less than a minute, which was good since we got some unexpected aggro from the tents when he was at 5% or so.<br />
<br />
Have seen others have this problem.<br />
<br />
That is why it is the best way.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Had a bard pull it to the zone in.  A mob or 2 assisted on the way out of the tents, which he faded off.  An SK could probably single  him out of hte tents as well... advantage of bard pulling is the bard had him slowed when we got him in camp.<br />
<br />
This mob really is a pushover, despite the high max hit, wailing sisters + the 4 SK's are probably tougher.... and I think we all know how gimp they are.<br />
<br />
Breeder, farming rare spawns in PoG, and Falmont are the most challenging parts of our epic.  Everything else is extremely easy.  And Falmont is even a pussy for a final boss- I know an SK on my server got him to 20% with 9 people, I believe mostly, if not all pre-elemental.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>ootoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Did you not read any of the other posts there but mine?? <br />
<br />
Yeah i read em, but my question was directed at you. I've done the fight at least 15 times, never gotten any agro from anything else. so if you get agro from any other mobs you just suck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tyrs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yeah i read em, but my question was directed at you. I've done the fight at least 15 times, never gotten any agro from anything else. so if you get agro from any other mobs you just suck<br />
<br />
<br />
And I believe i answered your question in the same post you are quoting from,and if you actually read it instead of just looking over the text and saying you read it, then you will notice I never said that I had the problem of having unexpected agro at around 5%, so read over it again man.<br />
<br />
Hence it is the best way to pull like that to avoid this unexpected agro that &quot;MIGHT&quot; happen. And if you have a hard time accepting that then thats your problem not mine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Cryptia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">..so if you get agro from any other mobs you just suck..<br />
<br />
Shit happens, Mr. Perfect.<br />
<br />
It's just PoV, who cares if a few adds come at ya, at least makes it kinda exciting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Anyone know respawn time on him?<br />
<br />
-Bolas</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Bumluk Rayrspaun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Fought him at his spawn point (until he was pushed outside of the tent, at least) yesterday, and nothing added.  Not sure what you are doing to get aggro from other mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Cryptia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">We couldn't figure it out either, there was a group exp'ing off the other tent mobs so we thought that they may have pulled a few too many and then they added onto us. We weren't really sure so didn't want to point any fingers.<br />
<br />
Since then, other SK friends of mine have done Fraga with zero adds as well. Was just one of those days I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I have pulled him for 3 attempts, nothing has ever added or assisted.<br />
<br />
Just go inside, target him, go back outside and cast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Cryptia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">That's exactly what I did.<br />
<br />
Which is why we figured it was from the other group exp'ing there.</div></div><hr />
