<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Darcloakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just got the lvl 64 pet and i just started soloing in HoHa with him.  It seems like when i use Aug of Death he gets aggro and dies.  After i split using FD i cast Festering then Blood of Hate, then i send in the pet.  When i dont use Aug of Death he doesnt get aggro but it takes abit longer to  kill the mob. Am I sending the pet in too early? Is it because of Aug of Death spell? Or am I just a retard? Any help will be great and if your gona flame please make it a funny one we can all laugh at :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Just keep up CD and cast that when you get far enough away and don't have a DoT to recast. That should keep you agro. Also, make sure that /pet taunt is off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Use more dots.  If you're only using 2 dots, one of them shouldn't be BoH - it's not nearly as effecient as others, especially the fire line.  If you're keeping up asystole/BoH/ignite blood/boil blood/festering you won't have any aggro trouble.  If you have mana trouble, drop BoH.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Turn pet taunt OFF.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Darcloakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thank you guys so much for your replies.  Pet taunt was off, guess my problem was the lack of dots because mana is an issue.  I will drop BoH and go with the rest Slein recommended   Thank You guys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Cerbra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm surprised that festering and BOH is not enough to hold aggro from a lvl 49 necro pet, I have a 65 necro main and one tip I  would say if mana is tight is  dont send pet right away , let them run a few ticks and then send the pet in.<br />
 If your feeling spendy with mana hit mob with asystole next as Slein said but dont cast any fire dots to hold aggro as they dont actually do much for aggro, poison and disease are your aggro grabbers for kiting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">BoH is crap for aggro.. you can cast that spell all day long and old Jabober will get aggro and die.. <br />
<br />
I just use Festering, Asystole, Ignite Blood (BoH in PoFire) and Fear when kiting..<br />
<br />
Keep hitting the mob with fear after every cycle of dots and you will hold aggro just fine. Also you might try not sending in your pet until after the mob is below 95% and you have landed all your dots and 2 fears to give you a large head start on aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dkhar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You're just light on the CD's. I kite golems in PoV at the EW camp with my pet. I just use Festering to pull, hit with a CD on incoming then send in pet. Every full circle I do, I hit the mob with another CD. I also have my wifes chanter there most of the time and she chain nukes the hell out of the mobs and I have no problem holding agro from her either (she also DC's the chainmail guy at zone in for more DPS) with simply using CD. Oh yea, I VoT myself, that would be important eh. I usually throw 2 spears because I know I regen that much mana during the fight and the golems turn at 17% and I melee them with MC on to get some mana back. I like spears cause I have SCF3 and critical nukes are just cooler than dots :P When my discs are up I can burn a golem down with melee,  lifeleech and HT. That's fun too. <br />
<br />
Just as a sidenote, if you can grab a chanter this camp frickin rocks duo. I guess a shaman too but he don't have VoQ so screw those little bear hugging hippies. Show me the mana baby and we're good to go. Just make sure the chanter DC's that skeleton dude at the zone in, there are 2, one west and one east. The only thing you need to do is baby the pet over the river and through the castle so you don't hit traps and end up wasting DC running to zone (this happened :P).  They hit for max 147 I think and are not bad dps coupled with our pet and chanter nukes. We can run 9 golems before the front respawns at 4% AA each. Not a bad deal :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If you're going to duo with a caster, let the caster keep aggro so you can melee.  <br />
<br />
If you have the choice between a shammy and a chanter, take the shammy so you don't have to kite. (unless you can keep yourself up on slowed mobs...)<br />
<br />
If you're going to duo with a chanter and kite, let the chanter charm a real pet instead of DC crap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dkhar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">No way. Tried it buncha different ways here. Chanter holding agro with a pet is too mana heavy on her and dangerous when charm breaks and she gets stunned or somethng. There's not a lot of space at this camp. There ain't no clerics for miles... I am not taking chances. Safe, easy and relatively the same amount of kills per hour doing it with me kiting it and her chain nuking and using a DC pet. In fact, I think it's faster due to charm breaks and chanter needing to med every once in a while from holding agro and recharming. Not to mention the fluke chanter death when charm breaks and she gets stunned from behind and both mobs melee her to death in 2 rounds. Overall it's about the same though. It might seem like you kill them faster when you have the regular pet up but when you take into account all the downtime it evens out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ninaelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">what I do for kiting is typically I pull with festering (I kite in fire so no need to split) and then I hit the mob 3 or 4 times with clinging right off the bat to pull a load of agro. Then I send in the pet with taunt off and recast festering then asystole then BoH. By the time BoH wears off it's time to resnare so if you get resisted a few times you don't have to deal with an unsnared mob which = death or FD/lose the kite alot of the time. If I'm running low on mana I'll drop BoH and just keep snares up and count the ticks to tell when to resnare, bout 11 ticks I'll start to resnare. I never lose agro doing it this way and using clinging you aren't giving up alot of mana. Hope that helps. As far as a kiting partner I like a good ranger for fire, while a ranger won't deal the dps of a rogue or some of the other options I like a partner who is able to snare, this helps out alot when I get a snare resist on pull which normally I would have to either run like hell and try to snare quickly while taking hits and then try to tap my way back up or FD and lose a buffed pet and then have to recast pet and rebuff either way losing time I could be using for killing. the dmg/xp tradeoff is decent with a ranger I drop from 3 and a half blue ticks about solo to a half gold per kill with a ranger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Maicom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">she can kite the mobs if she has a clue as to what she's doing...<br />
<br />
try using howl of tashan to hold agro, she can run around and nuke still, you melee from behind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Excessium</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Use dots as normal, get some SoW, and run your ass off a distance, sit and med while pet beats on mob from behind. Sitting helps with aggro as well. When I only had a few dots I could use, I sat alot during a kite. Also with limited FT, it will help down time. You may be able to kite mob after mob. When I was in my 60's, I would Aggro-kite those little worms in PoV by dotting them, running to one side of a hill, sit, mob gets close stand up and run to other side. I was only getting 2% exp per kill but it was something to do while LFG.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Neric Ikolis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I use in this order Festering, blood of hate, boil blood, asystole.  You'll find that you can get about 3 blood of hates to one festering.  As suggested too sitting to med while it chases you helps on agro and of course mana regen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Klaaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Since two-box a chanter quite a bit, I often head to Tactics and charm Giwin in the GY.  I then aggro kite the Diakus around keeping aggro with Festering, Fear, and Blood of Hate.  I also throw in a Spear or two if mana is going my way, and DOT and nuke hte hell outa it with the Chanter.<br />
<br />
One issue when using a DC pet is that you need to be very aware of the amount of damage you and the Chanter are doing to the mob versus the amoujnt the pet does.  Due to the power of DC pets, they have special Exp rules.  If the pet does more than 50% of the damage it take 75% of the Exp.  It can be frustrating to have just finished kiting a Diaku in Tactics, and only get a 1% bump.  Make sure you outdamage the pet.  Under 50%, the pet takes much less than half the Exp, so it is worth it if there are plenty of mobs to kill.  Just watch the damage ratio.<br />
<br />
Lastly, if you guys get the chance, I have also had the chance to charm kill with an enchanter recently, and if you and the Enchanter know what you are doing, the exp is insane, and it is actually very safe.  The best strategy I have found is to make it a three person group: SK, Shammy, Enchanter.  We group up in Tactics or HoH, thoguh Tactics seems to be better because you simply don't run out of mobs.<br />
<br />
Enchanter Charms and Hastes a pet - Gladiator or Zek Initiate in Tactics. Enchanter needs to keep distance from fight.<br />
<br />
SK Tanks - Step in and generat enough hate from target that it will stay on you if charm breaks.  One Snare should do it.  After snare, target Chanter's pet.  You will need to snare it if charm breaks.<br />
<br />
Chanter Slows Target mobs and heals SK.  I usually two-box the shammy, so I keep her role pretty basic.<br />
<br />
Using this process, you can mow through mobs faster than whole groups can, and the Exp is insanely nice.  If you know a good enchanter to group up with, this should work nicely for a nonstandard group<br />
<br />
Sorry for getting off topic there.  Slightly more on topic as mentioned above, as long as I am fighting mobs over 55 I like to use fear to keep em off my pet.  And if you are fighting mobs under 55, fear kite 'em! =-)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">actaully, go to tribute master and get burning affliction 4.<br />
<br />
I was having this problem with pet getting aggro once in a while if I cast augmentation of death on him. I got burning affliction 4 and the boost to my dot was just enough to keep the mob looking at me.<br />
<br />
Also, if you are in HoH kiting, use darkness / ignite blood and BoH as mana permits. Astyole is resisted way too much in that zone.<br />
<br />
However, astyole works great if you are aggro kiting in the sandbox in hall of tactics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">What i would sometimes do is kite with my wizard wife. But i was much better at holding agro and kiting so what should we do is sit on her drog, and nuke and i would kite it around her Just chaining SoS and using manarobe+epic. <br />
<br />
Now that i box my cleric though i just prefer to tank unslowed and trio with her.<br />
<br />
Anyways my setup at the time was either kei + ft1 from solstice earring or lich ( i always get name wrong so not risking slein yelling at me about it :P).<br />
<br />
And so mana was an issue especially if i was alone and bored what i would do is haste pet via 64 haste (the extra duration really really helps) and then just pull with festering drop ignite then send pet in and start chaining cd for agro. I found fear abit too expensive mana wise. This way i could chain pull, think it took 2 cast of snare+ignite per mob but was along time ago. Anyways if your ever having trouble holding agro tanking or anything just use cd+fear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Atlis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Two places I kited extensively before hitting elemental planes - The Deep and Tactics.  In both places, I have a DoT which I use for a timer on my snare - depending on my luck with resists, I choose the two minute Ignite Blood or the one minute Asystol.  Using the two minute Festering Darkness, I can predict when to resnare a mob and when I have time for other activities.<br />
In The Deep, I tend to lose aggro to Goner if I am in a lazy mood and don't use more than 3 DoT's.  So, I use Clinging Darkness and spam it half a dozen times before sending in the pet.  If I'm not lazy, I might use one or two CD's, but I'll stack Festering (or Cascading) with Asystol, Blood of Hate, and Ignite Blood.<br />
In Tactics, holding aggro was simple.  Pull with Festering Darkness or Aura of Darkness.  Use Asystol or Aura of Darkness for my timer since the mobs resist snares a tiny bit more than in The Deep.  Send Xarn to fight as soon as I get my timer DoT and my snare landed.  Because of my terribly low mana pool and lack of Flowing Thought, I had to run a 6-Mississippi count and sit down before each tick so I could maximize mana regeneration.  I was sitting so often that I maintained perpetual aggro on the mobs even if Xarn generated more hate than me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not real good advice, duoed with and enc for about three years, the risk is not worth the results,  the chanter is among the best geared on the server, and has been playing since release.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Envoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">i just start off with a snare, start laying my DoTs down, and then send pet in..<br />
<br />
while im kiting, i chain cast clinging darkness, becuase it casts fast, has good aggro, and is very mana effecient.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Skoggel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I used to do a ton of aggro kiting in valor due to advantages of being able to afk while medding (useful for being productive IRL while being productive in EQ.)<br />
<br />
I'd end up setting up camp either in NE corner, or along the REAL west wall.. not the camp, but the west zone wall up there. Pull with Festering, land BoH, send in pet, land Ignite Blood. If I'd keep up all 3 dots every tick, pet wouldn't get aggro. I had no burning affliction then, though I'm not too sure that increases aggro any (wizards seem to agree crits don't add any aggro, though foci are a different thing in game mechanics altogether so don't have to follow the same rules.) If for whatever reason I'd not reapply BoH, bones getting aggro was likely. I also found it very easy to keep track of when to resnare this way, by keeping track of the BoH's.<br />
<br />
I never liked using Asystole for aggro kiting due to the resist rate myself. Sticking to Festering/BoH/Ignite is very user friendly as far as not getting pissed off at a string of resists goes. This is one of the reasons I don't like pet kiting in Fire, since I basically have to load it up. Still, if I'm soloing it's because I want a degree of freedom from EQ, so a little extra downtime isn't a bad thing in those situations.<br />
<br />
Trying to remember my spell line-up.. was built for maximum laziness and ease. I never had to keep clinging memmed so I could have extra slots. Bond of Death (for keeping hp up more than damage, although I might use it simply to kill stuff quicker in elems, I don't do much kiting there and I switch back and forth depending on mood), pact of hate, blood of hate, ignite blood, pet haste, standard harmshield in almost all my lineups, standard death peace in all of my lineups, then festering. It worked quite well, and is more or less the same lineup I still use even in various EP zones. I keep trying to work Asystole back in until I get pissed at it again, but otherwise.. :p</div></div><hr />
