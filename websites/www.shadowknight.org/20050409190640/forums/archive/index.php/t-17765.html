<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>langebananer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Heya guys!<br />
<br />
Reason I'm posting this is that i just recently started a young shadowknight, and I want to make the right decisions from the beginning - rather then getting all the way up there just to realise that my char is based on all the wrong things.<br />
<br />
I've asked friends what to go for, but everyone seems to give me different answers so I lay it to you... Which weaponskills ought I work on? Some say all, but in which order ought I prioritise?<br />
<br />
Till now (jsut level 19 mind you) I've maxed out  2HS and 1HS. Some say I shouldn't care about 1H weapons period, but I'm thinking that at higher levels when tanking harder mobs; the added AC and stats given by a shield will be worth the DPS cost of using a one hander.<br />
<br />
I've played pure casters up until now, and know absolutely nothing about melee skills and gear and such. Tips would be greatly appeciated :-)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Keep all weaponskills up.<br />
<br />
No particular order for now, just when you max one for your level, move on to another.  At around 40, your skills have a pause built in.  The cap won't go up with level again until 50, so you'll have plenty of time to work them all up to max then, so long as you've not neglected them.  Don't worry about a &quot;primary skill&quot; until you get to the point where it will do you some good.  In higher levels, you will want to make more extensive use of 2 handed weapons than 1 handed, but everything is situational, so keep plugging away at whatever is lowest and you'll do fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Use your best weapon.  If you get a new best weapon that uses a different skill, use it and it will max fast.  If you have zero skill, drop 30+ points in at the trainer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>wwxc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'd disagree with Catharsis. While you're young its much easier to keep the skills up each level. Bring out your best weapon when it gets hairy, but I'd really recommend not trying to take a skill up from 0 once you're in your 40's. Nothing pisses me off more than being in an xp group and having some gimp melee not doing any damage  because &quot;I'm working on a weapon skill.&quot; Its disrespectful and really slows the xp down. That being said, if you do have to bring a skill up, get a dex buff from the chanter in your group, makes it a lot easier.<br />
<br />
BTW, does the cap lift at 50? Because I'm halfway through and I don't think I've seen a skill up yet.</div></div><hr />

You will slow down any group's XP by not using your best weapon, including when you want to &quot;keep the skills up each level.&quot;  Your comment contradicts itself.<br />

It goes up at 51.<br />
<br />
To answer the original poster I would recommend this:  Keep your 2h skills maxed as a priority at lower levels, you will find that the lower delay 1h weapon skills will raise much faster when the time comes to train them than your 2h weapon skills.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately I didn't follow my own advice and so my skills at 42 are:<br />
<br />
1hs = 200<br />
2hs = 200<br />
1hb = 200<br />
2hb = 43 :( <br />
Pierce = 190<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kahrn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I used a 1hs from 1-50 Massive dragon claw shard<br />
<br />
50-54 I used Two-tined corpse picthfork (2hp)<br />
<br />
55-65 I used Black Bastard Sword (2hs)<br />
<br />
Now I used Greatstaff of the Fourwinds (2hb)<br />
<br />
I never trained points into any of these skills and I never worked on them.<br />
<br />
Sure I missed alot when I first got them but the skill up's went fast and I never lost aggro. I never regretted not working them up either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>wwxc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm assuming a healthy dose of soloing there, esp up to 50. And I'd think that using a weapon that is slightly worse than your best one and 3 skill points behind is a hell of a lot better swinging something at 35 skill points and missing 9 out of 10 times.<br />
<br />
So unless you want to get anal, I'm not really contradicting myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ramgar SK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Keep your 2hs max.  I've found this the most common type in my career, and the best dropable 2h weapon is a 2hs (WMBS).<br />
<br />
1h anything is not near as good IMO.  My DPS severly suffers when doing the shield thing.  Yes, I get an AC boost, but it really doesn't seem to help because the mob beats on me longer in solo situations.  When tanking for a group it does help some, but I am in the mindset of good DSP makes a good defense.<br />
<br />
I've found everything else is optional, and depends on the best weapon you have at the time.  levels 1-9 or so I had a fs long sword that kicked ass!  (lol)  Then I got a shiny brass halberd and it rocked!  In my 40's I was mad because I got a great deal on a frost giant femur and 2hb was 0.  It didn't take long, even with troll dex, to get 2hb to 200.  20 to 100 was hard because I didn't hit often enough and it wasn't really fast.  But that was maybe a couple days in DL (3-4 hours).<br />
<br />
For those that say keep them all maxed, that's fine and well if you have the plat and patience to get all the types of weapons and switch them all in and out  (yawn).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Darkenesis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Worked mine up as I went along through the levels.<br />
<br />
1h weapons usually a lot better at lower levels due to the low delay.  Damage bonuses on 2hers don't get cool until you hit 51.<br />
<br />
Ebon Mace/Mace of the Shadowed Soul are both good 1hb items that used to last many well into their 50s.  Noct Blade is another 'good' (for its time) 1hs that also lasted many into their 50s.  Argent Defender is a good 2h.  Any of the Velium spears are nice for piercing.  And a Granite Face Grinder is a decent 2hb.  (of course, all for your level)<br />
<br />
PoP has many droppable items that compare to, and sometimes outshine NToV weapons.  All of these (except the lances) are Kunark, so should have no problem finding a good deal on one of these.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>tanadil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">My own opinion is as above, keep all skills maxed if you can.<br />
<br />
However in reality I only ever use 2hs and occasionally 1hs when tanking against casters where the bash interupts and extra ac is useful.<br />
<br />
Besides as a dark elf I figured i ought to use a sword as apose to a bloody great club!<br />
<br />
I will leave the clubbing to our troll/ ogre counterparts.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>lorddaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">get good weapons to do the training with. like the following suggestion<br />
<br />
Piercing - TTCP...damn thing is a sewing needle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tumy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Up until 51 I highly suggest getting a Shard of Night for peircing.  I got more use out of that weapon alone than any other weapon in my carrer so far.  Once you hit 51 the TTCP will outdamage the Shard, but not by much.  I used the shard till 56th level because I liked the extra AC from a sheild.<br />
<br />
The way I kept my skills up was fear kiteing.  I found the fastest weapon I could get my hands on and found a &quot;easy&quot; high blue mob and fear kited.  Ex: for 2hb I used a Shovel dam4 delay20.  My 2hb flew up in one day.  For 2hs I used a weapon that I cant remember the name of but it was dam17 delay27.<br />
<br />
Just find the lowest delay weapon and spend a hour fear kiting ... oh wait.  This may not work as well as it did for me because of the restriction on KEI now.  Hmmm<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I would suggest against spending your skill points each level on keeping weapons skills up.  From what I've seen, especially on 1 hander weapons, skills will go up very fast on their own with some dex buffs and a bard twisting dex and haste songs.  Keep your points for bumping up the slower skills (2 hander skills go up slower because of the delay, as skillups are determined by swing), and skills that you don't have the opportunity to practice easily on your own.<br />
<br />
At 57, I just let my level skill increases ride until I see a glaring need to bump one up by a few points.  Pretty much every thing else will go up with practice.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>BrikBludgaard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Keep all of your weaponskills maxed.<br />
<br />
It is a LOT easier to throw a secondary weapon in there if you are only 5 points behind.<br />
<br />
Being level 40+ and having a 0 in a weaponskill is quite annoying and should be avoided if at all possible.<br />
<br />
DING!<br />
use 2HS until maxed<br />
use 2HB until maxed<br />
use 1HB until maxed<br />
use 1HS until maxed<br />
use Pierce until maxed<br />
<br />
do that every level, and you will not have to slow down anyone for long.<br />
<br />
If you get behind, find a group that wouldnt mind you practiciing your skills as the seventh member of a group. (not getting XP)  likely the group will invite you soon enough, and they will be all too happy for every point of damage you do.  You should NEVER be able to outdamage them... and they get XP faster than normal...  Everyone wins.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Trugg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Ok, I know this option isn't available to everyone, but it's worked for me.<br />
<br />
My alt is a level 46 Ogre SK who, despite all the advice, only ever used a 2hs or 1hs.  All other skills were 0!<br />
<br />
My main is a 65 Mage on a separate account and he has the AA ability Pet Discipline.  I take both chars to Shar Vahl zone in (both indif and no wondering guards etc) and sit mage in the corner.  You need to sit in the corner so the pet gets wedged in there.<br />
<br />
Hit duel, mage activates pet hold and SK starts beating on the pet.  The level 65 Earth pet is so big and dumb with reasonable regen that he rarely drops below 98% health throughout the beatings.<br />
<br />
Did this a couple of nights before going to bed and Trugg now has about 190 in all wep skills (those last 10 won't budge /boggle).<br />
<br />
Could use a Beastlord too I guess.</div></div><hr />
