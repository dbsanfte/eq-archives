<br />
Pets will zone with their masters.<br />
<br />
Mana will display a numeric value.<br />
<br />
Buffs will show a countdown timer when moused over.<br />
<br />
The new Veeshan's Peak! <br />
<br />
And many other exciting changes.  Stay tuned.<br />
<br />
Brenlo the Updated<br />
	<br />
<br />
<br />
Not sure if this happened anywhere's else, but Hate was down last night for BB...maybe patching it too to improve lag? Cannot believe mana is going to be displayed and buffs have a countdown timer! IMO, despite class issues being ignored, I give it an 8.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Krushum Gudended</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">sigh, why did I buy inspect buffs then?<br />
<br />
mana being displayed is own, tho<br />
<br />
augs, pets, as well</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I know casters who got inspect buffs so they can see other members buffs and not just their own.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nope, I can't remember where I saw it, but there's a small raid encounter that pops a projection.  If you have the original key you get the new key and a reward for the old key.  If you don't have the old key, you get a container that requires 3 or 4 pieces from various zones.  I think they were like chardok, howling stones, can't remember the other ones.</div></div><hr />

They didn't admit anything.  They just moved it back a week and the official patch news will also state that Vietnam was a tie.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Synapticus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">sounds promising.  Tweaks that don't really affect class balance, i guess no one can complain this time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Derraj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">plenty can complain, like PvPers who use the tactic to zone and hopefully the person they attack (lets say, a mage) will zone without pet then bam, lay the smackdown on the mage.</div></div><hr />

I have 4 40hp augs from ele armor i'd love to swap over to GoD stuff.. im sure im not the only person either</div></div><hr />

What I hear is that they've changed the purchased aug return so that you get back half value.  I'm happy with that personally.  Will be nice to get some points back for the old type 7's.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Interesting information for you to read that I got from my friend in my guild forum. My guild is mostly UK-based and has lack of raids for USA players so VP seems is a good one for us. :D<br />
<br />
For those who completed the key, there will be one mob to kill who drops 40 books. Turning in that book will key you for VP. If you don't have the old key, then you will need to collect 3 items (I think that's right) turn that in then turn in the book.<br />
<br />
Now what I just found out about VP is that it's going to be using faction. If you are on Ring of Scale faction, you will be limited to quests, but lots of them. The quests will result in similar rewards to the dropped items. <br />
<br />
Most of the quests can be completed with 1-3 groups. This may be a great opportunity for the US evening players to do things together. <br />
<br />
The other faction is Mayong Mistmoore. You will not be able to do any quests, just straight killing. Expect the new VP to be elemental level with corresponding drops.</div></div><hr />

<br />
oh shut up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Heh, I click my circlet probably a thousand times on any given raid day.  The day we get suspended minion is the day I consider using a pet on raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Krushum Gudended</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Becomes different now that pet pulling is an option again while raiding, but I agree, suspend minion would own.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">We pet pull one part of one raid currently.  Even then it takes 4 of us to insure that one pet (with buffs and shrew) makes it back with the mob with how hard they hit and/or all the roots and snares they cast.  No way I'd pet pull regularly on a raid.  Moreso since we have no troubles at all pulling traditionally at ideal rates with minimal death.  <br />
<br />
Not meaning to be facetious, but do people actually pet pull GoD raids full time?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Heh, I click my circlet probably a thousand times on any given raid day.  The day we get suspended minion is the day I consider using a pet on raids.<br />
<br />
It's one thing to use your pet situationally (I.E. reasonable/normal), it's another to never use it at all.  Not using all the tools available to you is just needlessly gimping yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I have pet up about 70-80% of the time I raid, unless I know I will have to invis or there is a particulary nasty AE in a coming fight. <br />
<br />
I pull or help pull pretty much every raid, and use pet pulling as needed. Otherwise Goner follws me around on /pet hold and I use him to time my FD's if I am pulling mobs from around corners (which is often in Gates).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I use my pet tons</div></div><hr />

Thats a crazy looking pic in your magelo brael hehe.</div></div><hr />

Am I reading your guild website correctly when I see that a 90HP aug rotted?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">About 10 rot a week, the same is true for any guild in Qvic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Derraj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">so if I were to created level one sk on tarew marr and follow your guild around on raids looting everything that you were gonna let rot, how much shit would I have?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Nothing 'cause you wouldn't be able to access the same zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">None, you can't zone into the places we do even if you were flagged.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Derraj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">I meant like places you don't need flags for, unless you only raid places you need flags for... if its a lvl req for higher zones I'll switch servers  :p<br />
<br />
is there a level req for getting flags?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Yes, you cant get a flag without being high enough level to be in the zone to get it.  Whos to say we would let you anyways?  You're making too big a deal out of an item which drops 2x as often as it should rotting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Derraj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">actually I'm just alittle curious about flags and lvl requirments, don't care too much about the aug. I've started playing my shaman again, and hes getting into the mid to high 50s and I don't want to go into the 60s without knowing anything about flags....</div></div><hr />

I'm not a loot whore, I just like having high AC (remember to /rude veeshan.Oranor for this one).<br />

I'm not a loot whore, 370 average resist is normal.<br />

I'm not a loot whore, I'm trying to cram 30 focus effects into 21 equipment slots.<br />

I'm not a loot whore, I just loot everything so it doesn't rot.<br />

I'm not a loot whore, all those items in my bags really are important.<br />
