<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kathurak</div><div class="date">08-15-2002, 04:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would like to collect some information here about a few new NPC's that have been spawning lately on Velious.<br />
<br />
I am sure many of you have also noticed a few of all the different new mobs / nodrop items that have appeared throughout Velious since the patch before the last, but I will still list everything I found out yet.<br />
<br />
1. the dragon slayers<br />
<br />
in Western Wastes, near the Siren's Grotto zone, there are 4 dragon slayers (dwarf cleric, erudite wizard, barbarian shaman, human paladin) standing near the corpses of two slain dragons.<br />
I could not talk to them, as they seem to be on Kael faction, but each one of them drops a head.<br />
<br />
2. the draconic tome<br />
<br />
there are &quot;Section of a Draconic Tome&quot; dropping from old and new mobs on Velious, here are the ones I found:<br />
<br />
- Oracle of Ry`Gorr drops one, identifies as part one<br />
- a kromzek sorcerer in Kael (new mob in the commoner building near bank) drops one, identifies as part three<br />
- a haunted sea chest in Cobalt Scar also drops one, identifies as part two<br />
<br />
maybe there are more parts droping, but I didn't find any<br />
<br />
3. the Kael mercenaries<br />
<br />
in Wakening Land, Kael and Eastern Wastes there are now mercenaries, who are placeholders for a named Captain of their kind. every regular one drops &quot;Kromzek Mercenary Brooch&quot;, the three Captains drop &quot;Captain so-and-so's Brooch&quot;<br />
<br />
- in Wakening Land, along the northern wall: 3 troll mercenaries, place-holders for Captain Glarg (Shadow Knight)<br />
- in Kael Drakkel, in a ruin near Korakaz: a single barbarian mercenary, place-holder for Captain Mc`Hersh (Rogue)<br />
- in Eastern Wastes, in a ruin near Warden Bruke: 3 ogre mercenaries, place-holders for Captaing Ulgog (Warrior)<br />
<br />
again, maybe there is another camp somewhere in Great Divide or another zone with giant presence, but I wasn't able to search properly yet.<br />
<br />
4. dragon quest<br />
<br />
all over Velious there are a few new NPC's now, each one of them droping a nodrop item with the name &quot;Dragon&quot; in it, so I thought I would all list them together:<br />
<br />
- a shadow guard necromancer, near Vhal Sera in Tower of Frozen Shadow, drops &quot;Dragon Scripture Tablet&quot;<br />
- an icepaw sorcerer, new kobold in the pit in Velketor's Labyrinth, where you drop down to go to lower dogs camp, drops &quot;Crystal Dragon Eye&quot;<br />
- a siren sorceress somewhere in Siren's Grotto, drops &quot;Platinum Dragon Scale&quot; (information from the Safehouse, couldn't confirm it yet)<br />
- a chetari runemage in Dragon Necropolis, supposed to drop &quot;Golden Dragon Claw&quot;, but I was never able to get deep enough to find him (again, from Safehouse)<br />
<br />
So, this is it.. all the information I was able to collect over the past few weeks.<br />
Now I am curious if anyone else here has been into finding out what these items are for, because I wasn't able to.<br />
If you have any new information on this, or maybe even a quest to use these items in, please share it here :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kathurak</div><div class="date">08-15-2002, 09:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, most of it is soloable.<br />
The mercenaries are all green to me at lvl 59, the Captains light-blue.<br />
The pieces of the Draconic Tome were easy, too. Oracle / sorcerer / sea chest all soloable.<br />
Dragon quest items I didn't solo, always brought a group as they are in dungeons, as you said.<br />
I couldn't solo the dragon slayers either, as they seemed to be highly resistant to fear, so I went their again with a lvl 60 Shaman and then we could kill them all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I found this guy 2 weeks ago. He's in the huge area with the water falling from the ceiling,and the ladders around the room. If you go left isntead of going right towards zlandicars lair he's in that room. Assuming he isn't a random pop anyway ;)</div></div><hr />

Btw, thanks for making Ancient spells only on one mob in the game that my guild finished farming 7 months ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Naelael Sang'Noir</div><div class="date">08-21-2002, 11:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cool. New quests. Never get enough of those if they arent crazy impossible. <br />
<br />
As for the ancient spell comment.. please.. just stop now. Their drop rate is perfect for what they are.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NaranekTZ</div><div class="date">10-04-2002, 02:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a word to say that these quests are now live...but I think only on legends so far. Skyshrine recently got a revamp with new mobs and quest givers...dunno if it went live on the rest.<br />
<br />
Anyway here goes on the quests i've completed so far (think i'm first person to complete a couple of them but wont swear to it)<br />
<br />
<br />
All quests i've done come from a barbarian npc not far from the ent by the name of Torm Wenrar.<br />
<br />
First quest is to find the kromzek mercenaries (trolls inf WL, Barbarians in kael and ogres in EW) and keeeeel them. Take the brooches/talismans from them and hand 3 back to him.  Reward is a 5 dose potion of draconic rage usable by all melee....bar monks for some reason. Potion grants a 65pt DD proc buff wich won't stack with SoD. Useless for us but can see it being usefull for rogues and warrs.<br />
<br />
Second quest is to kill the captains, the merenaries above are the PH for them and you need one from each of the 3 zones. captains are reasonably rare spawn light blue to 60. Take each captains brooche and hand all three to torm. Result is a plate wearer only belt 8ac 4str 4sta 20hp 6fc cr (from memory but close).<br />
<br />
<br />
Final quest is to kill the undaunted mercenaries...which is the 4 dragon slayers in WW...and hand in there heads to Torm. Tried to solo but they are tough with high ac and some decent amount of HP. Got him down to 60% that way...couldnt get a fear off. With a cleric these guys were pretty easy though they took a little time.<br />
Handed heads in and got the following...Draconic Pauldrons 15ac 12str 12sta 6cr 6fr all plate classes (and i think maybe rougue)<br />
<br />
To innitiate the quests you must be ally for the quest givers to talk to you, though if you speak to them then lose ally you can still do the quests.<br />
<br />
The captains one may be broken slightly in that you may be able to hand in just 2 captains brooches and one normal one (cos i think I may have done this while doing the quest and still got reward)<br />
<br />
Faction hits are neg zek and riff, positive CoV and Yeli. All quest rewards are no drop.<br />
<br />
<br />
There are also a few more quest givers which the drops mentioned at the start are for but i havnt done them yet. There are also some new Crusaders up near Yeli that give quests but I couldnt get passed the first talk to get the quests from them...pretty sure they are related to ST in some way though as these are dragons meant to fight Kefarym.<br />
<br />
Skyshrine armour quest mobs have moved are are now through the door on your left when you first exit the maze</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zanix The Unholy</div><div class="date">10-04-2002, 11:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">pretty sure this was &quot;tested&quot; on legends even while i was there. most of it is quests to make ST keys &quot;easier&quot; to get. I think a new zone is also involved. I believe my former guild's front page has some pics and loot from that new zone or quest maybe, not too sure <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rozzor</div><div class="date">10-05-2002, 04:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;2. the draconic tome<br />
<br />
there are &quot;Section of a Draconic Tome&quot; dropping from old and new mobs on Velious, here are the ones I found:<br />
<br />
- Oracle of Ry`Gorr drops one, identifies as part one<br />
- a kromzek sorcerer in Kael (new mob in the commoner building near bank) drops one, identifies as part three<br />
- a haunted sea chest in Cobalt Scar also drops one, identifies as part two&quot;<br />
<br />
 This is a Quest for Mages as it seems. The Questgiver is an Erudite Mage and result will be a Tome.<br />
He ask for 4 Pieces so better find the 4th :-)<br />
i have no clue though where it can drop.<br />
<br />
<br />
New Quest will also be for Bards. They can gather Materials on Veliouscontinent(Tradeskills needed for combine). Result: Horn, Lute and another instrument, i forgot right now :-)<br />
<br />
<br />
I have a Dragon scripture tablet too but didn't found any Mob in Skyshrine that is talking about it...<br />
<br />
I think i will LOG the dialogue with the crusaders and maybe you have an idea what to say to them..i am stuck at every of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gothmohg</div><div class="date">10-05-2002, 09:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Was waiting for that bastard Rodrick to spawn for my 6th ring and got bored so I decided to kill the Ry'gorr fort denizens.  Oracle dropped &quot;a scripture of dragon tablet&quot; NO DROP looks like a scroll.<br />
<br />
Kept it as I love to quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NaranekTZ</div><div class="date">10-06-2002, 05:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's part of the draconic tome quest, see above for the three parts found so far. Need ally to start the quest but you can complete it if you drop down, my guess is the 4th part is in either wl or IC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KrehnLForr</div><div class="date">10-15-2002, 02:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">4th part of draconic tome found in GD, off Gralk Dwarfkiller in the fort.</div></div><hr />
