<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Noctix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been thinking about the problem that SKs don't have any way to mitigate burst damage like most other tank classes do.  While giving us a &quot;mini-defensive&quot; and/or a set of parry/riposte/etc discs would fix this, that doesn't really seem to be a very good fit in a role-playing sense.<br />
<br />
I have been trying to think of a good way to mitigate burst damage that would fit with the SK class.  Here are two ideas I've had.  They're similar ideas and could probably use some tweaking but I thought I'd throw them out there for discussion.<br />
<br />
First, my idea in spell form:<br />
<br />
Spell: Breath of Death <br />
Level 66<br />
Mana 1000<br />
Duration 20 min<br />
Cast 10.0<br />
Recast 10.0<br />
Description: This is a self only buff.  When the SK reaches zero hit points, this spell automatically complete heals them, then the buff disappears.<br />
<br />
Second, here is a similar AA idea:<br />
<br />
AA: Afterlife<br />
3 Tiers, 4, 8, 12 points<br />
Levels 66, 68, 70<br />
Type: Automatic<br />
Duration: 2, 4, 6 seconds<br />
Description: Upon death, the SK can fight in invulnerable specter form for a brief period of time.  If a heal lands during this time, it brings the SK back to life.  If no heal lands, the SK dies as normal at the end of the effect.<br />
<br />
The idea of both of these is that it would give SKs a way to mitigate burst damage by giving a &quot;second chance&quot;.  I like this as an alternative to a mini-defensive because it is more class defining and gives a sense of the Shadowknight relationship with death and the undead.<br />
<br />
As I said before, the numbers could probably be tweaked.  I wanted to get the idea out for discussion though, so feel free to debate, tinker, and flame.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The afterlife aa I see plenty of abuse for.  Ong group of sk's one group of clerics.  Let the SK's die become invulnerable, start CH chain bring them all back.  Sk's then tank as normal, with normal Cheal rotation.  That way you get one free death, the extra ago from being low health, the invulnerability and a chance to basically come in fresh to a battle when you've already done significant damage on a MOB.<br />
<br />
Would HT refresh upon the first death?  If so lots of potential for abuse.  Pop HT before first death to get extra dps, Pop HT with AA's after.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>BrikBludgaard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Easily fixed...<br />
<br />
Afterlife could just be 12-18 seconds...<br />
<br />
No one wants to give up a get-out-of-jail-free card until they have to...<br />
<br />
Set a 20 minute re-use to the ability and make sure its interruptable and takes a while to cast. (10+ seconds)<br />
<br />
Make it a 95% thing... (5% of the time it doesn't work)  The gods of evil do not always keep their word.  (Whoops... you died...  forgot to help you...  what? you thought a god of HATE would keep his word?)<br />
<br />
Afterlife could cast a non-dispellable buff on the shadowknight much like death effects...  only it would have POSITIVE effects.<br />
(the shadowknight has a pact with the gods of death)  This is of course, provided it works.<br />
<br />
it could be easily designed so it wasn't abused any worse than defensive...<br />
<br />
