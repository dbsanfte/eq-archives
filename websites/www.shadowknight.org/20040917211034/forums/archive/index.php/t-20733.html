<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cantyanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have yet to really use our aggro increaser spells.  I was told casting them will increase the range mobs will attack from.  I was wondering if all the spells that increase hate or aggro have a blanket effect or if some will *only* affect the target.   The spells would be useful if they didn't get group mobbed.  <br />
<br />
I basically would like advice in how best to use such spells and when, or if I should at all.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kromglon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I dont use em and have no aggro issues unless someone is being a dumbass and trying to get it. CD, and spears usually gets it get back if somone snags it for a second. Ive been grouping with guildmates 5 levels and above me wizards,rogues and rarely have they taken aggro from me. Im 55 and use a WMBS. No clue if it stays the same past 55.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>nimic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">CD is the only aggro spell I use at 65...  Fear is useful for breaking mezzes (make sure the mobs not fearable, heh) if you cannot get a taunt off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Polite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The voice line of spells is nice to place on a main tank on a raid or for placing on a warrior in an xp group to help him establish agro. CD is better for us to use than any of the terror line for self agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>lorddaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">what they said.<br />
<br />
Voice = cast on the main tank for the raid.<br />
<br />
fear+darkness &gt; all but mebbe a pally with all stuns loaded.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Arikash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">hmm, I usually use CD on inc, then during the fight, I cast 2 darknesses at the beginning to establish aggro, then 1 at like every 20%ish depending on the group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Cantyanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ok, so basically the aggro line of spells is to cast on others who are tanking?  <br />
<br />
kk, i've been using CD and spears.  Not high enough to use fear without it affecting the mobs.<br />
<br />
Just making sure i wasn't missing use of spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>VengerMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Voice:  Raid MA, occasionally XP group MA's if they request it.<br />
<br />
Terror:  Raids only, and only when i'm asked to establish myself as the RT.  works great for this purpose in my experience, but has little to no other use.<br />
<br />
Clinging Darkness:  personal aggro as MA.  level 9, mana efficient, and effective as hell.  never bothered to use Fear, i've never needed more than CD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>nimic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I think fears main use it when you want to aggro a mob without Dot'ing it...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kahntun Derstand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yay, search is my friend!  I found this explanation from Brael for you bud:<br />
<br />
Sure Inferna. Warriors generate their aggro through 5 methods, these are: melee aggro, +hate procs, high aggro procs, provoke line, and taunt.<br />
<br />
In order for voice (or any aggro mod ability) to affect something, it has to meet 2 criteria, it has to not put you at x posistion on the hate list and it has to have an aggro mod on it. To have an aggro mod a spell must not give a fixed value of aggro (direct hate spells). Looking through the list of Warrior aggro generation, melee aggro is affected, +hate procs are not, high aggro procs are, provoke is not, and taunt is not. I don't have the time to go through and calculate it all right now and it varies by the weapon and combat fx, but melee aggro is roughly 35% of a warriors aggro, procs are 45%, and incite is that final 10%. Out of those procs on a high end warrior only 3 of them should be affected (pestilence shock, eoe's proc, and ykesha), which is around 10/15 of their average ppm (depending on where you aug the ykesha) so 2/3 of their proc aggro is affected by it, or 30% of overall aggro, plus 35% of melee aggro, thats 65% of their total aggro which is affected by aggro mods. That 12% is barely able to be justified with Warriors insane aggro as it is, but how do you feel about it when you find out its really just 7.8% additional aggro?<br />
<br />
That made a lot of sense to me when I read it.  I don't waste a buffslot on Voice anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>aress</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">fear is my preferred spell, don't want to have chanters yell at me.  One has to concentrate a bit though when going back to a lolwer zone.  Last night a guild SK accidently feared a mini dustrunner, who, with sow speed, took off :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>shadowblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I think I remmeber Brael or someone saying, if they catch a SK using Voice of Thule in a raid, they get disbanded from guild :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kahntun Derstand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yeah, that's how I found it.  I searched for Brael and Guildremove.  Only two posts came up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gwarh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Gwarh a lil slow, but he a Troll so I'm not sure Im understanding everyone here.<br />
<br />
You cast FEAR on the mob to hold agro? The same Fear spell that makes the mob run away from you. The same Fear spell that when cast in a dungeon makes the mob bring back all his buddied for a Soccer Hooligin Ralley on by Big Green Arse?<br />
<br />
Anytime I cast fear in a group they freak out. Only use it in Fear Kiting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Daikoku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">When  mobs are 55+ they are immune to fear, ie they do not, will not run away.  They just hate you.<br />
<br />
Did forget this  when farming the Valshir illusion spell once in ssra,  luckily we had a druid with us to succour<br />

My Shaman buddy at work just told me the same. Shows how highlevel I am<br />
<br />
