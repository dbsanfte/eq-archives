<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Brildayr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First, I would like to say that I am no way advocating or suggesting nerfing any other class.  This is an exercise in making a valid point via sarcasm.<br />
<br />
I would like to present some thought into what I believe is an absurd position with the &quot;mitigation is a class defining ability of the warriors&quot; precluding any other class to have this ability.  Who pulled this absurd idea out of their arse and I don't really want to know what else might be lurking up there.<br />
<br />
Complete heal is definitely a class defining ability of the clerics.<br />
<br />
1) they get it at lvl 29.<br />
2) they had it since way back when Kunark came out.<br />
3) they were the only ones to get it, when it was introduced.<br />
4) no other class got this ability for quite some time. (we'll get back to this later)<br />
5) clerics two main roles are 1) healing, and 2) buffing.  I don't believe this assumption can be argued against very much.<br />
<br />
Please remove the pseudo complete heal from the druids and shamans to bring this class defining ability back in line with &quot;the vision&quot;.<br />
<br />
Mana regen buffs are a class defining ability of the enchanters. (with exception of the bard, who can do a little of all, but master of none)<br />
<br />
1) they get it at lvl 16.<br />
2) they had it at lvl 29 since pre-kunark.<br />
3) they were the only ones to get it, when it was introduced.<br />
4) no other class got this ability for quite some time. (we'll get back to this later)<br />
5) two of the enchanters main roles are buffs (specifically mind buffs/debuffs) and crowd control.<br />
<br />
Please remove the mana regen component of the druid's Protection line of spells.<br />
Where in the world did they get the idea that a druid is capable of mind buffs ?  Unless you assume its part of the animal in the races.  Gads what a long stretch of the imagination.<br />
<br />
What stretch of the imagination are we being required to believe that because an ability is &quot;class defining&quot; it allows it to be precluded from any other class in the game ?<br />
<br />
Every point I made for the above two examples are valid.  Every one of them is the truth.  Why did the &quot;other&quot; classes get to share in the &quot;class defining&quot; abilities of the original class?  I hope that everyone can see the absurdity of the mitigation statement.  With the above two examples of absurdity that I've given, is there anyone that believes that warriors being the only class allowed to have mitigation is any less absurd ?<br />
<br />
Yes, mitigation needs to be shared amongst the other two tank classes in the game.  (remember when I said we'd get back to this later?) There are several precedents for this within the game for the last couple of years.  I actually don't care how it is implemented or what its called, so long as its effective.  Be it spell, disc, AA, etc.<br />
<br />
I want to stress again that I am in no way condoning or suggesting nerfing any other class in the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
what are u talking about?? why do you think Clerics are looked for all the time... when ur looking for a group healer you dont look for a druid.. or a shaman to heal you. Clerics are still superior to all other healers in every way<br />
<br />
Please remove the mana regen component of the druid's Protection line of spells. <br />
<br />
BLESSING... its a blessing from nature.. and it is in no way better than even kei.. its minimal manna regen<br />

do you have something against druids??? Or u just wanting them to be more gimp then they already are</div></div><hr />

that is all he is pointing out.  He does not really expect them to nerf classes to bring back the holy trinity further.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Laronx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">well if he previews his posts before he posts them we know what the second one was too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Lynxal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Actually, his point is a good one in regards to the priest classes.  They upped Shaman and Druid healing due to the fact that clerics were too far ahead of the other healers and you were required to have a cleric along which never made the clerics too happy either since they were badgered the second they logged on to help with something.<br />
<br />
It's the same situation with Warriors right now.<br />
<br />
Kilk....I would take a druid over a cleric in an EXP group situation anywhere but GoD....especially if I had a shaman there to slow in lieu of a chanter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Stattic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">OK coming in for a late post here. <br />
We all cant forget the BEASTs mana/HP regen line. I will take BST crack over any Clarity(not kei) any day because at lower levels it last longer and also gives a HP regen with it. A lot of classes share abilities but are stronger in their own way. So if so many classes share this ability then why cant we share better mitigation?<br />
<br />
Just what is our roll again anyway? Tank...Caster....DPS....Croud Controll...Puller.... :confused: <br />
Hmm Looks like SOE is loving the fact that they are turning us into a SUPER BARD!<br />
<br />
Even still.. SKs rule all!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
And yes...in no way am I ripping on the SK class. Please dont look at this in that way :D <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Saedog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Here are some points to ponder:<br />
<br />
   1.  Enchanters do not get a self-only mana regen or the ability to give people shots of mana ( barring their weak 'gift' line ).   Almost every other class in the game gets a stacking self-only mana regen.   Enchanters have wanted a self-only mana regen for fucking years now, but don't single druids out because almost every class has a very nice self-only mana regen or even some that have stackable buffs and self-only.<br />
<br />
   2.  Bards mana song stacks with everything, however it does nothing to enhance their own mana regen.   Bards need mana regen buffs from another class or FT to even regen mana faster than meditate (1).    In their favor, at least people have to group with bards to enjoy their mana regen -- although Chorus of Marr is AE ( groupV2 or whatever ).    Many people just snag Enchanter and Shaman buffs and say 'peace out' from PoK, which doesn't necessarily encourage grouping with those classes.     I think the group leadership buffs are interesting, as you have to group with that person to enjoy them.   It maybe a little over the edge socially, but something to consider at least when many people are crying for KEI, Shammy/BST buffs and Virtue in PoK.<br />
<br />
   3.  As a former druid ( pre-Kunark/Kunark/some Velious and now back to it as a boxed char ), I really hated with a passion that Verant ( it was Verant at the time ) turned down the path of being more of a healing class.    Anyone who has played a druid will tell you that they suck balls at healing until later in the game ( superior healing doesn't really even cut it in later expansions as a patch heal, nor does chloroblast ).    I would've much rather had the druid continue down the half nuker/half dot'er class much moreso than 'shitty healer'.    As for shamans, I can't really say because I've never played one.<br />
<br />
    4.  I couldn't really agree more about mitigation amongst Warriors, SKs and Paladins, however I also believe that even Bards should have some mitigation bumped up a little bit.   Monks can screw themselves in the mitigation department imo, even though they've been whining to have their mitigation back to the days of yore.<br />
<br />
    I guess the real kicker is that there should be class defining abilities that are worthwhile, but it is hard to dish them out without giving everyone penis envy in some fashion.    &quot;The Vision&quot; is long gone, until maybe Vanguard is released.<br />
