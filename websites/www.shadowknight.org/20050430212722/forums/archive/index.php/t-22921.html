<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Noctix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been working on GoD sewers lately but I'm not having much fun there.  The only sewer that offers any gear upgrades for me is Sewer 3 and the nature of the mobs in that sewer (high hp, low dps) makes fighting there more boring than watching paint dry.  Plus, I don't really see much point in flagging since my group will likely not be able to do Vxed/Tipt unless we level up quite a bit first.<br />
<br />
So, I'm looking for a place to hunt that will give good experience as well as offer me some gear upgrades.<br />
<br />
Criteria: Must be tankable by me (see magelo).  Must be single groupable by a group of 66s (SK, rogue, wizard, monk, cleric, shaman).  Must be doable given 2-3 hour play sessions.  Also, instanced content is a plus.<br />
<br />
Specifics on how to get to a zone, what the nameds are, how to find the nameds, and what gear is available would be great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Neithan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">While finishing tipt may be beyond you there is no reason you cannot fight to the first named and farm it for augs. XP is great and given DPS of the mobs you should find it a fun challenge. (I have tanked Tipt up to the 1st named so I see no reason why you cannot).<br />
<br />
Vxed again I think you should try. You do not need the flags to go there and the named can drop good stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Oberyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think you will have fun there:)<br />
<br />
Two things:  Make sure you get singles, or have good crowd control, since with an add on you tanking, you will go down so fast you will go &quot;WTF!?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Getting singles is easy, pulls are not particularly hard there.<br />
<br />
Second thing, that makes it doable:  Slow early.  I usually pull, get good pre-agro, and have chanter slow before I engage.  Cheesy, but it avoids that huge burst of mob DPS to start with.  You can do without, but its a crapshoot.  A couple good rounds, a slow heal, and you are toast.<br />
<br />
There should be some upgrades there for you, its a challenge, therefore a blast, and XP is excellent.<br />
<br />
For the named mobs, get creative, and they usually go down:)<br />
<br />
Entrance is off Barindu, on the right side of the zone (coming from Qinimi).  Talk to the drowned-looking Manga Elf female there.  Zone is behind her in the gully.<br />
<br />
Mites summon, Kyvs summon, Ikaavs summon, named's summon, rest dont - which can come in very handy, specially with no chanter.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rhumba_Kween</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've changed my toon a bit lately. My plan is to just hit Oow till I get to 70 and then worry about Vxed/Tipt again.<br />
<br />
With that said, your crew could handle lots of spots in Oow that I have been to. Only one of them would have possible upgrades for you.<br />
<br />
Wall of Slaughter (aka Dreadlands 2.0) This zone is great xp, and the named there drops runes for spells and some descent items. A couple items are: <br />

http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=30482<br />
<br />
This is also rumored to drop there. But I've not seen which mob yet:<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=70225<br />
<br />
You can look on allah's there might be a couple other upgrades for you. But none of them will be big upgrades at all. Also, the joys of WoS are that it is super crowded. We went the first night and killed 5 named, there were 30 in zone. Every time I've run through there since then there have been at least 110 in zone.<br />
<br />
In my opinion, your better option now is just to focus on Oow spells for the group. Getting the Shammy (I think you said you have one) the upgraded spells will do more for you than several upgrades will do. Those, along with your spells should let you start to hit Vxed/Tipt fairly easily I would think. At least I'm hoping they do me.<br />
<br />
Another spot for spells are the instances off of Dranik's Hollow. Just look for the named in there. Their Ph's are uniquely named so they are easy to find. These instances are very easy and are very solid xp for the diffuculty.<br />
<br />
Good luck Noc.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Croix VorAbaddon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Can't confirm this myself, but I've heard City of Dranik can be just as good a camp as Walls for exp and drops, if you know the place and the puller has talent. And it's usually FAR FAR less crowded.</div></div><hr />
