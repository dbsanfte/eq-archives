<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>sin_vraal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been camping the frontier mounters to get the penkeeper to pop and drop that stone key.<br />
<br />
I've yet to see it drop, with I'd say well over 20 penkeepers dead.<br />
Does this key drop anymore? I've got every other key known to man. I've been here for far more than 20 hours now, and with this being the only part of the entire greenmist quest holding me up. I'm getting more than alittle frustrated.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also is the pottery wheel still in droga, or did they move it out side as well?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>DrMobius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Just did it this weekend.  Got my last scroll at 9:00pm on Friday, headed to the caves in FM, First penkeeper was up and he dropped the stone key.  Next pop dropped stone key, the one after that dropped bone necklace key.  Waited until 2:00am for another penmaster to pop, he had a bone necklace key as well.  Waited until 7:45am till the next penmaster finally popped, he droped the bone key.<br />
<br />
The pottery wheel is in the exact same place.  Enter Droga, shrink, invis, run like hell.  Combine, re-invis, run like hell.<br />
<br />
Everything works, its still just a long ass camp. :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ack, they left the wheel in the old jail area of Droga?  Jeebus, what are the levels of the mobs in there now?  I almost died doing my Tome camp to a swarm of greenies, I can't imagine making a mad dash into that area and trying to do the combine while praying that your invis doesn't break and bring down the three nearest cells full of dk blues (or higher) on your head.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>DrMobius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The mob levels in Droga were bumped to 50 - 55.  If you get SoW'd or SoE'd before you go in the zone, then shrink yourself and invis, your invis should last you all the way down and back up.  However, there are no mobs in the cell with the pottery wheel, nor are their any mobs in the adjacent cell.  There is a mob in the third cell, but he's a quest mob that won't agro on you when you re-cast invis.  <br />
<br />
There are 2 goblins outside of the cells, but they won't agro on you either.  Its really a safe, fast, painless run.  If invis happens to drop on you then keep booking it to the cells and FD or DP before you enter the cell.  Wait it out, the mobs will eventually all return and then you can stand up and squeeze through the bars to the pottery wheel, FD or DP just to be safe, then do your combine and put invis back on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>sin_vraal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ok stone key DOES drop still , it just seems EXTREMELY rare.<br />
<br />
The penkeeper just  being tough w/ me.<br />
<br />
Regarding Droga, as DrMobius said above, it is in the same place...<br />
<br />
Shadow step DOES not work through the bars as far as I can see. I had several instances where I was pushed flush up against them, but never through..<br />
<br />
I dont know if the shrink works, but there is a pit you can fall into that drops you inside a jail cell, then you can kill a goblin Janitor for a no rent droga key... only thing is I would reccomend doing this unless you are high enough level to take down a level 46-50 guard.<br />
<br />
Also fighting your way down is not reccomended... Outside the jail are 2 mobs that conned even and above. (one white, one yellow) any grp going down there save an uber  grp is gonna get trashed with the monster density as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>sin_vraal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">andd WOOT, got my greenmist last night / this morning!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>DrMobius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Medium sized characters (DE, Human) need to take one swig of ants potion, fat-assed characters take 2.  You run against the bars moving from left to right and you'll just run right through the gates.  No need to kill anything or get keys.<br />
<br />
Before entering Droga get SoW or SoE.<br />
Enter Droga.<br />
Take 1 or 2 swigs of ants potion.<br />
Cast Gather Shadows (or click CoS).<br />
Run down to jail area.<br />
Run against bars to squeeze through them.<br />
Combine in pottery wheel.<br />
Re-cast Gather Shadows (or click CoS).<br />
Run like hell out of there.<br />
<br />
Its cake :D<br />
<br />
(Edit: Shrink DOES work, and grats on Greenmist!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nazgaull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Just did Argest tonight.<br />
<br />
Cleric friend and I went to FM together and we camped the room with the Iksar slaves.<br />
<br />
We cleared all the goblins out of that, and the Penmaster and Penkeeper both spawned right after.<br />
<br />
We you go down the cave into that room, we sat along the left wall.. <br />
<br />
The Penmaster and Penkeeper's both spawned directly across from us.<br />
<br />
They dropped the following to 2 hours time, and in this order.<br />
<br />
A Copper Key<br />
Bone Necklace Key<br />
A Bone Key<br />
A Steel Key<br />
A Iron Key<br />
A Stone Key<br />
<br />
<br />
The Iksar's present at the time were the following.<br />
<br />
An Iksar Slave on the Left.<br />
<br />
A Crazed Iksar Slave on the right.<br />
<br />
We killed the Crazed first, and another CCrazed popped in it's place.<br />
<br />
We killed An Iksar Slave next.<br />
<br />
An Enslaved Iksar spawned in his place.  <br />
<br />
I have a screenshot of both I'll send into AllakHazam.<br />
<br />
I turned the keys in to the Enslaved (Argest) with dubious faction, and recieved A Coarse Iron Needle...<br />
<br />
Now all I gotta do is get my last two scrolls from CoM and the one from Kaesora.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">So did they also revamp CoM with new mob levels?  I did the CoM scrolls bit while levelling there, so it wasn't so bad, but I always thought that having to do it later would suck hard, as the drops were pretty slow and the camp really was boring once it started to green out.<br />
<br />
Kaesora scroll was incredibly easy.  I think it took me all of 10 minutes.  Of course, Kaesora is one of my favorite zones, so it might have seemed like less time than it really was, but I'm sure it wasn't more than half an hour.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ashrai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">CoM revamp doesn't seem to have really affected the scrolls. I  went back a couple of weeks ago to get the 3rd and didn't notice anything different (had gotten my first 2 while exping there in early 50's). Got the scroll in about 5 minutes tho so wasn't there long enough to poke around much more than the stables. But stables didn't have any perceivable difference.</div></div><hr />
