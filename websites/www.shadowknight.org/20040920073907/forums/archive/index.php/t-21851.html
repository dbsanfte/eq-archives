Goto your control panel and goto edit options (http://www.shadowknight.org/forums/profile.php?do=editoptions)  From here scroll down to Messaging &amp; Notification the third choice under this category is Default Thread Subscription mode, change that to whatever you would like to have (Do not subscribe, No email notification, Instant email notification, Daily email notification, and Weekly email notification).  Next goto your thread subscriptions (http://www.shadowknight.org/forums/subscription.php?).  From here you can adjust existing ones individually either deleting subscriptions, changing how often you get emailed, etc.  In addition to this, when you make a post under Additional Options (below the first Submit Thead button currently) you can set your subscription at the time you post.<br />

Post if none of this works to fix the email spam.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>SoulVoid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">going to look at globally disabling email notifications and requireing it be turned on. just a matter of me finding the right table column. fixing the email system is causing different problems and this should solve a lot of them. Sorry to those that want the alerts, just re-enable them on Sat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>scpio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">im not seeing where i can change the adjustments when i veiw my subscribed threads - i set it at none and the notification thingy is off but i still get them</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>SoulVoid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Verify you are not currently subscribed to any threads before you turned it off, that is more than likely the problem.</div></div><hr />
