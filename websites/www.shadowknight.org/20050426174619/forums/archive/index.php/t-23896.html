<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Helstar Xmortuus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok folks, im a new member to SK.org.  I have read up on all info but not found anything on this camp.  If there is info I appologize for taking your time.<br />
<br />
I know all that have camped for the Greenmist have done so with many hours of time.  I have camped the Lab in Dalnir for 7 days 6 hours a day, not ONE Kly Imprecator has popped.  I ask if anyone has any info to pass on this camp i'd highly appreciate it.  Casters realm offers some help but not completely. <br />
<br />
None the less add if you have some input, thank you all for your time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Agoni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Keeping in mind that there are three spawn locations for a Kly Imprecator and that you can't get more than one to spawn at a time.  So what you do is make a run through Dalnir checking all three spawn points as you go.  If all have PH's then you are set to go.  Just go to the spawn point that you need and start killing him shouldn't take too long.<br />
Rinse and Repeat as necessary to acquire the three pieces.</div></div><hr />
