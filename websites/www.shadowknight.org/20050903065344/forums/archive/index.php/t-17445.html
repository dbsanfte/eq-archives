<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VykusSoulsdrinker</div><div class="date">10-09-2003, 08:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello, I was wondering does anyone have any tips on soloing for a level 52 SK..I have all spells up to level 52 except lifeleech, and have nice gear. My AC is 1280, and I have about 3500 HPs. I was lucky enuff to have a couple friends with me and we all leveled to the early 50s together, but now my Bard friend is into Kiting for himself, and my Monk friend is doing his own thing. I do have access to a level 49 Cleric for 2 boxing. I know about Snare, fear, pet, DOT, typ of Kiting, but was unsure how to really put it all together, and where to best do this. Would appreciate any advice and also, nice to meet all of you, my first post and im looking forward to throwing around ideas amd advice. Thanks.</div></div><hr />

Exp will come in a  lot quicker then soloing because you can kill so many more mobs with a group.</div></div><hr />

Sheesh, nice.</div></div><hr />

Just make sure that you snare everything or you can get lots of adds real fast.<br />
