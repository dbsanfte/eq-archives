I think its disgusting of some of the ways they kill babies, it just makes me sick. why would you abort a baby when if you don't want it you could get it a foster home? just think of all those homosexual or poeple incapable of having babies that would love to adopt it? some of you will say, what if the woman is at risk of dying if the baby isn't aborted, well fuck the woman who would pick herself over a baby. youve had sex already, nothing much left to live for. So what do you pick? should women have the choice of aborting a baby or should aborting or killing babies be banned?</div></div><hr />

you don't see killing babies as something wrong? OOOOOPPPSSS Condom broke, guess i'll just kill it before it comes out to solve my problem.<br />

I doubt foster kids actually hunt the parents down, and even if they're few in numbers the option of putting your baby in one is still there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i'm pro abortion.<br />
everyone should stop having kids... it would end world suffering. let the world die out peacefully, stop having kids you selfish bastards.<br />
<br />
and in regards to &quot;babies&quot; dying and how sad it is, when a fetus is developing, during the first trimester it has about as much self awareness as the average plant. it experiences no suffering by dying, while on the other hand its bound to experience suffering if it lives.<br />
<br />
also, something like half or more of successful fertilizations are naturally miscarried (generally at first period after fertilization), so its not like pregnancy is some sacred thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dkhar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I disagree with women having the choice to abort a baby UNLESS she is raped. And not, &quot;Oh I was drunk and accidently had sex&quot; kind of rape, I mean the type of rape where someone invades your house and whatnot. <br />
<br />
First of all, you made the choice to have sex. Sex, even with protection always carries the chance of becoming pregnant. You made the decision to have sex, you have already made the decision that it is possible for you to become pregnant. Your child did not make this decision for you.<br />
<br />
Secondly, a fetus is a living organism. No matter how small or big, it is a living organism. It will one day become a human. By taking its life at an earlier stage than birth you have robbed it of it's right of choice. It never had the chance to say &quot;I want to live&quot;, or &quot;I want to die&quot;. You are making that decision for it. If you decide to abort a baby, you have commited murder by taking a living persons life without his persmission. Some may argue that at -3 months a babys brain and body are not formed enough to count as a living person but I disagree. It &quot;could&quot; one day make that choice yet it is not ready. I bet if it could make that choice it would say no, please don't choke me with a hanger.<br />
<br />
I also disagree with having the baby and putting it up for adoption. The rate which babies are put up for adoption and are actually adopted are lopsided. Many young children end up in residentials, penitentiaries and the street. This is not a life for anyone, trust me. There are plenty of programs in this world which help Mothers cope with being a mother. Help with food, schooling, jobs, babysitters, anger management etc... I think mothers should be forced to spend the first year of their life with the baby before being allowed to make the decision to put the baby up for adoption. I highly doubt many mothers would make that choice after looking into their kids eyes and realizing they have created something wonderful (unless they are heroine addicts, they care for nothing but their next high). It may sound gay but I am a Father and could never imagine not having my children around. I believe in responsibility for your actions. <br />
<br />
Of course there are always unfit mothers such as I said above. Heroine and crack addicts should have their children taken from them. It angers me to no end that these idiots have unprotected sex, have kids and continue to smoke crack while their baby starves and lays in their shitty diaper. I have seen it first hand, a lot back in New Jersey. I felt like punching these whores in their faces until their eyes popped out of the back of their heads. I feel sorry for all the children in this world with parents that are addicted to such drugs that the drugs take precidence over their own children. There is of course, nothing I can do about it besides say I agree the child should be taken away. But that solves nothing because once a child goes into the system, there is a slim chance of ever having a normal life. It is however, better than watching your mom shoot up in a crack hotel while sucking some guys dick to pay for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm for mandatory sterilization at birth.  Once you're a certain age, have a life thats capable of supporting a child, can prove you're competent, have a desire to have a kid for a long enough period of time, you can get the sterilization reversed and have a kid.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I disagree with women having the choice to abort a baby UNLESS she is raped. And not, &quot;Oh I was drunk and accidently had sex&quot; kind of rape...so the majority of rapes aren't really rapes? nonconsentual sex is only rape when it happens with some shady criminal sex stalker?<br />
<br />
Secondly, a fetus is a living organism. No matter how small or big, it is a living organism. It will one day become a human.<br />
plants are living organisms too... are you opposed to the killing of plants? insects are as well... do you avoid swatting mosquitos?<br />
besides, the definition of &quot;life&quot; needs to be made, and that really can't be done justifiably at a specific point. you choose to define life as the moment of fertilization apparently, but heads up, there's a good chance that fertilized egg won't survive 9 months.<br />
<br />
By taking its life at an earlier stage than birth you have robbed it of it's right of choice. It never had the chance to say &quot;I want to live&quot;, or &quot;I want to die&quot;.<br />
aww... that's so true! but actually, the fetus is by no means sentient within the first trimester. it isn't making any choices or lacking any choices whatsoever... and HAVING a baby puts it in the one situation where it has no choice. a baby can't decide it doesn't want to exist.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you decide to abort a baby, you have commited murder by taking a living persons life without his persmission. Some may argue that at -3 months a babys brain and body are not formed enough to count as a living person but I disagree. It &quot;could&quot; one day make that choice yet it is not ready. I bet if it could make that choice it would say no, please don't choke me with a hanger.<br />
<br />
just a heads up here, there's just a tiny group of tissues hardly even noticable that basically get sucked out with a vacuum. and you know what? regarding the embryo, fetus, whatever choosing you're right... all living things are evolutionarily programmed to desire to live, and complete whatever task to increase the longevity of their species (which is generally to reproduce).<br />
<br />
but honestly, take a look in a mirror at your fucked up self and think of how hard your life has been. don't you wish your mother had aborted and you didn't have to experience all the pain and suffering that is life? you might say &quot;no, i'm glad to be alive&quot; but that's just part of how people are hard wired to survive. your parents put you in the situation where you have very little choice... the choice of existing.<br />
<br />
I also disagree with having the baby and putting it up for adoption...<br />
great, so you want 16 year old mothers to give up their futures so they can raise a child with no opportunities? yes this should bring happiness to the world.<br />
<br />
There is of course, nothing I can do about it besides say I agree the child should be taken away.<br />
get off your ass and adopt.<br />
<br />

not only are you a father, but a shining example of why abortion should be mandatoraly enforced.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And yes, the 16 year old slut who decided to eat the cock should be forced to keep the kid. It'll teach the slut some moral values, such as dick is for grownups, silly whore. When she has to wake up 15 times in an 10 hour night and feed, change and rock the child back to sleep, it gets tiring. When she realizes a pack of diapers cost 12 bucks and the little shitter can go through the whole thing in 3 days, she might find her purse a little lighter. When she goes to get a cup of milk and realizes she only has formula, she might start thinking... holy crap, I don't want another of these things. Having kids is hard and is a huge responsibility. The only thing wrong with my train of thought is some people are crazy and kill their kids because they can't handle the stress. Other than that I think forcing people to keep their kids is a good idea. I don't mean to rag on women and call them whores, I just think it's funny. Men are scum as well. To make a baby and then be like &quot;I'm outta here&quot;, deserves a bullet with his name on it.<br />
<br />
The point of &quot;living organism&quot; was that it would one day become a sentient being, capable of making choices. You've taken that away before it even had a chance. A plant will never become a sentient being. Don't be absurd.<br />
<br />

Problem with this is that it isn't only the mother suffering. If you force a kid to keep a baby, oftentimes the baby will end up abused, homeless, dirt poor, drug addicted, a criminal, dead, etc. Also, no 16 year old hooker's baby is likely to be anything but a burden on society. <br />
<br />
And let's face it, 4 microscopic cells isn't &quot;life&quot;. It's potential, but hey, so is sperm. Is masturbating murder too? If you work in one of those fertility labs, and throw away a batch of frozen microscopic embryos, are you a mass murderer? Let's get a grip please. There's a huge difference between 3 days pregnant and 9 months.</div></div><hr />

I think anyone, even boys and girls playing at being men and women, that come off like having a child makes you a cripple should be executed, and spare the child a horrid life.  It isn't a child's fault that the parents suck at life.<br />

The intended result of consensual sex is procreation, not recreation, and it's the parents fault if they fuck around before they get an education/job/reliable spouce/etc.  Abortion is ducking out of the responsabilities of being human.  My opinion anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
actually that's not quite true in humans. people have sex because its fun, and in humans sex isn't just intended to produce children. humans are about the only animal species that have a concealed ovation cycle. in other animals the female will go into heat and or release pheremones or obvious tell tale signs that they are ready to become impregnated, and only have sex during these times. humans for whatever reason are different. if you're really interested you can read why sex is fun (http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0465031269/qid=1088113954/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_1/102-0579050-2823343) by jared diamond.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know sex is fun and is why most people have sex. That's, really, the problem while missing the point at the same time.  I'm not suggesting that people should only have sex to reproduce, but I was saying this - If a guy fucks a girl, there's a chance she's getting knocked up.  Regardless of how great it feels or how much you are paying her, sex is part of reproduction.<br />
<br />
All I'm trying to get across is (with consensual sex) someone gets pregnant and you can't deal with or support a child, blame shouldn't be placed on the kid and that includes terminating the pregnancy.  <br />
<br />
Really, if you can't handle a kid, then you shouldn't be fucking anyone anyway, imo, but that's not the point.</div></div><hr />

When a male dolphin is interested in you, about the only thing you can do, if you are male, is to masturbate him. (Unfortunately, I cannot speak for the female of the human species... it seems women just don't like dolphins enough... so I cannot say for sure if it is safe to mate with them. I would suspect not, due to a dolphins size, but then again, I cannot say for a woman.) <br />
<br />
<br />
WARNING! In the considerations of safety, you should NEVER let a male dolphin attempt anal sex with you <br />
<br />
<br />
HAHAHAHA!!! <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You can attempt to lick and suck on the end of it while masturbating as well, but be warned, do not try to give full throat, and get the hell out of the way before he ejaculates <br />

but still ewwie, my love for animals stops at the &quot;ohhh how cute&quot; with a quick scratch behind their ears...  <br />

LOL But now I have something new to share with everyone LOL Gross!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Pyrthin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">There is nothing magical about a sperm winning the race to an egg that imbues it on the spot with sentience and the right to life.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">WARNING! In the considerations of safety, you should NEVER let a male dolphin attempt anal sex with you. The Bottle-nose dolphin member is around 12 inches, very muscular, and the thrusting and the force of ejaculation (A male can come as far as 14 feet) would cause serious internal injuries, resulting in peritonitus and possible death. Unless you are the masochistic type, you will have a hard time explaining your predicament to the doctors in the emergency ward....<br />
<br />
Thats one of the best paragraphs I've ever read</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Noctix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">My only view on abortion is that I wish they'd find some way to remove the issue from the presidential election.  I don't care how they do it...have a seperate elected post for it, have the AMA decide, whatever.  It just bugs the hell out of me that almost every woman I meet votes solely based on the abortion issue and ignores important stuff like taxes, war, social services, etc.<br />
<br />
To hell with the economy, which effects every single person in the country, this candidate is (pro/anti)-abortion and some tiny minority of women could be affected by what he has to say about it!</div></div><hr />

<br />
and yeah, that Dolphin thing was actually surprisingly informative..err i mean foonny</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Pro Choice<br />
Why?<br />
Any one can have sex, it doesn't mean they are capeable of being a parent.<br />
I don't want anyone who can concieve raising another human being<br />
It leads to Child abuse, incest and all other sorts of fun things<br />
<br />
Tell an abused kid that he wouldn't be better off dead just after his mother raped him<br />
<br />
Oh and Derraj, go fuck that high horse you rode in on<br />
<br />
I AM Pro-Dolphin sex though...they are pretty good parents</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Zepran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">I consider myself pro-choice, but I think that once you consent ot have sex you have made your choice.<br />
<br />
At the same time I'd like a variation of Brael's plan.  Everyone sterilized, then if you want to be a parent you can have it reversed if you can pass a test / convice a panel you could be a good parent. (Yes I know there is no way this test could ever be fair but it would be nice if it could.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Grimskayle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">I am very for abortion. This decision should be no one's but the mother and if there is a father that is going to raise this child. Would you rather a child live a terrible life because it is unloved or has to live in poverty? The parents/parent is the one that will sacrifice their time and money to raise it. It's their decision. You know whats funny? ALl these people who are &quot;pro life&quot;, you never see them put down a picket sign, and actually volunteer to adobt these children. Of course not. THey just wanna complain enough to be noticed. they dont actually wanna do what they say is right.<br />

I really like the sterilization idea. Once you hit 25, come take a test and then go have (1) child.</div></div><hr />

If all the 16 year old whores stop putting out, I'd be fucking screwed. (Or not screwed, not quite sure how to word that.) I honestly don't care much about the whole for/against abortion bullshit, I hate most other people too much to give a rat's ass about their lives.<br />

<br />
               DOGMA<br />
<br />
      &quot;Are you guys pro-life?&quot;  &quot; You mean those people standing outside the clinic with pictures of dead fetus's? HELL NO!  Me and LunchBox are pro-choice, a woman's body is her own fucking buisness&quot;<br />
<br />
         Now however happy you pro choice people are that i sed that and u have yet another supporter, prepair to be flamed.<br />
<br />
       Simply all the parties waging this retarded ass innersocial war about babie-killing are all overly aggresive and angry, most of them use stupid hippy bullshit like this to waste their time when regularly theyd be smoking pot and playing video games in their mothers garage in their regular life.  Sooooooo my look on this stupid fucking topic is that simply, all the babies should be lethaly injected in the womb before birth so that they die a painless death (except for the needle poke i guess) and that way the human race can finnaly die out, its not like this planet is benefitting from us being here anymore, we used to at leest give bac to the planet by spreading its life.... now we just rape it like one of those waitress whores who you give a fifty dollar tip and take em out back.<br />
<br />
By the way, im not a hippie pro-life activist or any of that bullshit, im just stating that if i was the earth i already woulda shat our race off my skin and and found a fucking party</div></div><hr />
