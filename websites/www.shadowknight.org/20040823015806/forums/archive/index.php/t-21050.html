Democrats = Jobs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Paynreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nice. The article you posted does not mention job standings at all, yet the only line you wrote in your post is &quot;Democrats = Jobs&quot;.<br />
<br />
Either you're an idiot, you don't know what the fuck you are talking about, or you need to go back to highschool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">That articles so stupid I couldn't even finish reading it.  First of all the president doesn't directly control the economy, if he did every single president would have the best possible economy going at all times.  Second of all, you know how unemployment is factored right?  It's the percentage of unemployed people currently seeking work so those numbers can also be taken as saying that a Republician motivates more people to find jobs.</div></div><hr />

Stupid democrats giving people jobs. Why, if they were unemployeed they would have TONS of motivation to look for a job. So unemployment is a GOOD thing. Sure, you might be starving in the street, but it builds charecter!</div></div><hr />

You seem like a decent fellow, so take my advice as friendly.<br />
Stop thinking about politics and the economy. You've shown you have about zero comprehension concerning these things, no matter how much you read. Let it go and let people who DO have a head for these things handle it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'd say it's a safe bet Brael was referring to the disparity in welfare and government aid to those who don't aid themselves in the policies of demcrats and repbulicans (for those of you who can't figure that out for yourselves...).</div></div><hr />

If he didn't understand Braels point concerning this, he sure as hell isnt going ot understand what you just said :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>DrakainShadescale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think the safest thing to say about politics and religion in general is that it makes smart people dumb :)</div></div><hr />

It's just that trying to is so much fun! :D</div></div><hr />

&quot;What's the difference between a Democrat and a Republican? A Democrat blows, and a Republican sucks.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Howlitoezis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Democrats want to take 40% of my earnings and give 50% of that to crack whore mothers, 25% to overseas aid, and 25% in their own pockets.<br />
Republicans want to take 30% of my earmings and give 50% to big businesses (which puts it in their own pockets, really), 25% to the military, and 25% in their own pockets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>brian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I will vote for a democrat since I already spend 40% of my salary on coke-whores, jap-scat porn and campaign contributions...</div></div><hr />
