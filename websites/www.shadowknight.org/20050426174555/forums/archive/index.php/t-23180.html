<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zefan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As a Erudite I have to worship CT and I see thats in my benefit now. Id like to know what factions I can start raising now (levle 41) before i start the quest. What are the must have factions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ShkahlTP</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">well to make it easy id suggest raising all cabilis factions, and just avoid the necros like the plague... kill enough bandits/outcasts in field of bone or slaughter frogs in SoNH or sebilis to become non kos to troopers(at least troopers to start with)<br />
<br />
after, empty all your bags at a bank, refill them all with bonechips, doesnt matter how you do it, just every last godforsaken slot with bonechips, shoce them up your ass, in your ears, in your nose, whatever. once you cannot possibly hold any more bone chips, go to trooper mozo in field of bone (iksar guard next to cabilis zone in) hes on the right if your looking at the city. start handing him bonechips, unstacked. per two bonechips you get a little coin and some faction for ALL cabilis factions (except necros). empty your bags/nose/ears/ass of bonechips. this will take a few hours. then con the SK's roaming around with pets, if your non kos your good, just use the hide trick for you turn ins,<br />
<br />
oh yeah, there is a necro at the top of the SK tower (but you dont ned to go up there) and there is sometimes one named grype in the bar near the sk/shammy guild, just avoid the bar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zefan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">awesome thanks. Im gonna head over to cabilis now nad see just how kos i am. And then probably will slaughter frogs for a long time lol.  Another question, since im not a newbie iksar, how do i start the quest?</div></div><hr />
