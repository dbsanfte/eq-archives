<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Elkar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Warrior Incite may have gotten a bump with this patch.  My normal warrior group memeber was regularly pulling snared mobs off me before getting to camp, without a successful taunt.  That was definately not the normal case prior to tonight.<br />
<br />
Anyone else notice anything?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Daikoku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">One of our better wars could not hold aggro over me in p1, even with me being with the wrong spell set up.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dai</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ttuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I was actually talking with a warrior in my group about his incite maybe being nerfed. He couldn't agro off me for shit tonight and at most I could use 1 CD on the pull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Seems the same as normal to me and I play a Warrior some too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dkhar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Grouped in a LDoN and PoN with a warrior today. In the LDoN, monk was pulling and I was tagging and tanking. Warrior is a taunt smasher and I still had no problem except for that 1 second he was mooshing taunt. I pulled in PoN and there was not a chance in hell he could pull agro off me. <br />
<br />
I did notice I had many more successful taunts today than the past month or so, which has been extremely agravating for me. Fail taunt so much I want to punch things. I normally break mez's with taunt, and the rate has been fail 2 success 1. I went all day today and only failed a few fails. Not too shabby compared to the 3/4 fail rate it was at. Then again, it could just be one of those good days out of the whole month. Like I swear my jboots are slower :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Oogoog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I group fairly regularly with a warrior.  Before last night he wasn't having trouble keeping aggro.  Last night he was having more trouble holding it.  I was in Damage dealer mode so I wasn't trying to take aggro from.  Mob was ping ponging more than usual.  Seemed odd, but hard to say what was really going on.  It took him an average of 3 taunts per mezzed mob for a success.  I started trying to taunt mezzes as well just to speed it up and one of us would break it whenever we got a successful taunt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">This is how you tell if incite was changed<br />
<br />
Has Incite changed? (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spellhistory.html?id=4697&amp;source=Live) <br />
<br />
Nothing was changed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Elkar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Not really.  When ranged agro was changed, you didn't see every spell in Lucy's database with a change entry.  Agro is far too hidden in game mechanics for it to be on a silver platter for you.  Nice SK.org flame attempt though.<br />
<br />
Anyway,  could have been any number of things I guess.  I use festering to pull in LDoN hards (at the level and composition of my group, it works best for us).  Had VoT on the warrior like usual.  Probably comes down to the psychology of a patch day more than anything, just wondered if any else noticed anything as dramatic as I did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Askeer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">err, pulling with festering ?<br />
what for ? so the mobs arrive very slowly and annoy everyone ?<br />
very strange choice for a pull spell.<br />
Also, you should drop VoT and mem something useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Elkar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Not at all.  If I get multiples, especially if casters, I can FD and let the others go home.  I leave the fight early enough to do that and get a mob to camp about the time the previous dies.  If I get a single, the warrior can taunt and get my snare agro.  Works fine.<br />
<br />
But I'm also not in a very high level guild, so although we can handle 2's, it hurts on the mana.  If I pull methodically, we win more often than lose.<br />
<br />
I hate pax on high risk, it seems resisted so often and brings trains.  I could FD/tag, but they seem easier to manage when snared.  Pet pull seems like to many pets would get waxed and I'd waste mana on pets.<br />
<br />
We got a 9k warrior, I'm around 8k raid buffed.  AC is low, I know.  How would you pull if you were me.  I'd be glad to listen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ttuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'm pretty much the same gear level as  you Elkar, and I also find that snare is the easiest way for me to pull, I'm sitting at just 8k when buffed in a group, so I like the mobs pre slowed in hard ldons. Pet works, but only if you can get it virt/focus etc, even then it dies alot. Still, on some rooms it's your only option for gimps like us.</div></div><hr />

What does it mean, &quot;pre slowed?&quot; <br />
<br />
Either the mob is slowed or it isn't.  There is no other option and they are mutually exclusive.<br />
<br />
Pre-slowed is a meaningless word.  :)<br />

Either the mob is slowed or it isn't--there is no other choice.<br />
<br />
I suppose you are saying that the mob is slowed then.  :) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>StruzorGnome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Listen tard.  Pre = before, pre-slowed means SLOWED BEFORE IT GETS TO CAMP AND STARTS HITTING YOU.  You are not smart or witty by repeating &quot;it's slowed or it isn't.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">You're thinking of the terminology wrong, pre-slow is referring to it being slowed prior to the mob being tanked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>lorddaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">simple logic test.<br />
<br />
1. is the mob in camp? yes/no<br />
2. is the mob slowed? yes/no<br />
<br />
1. no 2. no = not &quot;preslowed&quot;<br />
1. yes 2. no = not slowed and tank getting beat for full mob DPS (this is bad, and either means tank gonna die, or healers going to waste alot of mana)<br />
1. no 2. yes = mob is preslowed, mob is not in camp, but mob will not deliver full DPS to the tank when it get's to camp<br />
1. yes 2. yes = mob in camp beating on the tank, but for reduced DPS compared to the yes-no above.<br />
<br />
if you can't undrstand the importance of having slow landing on mob before it hits the tank, go back to playing tiddlywinks on yahoo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Listen jerk-off, I was jesting.  <br />
<br />
And I don't give a rat's ass how the fuck you want to define &quot;preslowed.&quot;  Either the fucking mob is slowed or it isn't.  There is absolutely, positively, no other state the mob can exist in.  The fact that the mob has reached camp or not is completely irrevelant.  The way you are using it means, &quot;to slow the mob before he is slowed.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Slowing the mob &quot;PRE-CAMP&quot; might work, but not the nonsense you have.  Brilliant work shithead.  Learn to correctly use the prefix &quot;PRE.&quot;  (HINT--the prefix &quot;PRE&quot; almost NEVER makes sense in front of a verb...)<br />
<br />
It was a JOKE ANYWAYS, you little asshole.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Banuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I have to agree with lunatic.<br />
<br />
The mob is slowed, or its not, unless perhaps you're counting the BST slow as the pre-SHM slow that will land half a second later?<br />
<br />
prior would have been what youre looking for. you want the mob slowed prior to you tanking it?</div></div><hr />
