dude.. you don't get it. *I* support the military. I vote against people that cut benifits, cut pay, or fuck vetrans (i.e. BUSH). I vote against people that don't send body armor, gas mask or other CRITICAL supplies to our troops (i.e. Bush).  I stand up to a government run by corrupt fucks that send people like you to die in a shithole so war profiteers can rob the treasury blind. You've done what but blindly follow orders?<br />
<br />
Whether you feel it is a just cause or not, show some fucking respect <br />
<br />
No. If you die fighting a dishonorable war then you fucked up. I respect those that died fighting for a just cause like in Bosnia. I do NOT respect those that died in Nam fighting against the people that lived there just because they chose a different socio-economic system.<br />
<br />
Wearing an army uniform and carrying a flag doesn't mean what you do is right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Loneshadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Amen Grim..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Lonelytank</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">First off, I dont wear an army uniform, I wear an Air Force uniform.  And secondly, if you ever served, you would know what following orders were about.  Our military leaders know so much more than you think they do.  You may try to justify your disrespect however you wish, but that still doesn't make it right.  And if you ever held a military position you would know what that means.  You have no clue what life is or is not like in Kuwait, Pakistan, Turkey etc.  You have no clue how the people there live, the way they treat women, religion, or just plain freedom.  You may scoff at your comfort of freedom, but that freedom will always come with a price.<br />
<br />
9/11 brought to the table something that this country had never dealt with before, a substantial attack on not only our countries citizens, but their way of life.  The ramification of WTC are still in effect with the manner in which you will never percieve.  You will never know the look of joy on the face of an Iraqi child when they found out that Sadaam was no longer their ruler.  You will never know unless you have been there.<br />
<br />
Secondly, the gas mask issue was put into effect not by BUSH but by Clinton.  The thing I think you don't percieve is the responsibilty that our military leaders have.  The fates of thousands of soldiers lie in their decisions, and that is not one that our officer core takes lightly.  You will never know how much aid we provide other countries until you see 1,000+ palletes of food and provisions for poverish citizens of other countries.  Whether you like it or not, you don't know shit about why wars are started or how they are fought.  So to sit there and say that you do is imho an ignorant action.<br />
<br />
What I do for a job may not be right for YOU, but it is the life I chose for MYSELF.  You have no idea what honor is in war.  You have no idea the measures that our soldiers take to not violate the laws of armed conflict.  But then again you knew that right?  Because you are the one who guages why American Soldiers should be sent from home.  You know every briefing that has been conducted on the manner of affairs in Iraq and Afganistan?  You don't know shit, except for what you read in the news.<br />
<br />
Why I fight in the military is for personal reasons, personal being that even though I may not understand exactly why I am where I am, its still my job and duty, because I gave my word that I would uphold the constitution.  But thats taking pride in what I do, maybe you have never felt that which is why you belittle something you know jack shit about.<br />
<br />
You may look at war from a very outside perspective, but until you have lived it, or been a part of one, shut your fucking hole.  You belittled men and women who will never have the luxury of spending time with their families and friends.  You belittle the memories of what those people accomplished in their lives, both military and civilian.  Would you be this way if the person in the box were brother, father, sister, mother, son, daughter?  If you best friend was laying in one of those caskets would you speak so harshly on it?  Fighting was their decision, and just because you don't understand their choice, doesn't mean its wrong.<br />
<br />
Grim, I pity members of society such as yourself, you don't know anything about military life, but you won't hesitate to piss on the graves of those that have died before you for this country.  Whether you understand it or not, they were still people, and deserve at least respect, so once again I re-iterate.  Shut your fucking pie hole and show some respect for the deceased you selfish asshole.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kebsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">So tank, what is your position on the war's morality?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Grim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Oh what ever dude. You're not some fuckin hero. You're not some brave rambo takin out the bad guys. You're not fighting for me. You're not fighting for the mom, apple pie, and the american way. You fought a war against a petty dictator that had nothing to do with 9/11. You fight so that we can control Iraqi oil. You're no better than a pirate. Arrghh, matey. So there is nothing honorable in your deeds or words. You're just a guy that got played. <br />
<br />
<br />
Any loss of life is regretable, but yours no more than anyone elses. Those poeple up their in that pic? Sad, but they chose to to fight an unjust war. They could have said &quot;No, I'm not going to fight this bullshit war. Send me to Levenworth.&quot; But they went. And now they are dead. <br />
<br />
<br />
$200 billion dollars, 700 dead americans, god knows how many dead iraqi's (hostile and not), and all for what? So halliburton can get paid? So the war profiteers can make a quick buck? Sure, our troops can't get they latest and greatest (it's clinton's fault again! omg! :rolleyes: ) but the mercenary company boys do. And they only cost 25x what US soldiers cost! Gee.. i wonder where the money for bulletproof vests went... (hint: Son, you got fucked.)<br />
<br />
You will never know the look of joy on the face of an Iraqi child when they found out that Sadaam was no longer their ruler.  Dead is dead. You should know that. <br />

What is your position on the war's morality?  <br />
<br />
War is always bad.  There is no moral relativity.  The situation doesn't matter.  A man who steals bread for his starving children is just as guilty of stealing as the man who stole bread to throw it in the river.   But as people we understand the former situation better and will have sympathy and mercy.  War is always bad.  A war to throw out a ruthless timocracy (see Liberia) is no worse than a war for oil.  That being said I'd much rather not support the latter.<br />
<br />
But, I don't buy the bullshit about this being all about oil.  Not that it doesn't have merit, but I remember Bill Clinton, All Gore, Hilary Clinton and the current President all stating in speaches that our intelligence believed that there was weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.  I'm still pissed about the terrorism, I'm pissed about Americans paying only lip service to security and I want to believe that part of the reason for the war was because we learned the the price of non-action.<br />
<br />
In order to maintain a role as the hegemon (one supreme world super-power) we will need to do many awful things and get involved in colflicts we have no place in.  The United States will have to decide how important the role of hegemon is to it and start being careful about which fights it gets involved in, even if it decides to retain it's hegenomy (see the War of American Revolution for what a poor choice of conflict can do to a hegemon)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Brona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Well, allow me to rhetort. I served over there as well lonelytank so I understand what your saying. <br />
<br />
I think what grim was trying to do was point out that we are wasting our troops lives by throwing them into a useless war that is clearly politically driven . However, I did find the context in which grim portrayed that message extremely distasteful. <br />
<br />
When I look at that picture I have torn emotions. First, I am extremely proud of those young men and women for serving their country honorably so that we can live freely. But I also see lives lost, perhaps needlessly, perhaps not. But they aren't coming back and I hope they didn't die so that someone could line their pockets or raise their poll numbers.<br />
<br />
But I also understand what lonelytank is saying (having been there).  American troops don't care about politics or who is in office, or polls or statistics. They take care of each other and the mission and it doesn't matter if they agree with the reasons they are there or not. <br />
<br />
We volunteered to serve our country because we love it. We sacrifice most of our basic freedoms in order to make sure those freedoms are protected for the civilians. I didn't mind going to some shit-hole country in the middle of BFE if it meant my wife was at home safe and my kids can grow up without fear.<br />
<br />
I have my thoughts about this war though and I am far from optimistic about our &quot;reasons&quot; for going to iraq.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Dkhar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I pulled this from over on the Neveron Forums. I can't even write anything to you Grim I'm so pissed. First off, you post bodies of American soldiers in the Flames forum in a flame post about Americans being greedy for oil and we deserve such things! You fucking ignorant NIGGER! And yes I can call you a fucking nigger because that's what you fucking are. A piece of fucking shit nigger. Now, I can't even type, I feel like flying to your house and pulling your fucking face off with a sander. You're a fucking moron, a real piece of work idiot. <br />
<br />
Well anyway, here's a little something about how greedy we aren't, and just how fucked up things got when Americans decided to go AGAINST MAKING MONEY FOR FREE.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Apologies for yet another politics post on the General board, but I thought this deserved attention, as it underscores part of why we evil Neocons don't have much regard for the United Nations - something, judging by some of the comments I've received, some of the non-American readers at Sarna have a question about. <br />
<br />
(I would have put this in the Bush and Tyranny thread, but it has nothing to do with Bush and not much to do with tyranny, and nothing to do with drugs, which is where that thread has kind of drifted off to.)<br />
<br />
The following article appears in the print and on-line editions of this week's US News and World Report. While US News tends to lean a little to the right of say, Time or Newsweek, it is regarded as one of the Big Three news magazines in the United States. So it's not just right wing paranoia or the tin-foil brigade making anti-UN noise. There's major structural problems at the United Nations, and until we see the UN itself face up to it there are going to be a lot of people, myself included, who are less than inclined to invite the world body that contributed most to the misery of sanctions-era Iraq to play any major role in helping Iraq put together a government. <br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
A Tangled Web, Unravelled<br />
<br />
The prospects of the United Nations taking over the transition in Iraq may now be fatally compromised. The world body is caught up in a welter of allegations and evidence suggesting strongly that a noble effort of humanitarian assistance was tainted by greed, bribery, and the most venal kind of power politics. The U.N. was supposed to oversee the oil-for-food program that allowed Saddam Hussein to sell oil and use the proceeds to buy essential food and medicine for the Iraqi people. At least $10 billion, evidently, went into the pockets of political operators.<br />
<br />
It is a tribute to the new American-installed democracy in Iraq that an Iraqi newspaper has been in the forefront of exposing the racket and naming the 270 international power brokers who seem to have had their hands in the till. Here's how the scam allegedly worked: Saddam sold oil to his friends and allies around the world at deep discounts. The buyers resold the oil at huge profits. Saddam then got kickbacks of 10 percent from both the oil traders and the suppliers of humanitarian goods. Iraqi bean counters, fortunately, kept meticulous records.<br />
<br />
Coincidence. If you wondered why the French were so hostile to America's approach to Iraq and even opposed to ending the sanctions after the 1991 Gulf War, here's one possible explanation: French oil traders got 165 million barrels of Iraqi crude at cut-rate prices. The CEO of one French company, SOCO International, got vouchers for 36 million barrels of Iraqi oil. Was it just a coincidence that the man is a close political and financial supporter of President Jacques Chirac? Or that a former minister of the interior, Charles Pasqua, allegedly received 12 million barrels from Baghdad? Or that a former French ambassador to the U.N., Jean-Bernard Merimee, received an allocation of 11 million barrels? Perhaps it was just happenstance, too, that a French bank with close ties to then French President François Mitterrand and one of the bank's big shareholders who is close to Saddam became the main conduit for the bulk of the $67 billion in proceeds from the oil-for-food program. All told, 42 French companies and individuals got a piece of this lucrative trade. No matter how cynical you may be, it's sometimes just plain hard to keep up with the French.<br />
<br />
But they're not alone. Russians received more than 2.5 billion barrels of the cut-rate crude. Some 1.4 billion barrels went to the Russian state. Not to be left out of the feeding frenzy, even the U.N. got in on the action. It received administrative fees of about $2 billion for the program, which may be fair, but the senior U.N. official in charge of the program, Benon Sevan, is reported to have received 11.5 million barrels himself. Cotecna, a Swiss-based firm hired by the U.N. to monitor the import of the food and medicine to Iraq, hired Kojo Annan, the son of U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, as a consultant during the period when the company was assembling and submitting bids for the oil-for-food program. All of these coincidences were reported by Claudia Rosett in the National Review. None, surprisingly, were disclosed by the U.N., Cotecna, or the senior or junior Annan. The imposition of so-called smart sanctions on Iraq, several years after the end of the 1991 Gulf War, allowed Saddam to purchase items besides food and medicine. But some of the things approved by Kofi Annan seem pretty far afield. There was the $20 million he authorized for an Olympic sports city for Uday Hussein, Saddam's reprehensible (and now deceased) oldest son. And then there was the $50 million for TV and radio equipment for Saddam's ham-handed propaganda machine. This is food? Gives new meaning to Kofi Annan's statement, in 1998, that Saddam was a man &quot;I can do business with.&quot; And how.<br />
<br />
All of this would seem to raise a few questions about the intense opposition to the American intervention in Iraq within the U.N. Security Council, and particularly from Paris and Moscow. In one way or another, the U.N. stonewalled, until now, a serious independent investigation of the oil-for-food program. To his credit, Kofi Annan is now supporting such an investigation, but the Security Council has not approved it, and France and Russia--surprise!--are actively blocking it. Former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker has agreed to head the inquiry, but only if it is blessed by a Security Council vote. Absent such a vote, there is still an awful lot of explaining to be done. <br />
<br />
Will the investigation be whitewashed to preserve the U.N.'s reputation so that it can replace the CPA in Iraq, or will the investigation get to the bottom of this ugly mess? Fortunately, Congress is going to conduct its own hearings on the largest public financial scandal in history--and the disgraceful insiders' game played at the U.N. <br />

<br />
Dem's are making iraq worse to make an issue of it? I hear tinfoil is in this year. :rolleyes: Go read that last link. Go on. The memo they talk about is damning. See, no one HAS to make it worse because it's already so fucked.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway, what I was saying about supplies is that THEY ARE AVALIBLE. You can BUY them RIGHT NOW. People (non-military) are buying them here to send to Iraq. How can you say that's not fucked up? If I was in charge you would *NOT* be able to buy them because I would be shipping every last one over there to those that need. That is called supporting the troops. <br />
<br />
<br />
As for &quot;laughing at the dead&quot; I'm not. They got con'd into going to war (Osama who?) and now they are dead. they died becuase the preznit said to go. So.. was it worth it? Can you look at them and say their deaths were not in vain?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Grim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">And in a stunning &quot;I TOLD YOU NEO-CON ASSHOLES SO&quot;, according to Republican Congressmen, it IS Bush fucking the troops. <br />
<br />
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A28903-2004Apr20.html<br />
<br />
<br />
But military officials, defense contractors and members of Congress say that worsening U.S. fortunes in Iraq have dramatically changed the equation and more money will be needed soon. This comes as lawmakers, returning from their spring break, voice unease about the mounting violence and what they say is the lack of a clearly enunciated strategy for victory. <br />
<br />
The military already has identified unmet funding needs, including initiatives aimed at providing equipment and weapons for troops in Iraq. The Army has publicly identified nearly $6 billion in funding requests that did not make Bush's $402 billion defense budget for 2005, including $132 million for bolt-on vehicle armor; $879 million for combat helmets, silk-weight underwear, boots and other clothing; $21.5 million for M249 squad automatic weapons; and $27 million for ammunition magazines, night sights and ammo packs. Also unfunded: $956 million for repairing desert-damaged equipment and $102 million to replace equipment lost in combat. <br />
<br />
The Marine Corps' unfunded budget requests include $40 million for body armor, lightweight helmets and other equipment for &quot;Marines engaged in the global war on terrorism,&quot; Marine Corps documents state. The Marines are also seeking 1,800 squad automatic weapons and 5,400 M4 carbine rifles. <br />
<br />
Rep. Curt Weldon (R-Pa.), vice chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, charged that the president is playing political games by postponing further funding requests until after the election, to try to avoid reopening debate on the war's cost and future. <br />
<br />
Weldon described the administration's current defense budget request as &quot;outrageous&quot; and &quot;immoral&quot; and said that at least $10 billion is needed for Iraqi operations over the next five months. <br />
<br />
&quot;There needs to be a supplemental, whether it's a presidential election year or not,&quot; he said. &quot;The support of our troops has to be the number one priority of this country. . . . Somebody's got to get serious about this.&quot;  <br />
<br />
So please post about how I was right and you were wrong. <br />
<br />
But seriously, why does Bush hate America and our troops?</div></div><hr />

Marketplace has a nifty (completely totally fucked up) look at the iraqi reconstruction effort. This is YOUR tax dollars. Those dead are YOUR troops. The person responsible? <br />
<br />
The spoils of war add up to more than capturing expansive palaces and luxury cars. As Marketplace reporters have discovered, not all of the $22 billion being spent to rebuild Iraq is going where it should. Who's watching the money as it streams through Baghdad? Just about no one, and bribes and black marketeering are rampant, witnesses say. A leading anti-corruption group claims as much as 90 percent of U.S. money spent in Iraq is being lost to corruption. From Halliburton subsidiaries charging double for gas, Iraqi officials and Arabic translators unrestrained from pocketing millions of dollars, or even members of the interim governing Council accusing each other of taking tens of millions in bribes. Trouble is, the root of the problem can't be found anywhere near the Green Zone. Try the White House, and Capitol Hill, where oversight of Iraqi construction crews and U.S. contractors like Halliburton has only just begun to be assigned… more than a year after the war began.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Grim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">From &quot;Curtains Ordered for Media Coverage of Returning Coffins&quot; by Dana Milbank (Washington Post, 21 Oct 2003):<br />
<br />
Since the end of the Vietnam War, presidents have worried that their military actions would lose support once the public glimpsed the remains of U.S. soldiers arriving at air bases in flag-draped caskets.<br />
<br />
To this problem, the Bush administration has found a simple solution: It has ended the public dissemination of such images by banning news coverage and photography of dead soldiers' homecomings on all military bases.<br />
<br />
In March, on the eve of the Iraq war, a directive arrived from the Pentagon at U.S. military bases. &quot;There will be no arrival ceremonies for, or media coverage of, deceased military personnel returning to or departing from Ramstein [Germany] airbase or Dover [Del.] base, to include interim stops,&quot; the Defense Department said, referring to the major ports for the returning remains. <br />
<br />
A Pentagon spokeswoman said the military-wide policy actually dates from about November 2000 -- the last days of the Clinton administration -- but it apparently went unheeded and unenforced, as images of caskets returning from the Afghanistan war appeared on television broadcasts and in newspapers until early this year [2003]. Though Dover Air Force Base, which has the military's largest mortuary, has had restrictions for 12 years, others &quot;may not have been familiar with the policy,&quot; the spokeswoman said. This year, &quot;we've really tried to enforce it.&quot;<br />
 <br />

more l33t spoilerz for the Saudi gas thing. kinda. I've heard more of it in other places but basically comes down to Preznit getting a deal to lower gas prices before the election.

<br />
I've got a very simple argument to stop that line of thinking:<br />
<br />
Of all the countries on planet Earth, the current United States of America is by far, by far the most militarily powerful country to ever exist. It could, quite literally, fight three overseas wars at once and win. It could win a war without ever setting a single soldier down on the ground. In fact, the United States has enough nuclear weapons to exterminate every living thing bigger than a cockroach - not to mention conventional bombs and god-knows what else.<br />
<br />
And yet... we don't do that. Right now, at the press of a few buttons, we could quickly turn North Korea into a molten hell. After 9/11, the US could have put the entire middle east in a 10,000 year nuclear winter. We could have killed every single living thing in Iraq in the current war. 100 American soldiers have died this month alone in fighting with rebels who are mostly holed up in urban areas, and yet we did not HAVE to lose a single one of those soldiers, we chose to; the easy method would ahve been to blow the fuck out of those cities and just write off the civilian casulties as the cost of war. Instead, we take that cost upon ourselves. We use soldiers - allow our countrymen to die - instead of calling in the Air Force and just leveling everyone who stands in our way.<br />
<br />
Is the US perfect? Fuck no, no person is and no country is. But is it true that we are a nation run amok on the other members of the planet? Hell no. We use force when we deem it necessary, but we use it with discretion and in a controlled manner. We do not run rampant on the earth, no matter how much you may like to think so.<br />
<br />
I guess i can conclude best by just saying that next time you want to badmouth US foreign policy, think about what we COULD do (not as a threat, but just as fact) and then what we CHOOSE to do.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>Dkhar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">We wouldn't have to bomb ourselves. We are self righteous, greedy, loud-mouthed Americans remember. Why the fuck should we care if there are bad people in our country ? They're not even really bad, they're American so that makes them good anyway. We can do no wrong and choose to stick our noses in anybody's business because we know what is best for everyone.<br />
<br />
I'm sick of all of you cocksucking foreigners generalizing the American people. I am not a politician. I am not a General. I did however, sit at home and watch on TV a shitload of young people go out into our nations capitol and have an anti-war rally that lasted for days. I remember those rallies going on for 2 weeks in different parts of the country, with more than 10,000 people at each rally. I remember watching TV and seeing the families of the men and women who were going off to war cry and grieve because they knew what was to come. I sit here every day and read about our soldiers dying, about their families breaking down when they hear the news. I read about the &quot;next Vietnam&quot; now everyday and it pisses me off because in the back of my head, speaking quietly this whole time, a voice that says &quot;We could have just nuked all the dirty little ragheads&quot;. But I don't speak it aloud because it sinks me to the level of our enemies, who generalize our Country and have acted upon it in such ways that it has killed thousands of Americans. <br />
<br />
Generalization goes a long way. So fuck off you foreign third world sheep fuckers. You know nothing of the real American people. We are too God damn nice, too helpful and too meek for such a powerful country. You're all just lucky I don't get to run the U.S. or I would ban the marriages of men to animal so quick it would make your head spin.</div></div><hr />

No Brael. They made the promise to pull their troops out of Iraq long before they got bombed. Of course people are more inclined to vote for the party that wants to pull out when you've just been bombed. The point is that majority of spain did not agree with participating in the war in the first place, and now they finally had a chance to send away the goverment that joined in to the war. The bombing only increased this effect, but spain would have left Iraq sooner or later either way.</div></div><hr />

You forgot to mention why they did get bombed, cause their goverment was yelling like the US, well they got removed fast dont you think, and i dont think they will see any more bombings in the future cause this goverment should have a little more respect for other people.<br />
<br />
Of all the countries on planet Earth, the current United States of America is by far, by far the most militarily powerful country to ever exist. It could, quite literally, fight three overseas wars at once and win.<br />
<br />
How can that be when they didn't even win 1 war in the last 20 years...actually to think of it, what wars did you win except WW1 and 2 where you had Europe backing you up.<br />
Oh and i dont think saying you have won, actually makes you win.<br />

<br />
Two facts to think about:<br />
<br />
- The Chinese have numerical superiority.<br />
<br />
- A lot of european countries have technological superiority in many fields, including military tech.<br />
<br />
<br />
Besides, todays america has NEVER fought against an enemy with an even remotely on par tech level. Without using nukes you would loose a hell of a lot of manpower and equipment trying to conquer and hold just ONE advanced country. Heck, even a country as small as Switzerland could hold the mountain regions for a VERY long time.<br />
<br />
Sure, the chances of a strike back to America would be slim. But just taking such targets would deplete the resources America has. Forget it. Conventional wars against countries of equal or better technology are a thing of the past.<br />
<br />
And don't even start with nukes; America can't survive on its own just as the rest of the world can't. To stay with the Switzerland example, a large amount of american hightech equipment for planes, military equipment and even spacecraft are manufacted in  the halls of Contraves, a swiss company, and a large number of other german and swiss manufacturers.<br />
<br />
<br />
Stop that crap about what you COULD do, because in the long run, you can't.</div></div><hr />

Now, as for the rest of what you said it sounds reasonable though im sure its not perfect. Im not going to bother refuting it because firstly you and I don't have enough information to really make an in-depth discussion about a war between the US and some modern European country, and second because the point of my earlier post was not to say &quot;Hey, we've got a big military and that means my penis is fucking huge !!!&quot;.

Care to explain how that should aid you ? Ever heared of the frase &quot;divide and conquer&quot;. Well it could be applied here for some part.<br />
It is true the US cant conquer the whole world, but it doesn't have to do that to be bullies. If you cant see that, you can allways ask me to explain it for you.<br />

And the Patriot missile thing...not exactly true.  It wasn't twenty years old.  It took twenty years to develop.  And Patriot type missiles cannot shoot down ICMBs.  The US itself uses ICBMs equipped with Enhanced Radiation Warheads (aka nuetron bombs) to shoot down inbound nuclear ICBMs.<br />

<br />
See, thats the point. The US COULD NOT NUKE the living daylight out of europe. Simply because you need europe at least as bad as europe needs the US.<br />
<br />
<br />
I never said super advanced technology that blows everything the US has out of the water. I said 'superior' technology.<br />
<br />
Two examples:<br />
 - Switzerland uses the german Leopard II tank, which, using arrowshot ammunition, will be able to totally incapacitate your prescious new M1A1 design with a single shot. The M1A1 however, needs 3-4 hits on average to take out a Leopard II. Well actually the M1 would survive... But the tank crew wouldnt.<br />
 - Switzerland has one of the best surface to air equipment in the world. Within three seconds they blow a detected hostile aircraft to smithereens, including that oh so safe-height flying AWACS of yours. First hit is programmed 'on the fly' with an estimated to-hit chance of 98%.  This is why it fires at least twice. Furthermore, tests have proven that these Anti-air facilities are pretty much invulnerable against infantry, air strikes or artillery attacks unless its really a full scale assault.<br />
<br />
To add to that; most military training in Switzerland *does* blow that of a lot of other countries out of the water. When the germans first gave us their new Messerschmidts and a short time later got into a skirmish, the swiss pilots almost totally decimated a 2:1 german superiority with less than 30% casualties. Similar figures appeared in a training fight between american and swiss pilots after we first employed the F/A-18. A troop (15 men) of swiss territorial grenadiers took out more than twice that number of SEALs in another training.<br />
<br />
Switzerland doesnt have a whole lot of quantity in most areas, so we make up with quality. Add to that mandatory military service (i.e. 2 million of our 8 million pop can be called to service) and the mountainous, difficult terrain for any attacker, at least in a large part of the country.<br />
<br />
Yes, you could take out Switzerland. heck, it'd be sad if you could'nt. But you'd be guaranteed to a) loose a hell lot of resources, b) piss off a LOT of other countries and c) loose a very important manufacturer of high tech equipment...which for example is used in the very same military equipment you'd need to lay waste on europe.<br />
<br />
<br />
Why do you think Hitler never tried to attack Switzerland? He was scared he'd loose three fourths of his army in doing so, thats why. Back then it wasnt that bad, although still a danger.... And today Switzerland has the same numerical firepower than germany, and more than Austria, Italy or France.<br />
<br />
We DO take the 'armed' part in our 'armed neutrality' philosophy pretty serious :)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW: Why does EVERY american confuse us Swiss with them sweeds? Really EVERYONE does that over there....Go get a map, jeez ^^</div></div><hr />

<br />
I didn't say Europe, I said Switzerland (or Sweden, whichever one of those you were talking about).  Of course, I'm aware of the political concequences of doing something like that, I was considering this a theoretical, might vs. might arguement.  And, for some reason I dont doubt that most of Europe would side with the US in such a situation.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for the M1A2 vs Leopard:  the upgrade from M1A1 to M1A2 came with the  full-on chobham laminated/spaced armor with a thick layer of DU.  It is the most heavily armored tank in the world <br />
in addition to having the most technologically advanced armor. <br />
<br />
  I dunno who told you that a Leopard could take it out in one shot, or that it would take several shots for an M1A2 to take out a Leopard, but a Leopard is made with significantly less chobham-style armor than a M1A2, which makes it lighter and more nimble but also more vulnerable to hits.  Furthermore, the Leopard II uses primarily tungsen based munitions, which don't have nearly as much punch as a DU munition.  DU has the  qualities of self-<br />
sharpening as it ablates on its way through armor, and of igniting <br />
on its way through too, making it a better penetrator than tungsten and spewing flaming toxic death on the tank's innards when it does penetrate. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Any anti-aircraft system has to be able to see the aircraft before it can shoot it down.</div></div><hr />

Its Switzerland. Get that into your brain. Not Sweden. I really have NO CLUE how almost no american can get that right, all the time. <br />
<br />
You couldnt just grill Switzerland. You'd loose the capability of maintaining / producing a lot of your stuff.  Try looking around how much foreign technology your military uses. German minesweepers for example.<br />
<br />
Keb, I NEVER EVER claimed the US couldnt take out Switzerland. Im claiming theyd have a heck more trouble than with some backwater country like Iraq. Hell, our (and yours for that matter) APC is better than their main battletank.<br />
<br />
Sorry, meant whatever designation the upcoming tank has. <br />
<br />
As for why the Leopard can take it out:<br />
Arrowshot ammo is a rather special sort. It packs less punch than normal projectiles in actual destructive power. However, the kinetic energy is sufficient enough to smack the entire tank away for a good 5-10 metres. And THAT simply breaks the crews neck. <br />
The tank itself only has a dent. But then, a tank without a crew isnt worth much.<br />
The Leopard II itself was DESIGNED to withstand such a shot, and even then it s crew has a very low survivability rating against an arrowshot.<br />
<br />
Oh yea, remind you: the Leopard II is a german tank. Not a swiss one. Its several years old too. Funny how an older tank can compare to a new american one.<br />
<br />
<br />
And if youre refering to your prescious stealth tech...<br />
Uhm... Well, the US gov was rather dumbfounded when Switzerland dropped a by the way note how they didnt like the stealthcraft passing over swiss borders not too long ago.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u111"><b>Dkhar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p111">I have to agree. I watched a lot of the History channel and they do a lot of shows on different militaries in the world. I specifically remember being VERY impressed with Switzerlands military. They work very close with a lot of the high tech countries and actually do produce many things Americans use. <br />
<br />
One of the more impressive things I saw was the training camp for some red beret elite guys (Mountaineers I think, cannot remember their name). But they were crazy, meant to be deployed in ANY climate, far out of the way of fire and then flank the enemy and destroy such things as communication towers, ammo depots and such things. I think they were formed as a ragtag band of guys that had some stupid insane mission to go over some frozen alps to defend the other side. The regiment did so well and lost no men that they started giving them special missions, sort of like the American Navy Seals, which I think were mentioned to be formed after the said Switzerland regiment. <br />
<br />
The most memorable thing I saw that these guys did was &quot;Saluting the Queen&quot; or something. In preparation for accidental or emergency plunges into freezing water, these guys would have to undress to their tighty whities and jump into a huge hole cut in the ice and then swim across to the other side. After getting out, they run into a tent and chug a goblet of Alcohol. The thing is, there is a chance that when you jump in you can go into instant shock, if you fail and have to be pulled out, your kicked out. The kicker is alchohol makes your blood thinner, which can bring on shock even after they get out. Kinda funny. Also crazy.<br />
<br />
But overall, these guys kicked ass. Definately would not mess with any guy going through that insane training program. Seriously, it was the most hardcore training camp in the WORLD. Not only do I believe they kicked the snot out of Seals but probably laughed afterwards that they were so stoned out of their minds while doing it.<br />
<br />
But me being American I still have to say we wouldn't kick your ass, we would say &quot;OMG you roxorz! You are on our team!&quot;. PFft, we are smart see.</div></div><hr />

<br />
   Part of the reason I think you might have this opinion, is that the US military has more soldiers in special ops units than Canada has active military(35,000 to 27,000).I am not bashing the Canadian military,its just that I am quite positive some units will have some members that should not be there, with large numbers like that.<br />
<br />

<br />
From what I've seen, read and heard, the problem with US specForces is simply that they try to plan everything out to the nanosecond, and then can't handle unexpected situations. <br />
On the contrary, all the mentioned SpecForces usually only make a rough draft of a plan, and are masters of improvisations. They make decisions in a split second - the RIGHT decision. At least thats how it is with the grenadiers and the GSG 9.</div></div><hr />

Oh yea, remind you: the Leopard II is a german tank. Not a swiss one. Its several years old too. Funny how an older tank can compare to a new american one. <br />
<br />
By 'Arrowshot' I assume you're referring to LKE 2 DM53 ammunition (never heard of it referred to as 'arrowshot' before), which was developed in the late 80's and the M1A2 is very resiliant against.  Yes, the M829A1 used in the M1A2 is much more effective in pretty much every senario and is considered by pretty much everyone to be the most effective anti-armor shot in the world.  In fact, it seems you have your facts a little backwards; I personally wouldn't doubt that a Leopard-II could take out an Abrahms mechanically, but killing the crew is a different story.  During the Gulf War only 18 Abrams tanks were taken out of service due to battle damage: nine were permanent losses, and another nine suffered repairable damage, mostly from mines. Not a single Abrams crewman was lost in the conflict.  The bottom of a tank is, of course, the most vulnerable area.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, both the M1A2 and Leopard-II designs are about twenty or more years old now, of course going through various modifications over the years.   <br />
<br />
<br />
Here's the stats of both so you can take a gander for yourself:<br />
<br />
M1A1 (http://www.army-technology.com/projects/abrams/) <br />
<br />
Leopard-II (http://www.army-technology.com/projects/leopard/) <br />
<br />
All of that isn't to say that the Leopard-II isn't a good tank, it is a very very nice one...but it's no M1A2.</div></div><hr />

I'm not sure of the technical designation of the projectile - but I can find that out. As for 'arrowshot', thats a pretty direct translation from the german term used in swiss military; so its not surprising that you never heard of it. I'll try to get more detailed info about it, but I know for sure that it has been tested against various tanks, including an M1A1. And the entire point of this projectile is to kill the crew, without actually damaging the tank a lot.<br />
<br />
Postponing this till I get some technical data :)<br />
<br />
@Jimmy<br />
Do you know Google? Do a search for GSG-9 there. You'll be amazed what you can find. GSG9 has done more than enough missions, and has an incredible success rate.<br />
<br />
As for your weapons:<br />
H&amp;K is Heckler &amp; Koch, an austrian company.<br />
SIG is Schweizerische Industriegesellschaft, a swiss company.<br />
EDIT: Correction, SIG Arms AG was seperated from the normal SIG a while back and renamed Swiss Arms. Still swiss, although with german investors.<br />

<br />
   Oh well, back to topic.I did the google search, and I found about 10 pretty solid missions GSG-9 did, not bad.Here is a link to chew on that lists the Navy Seal combat record.Like I stated before, too bad more isn't declassified.<br />
<br />
http://www.navyseals.com/community/navyseals/navyseals.cfm<br />
<br />
<br />
   200 combat missions between Panama and the gulf alone.Without a single loss,and that is just one branch of the US Spec Ops.When GSG-9 even approaches 100 actual missions drop me a line.<br />

You'd need numerical superiority. Considering switzerland can set up a good 1.5 to 2 million troops, thats not as easy as it sounds. Since Switzerland wont even try to hold the large northern plateaus of the country and just hold the mountain fortresses, that wont be easy. Heck, you even GETTING here wouldnt be easy. There are only a few strategic points along our border where landbased armies could enter, and these points can be well defended.

And we have enough ammo and general supplies to hold our mountain fortresses for an entire decade if need be.<br />
Add to that that we, unlike the backwater countries you have experience fighting with, have state of the art equipment. Heck, we supply you with a lot of your OWN hightech equipment. We picked up some already very excellent technology and enhanced it further.<br />

Yea you could take out Switzerland, but  I'd expect HEAVY losses on the side of your assault force. Sure more in total than on the swiss side.<br />

On another note, Fenrix made a very excellent point. The point where MANY americans only listen to their own countries propaganda. Try checking with some other sources of information for a change. You'd be surprised how different the worlds view of America is from your own. Sure, some of it is anti-american propaganda. But across hundreds of countries in the world, the info remains largely the same, and thus cant really be called propaganda anymore, since they really arent related.<br />

Funny how you americans tend to resort to cursing when you are out of arguments :)<br />
<br />
We were discussing a hypotethical situation where your all powerful America would attack a country they are NOT vastly superior to in technology, and how it would be a lot harder for you. Dont see whats so hard ot understand about that.  <br />
<br />
Any war is hard. And it doesnt always have to do with technical superiority. Ask the Germans what happened to them in Crete.<br />
The reason some are resorting to name-calling is because a lot of us don't differentiate polite and well stated stupidity (yours) to good old fashioned stupidity. It doesn't matter how many candy sprinkles you put on a turd, it's still a damned turd.<br />
You say<br />
America isnt all powerful, or the best country in the world, or the most advanced - ESPECIALLY on the social or democratic part, even though your government might want you to believe that.<br />
<br />
And yours is??<br />
Please. Get the fuck over yourself.<br />
You assume that we do not have the capability to produce high-tech armaments for ourselves, simply because we outsource a bunch of it? <br />
That is an erroneous, foolish, and just plain stupid assumption.<br />
The fact that we do not do something does not mean we are not capable of it. I do not run around at 15 miles per hour all the time. That does not mean I am not capable of running 15 miles per hour.<br />
Could America become atonomous? We sure could. It wouldn't be easy, but it is doable.<br />
That little country you call home, it is CONVENIENT for us to do trade with. Not neccesary.<br />
Think about it before you reply, becase you haven't been thinking outside of a very small, and very immediate situation.</div></div><hr />

The thing is that no one wants to discuss a hypothetical war situation between the Swiss and the US. It's just retarded. It's like discussing a hypthetical fight between Batman and Spiderman. What's the point?<br />
<br />
The reason people keep insulting you is because you're a moron. That's what we Americans do with morons. We insult them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u140"><b>vilesoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p140">OK, i quit rading after  page 3...the retard threshold of theis thread has hit the maximum capcity of my brain, and if my brain liquefies...people will have their points decimated to a burning pile of shit from tubgirl's ass.<br />
<br />
First off, OK you served, that is all cool, and as doing your duty, I'm not bitching at you. The deaths are tragic, and  doen in what you guys consider to be right. But the tragedy is that the deaths were done in an operation this dastardly.<br />
<br />
If there was any intelligence over this, the time to share it was 9 months ago.  So far I've seen no proof, therefore there is none...It's like my sentient god theory...if I have no proof, there is none.<br />
<br />
OK, first off, WE PUT SADDAM IN IRAQ.  This is not disputable, and has been public fact for some time.  He was trained in guerilla warfare as a general, and then given millions of dollars to start his own regime by assassinating his own leader.<br />
<br />
Now why ddoes this sound familiar?  Cuase we have done this to practically the entire middle east, south america, and parts of africa.  And guess what?  Every single one of them have turned into murderous assholes.<br />
<br />
So what gives anyone the idea that after some 20-30 assholes being put into power by us (and in some occaisions we even destroyed democracies over it...) that we can possibly do this one right?  If we want to do what's right, we let the ENTIRE UN into this rebuilding.  If you cry this is backing out, just STFU and learn about who attends the UN....the US is part of teh UN, so it is not backing out.  In all truth this would be the only &quot;honorable&quot; way to deal with this.  Having us rebuild this nation will only lead to another asshole in power.<br />
<br />
On the other side, we have been known to fuck over the people of a country as badly as the dictators.  The Iran-Iraq war is proof of that...WE GAVE WEAPONS TO BOTH SIDES TO MAKE IT AS LONG AS POSSIBLE.  Heaven forbid the sand people stop killing each other....<br />
<br />
Really, with the US's past of fucking with countries, I when i heard Osama's name...that just proved my theory....that all this shit would not have happened if we jsut leave the world the fuck alone.  We planted thiese assholes, and now they have come for us.  maybe this should serve as  a lesson, that we have no fucking clue on how to make a properly fucntioning nation, and two that we only know how to properly pad our gov'ts corporate interest.</div></div><hr />

We had no way of knowing he was going to become a ruthless dictator. There is no crystal ball in the Pentagon. Miss Cleo doesn't work for the government. So you're saying that since we put him in power we shouldn't do anything about it? We should have just let him continue killing his own people and perpetuating violence against the US? What about taking responsibility for what we did and righting the wrongs of the past? And by righting the wrongs of the past, I mean getting the evil dictator we put in power back out of power. But I guess responsibility is something that a pinko fuck like you wouldn't know anything about.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmm, lets see here....<br />
<br />
First off we trained him and paid him off to kill his own leader to take power...WTF fod you think he's gonna do, have a smores roast-off?  I'm sorry, but this shit could have been seen a mile away...with a very slim few, coups have never endded in having a just leader.  The history behind this goes to pre-biblical times.  Sorry, I  expected our leaders to be educated, my bad.<br />
<br />
No, I didn't say he was to perpetuate his activities, I said we need to quit taking shit into our own hands...this goes back to point 1.<br />
<br />
I would not go so far as to call anyone a pinko fuck.  See who is right and wrong is a matter of perspective.  I am willing to bet with you though, that whoever we place in there will be every bit as bad as Saddam was.  <br />
<br />
History will repeat itself, as it has for the past half century of us fucking with the governments of other nations.  my rant was not about &quot;let Saddam be&quot;, it was about &quot;we should not the sole rebuilders of ANY nation, especially considering our track record&quot;.  Rebuilding a nation is not something the invading party should do on their own, instead get the UN involved, since after all, we did use their traty with Iraq as grounds to  invade.<br />
<br />
But, i guess that's too hard for some folks to understand common sense....</div></div><hr />

Vile, my trust in the US was all but gone after reading various replys in this thread, but it came right back when I read your post.<br />
Thanks for that, I don't like disliking the US.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u146"><b>Shyntlara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p146">On that note I'd suggest everyone get some info on the current state of Afghanistan, and how much 'better' the people there have it after the USA 'helped' them. <br />
And I really recommend NOT getting that info from your own government, but some neutral source - or first hand info, if you can.<br />
<br />
The thing is that no one wants to discuss a hypothetical war situation between the Swiss and the US. It's just retarded. It's like discussing a hypthetical fight between Batman and Spiderman. What's the point? <br />
<br />
The point was that one american claimed how they could pretty much wipe out the rest of the world. I started the debate that european countries would be FAR tougher to conquer than some backwater nation, and used Switzerland as example because, being Swiss, thats the country I know most about.<br />
<br />
And I notice you are replying to the &quot;immature insults, curse words and the like&quot;.<br />
Try addressing my points. <br />
<br />
What points please? But alright, lets look at them.<br />
<br />
And yours is??<br />
<br />
No. It is not. Please tell me where I stated that.<br />
<br />
You assume that we do not have the capability to produce high-tech armaments for ourselves, simply because we outsource a bunch of it?<br />
That is an erroneous, foolish, and just plain stupid assumption.<br />
The fact that we do not do something does not mean we are not capable of it. <br />
<br />
Sadly, it isn't just an assumption. While you theoretically *could*, you have proven again and again that you can NOT. This is less a problem of actual scientific knowledge, than a mentality problem.<br />
 - Compare the hull/electronic systems etc of an american Boeing against a german Airbus. You will notice the great amount of efficiency, practicality and love for detail the germans bring to a product. You will ALSO notice that the wires of a Boeing arent properly ordered, and that its hull looks like someone smacked together some random pieces of scrapmetal.<br />
 - Check how much of your hightech equipment has failed due to bad maintenance (or total lack thereof), oversights due to plain lack of THINKING, or the good old desire to save cost.<br />
<br />
And dont tell me I dont know what I'm talking about, I work for one of the largest IT companies in the world, an american one at that. I see it every damn day.<br />
<br />
Could America become atonomous? We sure could. It wouldn't be easy, but it is doable.<br />
<br />
Oh please. You'd have to rework your ENTIRE industrial and economic environment. And trust me, due to the sometimes stoneage-like american social and economic state, Europe would have a FAR better shot at living without America than vice versa.<br />
<br />
That little country you call home, it is CONVENIENT for us to do trade with. Not neccesary.<br />
<br />
Oh, I'm sure you could find other suppliers, albeit majorly of lesser quality. However...see below.<br />
<br />
Think about it before you reply, becase you haven't been thinking outside of a very small, and very immediate situation.<br />
<br />
Quite the contrary. A single country isolating itself from the rest of the world is economic, social and political suicide. So autonomy for the states is really off the scale. My arguments arent just related to an immediate situation.  Lets take the same USA-on-CH example a bit more realistical:<br />
 - USA would attack and get kicked back by Switzerland, Germany and a bunch of other nations (yes they can do that)<br />
 - You'd have all of Europe and a lot of the rest of the world ROYALLY pissed off at you, and they'd think twice before EVER supplying you with military hardware again.<br />
<br />
While you might like the idea of the USA being all powerful, modern wars are NOT decided by sheer firepower. They havent been for a long time now.<br />
<br />
@vilesoul<br />
Thanks for your posts. It's always good to see that some americans keep their view of things a bit more realistic.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And for you again Dark... About that swiss guard in armor... <br />
During the era where that was state of the art &quot;military technology&quot; and not just ceremonial garb like it is today, swiss mercenaries were among the most skilled, most soughtafter and best mercenaries in the known world.<br />
Even earlier in history, a bunch of ragtagged swiss peasants trying to escape the romans fend off an entire roman legion before getting defeated; and the romans were unarguably the best trained and equipped military at that point in time.<br />
<br />
Us swiss were never many in numbers; we have soon learned to offset that lack of quantity with outstanding quality. And that philosophy holds true until today.</div></div><hr />

We had no way of knowing he was going to become a ruthless dictator. So when he started being one, like in the 70's, we did... what? I mean other than supply him with weapons? <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u154"><b>Opfor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p154">Well to clear up just a FEW little misconceptions...<br />
<br />
<br />
The Leopard II and the M1 are descendants of the same intial project. In the mid 70s the US and Germany (West) at the time collaborated on a tank design, the two countries eventually went their seperate ways, but the gun is the SAME for both weapon platforms.<br />
<br />
Sorry, but no tank on the planet can withstand a hit from the mainbore of either tank IF using APDUFSDS rounds. Just doesnt happen. <br />
<br />
As for &quot;arrowshot&quot; it is also known as HESH High Explosive Squash Head, basically the tip of the round is made of a soft medal, when it slams into the tank it causes objexts within the tank to &quot;bounce&quot; around at high speed killing the crew. The solution is reactive armor.<br />
<br />
As for SpecOps that &quot;have done something&quot; other than SAS, SF (-D), SeALs, Moussad, try these.<br />
<br />
SBS<br />
Rangers<br />
Foreign Legion<br />
Spestnaz<br />
Australian SAS<br />
GSG-9<br />
<br />
Frankly the list is only limited by the number of spec ops units. The reason you don't hear about them is because 1, why the fuck would they say they are conductiong operations their entire purpose is to remain annon.<br />
<br />
2. You only hear about the top 5-10% of any professions UNLESS you have some sort of personal connection.<br />
<br />
<br />
Has the US ever won a &quot;war&quot; without Europe's backing, Banna Wars early 1900's, Spanish America War, Mexican American War, numerous operations, etc etc. Now has Europe won a war without America's backing ? War is a TREMENDOUS drain on a country and modern warfare even more so, it's nearly impossible for a nation to solo a war. <br />
<br />
The US does have a significant advantage with military tech. The problem is we don't have enough for all our troops. As an example you might look up 4th Infantry Division.<br />
<br />
<br />
And finally (because, I frankly am not an economist) the most vunerable portion of ANY armored vehichle is not the bottom, its the top.</div></div><hr />

See. You don't even know what you're talking about.<br />
<br />
A lot dumbass liberal hippies will try and say that America put Saddam in power in the Iran-Iraq war as a puppet to fight against Iran. How they came up with this idea is beyond me. Chalk it up to liberal idiocy I guess. The fact is that Saddam became the ruler of Iraq years before the Iran-Iraq war ever happened and he did it with no help from the US at all. We did, however, support Iraq in the Iran-Iraq war because we felt that Iraq was the lesser of the two evils. Yes, politics is not always pretty and not always fair. Welcome to the real world, kids.<br />
<br />
The only real mistake was that America continued supplying him with weapons up until the late 80s, after he had shown signs of becoming a ruthless despot. Oh well. The US government is made up of human beings after all. And least we did something to right that mistake now.<br />
<br />
I like how you bleeding hearts are always quick to jump on Bush for his &quot;dastardly&quot; war in Iraq but always seem to forgot all the times Clinton bombed the shit out of Iraq without getting permission from Congress and without ever even going to the UN at all.

Maybe you didn't see the memo, but i dont give a shit about democrats and republicans. For me the only difference between bush and clinton are the fact that clinton was putting more effort in getting laid and bush is putting a lot effort in playing warfare, but beside that, they are both powerhungry idiots.<br />

Don't let anyone else in this world tell you how it is!&quot;.  We are taught not to hate people because of thier religion or the color of thier skin.  We are taught that all people are equally important, and suprising as it may seem, we are taught that war is bad.  We are taught the value of hard, honest, diligent work, be it going to college and getting a degree, going into the army, or working at a gas station. We are taught to compromise, and we are taught to be open minded when it comes to dealing with other people and other cultures.  How the hell else do you think so many different kinds of people from different backgrounds could all come together and live in relative peace with eachother?<br />
<br />
As to this war and other questionable wars and events in the last 30-40 years, I can definately see where some pooches have been screwed on our part.  But you need to wake up and realize that there are millions of people in this country, and not every single one supports the actions that are taking place.  You have to realize that not every single one of us thinks the same way.  Do I think I am better than a euro?  Hell no.  Do I think other countries need us or they're fucked?  Not really.  Is my country better than yours?  Who cares?  If you are happy with your way of life, good for you, I am happy with mine.  <br />
<br />
In the end, our current leaders have done alot to screw up our relations with our allies and other countries today, and that worries me.  It's leading to mass stereotyping of American values and morals.  You might have this intense bias against the US for whatever reason, but just realize that, while our ideals might be similar on paper, our chosen path to the fruition of these ideals varries drastically from person to person.  We are not all egotistical, we are not all war mongers, we are not all idiots.</div></div><hr />

I did say US didn't it ? It's not like i said all americans individual, i know a lot of americans, even in RL, and they dont have that mass ego i was talking about. I was talking about the US as in United States, the whole shit thrown together, cause most retards living over there like to brag how good and great the US is. Just look at Dark Lord John Denver, bragging he can read, but he still hasn't come to the comprehension part.

I think the real issue with the initial post is the defamatory way the coffins were portrayed.  The fact that lives were lost and trivialized is the real issue here.  Grim, you have a view, and are free to express it.  I would just ask you do it in a more constructive manner.<br />
<br />
Having served, and still serving, for 14 years I don't always agree with my orders, my missions or my commanders.  Whether you agree with US Foreign Policy or not the responsibility is everyone's.  The current American leaders were VOTED into power.  That means they can be VOTED out.<br />
<br />
Having said that and after spending an hour reading this post I feel dumber for it.  My point:  The text added to the pictures was inflammatory and disrespectful and that's my (entitled) opinion.  The rest of the thread is just machismo bullshit.  <br />

<br />
The Complete Military History of France<br />
<br />
  Gallic Wars - Lost.  In a war whose ending foreshadows the<br />
  next 2000 years of French history, France is conquered by of<br />
  all things, an Italian.<br />
<br />
  Hundred Years War - Mostly lost, saved at last by female<br />
  schizophrenic who inadvertently creates The First Rule of<br />
  French Warfare; &quot;France's armies are victorious only when<br />
  not led by a Frenchman.&quot;<br />
<br />
  Italian Wars - Lost.  France becomes the first and only<br />
  country to ever lose two wars when fighting Italians.<br />
<br />
  Wars of Religion - France goes 0-5-4 against the Huguenots.<br />
<br />
  Thirty Years War - France is technically not a participant,<br />
  but manages to get invaded anyway.  Claims a tie on the<br />
  basis that eventually the other participants started<br />
  ignoring her.<br />
<br />
  War of Devolution - Tied.  Frenchmen take to wearing red<br />
  flowerpots as chapeaux.<br />
<br />
  The Dutch War - Tied.<br />
<br />
  War of the Augsburg League/King William's War/French and<br />
  Indian War - Lost, but claimed as a tie.  Three ties in a<br />
  row induces deluded Frogophiles the world over to label the<br />
  period as the height of French military power.<br />
<br />
  War of the Spanish Succession - Lost.  The War also gave the<br />
  French their first taste of a Marlborough, which they have<br />
  loved every since.<br />
<br />
  American Revolution - In a move that will become quite<br />
  familiar to future Americans, France claims a win even<br />
  though the English colonists saw far more action.  This is<br />
  later known as &quot;de Gaulle Syndrome&quot;, and leads to the Second<br />
  Rule of French Warfare; &quot;France only wins when America does<br />
  most of the fighting.&quot;<br />
<br />
  French Revolution - Won, primarily due the fact that the<br />
  opponent was also French.<br />
<br />
  The Napoleonic Wars - Lost.  Temporary victories (remember<br />
  the First Rule!) due to leadership of a Corsican, who ended<br />
  up being no match for a British footwear designer.<br />
<br />
  The Franco-Prussian War - Lost.  Germany first plays the<br />
  role of drunk Frat boy to France's ugly girl home alone on a<br />
  Saturday night.<br />
<br />
  World War I - Tied and on the way to losing, France is saved<br />
  by the United States.  Thousands of French women find out<br />
  what it's like to not only sleep with a winner, but one who<br />
  doesn't call her &quot;Fraulein.&quot;  Sadly, widespread use of<br />
  condoms by American forces forestalls any improvement in the<br />
  French bloodline.<br />
<br />
  World War II - Lost.  Conquered French liberated by the<br />
  United States and Britain just as they finish learning the<br />
  Horst Wessel Song.<br />
<br />
  War in Indochina - Lost.  French forces plead sickness, take<br />
  to bed with the Dien Bien Flu.<br />
<br />
  Algerian Rebellion - Lost.  Loss marks the first defeat of a<br />
  western army by a Non-Turkic Muslim force since the<br />
  Crusades, and produces the First Rule of Muslim Warfare;<br />
  &quot;We can always beat the French.&quot;  This rule is identical to<br />
  the First Rules of the Italians, Russians, Germans, English,<br />
  Dutch, Spanish, Vietnamese and Esquimaux.</div></div><hr />

I (assuming you me myself not the US as a whole) choose 1 person to represent me. I didn't vote for the congressmen from this state, sorry. <br />

Well first Afganistan, funny I don't hear anyone whining that we shouldn't have done it. In fact we seem to be getting quite a bit of good feedback from that action. But then again maybe thats just the biased American press clouding my obviously deficient mental capacities with lies being spread by the military-industrial complex, so that I will be willing to subject other nations. But who knows.<br />
<br />
Iraq, I hear alot of we shouldn't have invaded, we had no right, it was politically motivated etc etc. Guess what genius war is ALWAYS politically motivated. Almost by definition no one has the right to invade another nation, thats what makes it so bad... You are following me here right? Whether we should have invaded or not is no longer the question. The moment the US set one troop in Iraq it made a commitment to help rebuild that nation, to a self supporting entitiy. Now AFTER the US leaves if the people of Iraq vote to put in a dictator for life, that is their choice and they are welcome to do so. Untill such time however the US is morally and ethically obligated to do whatever it takes to help rebuild that nation. Now if you cannot understand that simple concept then, then don't bother replying because it would be a waste of my time.</div></div><hr />

See, now you are confusing things.  Take a poll in all those euro countries where US foreign policy (Iraq in particular) is not favored.  The people in those countries are not going to go so far to say that they &quot;dislike/hate Americans&quot;, they are going to say they &quot;dislike the current US administration's foreign policy&quot;.

Why don't you tell me exactly when and how the US put Saddam in power and exactly what murderous acts Saddam performed before being put into power by the US. Just so we're clear.  <br />
<br />
1979: Seizes power with U.S. approval; moves allegiance from Soviets to U.S. in Cold War. <br />
<br />
1980: Invades Iran, then the &quot;Unicycle of Evil,&quot; with U.S. encouragement and arms. (In fairness, credit here goes to Nobel Peace Laureate, James Carter.) <br />
<br />
1982: Bush-Reagan regime removes Saddam's regime from official U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism. <br />
<br />
1983: Saddam hosts Donald Rumsfeld in Baghdad. Agrees to &quot;go steady&quot; with U.S. corporate suppliers. <br />
<br />
1984: U.S. Commerce Department issues license for export of aflatoxin to Iraq useable in biological weapons. <br />
<br />
1988: Gasses Kurds in Halabja, Iraq. <br />
<br />
1987-88: U.S. warships destroy Iranian oil platforms in Gulf and break Iranian blockade of Iraq shipping lanes, tipping war advantage back to Saddam. <br />
<br />
1990: Invades Kuwait with U.S. permission.<br />
<br />
Oh wait? U.S. permission? Yeah... <br />
<br />
On July 25, 1990, the dashing dictator met in Baghdad with U.S. Ambassador April Glaspie. When Saddam asked Glaspie if the U.S. would object to an attack on Kuwait over the small emirate's theft of Iraqi oil, the ambassador told him, &quot;We have no opinion.... Secretary [of State James] Baker has directed me to emphasize the instruction ... that Kuwait is not associated with America.&quot; Saddam taped her. <br />
<br />
Glaspie, in her 1991 Congressional testimony, did not deny the authenticity of the recording, which diplomats worldwide took as a Bush Sr's okay to an Iraqi invasion. <br />
<br />
Oh dis!</div></div><hr />

Can you give me some links on this?  Everything I've read indicates in 1979 he just, well seized power.  The way you state it makes it sound like he asked the US and they said GO AHEAD!  <br />
<br />
I don't deny any of the 80's era actions you claim, but by then he was already in power, and we were using Iraq covertly against Iran at that point so I fail to see how these actions by the US &quot;put him in power&quot; when he was already in power....<br />
<br />
And Grim, since when does &quot;We have no opinion...&quot;<br />
equate to &quot;invade the rag heads we support and approve this!&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u186"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p186">What Grim refers to as U.S permission I always saw as a bait and switch.<br />

Here is a Dictator we tolerated and did business with to help balance against the pro Soviet Shah.  We realize we don't want him around anymore and need a way to get rid of him where we look good.  So the next time  he says he wants to to fly off on an ego trip on some unsuspecting country, we say &quot;um, sure do whatever your gonna do man, like we care&quot;.

Ask someone from airport checkins who the most annoying passengers are, just going from the continents of North America and Europe. And please, dont ask one from an AMERICAN airport.<br />
Ask european business people why they prefer doing business with european companies instead of american.<br />
<br />
Or ask why the hell the american soldiers doing a training in switzerland didnt get the officers instructions in thrice the time our soldiers needed, and we needed to switch to firstgrade level teaching just to get the name of the damn pass into their heads.<br />

Thats what people say who don't have a fucking clue what they are talking about. <br />
<br />
<br />
And to &quot;defend yourself&quot; you resort to insults and exagerations.<br />
<br />
No, you're not stereo typing, insulting, or exagerating anything are you.  Hmm I bet the Swiss don't do this kind of thing in a flame war, or at least not alot of them.  Its just an American tactic, I see....<br />
<br />
You dont know jack about the countries outside of your borders, just like many other americans.  <br />
I don't?  You don't know me dipshit so don't pretend to.  Oh yeah I guess Swiss like you know alot about every country in the world!  I mean its mandatory to take &quot;Useless Facts About French New Guinea 101&quot; in Swiss college eh?  Right.  <br />
<br />
Either way, since when did knowing things about foreign places make a person smart?  Since when did not knowing things about certain places become an insult?  Its funny, yeah I don't know jack shit about African countries, but I could read a book and find out and not have to memorize every goddamn fact and or political issue going on there to have a clue.<br />
Its called freedom of choice.  I do whats interesting for me, not what you tell me to do.  You probably call this self-centric and egotistical, but then again I'm sure you can't tell me half the shit thats going on in the world outside of Iraq, Europe and the US.<br />
<br />
You don't get it. I don't hate americans. <br />
No, you just &quot;dislike them&quot;...<br />
<br />
And tell me, if all these little incidents with the dog-in-microwave, hot coffee spilled or the thing with the burglar suing the owner of the house he broke into because he fell through the wintergarden roof...

What you don't get is that there are stupid people from all walks of life, from all countries of the world.  Same with idiots, assholes etc.  You're rediculous if you think otherwise.  Idioicy is something of human nature, not racial or national in nature.  Ho hum wake up moron.  There's always stupid shit in the news because *DING DING* theres a lot of people on this planet!  <br />
<br />
Yea I don't live there. But if at all, that makes my opinion more valid, because I'm not one of the people this is all about for sure. <br />
Keep on coming up with rationalizations idiot.  It doesnt make you any more valid.  <br />
<br />
Ask someone from airport checkins who the most annoying passengers are, just going from the continents of North America and Europe. And please, dont ask one from an AMERICAN airport.<br />
<br />
They'll say all passengers are equally annoying you dumb cunt...<br />
<br />
<br />
Ask european business people why they prefer doing business with european companies instead of american.<br />
 <br />
What, are they going to say &quot;because americans are idiots, lazy, and annoying&quot;?  Or are they going to say something reasonable like its less profitable from a tax perspective or some EU perspective for our business?  Either way, you arent some super representative from all Euro business, so this is a pretty unfounded claim.<br />
<br />
Or ask why the hell the american soldiers doing a training in switzerland didnt get the officers instructions in thrice the time our soldiers needed, and we needed to switch to firstgrade level teaching just to get the name of the damn pass into their heads. <br />
Can you tell me the directions to Flagstaff, Arizona from Denver, CO?  I want to take a scenic route to so make sure you plan a route near the grand canyon.  Oh wait, you don't live in the US and don't know shit about where these places are?  Thought so...</div></div><hr />

Can you give me some links on this?  Everything I've read indicates in 1979 he just, well seized power.  The way you state it makes it sound like he asked the US and they said GO AHEAD!  <br />
<br />
<br />
He just, well seized power. Sure the CIA was there, and met with him, and approved of him, but I'm sure they didn't interfere. That would violate the prime directive!<br />
<br />
First google hit. /shrug<br />
http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/51/217.html<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't deny any of the 80's era actions you claim, but by then he was already in power, and we were using Iraq covertly against Iran at that point so I fail to see how these actions by the US &quot;put him in power&quot; when he was already in power....<br />
<br />
Then why keep helping him? Oh yeah.. it was convienent. Who cares if some guy kills some brown people somewhere. <br />
<br />
<br />
And Grim, since when does &quot;We have no opinion...&quot;<br />
equate to &quot;invade the rag heads we support and approve this!&quot;<br />
Its nice how you can imply something from some obscure quote, but you're really just reaching.  <br />
<br />
WTF ever man. That's beyond being dumb... If you asked a cop if it was ok to assault someone and they had &quot;no opinion&quot;? They EMPHASIZE that the person you're going to assault is in no way associated with the cop? WTF else could that mean? Please tell me.<br />
<br />
And then of course as soon as it happens we have to SAVE FREEDOM! Time for war! Yeah.. the gulf war strongly stated how we have &quot;no opinion&quot;. Reaching you say... :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

I was asking this not in a stand-offish manner so all you needed to do was post a link.  Anyhow, the article says a CIA led coup led to the Baath's party rise to power in '63.  The party, not the man.  Saddam siezed power from the party in '79.  So how exactly is this US approval of one Saddam Hussein coming to power, especially considering the fact that the US had had no relation with iraq in the years that Hussein was coming to power in the Baath party?<br />
<br />
Then why keep helping him? Oh yeah.. it was convienent. Who cares if some guy kills some brown people somewhere.  <br />
Cold War implications, yeah it was convenient.  They kept helping him untill he stopped meeting thier needs.  Didn't hear many people whining back then.<br />
<br />

Been reading too many conspiracy theory sites man...<br />
Here's the entire quote by the way...<br />
<br />
I was in the American Embassy in Kuwait during the late 60's. The instruction we had during this period was that we should express no opinion on this issue and that the issue is not associated with America. James Baker has directed our official spokesmen to emphasize this instruction. We hope you can solve this problem using any suitable methods via Klibi or via President Mubarak.  <br />
<br />
Hmmm leaving out that last line can lead to a whole different meaning huh.  Yeah, I'd still say you're reaching.<br />

No, but europeans tend to be a lot better informed than americans about the world on average. Heck, just look how many people confuse Switzerland with Sweden; both only have the two first letters in their name identical. Or damnit, on a freaking CNN newsfeed you could see a map of central europe with the country names everywhere but where they belong. In a damn CNN NEWSFEED! Not just a little confused, but just totally wrong. <br />

Oh, we have morons like that too. But unlike the US, they dont WIN the lawsuit over here, and get nothing but a good laugh.<br />
<br />
They'll say all passengers are equally annoying you dumb cunt... <br />
<br />
Who's working in airline business here, me or you? British people for example are very pleasant most of the time. Hey, they even politely ask you if you speak english at all, while the average american passenger just snaps something at you, cutting off half the syllables and then gets all furious because you didnt understand him perfectly clear.<br />

1.  It was a freaking pass name. A DAMN SINGLE GEOGRAPHICAL NAME.  And it took ages for them just so they'd remember THAT.<br />
<br />
2. It wasnt just related to geography, trust me. They very simply being utterly stupid, or at least most of them.<br />

Many peeps I know that have been to Europe and they feel Europeans give Americans the same attitude that you say about us, especially the French. It goes both ways. You are talking about either rich businessmen or rich vacationers. What you have seen from Americans does not represent the &quot;average Joe&quot;. Your views about Americans doesn't represent 1% of the population. You have no idea what you're talking about you dumb assmunch. You're so ignorant it's almost funny.</div></div><hr />

If you read the whole thing instead of just trying to make the point, you'd understand what is being said. <br />
<br />
Look at it from Bush's standpoint: either a) we do nothing and saddam is in our debt for allowing him to kick kuwaiti ass, or b) what happened - win a war, try to save your ass at election time, get mad money from the saudi's and Kuwait, etc. <br />
<br />
I don't have to make this stuff up - bush is all too eager to fuck shit up on his own. Example - $30 BILLION to make nukes. Fucking worthless never ever ever gonna be used nukes. $30 billion.</div></div><hr />

They aren't worthless, they are probably the best deterrent against foreign attack we could possibly come up with. However, i do pray that we never use one. I've done my research on the things, and they're disgusting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u203"><b>Mutton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p203">Call me an optimist, but I re-read that article and did not get any such indication.  Most of that article was Saddam whining about how much SOE sux, err how much his people have suffered since the conclusion at the Iran-Iraq war and how the US was now trying to paint him as a douche bag.  You know, all of that could entirely be true and probably is true, but I saw none of this bait and switch stuff you are infering.  At the point that article was written, it appeared that there were already rifts and that the US was aligning itself with those who would benefit them more i.e. kuwaiit...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yep....real good deterrent hey?:rolleyes: <br />
<br />
I'd be brazen enough to suggest that maybe a BETTER deterrent is fixing the US foreign policy from the shit-stained mess it currently is and MAYBE years down the line the rest of the world may change their views of the US.<br />

<br />
EDIT: Let me rephrase that. M.A.D. is horrific and terrifying, but it does serve to scare countries away from nuclear warfare.<br />

Its a sad testament to human affairs, but if &quot;they&quot; have the bomb, one of few ways to prevent its use is if you have the bomb too.</div></div><hr />
