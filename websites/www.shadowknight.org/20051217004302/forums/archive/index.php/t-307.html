<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">taerun</div><div class="date">04-01-2002, 12:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have noticed a strange spell message in my chat window that I have never seen before. I hope this is the correct spelling:<br />
<br />
Your target resisted the BladeDanceSK spell<br />
<br />
Your BladeDanceSK spell has worn off<br />
<br />
Any idea what this is? At first I thought this is in connection with the epic but that proc has it's own message.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taedirk</div><div class="date">04-01-2002, 12:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Were you grouped with a bard?  If I remember correctly, one of their SoL spells gives all group members a proc called Blade Dance, which is a dex debuff proc.  That might be why, but the BladeDanceSK has me stumped...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dzenith</div><div class="date">04-01-2002, 12:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ya, it's a bard song proc tap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brael</div><div class="date">04-01-2002, 12:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">sk version of the bard proc, not sure on the difference between the sk and non sk ones... all i can think of is ours is specially coded because of soul abrasion (to either work better or work the same as othes)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">taerun</div><div class="date">04-01-2002, 12:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok that answers it then. Yes, I was grouped with a Bard when this happened. I was just confused by the SK part in the spell message.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the tips :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">trun</div><div class="date">04-01-2002, 01:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Proccing spells are modified for sks I think because of our proc buffs. Some ench cast trickster's aug on me once and it was proccing ??trickstersSK. I checked spdat and I think the damage value was the same as the normal version, so I guess it's for stacking reasons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xilith</div><div class="date">04-01-2002, 01:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If memory serves, Boon of the Garou works differently for us as well, and we all know Vamp Embrace is coded with 2 different effects.<br />
<br />
Evidently both the SK and normal versions of BladeDance tap 25 Dex, and Boon taps 5-35.  Maybe this is a necessity because of how they changed Vamp Embrace to work differently, and now all proc spells require an SK and normal version?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krazaak</div><div class="date">04-01-2002, 01:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Originally, there were two versions of the Vampiric Embrace proc to handle our lower power version.  For some reason, due to the coding of that one, all the new lifetap proc buffs they've added have two identical proc effects, one for SKs and one for everybody else.<br />
