<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Duke Vendric Ravenkrest</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 09:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Before you run out to pull get these spells on ya: RuneV, Bedlam, Celestial Elixer. Don't always need all three but in some places it's just a good habit. Besides, you'll be making enough PP to cover the peridot cost of Rune easily.<br />
<br />
Other than that it's mainly just pathing tricks and such. Run 3 helps tons, heh.<br />
<br />
My favorite place to PBAE is Seb Disco 1 &amp; 2. A good PBAE group can clear from zone out to all of disco before respawns, named included. Surviving the run back to the group and keeping the chanter alive through mobs who resist stun (common for Disco 2 mobs) are the only hard parts...well, that and grabbing enough mobs to please your group.<br />
<br />
Generally what I'll do is start the PBAE from zone in. I get those three spells and run all the way into zone out then run back, sitting down once next to any mob that didn't already aggro. PBAE them then move to in front of zone out and med up. On this pull, drag corners whenever you can to slow down your persuers, helps a ton with the three golems pounding you.<br />
<br />
Next pull I grab everything in disco hall between the entrance to disco (the scarabs) and zone out. On this pull just jump a lot if you have to, it really isn't that many mobs though. I usually leave the scarabs / golem in front of disco for now.<br />
<br />
Next I move the group to the end of disco hall right at that ledge. This is the fun pull, hehe. Make sure you have RuneV at the very least. And, you might not make it back, it all depends how well you work the pathing bugs. But, run through the opening to disco, through the door, take a right, down the stairs, take a right, sit down between those frogs, through the door to frenzy, sit down in that room, back out to the disco floor itself, sit down on it, over to the room on the other side, sit down in it, back out and then cross BACK towards the frenzy room side of disco, then back to the side you just came from through that hallway in the middle of the two, up the stairs and out the door, make sure to grab the entrance mobs and then back to your group. Heh... if you can do that you'll get around 23 to 25 mobs depending on what disco 2 roamers were at the D1 end of their path. Grats, you just pulled all of disco one in one shot. If you did it right pathing should have kept you in pretty good health, mostly.<br />
<br />
Now move the group into Frenzy room to med up, etc. Next pull is a $&amp;#@)*!! Run through the D2 door at the disco floor, into necro room on right and sit/stand and run out across the hall to the library and haul ass towards brogg, grab everything in brogg's room, haul ass back out, detour into the side room on the way, then get all the library mobs and back to your group. This, needless to say, will hurt very much, heh.<br />
<br />
Final pull, move everyone into necro room and grab the back to rooms of D2, where the commander etc spawn, lots of unstunnables, or nearly unstunnables....<br />
<br />
<br />
Basically, if you see that running one way lags the mob behind you, use that to your advantage. While he's trying to figure out how to get to you, you're putting distance on him and not being eaten alive. This is especially important when you've got 20+ beasts tearing at your backside, even more important when that list includes brogg, 4 or 5 krupps, and a possible illis or two haha.<br />
<br />
Other than that, strafe run whenever needed, drag corners (much like corner splitting with FD pulls on raids) and, well, just run fast as you can. Sit to get aggro on low level mobs (hard to pull more than one mob at level 60 in seb, especially when you're so used to pulling singles that it's second nature). Um, that's basically it. Pull as much as you can without dying on the pull, have the cleric start casting CH as soon as you're in range (if you pull right you'll need it, lol) and make sure you have one hell of a chanter...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Garila</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 02:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This may just be a totally idiotic idea but I think I heard it somewhere . . . if you can be invis and run fairly deep (or eye of zomm) target a mob come back to your raid party and summon up a low pet, invis the pet, and /pet attack you will get a bit of a train.  Other tricks are to have a lowbie fear something back into the dungeon usually resulting in a train . . . . hop over to monkly-business.com and check their message boards for ways to get insane trains . . . . see some nasty threads with 50+ mob train pics in them all the time over there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Duke Vendric Ravenkrest</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 04:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Last I checked couldn't invis a pet. Also the pet has to be in attack range of the mob to run after it. Besides, most places worth PBAE pulling ya can't run around in invis. /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Exex Steelrose</div><div class="date">04-10-2002, 06:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A fun trick is to have one of the wizards with decession send you to the zone in then run back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Okami</div><div class="date">04-10-2002, 10:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">what Ive liked to do was invis, run to one point, then break it and run back to the group.<br />
Also, if near see invis mobs, what if you were to run any and everywhere picking up mobs, then CoH back to the group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wavern</div><div class="date">04-11-2002, 12:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Coh clears aggro. =v\<br />
<br />
Best train I made in seb was to cast invoke fear on a messed frog at necrosis camp. Then bash it and send it on it's way. It ran down to the jail area to the shrooms. Everything it passed on the way back warped on top of me.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately for us, this wasn't an AE group. =v)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mynegon</div><div class="date">04-11-2002, 01:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have found one AE pet trick.   Pulling a bunch of mobs who are too low to agro, for faction, bone chips, etc, can be tough.  Even if you sit in the middle of them you'll only get a few.  But if you cast a level 9 pet, he'll agro everything in range.   I've used this to great effect in the Warrens.<br />
<br />
I keep thinking there might be some way to use the feature in exp-AE, but I haven't figured one out.</div></div><hr />
