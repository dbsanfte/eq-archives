<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ezele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As you have already heard, I have had a bug in the SK epic and so have about 6 other people.  all of us have dinged 70 in the course of the quest and this is a n educated guess by me and several others that if you do indeed ding 70 you will not be able to turn in Wailing Sister Blood and Wailing Rune.  THe new flag system probally scans for the class.  And before everyone was a Dread Lord...now at lvl 70 we become Scourge Knights and it read as a different class.  <br />
Even though it seemed insignificant before I am quite sure this is the problem, a small glitch in the flagging system and probally easily corrected.<br />
<br />
HOWEVER....To get to the point....IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE BUGGED DO NOT DING 70!!! It seems a stupid cause but that seems to be the sure cut case here. Please take this warning seriously.<br />
<br />
Thanks to all the people who have contacted me in this  endless pursuit of an asnwer to this bug you know who you are.  And TY Brenlo for finding us and reporting it to SOE.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Honorhawk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">im 69 mano ;/  and its broken</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kendril D</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">im 66 and ill know soon if its broke for me too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>ezele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">damn, well i was pretty sure about that...but even at that maybe its something related to that because im sure it has to do with either a class / flag problem,  only similiar thing i noticed inmost characters was the fact that most of us had just dinged 70.   But yes i did delevel to 69 and try and it didnt work but i know that wouldnt work cuz the change was already made...but oh well at least we have SOE workin on it and a sort of guess to what it might be....my apologies for this.  <br />
<br />
Seemed REALLY right when I dinged 70 on the Wailing Sister fight and it became bugged and another person had the same exact thing happen to him.<br />
