<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarkPetal</div><div class="date">04-01-2002, 10:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd like to get an idea of the sizes of the various guilds on the servers.  An approximation of the number of active characters or number of characters you would expect for a raid.  A single player playing more than 1 character is common now, so post the number of characters rather than the number of people playing.<br />
<br />
Also, what you would describe as your best achievement in terms of your numbers vs the mob.  It doesn't have to be a particularly tough mob, just a mob that you killed with less than what would be thought to be the &quot;norm&quot;.<br />
<br />
Edit: Oops, better start it off :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
We have around 30-35 active players (80-90% L60).  Our best achievement I would say was Zlan with 24 people.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tribunal of Norrath on Saryrn are approx 90 strong. Our highest playing member is 57, tho i think majority of the guild is 50-54.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dzenith</div><div class="date">04-01-2002, 11:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My point is that the actual size of a guild has little to do with the targets it can take out, so if you wanted an accurate display of a guild's size vs target you would have to consider the guild's ave level as well.  Ave total members online at peak raid hours would show more than total membership as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Duke Vendric Ravenkrest</div><div class="date">04-01-2002, 12:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Size means nothing as to what a guild can or can't do or how they do it. Really, it doesn't. You can't say guildX is better than guildY becouse they have 200 members.<br />
<br />
Ancient Council on Saryrn has around 160 active members. But, we see maybe 30 or 40 online at a given time, if we're lucky, usually. Well over half of our guild is casual players with a core of about 20 powergamers and 30 or 40 more every-other-day players. Most of our members have families and don't dedicate 6 hours nightly to EQ. Heck, most of them don't even log in nightly, or daily, or whatever. We can go 3 or 4 days and only see 20 people on then all of a sudden, 60 will show up to a raid. It's pot-luck. Most of our raids average 35 to 50 people depending on the weekday and time of day/night and general luck.<br />
<br />
As for accomplishments. We've done Cazic Thule with 48 people. We've done all of west wing temple of veeshan. Our first WToV named was Gozzrem. We had no DB casters in the guild and the night we finally won against him we had 38 people on the raid most of them under level 60 (12 were level 60 including me). The fight took 16 minutes (hahahaha, how gay). We've also done monk epic with 1 group all the way through, as well as Feydedar for druid epic with 12 people, woushi with 18, koralek dar with 5 people, lodizal with 3, Zlandicar with 23, doljo with 10, velkator with 28 and one GB caster, PoF DT golems with 13 and only one cleric, PoH mini's with one group even Maestro, Innoruuk with 18. Sometimes it's harder to get lower numbers. Zlandicar or something like him spawns and we can usually get 36+ people and usually do.<br />
<br />
Rather than guild size I think it's more of a &quot;who do we have&quot; kind of thing. Is it the hardcore, know-it-all players showing up or is it the casual players who aren't as skilled? Is it all level 60's or is half your raid level 50 to 53? Who you have determines what numbers you need, not vice versa, and that determines how many people it takes you to kill a mob. It also dictates what strategies you use. Is it to be a duration battle or a DPS battle, for example. Through all of the server competition we finally, FINALLY found Lendiniara the Keeper alive this past weekend and for our first ever attempt, 0 deaths and she died in 7 minutes. Not bad I'd say. Especially considering that for once, our Kael aligned guild beat 3 other dragon aligned guilds to her who can walk right up to her without issue.<br />
<br />
Accomplishments are marked by your guild and your guild alone. It's nice to know people are killing things outside of your guild and when they do it (if you need to keep track of death/spawn times) but other than that just worry about yourself and your guild. You'll be much better off for it in the long run.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flanders</div><div class="date">04-01-2002, 12:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">IMO Focusing on Guild size will always come back to haunt you later.  Focus first on levels, dedication, and most of all maturity and respect for others......Far too many times I've seen a guild breakup becuase someone died in a guild raid or couldnt get a group with other guildies and went off on some sensless rampage, and before you know it everyone is arguing and all but 3 of em leave (I know, I know, major run-on sentence).  You have to spot these people before they get invited.  <br />
<br />
Of course this prolly has nothing to do with what you meant and your guild is super nice, and im the one off on a sensless rampage.  bah! ill shut up now</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vorth</div><div class="date">04-01-2002, 01:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Myself and a good friend from the Rathe spent several months planning on the guild we wanted to form.  Our goal was to build a small guild that could do alot. Our final decision was 24-30 members max.  Limits on the number of each class. (a guild doesn't need 25+ druids, which my previous guild had at 1 time).  We mainly look for hard core players.  People with depenable play times, with skills to play their class, and realize that as the guild progresses they shall progress.  Right now we have about 18 members. We can't boast that we have killed any extrodinary npcs.  We are concentrating on improving everyone's equipment, and practicing tactics that we will need when we do try the bigger npcs. We range in lvl 55-60 with one lvl 53 druid.  We are working hard to level everyone up into the 58+ range. Hopefully we will soon be testing ourselves against some of the harder npcs in the game.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sloughfegg</div><div class="date">04-01-2002, 02:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The guild I'm with on the Quellious server is great. We're not an uber guild and don't want to be. we're not raid orientated, but we do our share.  I believe there are roughly 75 members in total, with about 15-20 on hiatus for DoaC or RL.  The one thing is when we put ourselves to a goal everyone in the guild is focused on that.  Most of the guild is low-mid 50's players with a few 60's ..  We took out dread and terror with 20 people. Last week it was the Servitor (with help from another mid guild like ours).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ainya</div><div class="date">04-01-2002, 07:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hmmm nice thread to show your pride :)  I would say our proudest achievement as a guild would be a fear raid abt a month ago.  We had 24 people, 90% 52+ a few 60's and a couple others just along for the ride that finally got 47.    cleared almost all of fear, killed all 3 golems (got my soul leech) and the broken one for wizzy thingy, until we finally wiped to that bee-yatch Draco.  Was  a blast!! )</div></div><hr />
