<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dikmer</div><div class="date">10-23-2002, 10:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why is it not possible for a gnome SK to be an original character?<br />
<br />
I think you people are stupidly biased and opinionated.<br />
<br />
For example, me and my wife. We /movelogged to Antonious Bayle from Xegony. She has a 50th level Dark Elf SK (Jeezlueez) that went. <br />
<br />
When we decided to move back to Xegony, it was gonna cost us 50$ to move our characters. I moved my 60 cleric, she applied to move Jeezlueez. There was some dumb thing that went wrong with her move, and rather than wait another 5 or 6 weeks for them to fix it and move Jeezlueez, she started playing Kensha. Kensha was a little gnome SK she started for fun.<br />
<br />
Kensha has grown up and is now level 55, and more than 2x the level of any of my wife's other characters on Xegony. Every piece of armor and every weapon Kensha has, my wife got her. She has earned her place, her level, her name, everything. Kensha is by no means a twink.<br />
<br />
To see, in many threads, where you peoople say gnome = twink, well, it's stupid and close minded. Get over your badass selves and recognize that gnomes can be just as good as any other race as a SK.</div></div><hr />

So it's now become a generalisation, same as the blondes and intelligence. So just ignore it. Also people like to pick on gnome because of their size/look whatever. I personaly find Gnome SK combo rather funny, same as a halfling warrior. Sure some peole want to roleplay and stuff, so my laughter is RP as well.</div></div><hr />

Ugh gnome SKs have got to be one of the stupidest ideas VI has ever had(and that is saying a lot)  <br />
<br />
Gnome paladins and SKs were in during beta.<br />
Gnomes are a Neutral race. Neutral races can be paladins/SKs.<br />
Humans are a Neutral race. Humans can be paladins/SKs.<br />
Dwarves are a good race. Dwarves can be paladins.<br />
Dark Elves are an evil race. Dark Elves can be SKs.<br />
<br />
I'm sick of people saying &quot;that's a stupid combination.&quot; Iksar monks are a lot dumber than gnome SKs.  A singing cat?  An ogre smart enough to use necromancy? A large, beefy barbarian skulking around in the shadows? Please.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I went through all the hell levels, when there was a class penalty, and when you had to beg/pay for a bind and after doing 2 and 3 hour corpse runs because there was no 'taxi' chat channel and i risked levelling without a bind.<br />
<br />
Then you've got people who have level 60 beastlords and even gnome SKnights. twinked or no... think it just a sort of 'permatwinked'. Gnome SKs just didn't have to go through a lot of the shit that some other people did, ie, they have soulbinders, nexus, bazaar, and way more expansions of loot.<br />
<br />
No gnome SKnight is saving up 3 weeks of hunting platinum to buy a weapon that SUCKS... I spent 1.5k on Lamentation Blade at level 25...<br />
<br />
Skill: 2HS   Atk Delay: 54<br />
DMG: 25   WT: 8.5   Dmg/Sec: 9.44<br />
STR+5  STA+4  <br />
<br />
1st off, I was envied by my peers - that was an insanely good weapon at the time (for my level)<br />
<br />
2ndly, that was a SHIT LOAD of &quot;Split Paw Hide Gloves&quot; that i had to camp or buy low and sell high. Like weeks.<br />
<br />
Does it start to rationalize for you? <br />
<br />
The race thing is a matter of taste, the gnome stats are pretty nice compared to other races. I just think gnomes look laughable (that fits my 'ass clown' personality, apparently) and its a farce that some little midget could ever be as powerful as someone with bigger muscles and a more efficient physique...<br />
<br />
bottomline, <br />
you should be on my front lawn holding a little lantern<br />
<br />
<br />
ps / it's an RPG? hence, other people play characters who might not like gnomes as a part of their personality? like, i'm pretty sure if a *real* gnome walked into my office i wouldn't tell him how far I estimate I could punt him, or how he must shop at baby gap or something. get a fucking grip, play your character and be the bestest widdow gnomie you can be!</div></div><hr />

I am sure that if people know your wife and see her playing they will revise their opinion, if not, then it's their loss anyway.<br />
 Is it a new trend that gnomes come here whining because their life is so tough and the big boys tease them and steal their lunch? I recall seeing it a few times lately, or maybe that's just me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaotix</div><div class="date">10-24-2002, 12:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I posted at my guild msg board that if anyone dared to make a gnome sk, I would train them till I was banned. (would I really? of course not)<br />
One of my step kids made a gnome sk named Minikao - I told him to delete it.  (did I really enforce it? yes)<br />
Would I turn a gnome sk (or warrior or halfing warrior or etc...) away from my group or raid based on their choice in a puny race?  nope.<br />
Half the fun of picking on gnomes is because they are such easy targets - like the game of gnomeball someone posted here :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Waaaaaaay back when (when dinosaurs roamed Norrath, and people had to sit for hours on end in Gfay to sell some equip), a GM came there to Kelethin at about 3 in the morning... Was bored as all hell, and turned himself into a gnome (was an iksar monk GM).<br />
<br />
My favorite part was when some guy was trying to talk to an NPC, didn't hit Enter I'm assuming... because he punched the guy, trained all the guards as he made a mad dash around Kelethin and the GM just said out loud &quot;LOL&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Last night while I was waiting for the portal in GD because I am much too p0 to get a TL, a gnome SK struck up a conversation with me (he was waiting also) about how my guild sucked and I didn't deserve my gear and he 0wnZed me, etc etc.  He was 58, and asked me to duel - I asked him if he wanted to do it there or somewhere without mobs, and he said to hold on while he ran his cleric and shaman there to help him during the duel~</div></div><hr />

People don't want to waste time on a character with &quot;bad&quot; stats, so they twink them out.  <br />
<br />
My main is a Gnome Rogue, and I'd say close to 99% of the other gnome rogues on my server are twinks, a couple I know started as twinks, then later became mains.  <br />

There are tons of examples of cute little evil and scary as hell things in horror fiction: Ghoulies, the little jungle guys from Mummy 2, Puppetmaster, (and if you are old enough or watch enough horror flicks to remember) the little guy from the third part opf Vincent Price's Trilogy of Terror. The list goes on and on.<br />
<br />
What is comparable to Iskar in horror fiction? The Sleestacks from the old Land of the Lost kids show? Ooooooo, I am shaking in my widdle shoes.<br />

I don't think you can find any equivalent of Dark Elves, unless of course you resort to relying on Anime trash.  Well dressed blue dudes that regullarly get thier asses whupped by a bunch of pubescent girls in sailor outfits really make my heart flutter in fright.<br />
<br />
: Laughs in derision.<br />
<br />
The real reason all those jerks bash on gnomes is because getting thier asses spanked by a superior race only a third thier size makes them question thier manhood (which of course is already damaged from thier lack of endowments and poor sex lives.)<br />
<br />
As a Gnomette Sk who mangaed to make it to Lvl 20 in 8 hours of play wielding only her newbie armor and a crackewd staff, I can assure you that far feewer Gnome Sks are twinks than the majority of dip-wads here seem to think.</div></div><hr />

Someone who tells us to think of gnome SK's as &quot;Chucky&quot; and then rips on Anime films?<br />
<br />
I am not a fan of Anime at all. I don't own any at all. But I'd rather be duct taped into a chair and have my eyelids stapled to my forehead and forced to watch 100's of hours of Anime before anyone could ever make me watch a &quot;Chucky&quot; movie again. Anime flicks, even though I am not a fan, are award-winning material compared to &quot;Chucky&quot;.<br />
<br />
Asking folks to think of Gnome SK's as being similar to &quot;Chucky&quot; only makes the thought of gnome SK's that much more ridiculous. Attitude, appearance, general theme are all just wrong. <br />

I don't think anyone here who bash gnomes has been &quot;hiding&quot; the real reason they bash them in the first place: gnome sk's are ridiculous. They just don't fit the &quot;evil theme&quot; to a large number of players. <br />
<br />
Not liking a particular race/class, contrary to some people's beliefs, has nothing to do with sex or lack there of. My sex life is just fine. I've never lost a duel to a gnome. I am hung like a typical dark elf. What's there to fear from a midget?<br />
<br />
And that's just it: most gnomes are probably twinks for people who get bored because most people in their right-mind will not play a midget dressed in black pretending to be the boogy-man.<br />
<br />
Most people just think that gnome SK's are goofy. I tend to agree. Do I &quot;Hate&quot; gnomes? Not really. (Maybe in role-play terms, yes)<br />
<br />
But I will close with a simple question - <br />
Would Darth Vader have been intimidating at all if he were three-feet tall? Don't think so.<br />

<br />
Possibly not, cuz rather than coasting through the lower levels, they might have actually had to struggle through having lower levels of AC and HP and Mana, making it harder to defeat monsters, making them have to employ different strategies besides &quot;bonk the 100hp froggy with my sword from Ssra temple that does 75 damage a swipe&quot; and the like.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I don't have anything against twinks perse. Hell, I'd be a hypocrite if I did. I've done some minor twinkage of a mage, a monk, a necro, and a couple other classes in my time, and hell, My original main (a Bard) gave Jobrill a MoSS when he was in his mid-30s, and my level 65 druid bro sometimes gives me melee gear he won in higher groups.<br />
<br />
However, I like to think I work at learning the classes I decide to play. I read boards, I test strategies, I gimp myself, to make sure that I know how to play. In my experience, tho, most twinks do not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnax</div><div class="date">11-22-2002, 11:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK.  Lets put the blame where it belongs : on inexperienced players, twinks or not.  As much as i hate it, I fall into the bracket of inexperienced players ... the only planes i've been to are Knowledge (duh) and Hate.  Been on a Vox raid once ... 2 failed attempts in 8 hours ... at which time i decided never again to go on a pickup raid.<br />
<br />
I can't put blame on twinks because I know that  low &amp; mid lvl characters are rarely remotely like upper levels.  I hear people talk about how SKs are about DPS all the time ... i tell them that &quot;from my experience&quot; they are full of shit ... at 49th lvl my DPS is absolutely horrible ... pre-50, imho, SKs are about aggro mgmt.<br />
<br />
So &quot;whats the point&quot; you ask?  Maybe pre-50 levels mimic post-50 abilities soo poorly that players learn the wrong roles for their classes.  At 49th lvl, I know how to do 2 things well : fear kite &amp; maintain aggro ... BOTH of which will be completely useless when i start raiding a lot.<br />

It's not even that. It's just plain idiots, who may or may not be twinks. It is not too hard to follow 2 or 3 basic rules that most successful raid leaders tell EVERYONE up front.

I personaly find Gnome SK combo rather funny, same as a halfling warrior. <br />
<br />
:p  teehee<br />
<br />
I'm willing to bet that the vast majority of gnome SK's are twinks like myself.  They came late in the game, and with Bazaar it's not hard to outfit them in pretty nice gear.  Heck, Vrap has better AC/HP than Parv did at his level, since I levelled Parv up to 50 pre-Kunark.  <br />
<br />
It's not twinks that ruin your gaming, it's dumb players.  I imagine if I decided to continue with Vrap to 60+ that I'd make a pretty decent SK, but I've also had 3 years of experience as a warrior with Parv.  There's a few things different playing an SK but the general game characteristics are the same, especially when playing melee-oriented classes.  Conversely, I know crummy players that make twinks; these are the people that get their groups killed, because they get their groups killed with their higher level characters also.<br />

People who twink themselves usually have made it to a high enough lvl to understand the basic mechanics of the game both grouping and raiding, low level to high level.<br />
<br />
The majority of these twinks know what they are doing for the most part (always room to learn).<br />
<br />
It is the people who are twinked by friends or families, they never made it to the high end game themselves and have no clue how to play.<br />
<br />
My buddy is like that.<br />
<br />
My brother and I set him up with soem nice gear for his druid.   We also let him tag along with us half the time while we coached him on what to do.<br />
<br />
Now he is lvl 50 with not a clue of how to play in a group at all.  I am to the point that I am scared to go places with him because I know he will let us die.<br />

<br />
What would make a gnome so hard to play untwinked?<br />
<br />
Statwise they have 5 more stamina, 1 less intelligence, 5 less agility but 10 more dexterity than a dark elf.  Steamfount isn't a worse newbie zone than Nektulos, and they have better faction with good races to boot.<br />
<br />
I mean, there are a ton of dark elves out there who played untwinked back before exp gain was increased 1-10, as well as the no more corpse runs or exp loss for those level, and soulbinders etc etc.<br />
<br />
I always hear that they have bad stats, but statwise gnomes are about equal as dark elves - the most popular shadow knight race.  Granted, some might argue that dark elves make up for it in looks but... /shrug</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why twinked? because I had collected a ton of equipment on my main (now retired) 60 warrior that was sk only and was dead tired of trying to sell it in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
Why gnome?  When I read about the game in phase2 beta I heard about gnome sk's and I loved the idea, then come release and the main class/race combo I wanted to play was unavailable.  Then verant said, hey lets put this in since we had planned to ages ago.  So basically I had always wanted to play a little gnome shadowknight.  I love small races for roleplaying reasons and have a great deal of fun picking on the big fatties that think I'm a football.  They quickly learn that this football bites :)<br />
<br />
I don't mind getting picked  on, it is roleplaying to some extent.  Ogres SHOULD pick on gnomes.  If a gnome could walk up to an ogre and not think...oh dang that things mouth is the size of my head!, then something is wrong.<br />
<br />
I don't care if somene thinks their SK is better than mine, it takes none of the fun I've experienced for the last 49 levels.<br />
<br />
I love this game, and being a gnome shadowknight is part of the reason I love it.<br />
<br />
p.s.  As far as looks go.  I have always loved the little iron stove tank type look of the old model gnomes in plate armor.  This was a serious contributing factor in me wanting to play a gnome sk.  As many people have said before, if you don't like how your toon looks (aesthetics, etc) then you probably wont enjoy him/her near as much.  Lets all have some fun :)</div></div><hr />

Most gnome shadowknights are permanently stationed in the bazaar or have fallen under the delete button, it seems. <br />
<br />
There are maybe 3 or 4 active 50+ gnome sks now. There's a 40-something gnomer sk in our guild who started as an honest-to-goodness first character not terribly long ago. There are generally no more than 10 total on-line, including bazaar traders. Most of the ones being played are under 30, and probably won't make it much further than that. <br />
<br />
Almost 4 years in, I think EVERY class is twink heavy. It seems inevitable. <br />
<br />
And, aside for the occasional mistaken identity*, people are generally more positive toward me now as a gnome shadow knight than they were for the first 3 months. It's old news now.<br />
<br />
(*One guy actually wanted to argue with me about who I was. It was a little surreal. He couldn't grasp that there could be more than one female gnome shadow knight in skyshrine armor on the server. *sigh*... All that time looking at dragon ankles for my armor to cause me identity problems.)</div></div><hr />

He saw me (61 cleric) and her, and just wouldnt believe that I was not 2-boxing and that she was an actual player doing her own thing. <br />
<br />
But, now that Kensha is epic'ed, it should be a total non-issue. She's truely unique on Xegony now.</div></div><hr />

You sir are CLUELESS!  I've played a TROLL Sk to 54 and an DE to 47.. . THose were alts to the 60 wizard long ago.. .<br />
<br />
THEN decided to twink a GNOME omg  I must be a n00b because I have all the experience in the game through Luclin! :(((<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW I enjoy the GNOME much more. INT, being small, ect.  It's a matter of playing style. <br />
<br />
Every experienced player knows in the high end GEAR is the only thing that makes a differance. Noobs like jobrills  don't know shit about the game.</div></div><hr />

What's the matter, Kainazzio? Did you get pwnz0red by some goodie two-shoes high elf Paladin in Rygorr and Ro with a Ghoulbane? :(<br />

Twinking means nothing. Non-Twinking means nothing.<br />

GNOMES. SUCK.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sounds like someone's trying to overcompensate for their own short comings.<br />
<br />
I don't see everyone running around stating that Erudites suck, or that human suck.  Gnomes have some of the best starting stats for any race.  Gnomes are fun.  Try having a little character in your character, instead of powergaming for phat lewtz.<br />
<br />
Humans are neutral.  Erudites are neutral.  Gnomes are neutral.  They all can be paladins.  They all can be shadow knights.  They all can be necromancers.<br />
<br />
Dark elves are evil.  Ogres are evil.  Iksar are evil.  They can be shadow knights.  They cannot be paladins.  DE's and Iksar can be necromancers.<br />
<br />
Dwarves are good.  High elves are good.  They can be paladins.  They cannot be SKs or necromancers.<br />
<br />
You apparently haven't played many RPG games if you think that all gnomes are funny, good aligned little creatures.  There are plenty of small, evil creatures out there in D&amp;D (Svarts anyone?) so don't make a basis on gnomes being good just because they don't live in a swamp or a moat somewhere.  Try reading up a little on the history of Ak'anon, the gnomes, Meldrath, Dark Reflection, PoI, and Bertox and see how everything fits into place.<br />
<br />
I'm not a twink.  I started playing EQ 6 months after it was released.  I had a 56 gnome warrior for 2 and a half years.  I got rid of him to play DAoC and AO, and came back when gnome SKs were introduced.  This was my original class choice back from when I bought the game.  I was really disappointed to see that you couldn't play them, even though the manual at the time said you could.<br />
<br />
I just got level 60 with 98 days playtime on my SK.  I was the first one to complete my epic, and one of the first to complete Greenmist.  I've worked my ass off for everything that I have.  I started completely from scratch and gathering greater lightstones to make money with.  Not everyone's a twink.</div></div><hr />
