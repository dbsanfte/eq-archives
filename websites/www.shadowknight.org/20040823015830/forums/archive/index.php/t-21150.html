No wonder you're a Democrat.  <br />
<br />
Dem's suck pretty much. I'm socially liberal (pro-choice, pro gay marrige, pro legalization) and fiscally conservitave (anti-government waste, anti-tax for people) independant. I find that they mesh together very well. I don't believe in true free market capatalism, because that only works under ideal conditions. Last time around I voted green. Bush has sucked so bad that I'm voting for whoever else runs - be it kerry, mcCain, yantis, Fenrix, wtf ever. Really in just about every area Bush's fucked the country. So fuck him.</div></div><hr />

<br />
a third party won't win. anyway, i doubt kerry would raise taxes extremely, except we could hope he'd get rid of the BS tax breaks for people making millions of dollars.</div></div><hr />

Also, i know a third party candidate won't win; i just don't like Kerry and would like it if his votes were siphoned off by a third party candidate.</div></div><hr />

WTF ever. That &quot;richest 50% of the US payes all the taxes&quot; dittohead shit got to you? Know who the &quot;richest 50%&quot; are? Anyone that makes over 23k a year. I bet you all didn't know you were &quot;rich&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
And like it shouldn't be that way? So... Bill Gates and that bum beggin for a dollar to buy some thunderbird should pay the same amount of taxes? Try thinking for just a second.. there might be something wrong with that... If you have 90% of the total wealth in this country, you sure as fuck should be paying 90% of the taxes. <br />
<br />
<br />
Fuck it all anyway. This would be a non-issue if corporations paid their fair share. You know that all the compaines in america only something like 28% pay any taxes at all? As a percentage of govt revenue, they contribute around 8% of the total tax money raised. (numbers close but not exact.) FUCK that noise.</div></div><hr />

Who's gonna pay the trillion dollars other countires owe the US.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Blackstone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Actually, the median US income is more on the lines of 36k/year, not 23k/year.  By definition 50% of the people earn more than the median and 50% of the people earn less than the median.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rich&quot; is an adjective to describe wealth not income.  You can't tell how wealthy someone is by how much in taxes they pay.  <br />
<br />
Since you are a mind controlled naderite peon, I will attempt to educate you on just one little aspect of the tax code that you are doubtlessly unaware of -- Subchapter S.<br />
<br />
Subchapter S is the mechanism that a large proportion of small business file under.  Under Subchapter S the owner/proprietor pays income taxes under the individual rates.  Most Americans work for small businesses not large corporations btw.  So when they get taxed more, they grow slower, hire less people, etc. etc.<br />
<br />
So, when you punish the &quot;rich&quot; you are in essence punishing small business -- i.e. the place where you get your &quot;tobacco pipes&quot; and aroma therapy candles.<br />
<br />
Real rich people, like say Teresa Heinz (Kerry) pay very little in taxes, btw since they can afford the numerous accounting and tax defferment schemes that even high income people (such as myself) cannot.  (Doubtlessly this is one reason that she isn't releasing her taxes -- Kerry doesn't want the pittance she paid in taxes relative to her 550million dollar inhereted fortune to be exposed to scrutiny.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>yuggoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Kerry reported 20 million$ on his taxes last year... and paid like 92,000$ in taxes.  Bush paid about 200,000$ in taxes on 800,000$.  Still think Kerry will raise taxes on the rich?  He is one....</div></div><hr />

You do understand that this would socialize business to some degree right?  Businesses are not required to pay the same type of taxes as individuals because it is &quot;we the people&quot; who are supposed to support the &quot;people's&quot; government.  We happily practice capitalism here if you haven't caught on by now...</div></div><hr />
