<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kanigit007</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I and others have noticed that if you have Innate Haste, Speed of Vallon (or Brood) and if the enchanter turns you into an elemental (usually Fire Ele) - the player Haste Cap &quot;seems&quot; to go away.<br />
<br />
With this set up I crank out damage at a god-aweful pace.  Its unreal.<br />
<br />
I've seen a ranger become a machine gun with this trick as well - as the ranged timer resets extreemly quickly as well.<br />
<br />
A few enchanters I have talked to have also noticed it and one even would not do it because she felt it might be considered an exploit.<br />
<br />
Anyways - I just wanted to bounce that off the lot of you and see what you think.<br />

Off/On Topic - why is Call of Darkness listed in my spell list as &quot;Illusion Other&quot;????  WTF?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Does this illusion maybe calculate hits as if we were dual wielding?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kanigit007</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Maybe.  I was 2H-slashing when using it though.<br />
<br />
Can anybody else confirm or deny?</div></div><hr />
