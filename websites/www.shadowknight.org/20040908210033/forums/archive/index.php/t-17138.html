<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grimknot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know it was Ashenbone drakes before the revamp, but since the revamp I've LIVED in hate on Sol Ro and not seen a single damn hide drop.  I don't know how many Ashenbones I have killed and I've become disgusted with the difficulty of obtaining my epic.  Having both a Windblade and a BBS I want the epic for the prestige and accomplishment, but the stupid rarity and not the difficulty in comparison to other class epics has left me disgusted with sony.  Does the hide still drop off Ashenbones or was it moved to Hatebone Drakes (or whatever they are called).  Can both drop it?  And if anyone says yes it does, can you confirm you have seen it drop off this mob since revamp?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Saruton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Killed 173 ashenbone drakes so far no hide, but it is confirmed that it drops from the ashenbones as a guildie got one when he went up there and hunted at the entrance. And i do think its true as he really was very happy which was clearly visible in gu :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vaeani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">They do drop from Ashenbone drakes.<br />
Although I wonder if killing the broodmaster had anything to deal with it. I got my hide last night.We killed the Ashenbone broodmaster. killed another mob &quot;Mistress of Scorn&quot; and then evac'ed to ent. Drake was popped and he dropped my hide.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nycathis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Drakes dropped = 160<br />
Hide dropped = 0 <br />
<br />
Im waiting until 250 drakes killed until I /petition or /bug this.<br />
NO other epic has this amount of time sink in it AFAIK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Daerkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I spend a lot of time in hate as its quiet and a good place to get away from the crowds on the weekends. I have killed several hundred drakes and a large number of every mob in zone - enough to equip my entire group with marsinger shimmering gems, and have seen no hide drop.<br />
<br />
For comparison I have looted 3 staffs for magician epic while I have been up there, several vampire essences for enchanter epic, and even seoc for ranger epic. It does seem somewhat unbalanced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>GranochTonka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">298 drakes not one hide...this is almost as bad as camping shards :((</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nycathis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah but the difference here is that you can get shards to drop .....<br />
<br />
Drakes 180 hides 0</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dester</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">287 drakes<br />
0 Hides<br />
<br />
I have seen every other epic piece drop at least twice.<br />
I have killed the broodmaster about 5 - 6 times<br />
<br />
The drop rate is insanely stupid and I still have the soul leach in Fear to go also.<br />
currently 3 golems and 0 soul leaches.<br />
<br />
on a side note, I still have yet to see the minor signet of the Knight or warrior drop.<br />

This was all on E-Marr<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Gosh, this almost makes me feel guilty.  Way back long before the revamp to Hate, I went on my first Hate raid immediately after I got level 46 and I happened to be in Nektulos while a raid was forming, who needed replacements.  That night, I got both my hide and the shield.  I then went on a guild run raid two days later, and a hide rotted.  Granted, this was more than balanced out in my opinion by having to kill 90 golems to get the Soul Leech drop, and having to go on four Sky raids to get the Blade of Abrogation drop.  It took well more than a year before I was able to complete the epic, and the very next day a friend in an uber guild handed me a Windblade.  Still, I'm glad I have my Purple Glowing Sword of Dewm, and I wish everybody the best of luck getting the hide to drop.  Even before the revamp, my example is amazingly lucky, as I know somebody that raided Hate every Sunday for five months and still didn't get a hide.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is kinda off the topic, but in trying to spawn rharzar, I spawned blackwing for the bard epic at least 10 times.  I could easily solo blackwing, but it took a full group to do Rharzar.  Just one other way the SK epic is &quot;unbalanced&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Elquinjena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">This is for one of your fellow shadowknights..<br />
he has fought long and hard in Hate for this item..and it never dropped.<br />
<br />
On a raid this eve it did..and I was allowed to loot it.<br />
<br />
now I will do anything to faction that is needed that will allow me to MQ it for him.<br />
<br />
What I need help is in this, what faction is Teydar on?<br />
what would a woodelf ranger have to do to make him like me enough to do this mq for my friend?<br />
<br />
I do not care what faction I have to trash...he has worked damm hard, like all you have on this pain in the butt part.<br />
<br />
Please help!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Azaryl LVeldrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Im sure you will be KOS to the Bloodsabers (Qeynos SK guild).  Unlike the rest of the sks in the sewers, Teydar is on Truespirit faction...you would be apprehensive at most...meaning you could have someone pull Teydar outside of the Qeynos shadowknight guild and do the hide/turn in trick with your friend.<br />
<br />
In darkness,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Dester</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I was the SK that elquinjena had the hide for.  MQ was easy as she could do the hide trick for faction.<br />
<br />
Also pulling Teydar was easy as he is on True Spirit faction and was not assisted by the other blood sabers.  I did have to /q out and come back in to wipe agro though.<br />
<br />
just thought some people would like to know.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Zurdaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">If you dont care about your Qeynos factions (all of them) there is a mob in Blackburrow (human cleric i think) that gives MONSTER faction.. i killed him about 6 times and was MAX ALLY with bloodsabers.. Conversly, i killed him 6 times and was MAX KOS with qeynos.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

Cleric epic is a joke now.  Worst part is killing green placeholders for Bergurgle and Gimblox.  Most of the raid mobs can be one-grouped or duoed. :/</div></div><hr />
