<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kutsokare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was just going through the recent posts and saw this: <br />
<br />
&quot;Simply put, if you want to solo hard stuff then gear up, if you want to sit at a confortable 5k then two box a shaman and deal with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
I only really post when I really have the urge to, and that's right now.  So you're telling me that since I'm casual, I don't deserve to see the content at the high end?  I pay the same $12.95 a month that you do, and I paid the same amount for all these useless expansions.  I have GoD, mainly because I accidentaly ordered it, but I'd like to see more than just a Boat and an Adventure camp.  I have PoP, I'd like to see a little more than PoJ and PoV.  I've been playing since 2000, and so far I've only managed to get 2 level 55 characters, one SK and one druid.  I'm stuck at level 55, because I log on, go LFG, solo in Grimling for 2 hours while I wait for a group to pop up, and then log off.  I know you're going to bring up LDoN, but you don't consider the fact that LDoN is horrible in the 50s.  I get maybe a blue per adventure, while some guy in PoV sits there for 5 hours getting a yellow per hour.<br />
<br />
I have time constraints, but it doesn't mean I should have to only see HALF the game.  The main reason I'm here is for this:  Perhaps EQ should offer an alternative to flagging.  For instance, perhaps killing, or being in a group that kills, at least 1000 mobs in PoJ would get you flagged for exec trials.  Or maybe give us another EXP bar similiar to AA where we would gain points and be able to PURCHASE flags for exp.  This would enable us to get into higher end zones and be opened up to better exp options.  So there's my idea, *puts on a Flame retardant suit, because he knows SKO hates casuals =/*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Usually in life and in games the more time you put into 'it' the more you can get out of it. If LDoN xp isn't good enough for you and you are tired of PoJ and PoV then only thing I can suggest is go solo somewhere.<br />
<br />
Edit: Ask people who were 55 before Luclin and ask them how fast it took them to advance in levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bushido32</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My question is:  How does a casual progress when he wants to raid but nobody raids at the times I play?  I usually play late nights in PST.  After doing a thorough search of the top 20 guilds on my server, I found that no one really raids during my play times.  So, even though I have some leveling work to do, I'm not sure what I have to look forward to when I reach 65 (or 70).  EQ seems to be very focused on the 'core playing times'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">it's dependant on your server and if they have any PST guilds I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Why does this continually come up?  Its been this way with video games forever.  You can't beat FF3 just by creating your characters and running around town or exp'ing in the wilderness.  You didnt just walk up and get the magic sword and beat Gannon.  You have to move through the content and put in a bunch of time.  Thats how video games are.  No matter how much you paid to buy it.  Access to later parts are given by beating earlier parts.  The only thing that makes EQ different from older games is that it takes more people, but that was obvious by the MM part of MMORPG.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Madrone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You can get farther into PoP either by leveling or doing Quests, acccess to every zone in pop outside of Elementals/Time/Solro/PoNB is avaiable to anyone who puts effort into it (and I did not forget tactics, the quest for it is not much different then sebelis or chardok was back in velious/kunark)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Warrl Kyrie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You can't beat FF3 just by creating your characters and running around town or exp'ing in the wilderness. You didnt just walk up and get the magic sword and beat Gannon. You have to move through the content and put in a bunch of time. <br />
<br />
<br />
I'm sorry but this is actually a horrible analogy. As you could make meaningfull progress in FF3 with only an hour or two of game play. Granted it would take someone a greater number of days to complete the game than someone who played for 8 hours straight a day until they beat it.<br />
<br />
This is not possible in Everquest, there is little to no measurable progress that can actually be made in an hour or two. I'm not a casual player, nor am I hardcore. LDoN is one answer for the casuals, but then again, seeing the same cookie cutter content gets tedious. There should be an alternate way to advance, I just wouldn't know what that would be.<br />
<br />
Personally I can not see why some raiders feel threatened by casuals want to progress thru the game, without making Everquest a second job.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Flanders</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">After reading your post and reponses to other peoples post, I just dont think everquest is the game for you.  You cant seem to grasp the concept of risk versus reward and how it coorelates through all games.  No one promised you, you would beat gannon when you bought Zelda and no one is promising you Plane of Time when you pay your monthly fee.  You shell out your money under these pretences, knowing that this is something you have to achieve for yourself.  If it was given to you, it wouldnt be a game, it would be a movie.  Think about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">This is the best advice I can give to casuals to get something out of the game in later levels.<br />
<br />
1. Do NOT go through the 20's, 30's, 40's without a guild.  The lowbie family guilds is where you make friends.  A network of friends is the single most valuable thing for someone with limitted play time.<br />
<br />
2. Do diversify.  Go to the empty dungeon zones with those friends from your guild when you get a decent block of time.  Get experience with your group role, this expands to be your raid role.  Get some loot in the process and vital experience in zones that arent outdoor pull kill pull kill snoozer zones where LFG people rotate in and out.<br />
<br />
3. Keep your gear up.  Do the quest armor in the 30's, whatever, just keep it up.  Hunting in the non-traditional exp zones will get you drops and more cash than OT/DL (whatever is popular these days).  Do all quests available to you as soon as you're of level to do them.  Every level you should be able to say you're geared for your level.<br />
<br />
4. Join a guild that is at your level of progression (either develop with your lowbie guild or move on when you outlevel them).  Content skipping leads to frustration.  There has to be an optional raid guild doing velious/luclin on every server.  On TP theres quite litterally more guilds than the server population can support.  There's something for everyone.  Whatever, find a guild thats optional raiding, prefer dkp to merit because merit is tough on people who dont raid much.<br />
<br />
5. Take advantage of the raised levels that trivializes older content.  Named in places like NToV and Ssra named offer good gear and are waaaay easy post 60.  And it takes very little time to mobilize and set up for these targets with all the new things like PoK stones.<br />
<br />
6. Remember that there is no end.  Don't look at what the top guild is doing or what their members are wearing.  It will contribute to the mentality that somehow you being in that zone or having that gear means you win the game.  It doesn't.  They're doing the same thing you are ... trying the next available zone that they havent beat.<br />
<br />
7. If you absolutely have no time to raid, ldon alot or fight in zones where there are drops.  Research this.  With all the sites out there theres no reason to not know where good items drop that you can either use or sell.<br />
<br />
8. Do not rely on LFG.  God damn, I never want to hear someone bitch about this again.  Make your own groups.  You open up that lfg tool and find some people.  You do not need the perfect group.  You do not need to go buy buffs.  Get the people together fast, move fast and make the most of your time.<br />
<br />
Just some thoughts off the top of my head.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Heheh. It's same as RL.. A cable subscriber pays $30 monthly ONLY to watch TV 1 hour a day vs a full-time cable subscriber pays $30 monthly to watch TV 12 hours a day. Did you EVER hear about that person whined about full-time cable subscriber watching TV 12x more than him?? I never heard of that before. That part-time subscriber would think, &quot;Heck! I didn't see more than HALF of TV programming! And I still pay $30 a month. NOT FAIR!!&quot;  Most of them who paid full price and watched very very little usually just cancel subscribing and rented movies instead cuz its more money efficient for them.. They hardly complained to cable companies.<br />
<br />
EQ is VERY VERY similiar to TV subscribtion system. EQ is an service for people to enjoy just like cable companies do. They expected same monthly payment for their service REGARDLESS of people's usage on their service either big or small.<br />
<br />
One big difference between Cable and on-line games.. There is sense of competition in on-line games and there surely is no sense of competition in cable services. ;) They just watched.. On-line games, they interact..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I consider myself a casual player.  Not casual in terms of time played per day or week; but rather casual on content.  I'm not flagged for ST/VT/EP or beyond so I know I'm not going to see uber loot or be able to xp in sweet xp zones cranking out X aa's per hour.<br />
<br />
I accept that.  I don't feel I'm entitled to see every zone, unless I put in the effort [i.e. that effort = join uber guild, go on pickup flag raids, go lfg, etc.].<br />
<br />
The line you quoted hits home for me too, and the shoe fits.  2-boxing changed my EQ life, I had the means to be able to do SOMETHING any time I wanted.  If I couldn't do what I wanted, I did something else that I could.  I haven't been LFG for at least 3 years.  Am I a good 2-boxer?  Heck no, but good enough that I am being productive (in some way) 99.99% of the time I'm online.<br />
<br />
If 2-boxing isn't your bag for any number of reasons (hardware, accounts, etc.) then the next best thing is... a friend or two.  If you've been playing since 2000, you must have made a few friends, yes?  Or, make new friends when you find an LFG group... add peeps you like to your friends list -- ask 'em once in a while what they are up to and if there is room.<br />
<br />
Join a family guild that suits your style.  When and if you outgrow it (doubtful unless your casualness changes), you can leave it to join one more suited to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">/bah on peeps who type faster than me and :D  say what I meant better than me! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Noctix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'm a casual player and I'm all for making more content available to casual players.  But seriously, if you're level 55 and you're not geared up, you probably couldn't solo anything in the zones you're locked out of anyway.  There are progression paths that allow a casual player to get a LOT further than where you are now, you just need to make a couple friends so you can find a group when you log on.<br />
<br />
If you can't make any friends and don't want to multi-box, you need to either accept the fact that soloing is slow or switch games.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">since hes quoting me, heh... And i have -0- sympathy for &quot;casual players&quot; ill respond.  From the flip side, so you want to tell me that since you sit on your ass and tradeskill all day and sit in OS farming gems, while I the raider sit in PoW with 65 of my friends waiting for corinav to spawn, or doing the rathe so many times its sickening trying to get everything perfect so we can win...if you fail at the end thats an hour or better down the tubes.  People on our server have camped Corinav for Days, just sat there, you mean to tell me right now that you deserve to see the same thing they are seeing right now?  Before we were VT keyed 3 guilds were ready to kill emp...I sat there for 16 hours,  in emps room...Ive sat at corinav to simply accomplish the &quot;next level of play&quot;  and you wanna squeak by in a easy one group trial just cause you pay the same amount of money to play that i do?  I dont get to get XP everynight, I dont really play that much...but when im on i play hard to progress.  Its not that difficult.  You can do two things, sit there and feel sorry for yourself while your lfg and talk about how bad eq sucks and tailors to certain &quot;people&quot;, or get up and make shit happen,  It takes 3 hours a day to raid progressively on a normal basis if that, thats a couple hours after dinner and before bed, and even then most &quot;raiding guilds&quot; dont require 100% attendance, some get an over abundance just to account for those that dont play every waking minute of there lives.  Sorry if i sound condenscending,  but im really sick of the people making it sound worse then it is<br />
<br />
edit: im all for making shit more available to casual players... But none of them should get close to even touching me.  Even now they are too close</div></div><hr />

Yes, that is what I am saying.  You dont deserve jackshit.  If you cant put in the time, as everyone else does, then why do you deserve the same?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>scpio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">if find the posts about casuals vs ubers really nothing more then a lame attempt to get EQ to become a welfare state like UO is.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Oompah_Loompah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Basically the casual player need only have patience.  As time goes by SOE will continue to dumb down and make the game easier and easier.  They have done it so many times in the past it is practically a die that they methodically follow.<br />
<br />
I am a casual player.  Do I expect to see the high end shiznit? Hell no.  But then again my philosophy on life is that reward is equal to effort.  I believe this to a point - extremes in either direction are no good.  <br />
<br />
In the end, a casual player expecting to see end game content on thirty minutes of play and a hardcore player camping something for 16 hours straight are equally sad.  But thats the game at times.  One side (casual) expects everything, the other side (powergamer) is bitch to the game.  Who wins - noone in my opinion.<br />
<br />
In the end do what makes you happy.  Its a game, and not the only player in town, many other flavors to try.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Lizarde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I pay the same $12.95 a month that you do, and I paid the same amount for all these useless expansions.<br />
This argument is used often, but it is flawed.  The $30 or $50 or $100 you pay for EQ and its expansions, and the $10 or $13 you pay a month for access, buys you just that: a license for the game/expansions, and access to SOE servers.  It doesn't buy you anything else.  Not level 65, not level 2.<br />
<br />
The game is designed to reward players based on several factors, including time spent playing.  That's just how it is, pretty much any other video game is like that.  Granted, some single player games provide for 'god mode' and other cheats, but how much fun are those games when you enabled cheats and god mode?  That's right, it sucks because there's no challenge.<br />
<br />
I know that it's a point that gets repeated alot, but it bears repeating because the argument that 'I pay the same $13 a month as you' gives you the 'right' to certain levels and gear and zone access, is just not a valid one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Amazingly enough, I am not upset about not getting into certain zones since you need flags from raids. Also, I am not upset that power gamers (insert raiders here) have much more powerful stuff then I have.<br />
<br />
If you play the game longer, you should have better stuff and progressed further. What I am concerned about is the lack of continuing progression path for casual players.<br />
<br />
LDoN was a nice addition in this area, I just hope there will be more things that can be done quickly or in smaller groups. Also, I feel that everything in EQ takes a &quot;raid&quot;. Even alot of the droga quests, while the pieces can be farmed with single groups, it takes a raid to spawn the turn-in guy.<br />
<br />
I am curious about the new &quot;task&quot; system. hmmm.....</div></div><hr />

Your gear suggests that you still have a ways to go until you deplete the casual content that is already availible to you. The single group content from the revamped older zones and the higher cost LDoN armor are still waiting for you, as are many GoD upgrades that are within your range. There is definitely more for you to obtain for your own improvement within the confines of single group play, and that will enable you to single group even more content...<br />
<br />
It just won't be fast or clean alot of the time, Id wager...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>cames</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Without raiding I can see that you miss:<br />

Actually, you are correct. There are many things in older zones I do target. I find myself in 2-3 person groups in Droga quite often and like that zone (gimme more, lol). That is why I am not fired up about higher end zones. Also, as level 70 become available, some of those &quot;old&quot; raid areas (doomshade, rumblecrush, maybe vindi?, etc) start to become 1 and 2 group &quot;mini-raid&quot; options. Even the thought of The Emperor SSra comes a possibility.<br />
<br />
I am more concerned that while the address (or hopefully address) class balance issues at the high end, they do not forget the casual player who goes spellunking around the older zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Of course...but you need not worry too much. Who do you think that they made that Droga revamp for in the first place? Or Veksar? Or Normal level LDoN adventures?</div></div><hr />

All the old raid zones will eventually open up as they add levels and expansions.</div></div><hr />
