<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ben Holiday</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">While picking up the lance from the Spiritist in Feerrott I have collected quite a bit of the DF armor only problem is it's on my main which happens to not be an sk. So I'm wondering do the quest givers make sure your an sk to do the turn ins? Or should I just get an sk friend and MQ it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bloodmere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The Darkforge questseries is doable by all. The skeletons that give out the quests in Temple of Solusek Ro gives them out to everyone. Only thing i could think of is bad faction for certain people when the quests involve killing guards from Qeynos and Freeport.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>NorrynNoir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">these were definately mq'able when i did them though that was 3 years ago. avoiding the faction hits is pretty easy to avoid since you only need to kill one qeynos guard and maybe 3 freeport ones. you could handle that with your sk and let your main do the rest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Azudno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You don't have to MQ, Dark Forge armor is dropable. Just do the quest with your main who has to nodrop quest items then hand the resulting armor to your SK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I know for a fact that darkforge armor can be MQ'd.  Had a shaman friend that had one of the items and I had another and he mq'd me a second bracer.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ben Holiday</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Cool be trying this in the next week then have all except 2 pieces of the decayed armor now and not too worried about faction hits I can just do the faction improvement quests between killing guards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Thack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah, I know for a fact that other classes can do quest too.  Used to piss me off when I'd have non-sks random for the darkforge drops because they wanted to do the quest and sell the armor.  At the time, the quest gave about a half yellow of exp too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Yaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I always hated competing for the crusaders in the yard in front of CT with people trying to farm Darkforge for twinks and cash when I was there at level 35, trying to make an honest living, getting my new armor.  Fine Plate just wasn't doing it for me you know.  THey couldn't beat me to the spiritist though near the river.  He dropped my decayed chainmail early one morning.  There was a mage hanging out in the yard that had a right vambrace I needed to complete my suit.  I traded him something for it, just don't remember what.  My Druid friend ported us around to do the MQ.  So it is questable by all classes and MQ-able as well.</div></div><hr />
