<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Laymon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'v done the epic 3 times and this is the path I took the 2nd and 3rd time.  <br />

This is the first line from the 'foolproof' post in this thread.<br />

So I'm wondering, Just how many Ashenbone Drakes did you have to kill to get THREE epics?? and how long did it take?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Naaklum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i'm guessing he MQ'd almost every piece on the last 2 epics.  i had a freind who quit EQ and came back, while he was PLing his rogue to 50, he had peeps he new collecting all his epic stuff.  as soon as he hit 50, (10 RL days i think) he went and fought general for epic.  /shrug</div></div><hr />
