<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Warrl Kyrie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Last night while I was using my Goldenrod, it appeared that I recieved both the Shroud of Discord proc and the Goldenrod proc off of one swing. I did not get a double attack that round, nor did I get a reposit as I was behind the mob at the time. Unfortunately I did not have my log on at the time so I could not go back and confirm that is indeed what happened. Though the chat window looked similar to the following.<br />
<br />
You have hit &lt;mob name&gt; for 150 non-mellee damage.<br />
You have hit &lt;mob name&gt; for 115 non-mellee damage.<br />
You try to crush &lt;mob name&gt;, but miss!<br />
Soandso begins to cast a spell.<br />
You try to crush &lt;mob name&gt;, but miss!<br />
You crush &lt;mob name&gt; for 119 points of damage.<br />
<br />
The last two swings were in fact a double attack round. I guess my question is, has anyone else noticed this? I remember a rumor that this was implemented on the Test Server. Did this go live and I just missed it in a patch message or was it stealth added?</div></div><hr />

<br />
buff procs and AA procs can go off the same round as one weapon proc.<br />
<br />
just to clear some other things up,<br />
you proc per round, not per swing, so double attacking/triple attacking doesn't give you an extra chance to proc,<br />
you cannot proc on a riposte.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Warrl Kyrie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">So Weapon Affinity is actually worth purchasing now, or does it still reduce the amount our Innate procs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Arikash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It's worth purchasing, do a search on it, and you'll find the exact patch messge prolly where it states that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Warrl Kyrie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I did do a search, all of the results I had come up with were essentially asking about the proc rates of diffrent weapons, as well as parses on the dps of diffrent procs. Did not see anything pertaining to the multiple procs on one swing. Otherwise I'd not have asked, obviously.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It was always worth purchasing as parsings have shown over and over again.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shadowknight adeklias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">with SA, Innate proc from OOW AA, and 2 Damage augs from epic its possible to get 4 procs in one round.  WA went from bleh to top shelf.  Once you get the oow proc aa's and def aa's i would highly suggest going back to GoD and doing the hard grind to WA5.  <br />
<br />
Even though i still feel that pally/sk are still unbalanced due to stuns.....i suggest maxing the Lifetap/proc aa's first then making your arguement.  Its insane.<br />
