<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>BrikBludgaard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Shields should be about protection...<br />
<br />
1) All shields have a default BLOCK percentage similar to Damage bonus... all classes that can use shields benefit from this... warriors should see a flat bonus whenever ANY shield is wielded.<br />
<br />
2) WAR/PAL/SK when using a shield, can use /steelwall. This blocks a higher percentage of incoming blows + the shields block mod for 30 seconds... reuseable every 10 minutes. This ability STACKS with /defensive... it is NOT a discipline, but a function of skill with a shield.<br />
<br />
3) Warriors should be able to get shields that add to Damage bonus in primary hand. Heck... some of it might even be innate!<br />
<br />
4) WAR/PAL/SK can use their shields to defend others as well as themselves.  Knights can block for party members at one-third (minimum 1%) of their block ability.  Warriors can block for party members using half of their block score, (minimum 2%).  This ability STACKS with more warriors/knights in the party.  This ability STACKS with /shield for warriors, giving the target the FULL chance to block using the warrior's score while /shield is active. <br />
<br />
<br />
AAXP:<br />
(previous abilities increase with LEVEL, and are innate as long as you use a shield with a BLOCK mod on it)<br />
<br />
These AAXP are PoP AAXP<br />
2 4 6<br />
You may train at level 61 63 65<br />
<br />
Shadowknight:<br />
Shield of Spite<br />
<br />
Shadowknights using /steelwall gain an enhanced damage shield while /steelwall is functioning. Each level of Spite also increases the duration of /steelwall.  Spite is considered melee damage. (thus stacks with /disc leechcurse)<br />
<br />
level 1 50 damage shield, +2 seconds<br />
level 2 150 damage shield, +6 seconds<br />
Level 3 300 damage shield, +14 seconds<br />
<br />
<br />
Paladin:<br />
Shield of Reversed Polarity<br />
<br />
Paladins learn to channel their holy power into their shield during /steelwall and turn their suffering into healing for their party. (including the paladin)  Both amount healed and duration increase with AAXP level.<br />
<br />
Level 1 3% of damage taken to party +2 seconds<br />
Level 2 7% of damage taken to party, +6 seconds<br />
Level 3 15% of damage taken to party, +14 seconds<br />
<br />
<br />
Warrior:<br />
Shield of Frustration<br />
<br />
Warriors learn to optimize their shield use, blocking more often, and making their opponent incredibly frustrated and desperately wanting to kill the warrior.  /steelwall Duration also increases with level.<br />
<br />
Level 1 1.5x current block rate, +2 seconds, +150hate per block<br />
Level 2 2x current block rate, +6 seconds, +300hate per block<br />
level 3 3x current block rate, +14 second, +600hate per block<br />
<br />
Ideas, modifications, comments?  Better ideas?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>krikk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">that AA seemed pretty extreem, I dunno if they'd ever impliment. Although it would be cool. However, shields are a little less than they should be currently. A shield, being ideally the thickest piece of armor, while also being the most menuverable, should in theory give the user more AC than other pieces of armor, or allow for alot more block% when equiped. I can't imagine getting hit as much as I do while fighting with my shield; which I do more than not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">While the initial post is probably too extreme, I would agree that sheilds are not what they should be. <br />
<br />
Equipping a sheild and going to a 1hander lowers my dps I should see a fair exchange in defensive ability due to this. The point of using a shield is to increase ones defense. But the AC gained alone is really not significant enough for this to be really true. <br />
<br />
An innate block chance on shields would be great although probably make monks scream.</div></div><hr />
