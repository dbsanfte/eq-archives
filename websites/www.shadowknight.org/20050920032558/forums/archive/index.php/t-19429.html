Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">natus</div><div class="date">01-18-2004, 01:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">what specific classes of 65s are you talking about?  that would really help determine if you're fighting a losing battle from the start or not, hehe<br />
<br />
since you're asking I'm going to say you're not 100% familiar with chardok...take someone who is, it will save time getting to the spawn locs and having someone who knows what to expect from the pulls on the way helps tons, especially going toward the library<br />
<br />
<br />
as for the fights, these are listed easiest to hardest:<br />
<br />
weaponsmith - easily soloable, just invis in to spawn room and kil the room pops repeatedly til he spawns<br />
<br />
golem - did it with another sk and a shammy bot but could be done with any slowing class plus you, could probably be done with just about any other class and you<br />
<br />
drusella - soloable, search the forums for more info on how to get to her, tactics, etc...hell, you may get lucky and not have to fight her since there are usually spawn checkers parked there waiting for her to pop and you can usually work out some type of looting arrangement<br />
<br />
chardok (alchemist) - bard or chanter really nice to have here, lots of casters close to spawns and some form of crowd control is beneficial, possible for a very tight trio to do, respawn is around 28 minutes or so...be prepared to stay here for awhile, melees for 180 and casts shammy spells<br />
<br />
chardok (library) - crowd control necessary, rogue for locked door and sensing the traps, might want to take a full group for the dps...you might want to consider grabbing a cleric that's looking for a singed scroll from the king since you're in the area and king is 1 groupable, again I'd recommend a very tight group since things can get out of hand down here quick...this is kunark but it's not trivial by any means...fd splitting is possible but not the preferred method of pulling fyi, the key is to handle 2 or 3 mobs and move on quickly to the next pull area, repeat, and get to library quick, break it and set up shop, cross your fingers and hope for the best<br />
<br />
a good group of sk(you), war/pally/beast/monk/ranger/mage/necro/shammy (pick 1 to fill this slot, I just listed them in order of personal preference), chanter/bard, cleric, rogue, wiz/druid should suffice<br />
<br />
loremaster piza'tak usually drops history of the greenmist every time, it's just getting to him with 3 people that might take a bit of time and work unless you're all ally with chardok...loremaster melee was mid 200s if I remember correctly, king was low - mid 300s plus wimpy ae<br />
<br />
you may want to consider stocking up on coffins just in case things go awry<br />
<br />
<br />
good luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ganodoar</div><div class="date">01-18-2004, 06:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just two corrections I would like to add to Natus's post. Spawn time of the mobs down by the herbalist hut are 20 minutes exactly. Also the Alchemist Acolyte does not cast shaman spells. He is a level 57 warrior mob who will enrage at 10 percent. One of the 2 phs for acolyte is a regular sarnak herb collector (shaman mob). Be careful when engaging it cause it will gate most of the time.<br />
<br />
Also Loremaster Pizatak is not even that rare as you might think. More of an uncommon spawn. Luckily he always drops the History of the Greenmist. Oh yeah I think you should not have trouble finding anyone to help you on Pizatak cause, as Natus mentioned, you could find a cleric to kill the king while waiting. Pizatak also drops the History of the Dizok and so casters are after him for the FT4 robe quest. You might be able to find casters who need that part. Pizatak is a 58 warrior and enrages like the aco. Hits a bit harder than the acolyte but is easy for any group of people you'd have there.<br />

<br />
Will having maxxed out Venril Sathir and Chardok faction make this any easier? I figure getting to the mobs themselves is probably half the battle. Would any of you say that the faction grind is worthwhile?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wienaman</div><div class="date">01-18-2004, 10:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I will repeat this from another thread.  With Ally faction to Chardok, I went down to Alchemist Acolyte spawn, pulled him to Chardok B zone and soloed him.  Saying the Acolyte requires a duo, or for that matter the glowing golem requires a duo, when you are saying Drus can be soloed is a bit, umm short sighted imo.  I soloed the Glowing Golem (spell kited him, took some medding while i waited for him to catch up, but total fight took about 5 minutes...engaged him at 20 pct or so, meleed him down to 0 while he meleed me from full health to about 30 pct :P)  Drus hits harder than the golem, can't be kited, and can get adds on the pull if you don't know what you are doing.  If you are gonna take a partner on any of these mobs, I would recommend a cleric for pac and heals or a shammie for slows and heals, and taking them on Drusella.  Everything else but the Loremaster is soloable by a good sk (hell I'm NOT that great an sk, and I soloed it all :P)  Loremaster is easy too to be honest tho, just wait at the top of Chardok for a royals raid to zone in (happens at least once a day on Luclin) and just offer to help them fight down, maybe even tank for them.  Then both sides get a benefit out of it :D</div></div><hr />
