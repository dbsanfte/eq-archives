<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kizzestra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I couldn't find it but I know there was some discussion about the proc from the lifetap augments bought in Mistmoore having a &quot;knock-forward&quot; effect as opposed to a &quot;knock-back&quot; effect.<br />
<br />
I thought there was also some info that had mentioned that they had resolved this issue but I just bought mine tonight and it does indeed still yank me forward when it goes off. I find it a tad troublesome as it often interrupts my casting if it goes off when I riposte a mob.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know if this is &quot;working as intended&quot; or what? I could see SoE claiming that since it's a &quot;vampire&quot; effect, that &quot;it draws you closer to your victim&quot; or some crap. Though if they are going that route, I will just get rid of it and get the Ykesha augment from Guk instead.</div></div><hr />
