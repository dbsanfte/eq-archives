After reading their write up I can see why someone would change servers to be a part of a team like that.<br />

I am as much a loot whore as anyone, but I dont get anywhere near the rush from getting new gear as I do defeating new and difficult encounters.</div></div><hr />

Besides the encounter repeatedly bugging on us and resetting, it's a very very fun fight. Requiring the whole raid to pay attention at all times. One mistake, even at 10%, could have cause us a wipe. The fight itself is a good 20-30 min easily.<br />
<br />
Brael did you ever get in or what?? <br />
He's still an app.</div></div><hr />

The loot is kinda sadface, but I imagine it will get upped. That BP is a joke, no doubt about it.</div></div><hr />

Still an app.  It's a pretty fun fight though all the bugs and such in the encounter were pretty annoying.</div></div><hr />

That's one fucking long ass app process. You guys don't fuck around ((Yes, I know, a statement of the obvious, but it's 1 AM, I've been awake a long time, and don't give a shit.))</div></div><hr />

&quot;Overlord Mata Muram was brought down for the first time, serverwide, last night by the guild Cestus Dei of Veeshan, so congratulations to them. For those of you keeping track, that was about 190 days between the Omens of War release and first Overlord kill.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Daermonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">To quote my guild<br />
<br />
&quot;Lucky number 100&quot;<br />
<br />
We had 100 recorded DKP attempts on Mata Muram before we downed him. This includes the times where the script reset on us due to bugs though. Regardless, the fight was incredible, very very well thought out encounter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kahntun Derstand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Now, the question is, how long will he exist in that state before they nerf him like they nerfed VT, etc.<br />
<br />
If I ever fight him, I won't be bringing my Wizard to box.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Chania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Heh, that's true. They effectively made him anti-boxable with those emotes. They've been ramping up to that style of play for a while now, I guess it culminates with Mata.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Daermonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">One of our warriors boxes his cleric every time he's at the event. He's about 4/4 on mask reflects on his alt, and 2/3 on his warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">He's gotta be using 2 machines for that though... that I could see, 2-boxing on one PC (AKA what I do) I couldn't see happening.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Daermonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">He's a real life friend of mine, he boxes using 5 computers. 2 boxing on 1 computer, ya, I don't see it being very effective either.</div></div><hr />
