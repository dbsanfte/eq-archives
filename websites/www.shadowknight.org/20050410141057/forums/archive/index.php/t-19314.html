<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>DragonKnight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Heh how come whenever i hear someone (60-65 lvl) dueling a really high lvl SK (60-65) they say that the SKs pet was extremely strong, and yet our pets are lvl 41? Im just not getting it because everyone i see when i have my best pet out (im lvl 47) they're like,&quot; Its green.... Why don't you pull out your best pet spell?&quot; Can someone please clarify this up for me</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hrm... dual weilding pet that lifetaps and quads for 55's... bashes and kicks...<br />
<br />
Not as strong as other pet classes, but then again, we're not as squishable as they are either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">SK's are the best armored pet class (we also have the weekest pet besides thestoopid drood bear)<br />
<br />
When dueling a pet class many duelers (wrongly) attack the pet first then tear through the owner.<br />
<br />
With a good jousting/casting SK, you can't spend  time on the pet and you're just trying to kill the bastard owner of the pet.    And this pet owner is wearing plate.<br />
<br />
At high levels the pet you're ignoring is a dual wielding, qadding pet as said before.  It's not that our pet is so terribly strong (never should be compared to pet classes) it's just that you notice it more as it's interrupting your spells and smacking you while you're trying to crush it's owner.  <br />
<br />
That being said:  just explain to your groups that while it is your highest level pet and it is still green it effectively is the most mana efficient DoT you have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Winkles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">On the subject of pets, should we give our pets weapons post 58 or do they not lifetap with weapons?  I've seen the little guy quad for 47 but was wondering if he would do it more often with a weapon in each hand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kazral Shadowthirst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yea, ask for a mage to hook you up. You should see some difference. And I never thought about our pets that way in duels. We are the hardest pet class to take down so the pets will go away too but at the same time, the person cant take time to focus on the pet either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Free damage is free damage.  our level 64 pet Quads for 55, as has been said... on most mobs this is 20-30 dps with haste buff up.  More, if it's got summoned pet weapons and haste.  That's over 1,000 damage/minute... it really piles up.  If you're in a situation that allows you to use a pet... use it, there's no reason not to.  If people want to laugh... screw 'em, who cares?</div></div><hr />
