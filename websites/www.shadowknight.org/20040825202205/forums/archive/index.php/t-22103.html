<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Androsulach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Some kind of cheesey MUD or maybe MOO.  I bet you're a Disco Bandit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>derakolwtf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">with comments like that its obvious you have never played. if you want to know my class just look it up on the search dumbass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Androsulach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Okay, so I just look for Derakol or is it Derakolwtf that I need to look for?  But how do you get that a cheesy php game is better than EQ?  It's as boring as some of the MUDs I've messed with in the last 10 years and not as much fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>derakolwtf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">you can look for derakol.... i dont consider EQ fun for me. id rather someone hit my balls with a hammer than play it. look for the humor in the game.... its funny and there are quests. everquest doesnt even have a haiku dungeoun??!?! wtf</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dkhar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Fandra was the best mud I ever played (circlemud heavily modified). It was owned by a group of Russians, who were all friends. And it was a PK mud... and I'm American... with a big mouth :D Great mix. It made for about 3 years of intense playing. I was #1 American pk'r ever. I would have to say in the top 3 of best pk'rs ever on the mud. And boy, did they hate me :D They even got their friends to cheat for them and I still whooped their asses on their own mud!! Muahahaa... ahhh man. It was exhilirating really. Not to mention it was the best mud setup I ever played and I tested a lot of different ones for about 6 years beforehand. It had tons of quests, lots of l33t loot and temple factions and wars. Great classes, skills and spells. Overall I rate it an 9 out of 10 and a 9 only because it's run by Russians :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Azudno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It's still around! (http://www.fandra.org/)<br />

I have my occasional flirt with MUDs, for old times sake. Think I'll try some again now that I quit EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dkhar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">.... damn man it was so hard to quit that game and you went and linked their new webpage :P Bastard. I quit EQ recently (again) so this temptation... is... not needed... damn, clicked on it already.</div></div><hr />
