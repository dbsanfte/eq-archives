<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Emanepmet Metimucil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">just wanted some opinions <br />
<br />
My DE SK was my first char i quit him at lvl 30 to play a mage now i am sick of the caster life and have leveled sk to 42 now some friends and guildies are saying i should start over as an Ogre.  Is it worth fighting my way back to lvl 42 as an ogre just for the extra strength stamina and being unstunnable? <br />
please post your opinion im torn on witch way to go<br />

  <br />
   I have considered switching off from my troll, and even tried some alts because the XP penalty was getting me down.  After a lot of looking around, trying stuff, and just plain trying to decide what it was that I really wanted, I'm still playing my troll.<br />
<br />
  The races really are well balanced in terms of usefulness, or we wouldn't be having these discussions.  After 4 years we would have figured out conclusively that brand x is the best for shadowknights, and there ya go... have fun.<br />
<br />
<br />
   If you have not played an ogre before you will find that ducking everywhere is very annoying, shrinking is less optional than you may have thought, and the mana pool really is pretty small compared to what your darkelf has.   Even if you think you can level back up to 42 pretty quickly, you could level you current char that much farther during that time and still come out ahead.   You have a lot of time invested already and a level 50 darkelf is going to be a lot more powerful than a 42 ogre in any case.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Manslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Play what you like.  Personally, I am glad I took a smaller race with higher base INT, since it is much harder for me to max that stat vs all the physical ones on raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jupke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Dont ask stupid questions and play what you like. Only advise i can give. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Azraelwrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">42 is kinda too late to reroll.  I'd stick with dark elf if you like it even though ogres are better statwise.  It doesn't hurt to look cool in armor and have high int.  <br />
<br />
On a different note, one my friends Rallos Zek server I'm playing as an iksar sk and I hate it.  Him and his dumb iksar shaman and sk plan.  Medicore int and lots of dex and agi points that aren't really needed.  I wish I made a troll, ogre, or race with high int instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tumy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I had the same question about 2 years ago...<br />
<br />
My first was a DE, I leveled him to 38 and was not happy with him at all.<br />
<br />
I took his equipment put it on a Ogre and leveled him to 38.<br />
<br />
Comparativly speaking, I decided to stick with the Ogre because of the high nat stam.  He had WAY more hp's at that level than the DE.  He hit harder on average.  He had better DPS because I wouldnt get bash and stuned.<br />
<br />
Oh a side note, his mana pool sucked ass. <br />
<br />
But...If your server is like mine you can get extended KEI in the Nexus for 15pp a shot and go level for 2-3 hours with never running out of mana.<br />
<br />
MANA REGEN is the key for all SK's.  Tis not size of mana pool.  As long as you have enough mana to kill (1) Mob A, your golden...just up your mana regen and go solo.<br />
<br />
You will end up medding the same ammount of time &quot;per mob&quot; weather you have 100 INT or 200 INT.<br />
<br />
MANA REGEN is the key, its the only thing that will allow you to solo faster.<br />
<br />
So do you want to continue your DE?  Or start a Ogre that cant be stunned from the front?  Your call, I remade mine.<br />
<br />
Im completly happy with my choice.<br />
<br />
The Ogre Cultural kicks ass, I can do Green Mist, im never stunned, my Stam is over 200, and at 55 I broke 3K HP's.<br />
<br />
This doesnt show my stat food.  I eat Misty Thicket Picnic and Qeynos Afternoon Tea.  It ups my stam to 203 and my Int to 117.  Add KEI on to that and Im at 142 INT and regening 14 mana a Tick for only 15pp....Im happy =)<br />

When I get the cash, I'm gonna take down my sentient armor and replace it with some more melee suited armor.  It also doesn't hurt to do the prayer shawl quest.</div></div><hr />
