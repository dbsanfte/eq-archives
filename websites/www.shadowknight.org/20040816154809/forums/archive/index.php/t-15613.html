<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Oogoog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anyone seen any of these drop in a while?  They are the quest piece for the Blood of Pain spell.<br />
<br />
According to all the information I can find here, they are supposed to drop from the area of the Octopus Bridge in Dulak off Servants of Hate.  Specifically some people say off the Servant that spawns in the middle of the bridge.  I have been killing here for a few hours a shot for the last 3 nights.  Not one single organ.  Could someone please let me know if I am really unlucky or I need to /bug this.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>wetwurx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">try hunting in the tunnel to the right before the bridge, area where luggald assasin spawns thats where both my organs dropped. think they dropped of one of the chef hat wearing fishheads.  If the regular spawns there are a tough fight watch out the assasins is much tougher and got him to spawn more times than organs dropped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Stugein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">wetwurx is right.  I nabbed Blood of Pain just a couple weeks ago.  After you get into the tunnel take that right-hand hallway that opens up into a large round room (well before the bridge).  I got the drops in there fairly quickly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Oogoog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ok, I will give that area a try.  I have been sitting at the fork there.  Go straight and it hits the bridge, go right and it goes to that round room you are speaking of.  The only thing I have pulled from that round room though has been the 2 right at the entrance.  I will try pulling the whole room and see what happens.  Thanks again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shakasiss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I did this quest a while ago, but i found that the deeper you go into the caves the more often the organs, blood, bile, and saliva drop.  I did the organs with a mid 50s shammy dou and then the blood, bile, and saliva with a full group.  The organs dropped really common if you go straight across the bridge to where the blackblood start appearing.  If you continue on that path and go around to the door and go through, continue down the path and then down the stairs to the bottom room of the caves you will get the blood, bile, and saliva by the time you actually set up in the bottom of the caves.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Morgrist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">For my Comatose components,I just went all the way to the back room and cleared it. Got my parts in no time,and so did my two companions.<br />
 <br />
I understand the BoP parts drop better off to the right,around where the mob that drops Soulstripper for Wis casters is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Luxem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">For the BoP spell quest, I needed those organs. The only place I could find anything that drops them was the blue dude standing in the middle of the 3-way intersection on that stone bridge by where the soulstripper spawns. Trust me, my buds and I cleaned house there for 2 days before, past, and around that area before we found that the guy on the bridge was the only one that seemed to ever drop organs. I also found that if you're careful, you can stand at that intersection, and wait for his spawn and not aggro others standing around. they conned white and dark blue at the time. I hope this helps, and for other luggald components, they drop past that bridge.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nyrvel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Just completed the Quest 8.15.03. My group hunted in the 1st tunnel to the right, Luggald Organs dropped roughly 1 in 2 kills. XP and Loot were nice, lots of gems worth 60pp+ and stackable items worth 1pp+, gained 2 levels and walked away with 900pp. Good Hunting! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dregor Thule</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I got zero luck from the first right tunnel.  I went deeper in, over the bridges, and down past the waterfall path.  That main room was the money shot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>yuggoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Went into the first room on the right, spent about 2 hours getting my 2 organs.  Both dropped off the archons there.  Also got about 700 pp in gems and stuff, so it was all good.</div></div><hr />
