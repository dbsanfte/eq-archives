<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Brelil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi. i havent played much during the holidays so i might have missed something.  After casting engulfing darkness I cast fear.  The problem I am having is when the fear lands the mob poofs somewhere in zone and usually comes back a few minutes later full health and mad. Is this a bug?<br />

Thanks Brelil  29 DE SK</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ohsmondis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just wanted to let you know that the same thing was happening to me in Eastern Wastes.  After casting Doom  I would ussually dot with heat blood the cast fear and poof.  I think of the 8 or 9 times this happened I only had a named giant only actually come back.  I waited for the others but they never came back.<br />
