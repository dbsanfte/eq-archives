<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pelter</div><div class="date">07-10-2004, 07:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The ruins with skeletons in DL, up by the nexus port thingy (been so long since I used that I actually forgot the name lol). Plenty of skeletons that are easy to fearkite (using cheap panic undead) or just tanked if your twinked enough. Good quiet spot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Belyle</div><div class="date">07-11-2004, 12:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used to fear kite in KC at that lvl.  Use the short duration fear so mobs dont go to far, and being able to bash em to halt movement is helpful.  You can use the zone line area, also the arena where vs lives works too.  Have to be able to gate to get out of arena though.</div></div><hr />

Your also at a minimum (or pretty close to it) on pet usefulness.  I would stick to the old world for xp (mobs have a LOT less hitpoints there).<br />
<br />
Take a look at EQ atlas and see where grouping for 40 - 45s is good.  That is probably a reasonable place to solo.</div></div><hr />

At 47 you may still be able to get exp in SolB. I'm not sure if i left there at 47 or 48. <br />
ATM I am in Tower Of Frozen shadows. I hunted the Sleeping skeletons on the Third floor (single pulls except for a camp of 2, which can be singled via aggro pulling). IF theese skeletons get booring to you. head up to the fourth floor. the key here is to find out where the pit traps are (Theres an excellent guide to TOFS on RPGexpert, and of course EQatlas for ,maps) I pulled my mobs down through the pit traps where i could fight/kite them without fear of any adds. currently about to ding 49 There. probable gonna see too many Lblues to make it worth it. most hopefuly can advance ot the next floor to see what awaits there.<br />
<br />
I found this much quicker and more rewarding experence than the DL Plaguebone thief camp.<br />
<br />
Good luck sir.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Belyle</div><div class="date">07-12-2004, 12:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm i also used to fear kite LDC's in solb with the short duration fear.  If ya get more then one just fear the others off till you get one dead then FD and wait for reset.  Alot of times i did it right in the stone spider room, until he spawned at least.<br />
If you have decent magic resist, the bats are super easy to kill just outright tanking them to death.  Spot i used for that was the sola zoneline in the bat cave.</div></div><hr />

Do you mean Karnor's Castle when you say KC?  From what I understand, KC is on the same faction as the Outpost in the Overthere.  I wouldn't recommend lowering Outpost faction since that is where we start our quest for Innoruuk's Curse.  Am I mistaken about the faction in Karnor's Castle?  Please correct me if that is indeed the case.  Good hunting!</div></div><hr />
