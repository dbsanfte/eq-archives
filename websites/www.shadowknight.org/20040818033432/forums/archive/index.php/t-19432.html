<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Quick question...finally decided to zone into Howling Stones...problem...didn't bring my gate potion. Is there anyway I can get out other than getting a porter or a rogue to get me out? I see the exits on the map, are they possible to get to from zone in? Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Duh?<br />
<br />
You'd have to kill your way through north wing (or parts of it at least) to get out though,  easiest way, pretty much. Oh, and kill stuff at zonein to get the key to north wing of course.<br />
<br />
Not sure but you might also be able to go through the east door from zonein by levi'ing there and running down to the porter at the end of south wing, don't remember if there was anything in the way that was locked or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Duh? I was asking a simple question...first time in zone, not familiar with it. I do know that some doors are locked in the zone, so I was asking kindly. Thanks for the heads up.<br />

Was just in there a few days ago.<br />
<br />
As you go through the east wing to Drusella's room, there is a locked door at the end of the hall just before the room with the porter, which requires the east wing or master key.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ganodoar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Here is another interesting tidbit to add. Silvershadow may have mentioned it but I couldn't tell if he was talking about the portal in the east wing or the one in the south wing. <br />
<br />
Guildie found out there are two portals that lead outside to the Overthere. The first, as Groff pointed out, is past Drusella's Room and indeed requires the master key, east wing key, or a rogue with 200+ picklock skill. However, not many people know this but there is another portal. The portal in the south wing is located just before the invisible wall you go through if you were heading to the east wing. <br />
<br />
So looks like there are 2 ways to escape Howling Stones without a porter or a gate potion/OT hammer. I do not know for sure though if there are any locked doors on the way to the portal besides the entrance door to the south wing. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Melil Eskay</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My old main was a rogue and I spent tons of time in HS (long before the master key was in game and since wing keys were no drop and no rent we never bothered - didn't have to).<br />
<br />
There is a locked door before each of the portals in South and East wing - I don't remember what the keys are.  Don't get these portals confused with the ones in North and West which just bring you back to zone in.<br />
<br />
The door to go into South wing is locked, but you can get in using the key you get from West(?) which you get a key to from North(?) which you get a key from killing at zone in.  Sound fun yet?<br />
<br />
Now of course you can get into the East wing by leving up (those stairs are fake) and running over - the door is not locked.  BUT, you can't backtrack to the South wing from there.  The false wall in that first room only comes IN from South and NOT back to South.  Follow so far?  Good.<br />
<br />
Now, while you are trying to hunt for the keys don't forget that there are some trapped rugs.  One in each wing that drops you down to the basement.  If that happens you need to find your way to the teleporter in the middle to get back to zone in.  Going through the teleporter does NOT clear aggro.<br />
<br />
Ok, so with all that said, just get a rogue friend to lead you or better yet a porter friend to port you.  Otherwise you will most likely spend many hours trying to find keys and get through.<br />

p.s. Undertakers HT for 731 so it only takes a few of them to turn the tables on a fight - depending upon your gear of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Amphitryon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Just to clarify..fighting your way to the end of the North Wing does NOT get you out of the zone, it just lands you back at the zone in. You are still inside.<br />
<br />
Note on XP there.<br />
<br />
I went in and hung out at the zone in (im 60 SK) with a 65 enchanter and just completely obliterated all the entry way mobs (golems, undead and sperms). The AA XP for the 65 was nothing to sneeze at, after a less than an hour of then gor him he was up 3-4% of an AA without breaking a sweat. (ok, NO, its not BoT but then again its steadu XP w/o a lot of work)<br />
<br />
Me? grouped with him i raked in 20% of an AA in that time (which is why I wanna stay 60 for a long time..the places to hunt are like endless for me at this point<br />
<br />
otherwise, I go in there with my 2-boxed cleric (shes 54) and work the zone in and the entry to the North Wing. I can easliy get an AA during each session I go there now and come back with about 1kpp in plat loot + spell drops..and thats just the zone in. If ya go deeped the mobs are consitantly higher level (of course).<br />
<br />
gotta love zones wit a built in + XP modifier</div></div><hr />
