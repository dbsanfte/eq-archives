<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Daemoness</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've done a few adventure's not the most fun in world (special after ginding out over 2.5k AP in 3 days on my mage&gt;&lt;).<br />
<br />
Well, anyways the biggest problem is the groups are less then ideal cause of my play times. This is where he problem kicks in alot i mean alot of the random people I group with are tools and the biggest problems are (this is when im MA and puller)<br />
<br />
1.)There is a monk or another SK (or any class i guess) in the group while im pulling, they take it upon them selves to follow me while pulling often running ahead and agro up 5 more mobs on their own accord or smiply screwing up paci.<br />
<br />
2.) A rogue or monk in the group while im pulling follows me to about half way inbetween the group and myself and jump the mobs before i get them back to the rest of the group. On top of that they refuse to pull back.<br />
<br />
 Ok, those are 2 main problems im faceing in LDoN at the moment, is there anything that I can do? Or shell I stick to a mix spaming group chat unil they get a clue and avoiding ldon until later lvls ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Train them couple of times when u FD and they will start hanging back more</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes, I've always been a fan of the &quot;If they're being stupid, they deserve to be made dead&quot; approach. It works well, as even the most idiotic monk/druid/ranger/dumbass learns that death = bad, and that being stupid = death.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dakkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You can't control the real muppets.  But you can herd the ignorant a little.<br />
<br />
Set up raid monk-style pulling buttons for your groups:<br />
<br />
MOVE UP - DON'T PASS ME<br />
<br />
and<br />
<br />
WAIT HERE WHILE I PULL<br />
<br />
Watch your pulls so they don't get too long because if the group decides to creep up on you they'll go right to the doorway of your next packed room.<br />
<br />
Reaching back in my memory for spells used at 55 so bear with me - this is just what I did myself at 55, not suggesting everyone else does it:<br />
<br />
Manaregen at 55 is an issue and dooming darkness is heavy on mana to use for every pull.<br />
<br />
I used BE gauntlets (mana-free light snare), and memmed engulfing darkness too.<br />
<br />
Pull with the gaunts unless you need to snare/FD split.<br />
<br />
If someone jumps a single mob inbound, chain cast clinging/engulfing alternately from your spell gems till it leaves them.  They'll soon give up because playing chase-the-mob-back-to-camp isn't nearly as much fun as deliberately messing up someone's pull.<br />
<br />
If the pull's a multiple, your light snared mob should arrive slightly after the adds, so muppet will jump the adds first.  Then you can chain cast CD/engulfing on the MA mob if needed to bring it back to camp while they die to the adds.<br />
<br />
Not sure if this helps but from memory it's more or less what I used to do at your level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dkhar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Option #1 Simply state, do you want to pull or you want to let me do my job ? If they are an ass about it... go to option two.<br />
<br />
Option #2 Fight the mob with your OT hammer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I really like the stupidity=death approach alot, many many many dead people I can think of in raids I've purposely let/made die for idiocy (or afk... same fun either way).  People should be expected to know how to perform their role with a reasonable amount of competent in exp groups post 50.<br />
<br />
In the case of #1. learn to get by without paci first of all, second of all just tell them flat out, &quot;If I see you within 100 feet of me while I'm pulling you will die, along with possibly everyone else in the group, your next warning will be LOADING PLEASE WAIT&quot;, in the case of #2 tell them that if they jump the mob while you're still running back to camp you can't get aggro, and it makes your job 10x harder so in the interest of simplicity they can tank the mob next time they do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Oagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You're playing with dweebs that don't have a fucking clue about group tactics and class roles.  The fact that they have made it to post 50 shows mudflation works very well.  <br />
<br />
These people don't know what to do, because no one has told them what to do.  You have two options:<br />
<br />
1.  Spell it out to them.  Give them one chance.  Explain it before you go in.<br />
<br />
2.  If they don't want to listen, train their ass and let them die.  Then, leave the adventure, and go get a another group.<br />
<br />
I am seeing more and more skill-less idiots in open/pickup groups nowdays.  A good working group is a rarity, and fun.  A bad one, most common, and sucks.  <br />
<br />
I was in a pickup group in PoV last week where the replacement cleric brought 5 mobs with him to the back cave camp, instead of waiting.  I told the idiots my shaman could heal until we could get the cleric there safely.  They didn't want to listen.  I FD'ed the sk, gated the shaman, and went to Droga afterwards.  <br />
<br />
They all wound up in the GY.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Space</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">yup its getting sad out there im afraid to try normal ldons with some of these people i watch clerics thinking their tanks with more aa's in scf than healing makes me wanna scream.  I was never in danger of dying i self heal but  you see a caster just flop and die cause clerics to busy nuking and melee heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Another idea would be to just pass off pulling duties in the normal Ldon groups to whomever seems to follow you out when you're doing it...we've never really been the best pullers in those adventures overall. Our skilled version of pulling is too slow for such relatively easy content with a time constraint. In LDoN we are really most efficient in a tanking role, plus doing the occasional complicated pull/split.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bloodbrood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Communication is the foundation of any good group so the more communication the better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ashrai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">My two biggest peeves in LDON right there. <br />
<br />
First of all, for those of us who remember when getting into your 50's meant that you'd spend a really long time playing, we assume that being in your 50's mean: you don't do stupid shit. However these days, an LDoN with mid 50's usually means some of the folks you are entering an enclosed space with have maybe 1-2 weeks playtime. <br />
<br />
For the first situation, I have no tolerance whatsoever. No excuse for following a puller. Had a mage in an LDoN recently that liked to follow me, or poke his head into rooms, etc. Waited until he did it again, he agro'd a mob, his pet started in on it.... and I left him there to try to keep his pet alive, went back to the group, and had them follow me a different way. Shammy took pity on him and went and found him and the pet and saved their asses. Idiots who want to cowboy off on their own and agro shit: welcome to solo'ing LDoN. <br />
<br />
For the trigger happy people (Beastlords seem to be especially prone to this, and like to send that hugeass cat on my mob before it's actually entered the room- and of course since they can't position for shit the bigass cat ends up blocking the way.) Once again, no tolerance and no worries if they die. Someone engages the mob before it's safely in - or they hop on it and stick it where it can't be pulled back- they can tank it. I'll be FD'd over here watching your stupid proccing pet get reamed.<br />
<br />
Way to deal with that if they won't listen even after Death has taught them a lesson: sit kite it in. Agro spell of your choice, sit, and scoot backwards and drag it to you. That will usually pull the mob out of the mess of early engagers to where you want it unless it's physically blocked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>XebarisTP</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">What annoys me the most is group leaders who won't just pick any lfg people for a normal adv, but hang around trying to assemble the &quot;optimal&quot; dps group..<br />
<br />
Me: there's a pally lfg right there..<br />
Leader: NO!!! Have tank!! Need DPS!!!!!! DPS!!!!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Ok.... were you in my subconcious?  I had the same thing...damn that mage :mad: <br />
<br />
What annoys me the most is group leaders who won't just pick any lfg people for a normal adv, but hang around trying to assemble the &quot;optimal&quot; dps group.. <br />
<br />
Yup - agree with you there... I know what is needed for a group,  Tank, Healer, .. errrmm... yeah, thats it.. maybe a puller if the tank can't pull or doesn't want to.  But thats 3 other spots to fill.  Who cares what it is!!   Don't NEED mez, OT, DPS, Nukes, Slows.  They help sure, but not NEEDED!  Take what there is to offer, since you get more exp in a dungeon that sitting on your ass waiting for some class to become LFG.  I've done 2 hard adv with 4 people... they were hard, but better exp then waiting for 2 more people to go LFG.<br />
<br />
Ok, now, im only 37, they aren't exactly hard at this level, as I can tank 3 - 4 mobs a time with a cleric healer and no slow, in a Hard adv.  But it still means people can die if they are st00pid.  i have a standard speil at the begining that states anyone moving outta the designated room will tank what ever I bring in... I don't care what class it is.   I'll say move when they can move to next room, if I don't say move, they don't move or they die!!<br />
<br />
Im 9 from 9 at the moment and hope to carry that 100% rate through to lvl 65 and 100's of AA's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Dkhar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Will never happen. You'll run into a few bad ldon's here and there. I've lost at least 5 due to 3-4 people going LD 5 times each and just plain running out of time. <br />
<br />
Had a full 6 person group go in and 3 of them went LD immediately and never came back. We pushed on ahead with just us 3 (SK, SHM, BRD) and killed 48 out of 51 in a slaughter. Lost but damn it was hard and fun. <br />
<br />
I lost a couple because I gated out on some dumbasses that were just pissing me off and wasting my time. The worst was a Beastlord (Godzzilla I hate your guts) who thought he could tank better than me and pull and heal and pretty much just do it himself (he had 150 more hp than me but 5 levels lower). So I let him. I love my OT hammer. We probably would have won but I hate big headed uber people that never shut up about how cool they are and how much better they can do your job even though their class may not be designed for it. I'm not hateful or jealous, I just want to do my job not sit back and be delegated the dps guy who can barely out-dps his own pet while you go on and on about 10billionplat_item_002.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Daemoness</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Thanks for the help, I've had the weekend to deal with some of these groups. After about 10mins on my first adv i gave up on chaining CD and ED (too much hard work the group didnt deserve). Instead I would pull and if even one of then screwed it up I'd just FD and go make a coffee in time to pull another one.<br />
 Although in one adventure i watch a druid kill him self 2 or 3 times wake mezzed mobs up with targeted AoE's... much pointing and laughing to be had.<br />
 Over all though I have found getting groups in PoJ/PoN and PoI the people as a whole have more of a cule of whats going on then the people in ldon.</div></div><hr />

Depending on the dungeon, sometimes not even this. Fastest and most fun LDoN I've ever been in was 5 epic mages and 1 enchanter.<br />

THANK YOU!!<br />
Not all mage's are idiots but there's far far far too many of them out there for my taste. Hopefully the twit you had in your group will learn something before getting into a zone where a stupid decision won't only kill him but will also kill the entire group/raid.<br />
<br />

Situations like this amuse me more than anything. Having the ability to purchase +HP gear in the bazaar doesn't mean you know what you're doing. Also doesn't mean you can tank. It simply means you can take more damage before buying the farm.<br />
<br />
Reminds me of an ldon I did with another SK. The other SK was one level higher than I was at the time. She claimed she had twinked her SK from her main in the early levels (upon &quot;accidently&quot; inspecting her, it appeared half her gear was Paludal Caverns drops) and was going to purchase more upgrades in the bazaar with her main.<br />
<br />
However (her story at least) while she was running through West Karana with more twink money on her main (50k or something like that) she got killed. She had to log for a week long vacation and when she got back her corpse had rotted with the 50k in plat on her, which is why she had worse armor and weapons than I (just some dumbass non-twink newb) did. :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
BTW.....anybody dare venture a guess how much 50k plat weighs? And how fast somebody can run carrying that much coin?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kyfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I know on my old wiz long long ago pre-bazaar I did a trade in EC for 7500pp and couldn't move even one step :) . I had to call for rescue from a guildmate with SoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Talonmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I've found its best to judge people by the guild tags.  Since so many people are now 58+ you can't trust that pickups will know what they are doing.  Hopefully you know your server well enough to know what guilds tend to have members who know what they are doing.<br />
<br />
Its not a perfect system, but it beats starting an adventure and discovering 3 of 6 are complete asshats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Putrid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Daemoness said:  Over all though I have found getting groups in PoJ/PoN and PoI the people as a whole have more of a cule of whats going on then the people in ldon<br />
<br />
The lower planes are usually very easy hunting areas with rather static spawns or predicatable wanderers, so it is easy to be mediocre and survive.  LDONS mobs are close to your level and often come in waves.  That does not leave as much room for error, so player and group deficiencies become more obvious.<br />
<br />
Pickup groups were horrible when LDON first came out and then got better as more people got used to them.  I am guessing most of those players got bored and moved on and now a new wave of pickup players are starting the cycle again.  Good luck.<br />
<br />
Make a list of players you participate in LDONs with that you liked and did well.  Give them a tell when you log on.   That is the easiest way to get a good non-guild LDON group.</div></div><hr />
