Just got back on eq after almost a year off, trying to upgrade sum pieces, but dont have alot of time to group. Seems eq has slimmed up a bit, not as many people now, BoT is empty an thats where i would go to exp/get loot but w/o many peps there groups aint happening much. Trying to get any advice on stuff I could go solo or maybe duo if buddies are on. Not just equipment upgrades but utility items or other useful things a SK could use. The mindless exp grind gets to me so heading off solo i find way more entertaining. I read about &quot;Wand of imperception ( maybe spelled wrong )&quot; that has perm. clicky shrink, would i be able to handle that on my own or not? Any advice or tips would be greatly appreciated, thanks much in advance</div></div><hr />

No, I don't think so.  You will need to keep clear a camp in the deep with quite a few mobs and then bring out named.  He can't be snared, so its straight up tanking.  I think you could do that, but not sure you could keep the camp clear.</div></div><hr />

Look on Alla's and see what pieces from that zone would be upgrades for you, and you can probably solo some of them, while others you will need a slower/healer for. Check it out, go yourself and see how hard it is, if shit hits the fan just click FD and mosy your way out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you have a number of items that you could upgrade easily in the bazaar...for limited sums...e.g earring , bracers, neck item, etc.<br />
<br />
both GoD and OoW have a large range of droppable items with mid range hp...e.g +40 to +60hp that go very cheaply now that there is droippable gear that has 100+ hp for sale....have a look...do some searching in the bazaar....and upgrade your easy pieces that way...then there are a rnge of items you can go after solo like you suggested...but youll be even better equiped to do so...<br />
<br />
and there are plenty of places you cold solo for cash and or easily sellable tradeskill items etc. if you are short of cash at the moment...since the types of items im talking about wont cost you 10k+ each...<br />
<br />
my opinion anyways....<br />

Crossing my fingers for a time i win sumthing sweet and can easily get myself back to par, but not holding my breath on it.</div></div><hr />

If you truly want to upgrade, go get pelts and silks and whatnot.  They still sell well in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
Plus, I know quite a few Shadow Knights are buying tailoring supplies right now (like me).</div></div><hr />

It'd be some exp and very nice cash for you, so you can buy better gear... (the hallway down to Mauvin, in case you are unfamiliar with what spot I mean)</div></div><hr />

<br />
concievably you could solo the pieces needed for a Sprit Wracked Cord, another Bracer of Benevolence (prolly duo at least), the 70hp ring from Chardok B (shammy duo prolly) and things like that.  However, a better suggestion would be just doing the exp grind in WOS.  Just about every piece you need upgraded drops in WOS either from random in zone or from named camps.  A new 1 hander, shield, bracer, boots, ring, shoulders, cloak are all fairly abtainable.  <br />
<br />
To break up the boredom i suggest going to Muramite Proving grounds.  This might be a bit too much for you to tank with your current gear however there is GREAT no drop loots that drop there most of the time and you can usually just OOC for upgrades.  ITs a great spot to go LFG and try and get stuff as it rots.  Warclasp earring 125hp and stats, maze runner mask 145hps and stats, maze runner ring 125hps Cleave 1 and stats etc etc.  <br />
<br />
Either way, not only will the loot you get will have a substaintial effect on your char but the amount of exp/aa you get will extremely help you from where you are restarting at.<br />
<br />
The shear fact of the matter is that there isnt much you can solo with your gear and AA that is gonna do anything for you.  If you are low on time, try LDoN as a last resort.  Most groups blow threw them in like 30 mins or so now and you can always use the points for armor upgrades and HP aug upgrades.<br />
<br />
sorry if i wasnt a help but if you have any questions, keep asking<br />

EDIT: also a suggestion, max out your PoP defensive/HP aa As soon as you can to help your soloing/grouping out.</div></div><hr />
