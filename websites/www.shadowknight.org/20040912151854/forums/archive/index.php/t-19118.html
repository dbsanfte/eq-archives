Pros:  You haven't made one yet.<br />
Cons: You are thinking of making one.<br />
<br />
Also, whats the pros and concs of the Dark Elf Race if I was to pick one for a Shadowknight?  <br />
<br />
Pros:  They're short and they're blue<br />
Cons:  Lots of manginas like you make female dark elves and put them in leather and turn on the old models so they can see their blue asses.</div></div><hr />

<br />
   Pro's of a shadowknight:<br />
1. We are fun to play (We can solo we can group we can dish out damage like a tank)<br />
2. We CAN solo realtively well...having dinged 56 I spend most of my time soloing PoJ mobs because I hate grouping with retards in PoN or PoV...curse you eBay...<br />
3. Deadly DoTs...hey they may not be as good as a necro or druid..or even a shammy but they DO help in fights. Dueling is wicked with these when your teleporting yourself around and the other guy can't do more than walk and have his health ate away at.<br />
<br />
   Con's of a shadowknight:<br />
1. Bad faction is the obvious one but it never really stopped me except when I was level 12 and going to sisterhood isle to kill elves I died a couple of times...<br />
2. There are...too many. Everyone and their little bro seems to play a shadowknight.<br />
3. Sometimes confused with shammy...<br />
<br />
   Pro's for the inkie:<br />
1. Good Dex and Int...the Ultra Vision is great to have at many times<br />
2. Wicked cool in armor nuff said<br />
3. AWESOME RP abilities...<br />
<br />
   Con's<br />
1. Sort of weak...<br />
2. Nektulos sucks I think...there are too many newbies there KSing everyone and whinin'<br />
3. So cool everyone wants to inspect you (Same goes for everyone but...I mean really I hate that...)<br />
<br />
Hope that helps in someway I have yet to see =)<br />
<br />
p.s If you want nice people go somewhere else...these guys are jerks...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Avixious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The advice is short lived, I played a druid up to about 40 back in the day, despised the class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Koldariah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I hate to break it to you but playing a Druid and playing a Shadowknight are very similar. Actually, with the exception of being able to melee and not being able to port / SoW there isn't a fuck of alot of difference - sorry to the druid haters - but its true. <br />
<br />
Playing a Druid is a piece of cake...any retard can do it, but it takes skill, perserverence and the ability to do whatever it takes to play a Druid WELL. Any asshole can play a Shadowknight, but to be able to say 'fuck it' and continue playing your character the way you want to play, to be able to make a role for yourself even when all the roles seem to be gone, to be able to do whatever it takes is the difference between a good Shadowknight and a shitty one...sound familar? Likely not.. unless you had any skill playing a druid you wouldnt have a clue what Im talking about.<br />
<br />
If you couldn't handle playing your druid..I highly doubt you will do any better with the SK. If you couldn't handle the 'pressure' of healing while also root parking adds, snaring every single mob and making sure that you were watching everything and everyone around you at all times just in case you had to evac you definately wont like the 'pressure' as an SK. Shadowknights not only tank mobs, they tank while watching everything around them to make sure that they can handle it when shit goes bad. Thier harmony pulling is done by feigning, thier snare is darkness, they tap for heals and use zev instead of 9 to give mana, they mez tank instead of rooting for crowd control and HT to finish off a mob. <br />
<br />
Any idiot can play a hybrid..it's not a matter of pro's and con's,its a matter of being willing to do whatever is required to make a role for yourself, because sure as shit your not going to get one handed to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Avixious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It is quite easy to be most effective at any class, especially if one has been playing since beta. You suck whatever you need to suck up, and pull through to complete whatever it is at the current time in the game. In manner of speaking, I love doing this, I love being under any and all pressure. I love playing Enchanters, something is so pleasurable by being able to mez, and keep mezzed 6 different lvl 50 mobs while keeping buffs up and slowing a lvl 60 mob(I haven't played Enchanter for about a year, so it is a tad bit different now in more modern dungeons I'd presume). I stopped playing my druid because it was boring. If I died the group wouldn't die with me, the role was vastly foreign from the types of pressure I grew accustomed to as an Enchanter. I guess it just doesn't measure up to the fun Enchanters bring. Like I said, I only played the Druid to 40, so I am not grand master of Druids and all things of them. They do sound funner at the highest of levels though, and I do wish I stuck with my Druid a tad bit longer.<br />
<br />
One reason ShadowKnights are one of the least played classes, and this is just an educated guess mind you, is that the majority of the current SKs are total pricks. I have noticed on this forum that at least 40% of the people here are total nazi fucks, although nazis would probably be nicer and more helpful. If someone asks for help on equipment or something, god help them. I can tell, you Koldariah, are obviously not laid-back. I give a simple opinion and you &quot;help me&quot; with something I would expect from a marine. Unless you are subtly implying the pro's/con's of SKs, or DEs, that post is perhaps more worthless than Groffs. Offensive class indeed.<br />
<br />
Thank god SKs don't have very many buffs to cast on others, because most who play the class would never cast them on others! I honestly think I'll just skip the SK class and create a new Enchanter.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Avixious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">It's your job to keep them bitching apparently.</div></div><hr />

If anything make an SK and  play him well. Some people just are jerks plain off the get go...I think it's funny how they troll these boards looking for people to bash. *Wispers* I think they are all trying to compensate personally...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Koldariah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I will be the first to admit that Im not laid back..unless I'm on my back :p Actually I'm quite the Bitch, worked hard at it..took a long time to perfect  *bows*<br />
<br />
I figured you were trying to decide if you would enjoy playing an SK. A good way to decide is to try and compare it to something else in your experience. You stated that you didn't care for your druid so I was trying to help you understand the similarities so that you could make an educated choice. You did not mention that you played an Enchanter, you did mention a Druid. <br />
something is so pleasurable by being able to mez, and keep mezzed 6 different lvl 50 mobs while keeping buffs up and slowing a lvl 60 mob<br />
This is how it feels to play a druid to full potential. Without a chanter we do ghetto CC. Keeping 5 or 6 mobs snared and rooted while keeping DS/ buffs up and healing or patch healing as required. I will admit that playing my SK has not ever been quite that exciting, but it is sometimes along the same lines. <br />
<br />
Pro's and Con's are not something I deal with..just like you said..&quot;You suck whatever you need to suck up, and pull through to complete whatever it is at the current time in the game&quot; so far, I havent noticed to may things too horribly bad about playing an SK..they arent as powerful as I'd like, They solo reasonably well when required. If you are willing to work a little you will not usually have a problem finding a group - given it will likely be a little bit harder as an SK than it was for your chanter.. No way to make uber loot sellin KEI for plat either :p<br />
<br />
I love the control I have when I'm in a mobs face..being able to move it where I want it...give the roges some back to stab, or get it away from a caster fast. As far as SK's being pricks...I will agree with you, but I would also trust most of these pricks to have a clue about how to play thier class, I guess it goes with the territory :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Grimrod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Shadowknights in my opinion are the most self sufficient melee in the game when it comes to soloing overall .  Yes other classes can do more here or there but overall, SK's are the best imo.  The hard thing is choosing the race you like the most.  Took me over 4 months to decide on a race leveling up various sk's.  Pick one you like and go for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>DiggleDoggyfeets</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Originally posted by Groff Gorespiller <br />
There are no benefits, you should roll a druid and begone.  <br />
<br />
Yesss... join the evil empire. :p <br />
<br />
Pros of Sks:<br />
Can solo all the way up,<br />
At 30 we are the only tanks that can invis,<br />
We can also FD at 30 for pulling,<br />
Our HT does massive damage when we pump it up with AAs (I've heard people say 8.8k, haven't gotten there myself as I'm still working on my tanking AAs),<br />
When we need to we can really put the hurt on something,<br />
Behind druids we are on of the most self-sufficant classes in the game.<br />
<br />
Cons: <br />
Besides being dependant on mana for agg can't think of anything, I'm sure pallies are in the same boat.<br />
<br />
DE pros:<br />
2nd highest starting int,<br />
Good starting dex/agi<br />
Best starting nightvision,<br />
Best looking (I started out as a human, but rerolled around 40 to become a DE because I'm vain) seriously DEs blow people away on looks.<br />
<br />
Cons:<br />
DESK is a cliche, everyone and their cat has one,<br />
I'd say faction but that's been thrown out the window:rolleyes: <br />
Gnomes have better stats all-around.:confused: <br />
<br />
P.S. Suprised noone has mentioned this yet but the search function is your friend. Don't be a Gnome, Gnome's bad:mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Calamity_Daemon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Personally, I'd reroll an iksar not that I think about it...they look way cooler than any other race put together...(matter of opinion of course...my friend thinks they look like turds in armor...)</div></div><hr />

Heh imo that is too and Iksar can't wear the really good stuff the other races can later into the game. And just wanting to state my small opinion is that ive had the most fun playing the SK out of all the classes, and it makes me feel like the epic is more sacred (probably because its a good and evil thing)</div></div><hr />

If you do, it doesn't even make sense to use the word when describing someone on this board, as I don't think any of us are out killing Jews or trying conquer Europe for Germany.<br />

My ongoing plans for total world domination pretty much by definition require conquering Europe otherwise it'd be partial world domination.  Of coarse im doing it for my sake and not for germany.  Now where'd i put those fricken laser beams.....</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>brab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">LOL I just knew some of these posters were frustrated druids or enchanters,thier best skill is repost and repost again.SK class is just fun whichever race you play snares,lifetaps,bobbing corpse ,a nice black horse ,pre pop fear,one of the few classes that work well in all expansions.Also the joy of killing good race guards  or just FDing on a camp stealer ,some of the nicest AA abilities and the ability to invis and summon your corpse.<br />
Cons getting stuck in the raid group with no or a lousy healer because you can take care of yourself.The new your taunt has failed and having all your spells resisted including HT. And the biggest one is listening to warriors and monks whine how SKs should be nerfed instead of learning to play thier classes.<br />
Working on my 5th different race SK now still fun to play,have 7 different classes with AAs and truefully no where near as fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">A true cost/benefit analysis is not just pro's cons<br />
It's analyzing the value of that you must put in and comparing it to the value of what you get out of it.<br />
Just listing our useful skills is not enough for an analysis.<br />
Just as an NPV calculation will tell you the time value of money so a good cost/benefit analysis of SK's should tell you the value of your time spent.<br />
<br />
That being said the following is not a good cost/benefit analysis rather just rambling while I take a short break at work.<br />
<br />
SK's require time building up spells skills to ensure that you can get  less fizzles.  So 1hr time + 25pp for int buffs and clarity = more likely to be able to FD and invis. - Worth time investment<br />
<br />
SK's can wear armor from the highest class of armor in the game (plate).  Plate is (relatively)expensive but adds (generally) better AC. - Worth money investment<br />
<br />
SK's have pets that add damage and become the equivalent of a very mana efficient DoT, but can be hard to keep alive. - pick 'em<br />
<br />
okay running out of time...skip to the wrap up...<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
SK's sacrifice straight DPS/faction for verastility - Personal Preference <br />
<br />
Sk's are a blast, take time with you're SK.  Train all the skills with care.  It's like forplay the more care you take at the beginning the more fun you can have in the long run.  No not everything you spend time will be essential but it may just lead to more fun.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>shadowfox98</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I play chanter and sk, both at lvl 50+ and both started in 2001.  (I'm a slow lvler can't play much ) The Sk is rarely asked to join a group, chanter always has a group .  However when there are 20 war a few pally's and some monks LFA or LFG sitting on thier tails.  SK can go killing.  I play acording to my mood.  It's emensly fun to Mezz 6-10 mobs and play tag till the cleric and tanks can take them out.  But for anger managment, and just plain an excape from pestering.  You can't beat an SK.  Don't care what race you play.  A high end SK is death on steroids.<br />
<br />
That and SK is far easier to play after a few drinks, because you can usually find a warrior to MT and Necro to snare/Dot...In that case no one notices if you are a tad out of normal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>shadowfox98</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Oh yeah, and I forgot to mention the absolute roflmao FUN sk trains can be.  get to lvl 25-30 and run through nethumbrian tunnels till you ahve a few hundred mobs on your tail ( so they can kill the guards) FD at the zone line (incase it fails)  and watch the chaos<br />
<br />
A train like that can Ping pong for hours as people travel to DSP or MS.  It's a sick pleasure, but that's why I'm an SK.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Doryshan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">From a non-elemental Planes view of the game.<br />
<br />
SK Pros<br />
1) Plate Class melee with a wide array of melee and utility spells.<br />
<br />
2) Feign Death and Invis<br />
<br />
3) Hide<br />
<br />
4) Sk.org &lt;-- the people who know the class and have applied their stat analysis knowledge to working out what happens behind the UI.<br />
<br />
SK Cons<br />
1) A time consuming Epic that will test first your patience, then your determination, then finally your sheer bloodymindedness not to be beaten by a game.<br />
<br />
2) Faction &lt;-- a minor one as I enjoy the few places with which I built good faction.<br />
<br />
3) Sk.org &lt;-- those who have become bitter about the class but hang on for god knows what.<br />
<br />
DE Pros<br />
1) Ultravision &lt;--- when it is dark for my SK, I know it is positively stygian for  the other toons with me.<br />
<br />
2) Racial skill of Hide at 50% from 1st level.<br />
<br />
3) Decent starting Int<br />
<br />
4) Good newbie equipment quest.<br />
<br />
DE Cons<br />
1) Front Stunnable &lt;-- compared to  Ogre SKs<br />
.<br />
2) No Regen &lt;-- compared to Troll and Iksar Sk's<br />
<br />
3) Lower str at start than Ogre and Troll Sks.<br />
<br />
Hmmm there is probably more but these are my initial thoughts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">There's a reason people here kind of come across as assholes.  And to be honest, I kind of like the atmosphere here.<br />
<br />
We're evil classes.  Don't expect people that are attracted to a dark knight to be the friendliest around.  Our class is dark and scheming, we play dark and scheming, and we hold others at arms length.<br />
<br />
We're self sufficient, and by extension, often loners.<br />
<br />
We also take pride in the fact that, at least at one point, we were the least played class, and perservered.  We resent the fact that when we became the 'favored class of the day', all the assholes quit their monks and druids and started SK's, and that these twinks often stunk up the class in general.<br />
<br />
I think the old axiom from this forum is still true.  If you have to *ask* if the shadowknight is for you, it's not.<br />
<br />
We're not heros, we're not the best at anything.  We're good at a lot of things, but since we lack a clearly defined role, we're often left behind for pure classes.  We have to play many times harder than a warrior and play twice as well to be given a second thought as a tank in many raiding guilds... unless you just so happen to be short on warriors *and* paladins that day.  Shadowknights take a hell of a lot of effort to be truly powerful.... but that truly powerful shadowknight is a rare and terrible thing to behold.<br />
<br />
As a shadowknight, you'll spend hours and days with your /lfg tag on, passed up as a tank for warriors and monks, passed up as a puller for enchanters, monks, bards... passed up as dps by many classes... there's more than one point on the 'power curve' that we're waaay behind other classes.<br />
<br />
You can't rely on the merits of your class to be popular.  In fact, you probably won't be popular.  You have to rely on your grit and skill to be favored.  If you want a garaunteed raid role, play an enchanter or a cleric, or even a warrior.  If you love getting groups quick.... cleric, chanter, bard is for you.<br />
<br />
SK's are also very 'busy' classes to play, if you play them well.  I hit most of the spells on my spell bar, most of the fights I'm in.  You'll often be pulling, tanking, and snaring, so you dont' get to sit and get a rest at any point.  As puller and tank in many groups, your skill will be key to that groups success.  You will be adaptable, independant, self reliant, and have a lot to offer single group situations as an SK.  You'll be relegated to a support role on raids, especially in larger guilds.<br />
<br />
Advantages of dark elf:<br />
NOT a gnome<br />
ultravision<br />
int<br />
<br />
Disadvantages<br />
weak<br />

P.S.  be Annonamous so you don't upset your guild.  :)  <br />

There is a command you can type to see anon peoples guilds, I don't remember it right at the moment but my wife did it while transfering pp from FV to Prexus. The guy was Anon so she typed in some command to see his guild just in case she happened to get screwed on the trade.<br />
<br />
I believe it is something like...<br />
<br />
/showguild shadowfox98</div></div><hr />

We're evil classes. Don't expect people that are attracted to a dark knight to be the friendliest around. Our class is dark and scheming, we play dark and scheming, and we hold others at arms length. <br />
<br />
I had no RP interest in all about SK's over any other plate class, or ranger for that matter.   all my frinds werre lizards, I wanted to swing a sword and have spells.<br />
<br />
I do not need a few paragraphs on an outdated manual to  make me what I am.<br />

Feed the board trolls and they keep coming back .. i signed up for this forum thinking i was going to get some useful information .. pure dissapointment so far .. i thought VN Boards were the troll heaven .. guess i was wrong ..<br />
<br />
Thank you come again !  <br />

I think the theory here is that Veteran SK's had to work for the information you (and I ) are looking for.  so they make people sift to get the good info.  It's all over here if you're willing to look (BTW search works here -  use it - now STFU)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>lot3k</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">I know it's been said in this post already, I mean fuck, I read it.  But we shadowknights are not typically happy people for one reason or another, and most of us are not just shadowknights and have extensive experience with other classes as well  (I know I do, been playing the game long enough) A shadowknight does not have pros and cons, a shadowknight has nothing but his reputation, same can be said with paladins, except people look upon them more favorably than a plate/tank class with only the ability to CC, DOT, MT, FD Pull, and hit higher DPS than other plate classes (yea there is sarcasm) and alot of other SKs are the same way, we hate lil twits looking for the easy route so they start poking their nose around looking for the ubah race class combo... news flash, there isn't one, and if that is true SK truly is not.  I play a troll SK, I have been to 3 different servers, and all of them have a troll sk on them from me.  I have also played warrior, paladin, rogue, necro, and enchanter.  but I always come back to my SK, why? because it fits? because I like the challenge? because I love being the lone wolf? because I AM  an asshole?  because I hate the community in EQ?   because I like the thought of being an offensive combatant? because I like the thought of fueling myself with hate and rage to destroy my enemies (everyone)? yea, I think that about sums it up of why I play SK.....</div></div><hr />
