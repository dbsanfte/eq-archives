I wonder if it would be worth it to put two lifetap proc augs in it now that you can proc an infinate number of procs per swing. That, combined with the new and old lifetap procs could really be an incredible amount of healing. Not to mention that the focus effect would increase every one of those taps. That, on top of the clicky effect, might not prevent you from being one-rounded but it would sure as hell make you a bitch to kill by any other means.</div></div><hr />

So hopefully, by the grace of god they've made an SK only super lifetap aug that's actually lifetap based this time, just somewhere in OOW</div></div><hr />

Add to that the AA that procs a lifetap every melee swing... incoming: HP.</div></div><hr />

That's not what the AA does. It's just another proc, its random, though I don't know how much it heals for. I do know it doesn't go off every swing though.</div></div><hr />

I would think a Type8 +4dmg Aug and Some other assortment of DD would make more sence... The Dmg output alone would make it a nice agro wep...</div></div><hr />

With the new terror its not as big an issue anymore, still agro that can't be interrupted, that you don't have to channel, is something every sk should have.</div></div><hr />

If you dont like my openion then thats ok you can disagree with it... I stated my observation and Openion on the Augs and you respond by Bashing my Friends and well everyone on my server becuse, i will group with anyone who asks me wether it's the top guilds or the lowly person who needs a tank for a quest to the Off hand PU raid that wants to kill something... <br />

I think you should grow up a little...</div></div><hr />

Actually that's a semi-true statment, and I don't think he ment to insult anyone.. When I first applied to join my guild (this was just as GoD was released) I was sigificantly under geared. I was applying to a Time guild and my main weapon was my epic, the first raid I was invited to the first question someone asked me was who's twink I was :( . It was such a shock tanking for a guild group the first time, I was amazed on how much more effort I needed to put into holding agro away from 5 Time/GoD geared people going full out on mobs they could probably tank better than me at the time. I was very much used to PU groups (was unguilded for quite a bit) where I could spit at the mob and have enough agro to afk for the whole fight. Now that I'm Qvic/GoD geared I ussually don't have too much trouble, but the extra agro of a proc is always nice.  :)</div></div><hr />

If you can't see the benefit in being able to cast whatever I want, whenever I wan't, /shrug.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ninaelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I definately agree with Krush here, was thinking about doing that myself if I ever get the thing. atm I use Ornate Greatblade from fire with a ykesha proc type 4 in it. I sure work alot less for agro now in group with that aug and that's only 1 aug on a vastly inferior weapon. sometimes it seems like I hardly have to do anything at all to keep agro with wa4 just a quick snare and i'm gtg.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Rueeliar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">It isn't even rogues, at this point.  Beastlords, Rangers, and Mages are the biggest problems with this.  When they are pushing 300+ dps, a fizzle or an interrupt at the wrong time will see aggro going off to someone else very commonly.<br />
<br />
Yeah, upgrading from Clinging to the new Terror filled in that gap fantastically, but even then, it can happen.</div></div><hr />

super aggro on a 2her so you don't have to worry about casting lame aggro spells, just cast DOTS etc... shouldn't have much problem in raids b/c your warriors will have alot more aggro than you by virtue of their procs/they will be trying to get it. All you need to do is grab a target and start meleeing, throw a TOD, and if theres no warriors on it - you'll get aggro (something you should have anyways if theres no warrior on it!!).</div></div><hr />

Okay, I cant help it.  This is funny.  I'm being lectured about aggro management by someone who uses Terror of Thule.</div></div><hr />

My wife 65 wiz 230 or so aa just spell haste 4 and ft 12 or so pulls agro from me if i get sloppy with my agro cuz im doing something else on my sk/bst/cleric. I mem 2agro spells fear/invoke fear or cd/fear or fester/fear depending on situation so on inc i can alternate and drop 2/3 agro spells to hopefully lock agro. After which i can focus on doing the other things like casting aura of pain or aura of hate or zbite or toi or tov or whatever. So i put a force of yekisha aug on my 2hb and i have to worry less about maintaining agro off my wife while i cast my other spells and worry less if im forced to switch to my bst to off tank an add or something...<br />
<br />
Oh yah btw my wife gets all this agro just doing her job killing mobs as fast as possible is her job (and to DoT gating/healing mobs) if she has govern her dps then she isn't going oom so me getting the yak aug helped alot. On raids when i want to off tank something its easier to get agro and keep it. When i dont want to tank something like were on raid mob and im just doing dps i use my 2hb+yak aug for dps also and i dont get agro off the war mt going full burn chain lifetaps and BoHing the mob. If i want agro i still have to work for it on raids and such but it makes it easier and thats my job.<br />
<br />
I dont plan on getting my epic 1.5 anytime soon, sadly 2.5k+ hitting mobs are still alittle too much for my guilds wars + i dont feel i've done nearly enough to ask for the raid help of getting the weapon, but knowing that i could put 2 agro procs on it make me want it all that much more. HECK right now im hoping that prices will drop and i'll be able to pick up a blade of disruption cuz it has an agro proc on it.</div></div><hr />
