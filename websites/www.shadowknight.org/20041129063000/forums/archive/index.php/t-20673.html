<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KLeTuS_KaSaDy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">im getting really tired of this its ben around for what, 2 expansions now ? this needs to be fixed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Doesn't this happen because you have a slow connection/comp and there is a difference in what time client and serve have for you to recast?  <br />
<br />
I didn't think tis was an EQ issue per say but an equip connection issue.  <br />
<br />
That's what I always assumed.  I notice if I'm not laggy I don't get it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Darknyss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Using 11.0 Mbps wireless internet connection... I have almost no lag... my bar is a solid green, and my computer is in great working condition.<br />
<br />
I've noticed the &quot;Spell recovery time not yet met&quot; happens to me numerous times, especially when using multiple spears for pure DPS...<br />
<br />
As soon as I see my spellbar light up... I try a new spell... if I'm fast enough... I can recreate this practically every time... I think it's just a spell-recast timer bugged or something... <br />
<br />
Normally, if I can't cast another spell yet... it'll tell me... however, I can begin casting the spell and then finish with the &quot;Spell recovery time not yet met&quot; if I do it fast enough.<br />
<br />
I'd be more upset if it acted like I casted the spell... ie. mana loss, spell recast timer reset... but since I'm using fast spells, it's only a minor PITA.... <br />
<br />
nevertheless... it's still a PITA</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Makkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">its a problem with hard coded spell refresh time, which is 1 second i believe. if you use multiple spears or even try to use a spear very quickly after casting you'll get it.<br />
<br />
its a lot more frustrating on fd, which i tended to see it quite a bit on. darkness then fd fast enough and it gives you the message</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Utanlain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It happens to me every time I try to cast a spear just after my spell bar is active again, but that's not a real problem just annoying.<br />
<br />
It gets DANGEROUS though when it happens on a Death Peace just after I casted a Snare to split mobs. That happened to me several times already (and no, nothing to do with connection problems or PC lag) and endangered my life on every occasion.</div></div><hr />
