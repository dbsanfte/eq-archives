<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Puurrdy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">make sure everything but chr and wis has at least a 75, other than that, sta and maybe str for a gnome</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Manslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">STA is probably the safe bet considering the gear you plan on having.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zakton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">STR and STA but you could play a real SK too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Greggthegrmreapr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">he is a druid, that could explain his longing to play a gnome...  outcasts belong together :p</div></div><hr />

I wanted to go gnome because I thought since their stats were so similar to DE's that they could probably fight just as well ,is that true?  I didn't think there was any other factors to their tanking ability.  The main reason I wanted to go gnome is that they look pretty nice and on my server the demand for clockwork observer is so low that its way cheaper than other cultural armor.  If you think I should go another race could you suggest  which one, stat placement and armor suggestions?<br />
<br />
Thanks again):cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Drynnious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">CHA &gt; all. specially for gnomes!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gaklaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">do what you want most, but troll is awesome because they look sweet, and they have regen so they can solo pretty well (regen helps duh) and they can tank in groups well.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Hsystah Shadowspawn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Play what you think is best! By all means, if you like gnomes then play them especially if the cultural is fairly cheap.  However, don't do it just for the cultural.  Look at all the benefits of playing each race (and their are a billion threads if you want everyones opinion).  PLAY WHAT YOUR LIKE!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Azraelwrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Play a gnome.<br />
<br />
The only downside is that everyone will be picking on you because of your size and well, your a gnome.  If you can look past that then you should be fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Yinaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Sta &gt; all other stats <br />
By far the hardest and most expensive to raise and still have good AC.<br />
For Trolls and Ogres I'm not sure if I would go all Sta at start, especially ogre since they start pretty high. <br />
<br />
<br />
Obviously, don't even touch wis and charisma, wis is useless for you since your INT will be higher anyway and CHA is sooo easy to raise when you go to sell (opal encrusted steins, other random chanter made cha jewelry dirt cheap). you can always remove crusty armor when you go to sell<br />
<br />
Personally, I don't play iksar tanks because the limitation on a lot of armor and all the norrathian cities hate me, although once you get higher its minor on both accounts. <br />
Play what you want really, If you plan to go the long run and Raid a lot and everything, I'd probably look at regen, slam, and other racial abilities because your gear will pretty well cover the stats</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tumy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Everyone picks on me for my size =(  <br />
<br />
You'll get the &quot;He's so cute&quot;  and the &quot;Your to small to tank&quot;.<br />
<br />
I get &quot;God damnit Tumy WTF, Shirnk you fat ass!&quot; and &quot;Damnit Tumy you da fat&quot;, oh and &quot;What the size of a short buss and the same color (Fulvous cultural is bright yellow)&quot;...so now my guild calls me &quot;Short bus&quot;.  I dont mind because it builds character lol.  <br />
<br />
Yes I would pick on you because your a gnomer, but I understand at the same time. lol</div></div><hr />
