<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Evilhyde</div><div class="date">06-27-2002, 11:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was going through the tunnel in WFP to NFP, and right past the area where Poxsbourne is I ran into 3 female paladins and 1 male caster (wizard?).  They were blue to me at 15 but I eventually killed them all.<br />
<br />
Two of the paladins dropped heads - Raenna Griff's Head and Tarsa Yovar's Head.  The caster also dropped his head - Yovik Splegle's Head.<br />
<br />
I did a search on allakhazam and can't find any mention of any of the NPCs or their head as a quest item - thought it might be a quest for the Dismal Rage or something, anybody know what it's for?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Evilhyde</div><div class="date">06-28-2002, 01:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah I've killed them a few more times for fun... I love interrupting their heal with my slam and then watching their faces when they realize their heal failed and now they are gonna die.<br />
<br />
And the scream they  make when they fall just warms my heart in that special way...</div></div><hr />
