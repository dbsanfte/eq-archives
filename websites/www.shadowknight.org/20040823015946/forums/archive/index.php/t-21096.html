<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I come in to work this morning to conduct an admissions interview for one of my Admissions Representatives and BAM at 9 am Central time who should walk in but a gorgeous full figured woman.  Now she isn't nearly the acreage of the girl he once had in his sig at s-k.org but she has wonderful full figured curves.<br />
She's married though, I think, but didn't know if that would be an issue for you.  <br />
<br />
If not please, Brian get to Milwaukee in the next 45 minutes and after she's admitted to the University you can use on of the classrooms to get your chubby groove on.<br />
<br />
I'll ask her if getting smacked with fish during sex is a turn off for her...well probably not that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>brian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">post pics of her plz!!! (i dont care if shes married) <br />
<br />
<br />
(milwaukee is like on the other side of america from me though so no fuckin way i could have made it in 45 minutes...  you're gonna have to be my proxy-stalker-agent-- get one of those camera phones and a job as the locker room attendant or something)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chayde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, when I was thinking of Brian.... <br />

<br />
But wait, that was the emote icon that Dhkar posted for him....<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
:(<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Then I remember a friend who uses this emote icon as her avatar.....<br />

/probrianthread off<br />
(where the fuck you live?  Texas?  Jeez Milwaukee is in the middle of the country how can it be on the other side of the country from you?)<br />
/probrianthread on<br />
<br />
Milwaukee is probably THE place for portly poon, but since you can't get here I suggest you subscribe to the Lane Bryant catalog.<br />
<br />
I'll keep you posted on all the hefty honeys, though I have no camera phone and you may just have to put up with my descriptions.</div></div><hr />
