<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone else's fear not doing anything?  No resist message, no agro, nothing ... just casts, mana pres message, and nothing.  Only happening in Uqua.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mathas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Happened to me last night on one of the spirits.  I wasn't really trying to aggro anything else, so that's the only time I cast it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The spirit might have despawned, works fine for me although I prefer to use CD in Uqua because of the faster cast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Cyrielle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">since you can't mez anything better use Cd line really</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I realize I can just use CD, more of a question of that zone ... is there a reason why does it not work there?  If not, does the fact that they can just turn off Fear not instill even a little bit of worry in anyone else?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>LardyTP</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I was raiding with Catharsis when he noticed this. Fear didnt successfully cast on any mob in Ugua. Normal cast yields a &quot;Resists your Fear&quot; and an &quot;Immune to Fear&quot; message as well as agro in any other zone. In Ugua when trying to use fear no resist/immune messages were receieved for us, and no agro at all is built. Treats it like you cast a beneficial spell on an npc, no agro even if you tried to use it to tag.<br />
<br />
This is odd cause a week ago i know Fear was working in Ugua. I had all paladins test spells that mobs were immune to to check, and all of there spells were landing fine.<br />
<br />
We zoned to make sure it wasnt a bug with us. For anyone thinking that maybe the message isnt there but the agro is, i chain cast Fear/Invoke Fear on a mob on incomming, and continued to do so while it was being engaged by our worst agro warrior, and the mob ignored it all.<br />
<br />
So, either Fear is off in Ugua, or it was some crazy bugged expedition. Regardless, if they can shut Fear off in zones this would make me wonder why they would shut it off here, all i could think is maybe there is an encounter deep in with swarm adds that could be feared off and this was the solution SoE used.<br />
<br />
Ill check next time im in Ugua, would like to know if any other SK's notice this.</div></div><hr />
