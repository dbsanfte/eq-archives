<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Peztilence Forever</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have 2 Questions. <br />
<br />
 1) Why the Greenmist. I have almost completed this quest and get asked alot, especially from my guild WHY bother. <br />
 I have my own reasons WHY to bother but I wondered if anyone else had a good reason I could also offer them :) OR do you think the Greenmist sucks ?  P.S I am aware there are better 1h weapons! <br />
<br />
 which brings me to my second question.<br />
<br />
 2) Should we bother with 1handers. As I said peeps say and afew of my guildies &quot; get a good 2hander and thats all you need, agro and dps &quot;  But looking at the END game wont 1handers for Knights be a good alternative IE with the GoD shield AAs etc?<br />
What is a good arguement for using 1handers. Once again I have my reasons but I wanted to see others thoughts. Pros and Cons.<br />
<br />
Cheers Knights.</div></div><hr />

I use 1h+shield when I need the extra ac/shielding/hp(i.e. when I'm tanking), not because of any aa's.  In my opinion, the aa's that affect shields are just a small bonus when you're already using one, rather than reasons in and of themselves to use one.<br />
<br />
Anytime I'm not tanking or anticipating a need to tank soon, I use my 2h for dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ashrai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Greenmist- me personally, I did it because at the time it *was* the best available 1hander to me. Also, I enjoy quests and for me making a Shadowknight went hand in hand with doing Greenmist- it was a rite of passage, blahablah. Was also nice to know I'd never have to farm ore in SSRA mines. <br />
<br />
1hander vs 2hander: I go 1hander + sheild when tanking because my AC needs all the help it can get. 2hander for DPS. And in my case, I don't have a tanking 2hander (and can never seem to beat the Pallies on them when they do drop) so if I have my 2hander out and for some reason I grab something to tank, I will get torn up fast (my 2hander is Crow Footed Lance, not something you want to tank with)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you want to do it, go for it.  Since you're EP, it wont take more than a maybe 2 other people to finish any part of it.  I did it because TP was very new and it was the best thing available to me when the quest was actually implemented.  And I'd already done all previous khukris.  Be aware of this ... it procs a dot that takes up a buff slot.<br />
<br />
Copy/paste Dalzhel's 1h+shield comment here.  I always swap it in tanking anything on raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Peztilence Forever</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Cheers all.<br />
<br />
 I've done the whole Quest alone But will I need help on the Cliff Golem ? This is the only mob ive been curious about ? Oh and also getting the Green Shard ? Can this be done alone ? Other than that the Quest is a walk through at lvl 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rorthek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">When i did the Glowing Golem for my Greenmist i had a lvl 65 friend Tank for me  . the cleric didnt have to heal him at all... really the hard part would be teh clif golem or geting him solo from the guards.<br />
<br />
a while back i solo'd the Greenish shard on my 65 monk, ToV geared, so bye no means &quot;uber&quot;..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rorthek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Blah sorry the tank was a 65 SK</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ashrai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I did Cliff Golem in my 50s with a L65 Druid taking Rampage. IMHO the skellie for the Life Leech quest was tougher than this guy.</div></div><hr />

I got greenmist for the pure and simple reason so i wouldn't have to do CC during the emp fight.</div></div><hr />
