After hitting 52, i wanted to HT something. So i target the mob, hit HT and nothing happens. Button is greyed out for using, but nothing else.<br />
Couple seconds later the buton pops out again. hm. target myself, hit HT, same deal, nothing, greys out, pops ready a few secs later. after i camped and loged back in  it worked again, i HTed myself due to a lack of mobs<br />
Anyone had this happen?</div></div><hr />

I agree Spurnia... one of my favourite feelings is making a corpse out of the scary little gnome caster running around between my legs at low life.  I'm never quite sure if hes there or not because I'm a troll untill I get the HT landing mssg.  Soooooo satisfying.  And ya, I'm a member of Da Bashin' Iggles on Sullon now.  Used to be a bloob from the Rathe, but the temptation to 1. Kill Druids, and 2.  Never have a Druid as the healer in my group again, motivated me to move to Sullon.<br />
<br />
I've got about 35 insignias from even druids I've killed so far, that doesn't count the multitude of greens, or the occasional red that I've dropped.  Started at lvl 18, still going at 53.  Lord I love killing them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If happens the most on my rogue (since he has alot of buttons to hit)..  and I have to camp or zone to fix it..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SpurniaVZ</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 08:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hehe Soulle I got to love the image of a fatty to slow to turn around to see a gnome! ROFLMAO hehe!! Hey on Vallon there is a guid called Ogers for Ogas or something along those lines and yes class specific! Lol I have to admit that I love that!! Even though we are enemies I always have to blow kisses or what not even in the midst of losing to PvP !hehe One of the cutest stories I have heard was when this Ogre was confronted by a group of Lighties and of course got owned but afterward they all had a big laugh about it and granted him a free port. When asked where he wanted to go he shouted &quot;Ogguk.... home of 'da Oggies!&quot; <br />

BTW how do you like Sullon?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Soulle</div><div class="date">04-04-2002, 12:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sullon is my home now.  Played an SK up to 57 on the Rathe but it just didn't do it for me, I got too frustrated at wanting to fight people all the time and nobody wanted a peice of me ever, even tho i feel I kind of sucked back then... heh.  I started on Sullon when it came out, and kept Huggee Delicious alive and all his gear on him on the Rathe for the longest time, never knowing which I was going to stick with.  One day all that changed tho.<br />
<br />
I was pk'ing in stonebrunt after it had just been created and the Good team had taken it over as their xp spot.  A full group of Goods was xping somewhere in the zone, and talking smack to me like it was going outta style.  I eventually walked over a hill, saw a highland kobold corpse, and started to sneak around the edges of the group, conning people and checking classes.  After I saw that all of them were barely green, I was 40ish, so probably mid to low 30's, I waited untill I saw them finish the mob they were fighting.  <br />
<br />
Running up behind the sitting wizard, I clobbered him with my weighted axe, and HT'd him down in the first second of the fight.  Clinging dark landed on the cleric right after that, and I jousted him down while the druid tried to nuke me, and the ranger, bard, and paladin all attacked.  Next was the druid... next was the bard... next was the ranger.  I left the Pally for last, and was at 2 bubs of life when he was the only one.  He kind of looked around resignedly and started fighting me, was great... hahahaaha.  <br />
<br />
When the fight was over, and I looked around at all the corpses I had made, and roared &quot;WAAAAAAAGGGGHHHHH!!!!&quot; to the zone, that was the day I chose never to return to the Rathe.  I gave all my tradeable gear to my girl and have stayed on Sullon ever since, I love it... heh.<br />
