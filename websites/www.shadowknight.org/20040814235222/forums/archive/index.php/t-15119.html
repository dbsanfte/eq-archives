<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>LoganHex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello everyone. First post on this board.<br />
<br />
I play an Erudite Shadowknight on Maelin Starpyre. I am currently of the tenth level and working on completing my Fell Blade armor quests (just need to finish with the gauntlets and the breastplate).<br />
<br />
After perusing Allakhazam I discovered a kind of follow up armor quest known as Riddosan armor. There are quests for the Tunic of Riddosan as well as the Leggings of Riddosan given in Paineel. I thought that perhaps those were the only two pieces of Riddosan armor until I was doing some research on the Warrens (where I plan on leveling for a bit) when I found out that a creature called The Muglwump drops the Helm of Riddosan. <br />
<br />
Now I hold the belief that there is probably a full suit of Riddosan armor and I would like to obtain it if at all possible.<br />
<br />
The question that I would like to pose to the board is does an entire set of Riddosan armor exist? If so, does anyone have any information on it? I already know how to obtain the tunic, leggings and the helm. If anyone knows how to obtain other pieces (or if you can at least confirm their existance) I would appreciate it if you could add your knowledge to this post (or e-mail me at SaviorSelf@inhell.com).<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hatre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">unfortunately your dreams of a full suit of Riddosans will not be fulfilled as the Tunic Leggings and Helm are all the pieces there are in the game.  Just as a side note by the time you can take the Muglewump you'll be of a level to start your Darkforge armour quests so look them up when you get to 30 or so.</div></div><hr />
