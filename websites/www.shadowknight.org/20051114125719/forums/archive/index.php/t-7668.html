<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zaggnut</div><div class="date">10-30-2002, 11:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm a level 50 ogre SK. My gear is ok, but not great. It used to be twink gear, but my level has pretty much caught up with everything I gave myself. <br />
<br />
I generally solo, and do pretty well, but I'm wondering if there are things I could do better. <br />
<br />
Here's my basic procedure. Any tips would be appreciated. <br />
<br />
I am generally buffed with Grim Aura, Scream of Death, and Shroud of Hate. I have my 61 cleric to buff also, but honestly, Aego isn't really necessary, and I usually forego it. The new spell haste buff is nice though, and I have been using that some. <br />
<br />
First, I speed my pet, then pull with Dooming Darkness (I'm mostly camping gnome gaurds in Echo Caverns at the moment). While they are inbound, I sick my pet, and cast shroud of hate for the attack buff, and spear of pain. By that time the mob has reached me, and I fear. I re-apply fear as necessary, and recast spear when it refreshes. <br />
<br />
It seems to work ok- I haven't been in any danger at all, and I seem to almost keep up with the 4 spawns, with the first repopping as I med from the fourth one. I generally end up at about 85% health and anywhere between 30 and 60% mana. Health generally regens at least close to full by the time mana is up. <br />
<br />
The biggest problem I have is that darkness almost always wears off before I'm done killing the mob. I've tried pullng with other spells, but I usually end up taking a lot of damage before finally channeling a darkness, and that increases my downtime a lot. It would be less downtime to cast another Dooming. I have BE guantlets, and have considered pulling with engulfing darkness, then overwriting it with dooming after it's taken some damage. <br />
<br />
My spell line up is as follows:<br />
<br />
Lifedraw<br />
Dooming Darkness<br />
Shroud of Hate<br />
Spear of Pain<br />
Fear<br />
Strengthen Death<br />
buff<br />
Feign Death<br />
<br />
Any tips on my methods or spell selection would be welcome. I've palyed EQ for about 3 years, but this is the first melee I've played to relatively high level, so I'm really kind of a n00b at it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trysbrina67</div><div class="date">10-30-2002, 12:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">get some BE guants, they should be like 500pp and pull with the engulfing darkness rclick.  this will save some mana as its a mana free snare.<br />
also try to get a C3 or something, plenty of 60 chanters running around these days and C3 is easy to get.  that will really cut down or your med time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Uwildi</div><div class="date">10-30-2002, 09:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How close to dead are they when dooming wears out? <br />
I use the BE gauntlets to pull, and have clinging mem'd as a backup if it wears off before the kill.<br />
<br />
Fast cast, almost no mana, and that close to the end it snares the mob enough to finish it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baraxul</div><div class="date">11-03-2002, 10:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Once I got Dooming, Engulfing just seemed to be too weak of a snare, and I haven't used my BE gaunts much since 49.  It seems to work better for me to pull with Dooming and quickly pull off a BE boot fear before mob engages than to pull with gaunts and follow up with an Invoke Fear... of course, it's possible to fear kite entirely with the BE if mana runs out, but why do that when you could spend the time medding or begging chanters for brain candy ;).<br />
<br />
Anyway, your tactic seems fine to me, I might switch out the Shroud of Hate for a Heat Blood as this will probably do more damage over the course of the fight than the benefits gained by the buff as far as I can tell.  Or you can just cut that part out entirely and have a little &quot;oh shit&quot; mana left over for an emergency.</div></div><hr />
