<br />
Oddly enough, though FD is supposed to be one of our trademark skills, I think I have used it once since I have gotten in. LDoN does not seem to give time for FD pulling.<br />
<br />
Our 34 Spear worth using?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Astrakan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm pretty sure I used my spear quite a bit at 34, although it got better when I was able to get KEI and mental corruption, thus allowing me to keep up manawise. <br />
<br />
As far as spell line-up:<br />
<br />
Feign Death is a must.  Regardless of whether you use it for pulling, it is a nice get of jail free card to have up, always.<br />
<br />
After that, I thought I was going to have a really good response, but I don't.  Besides keeping clinging darkness up, and a lifetap, who really cares.  Most people are so overpowered equipment wise at this level, that you can blow through them in no time.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Waydol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have had FD memmed in the same spot since level 30, and it has saved my ass countless times.  Especially useful when soloing and you screw up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Lifetap<br />

Clinging<br />
<br />
AC Tap<br />
<br />
Grim Aura<br />
<br />
34 Spear - It's nice.  Will take about 15% of a Mobs health in the 30's. so good if they are trying to slink away or nice to see that quick drop at the beginning.  Recast time sucks, if soloing you'll only see it once every fight.  If grouping you'll see it once every couple of fights.<br />
<br />
Shield Skin - many will say this sucks but it's super cheap 45 damage rune (just need a 2gold reagent).  Costs about 1/3 as much mana as the tap for 45 hp. Why tap it back when you can never lose it in the first place.  Load it before agroing, you will still use tap, but just not as much, and the healers on LDoN like the placebo effect as they think they are healing you alot less.<br />
<br />
Pet haste/Invis<br />
<br />
FD- The nice thing about FD in LDon is if you are pulling from a crowded room and don't have pacy - you just clinging one see how many are coming and FD before you get a train, just got to keep your group backed up.  Also last night I got a thought and FD'es befor the rogue tried to disarm a barrel in LDoN.  He triggered the trap, everyone else got poisoned but me.<br />
<br />
My line up tends to be tweaked for each hunting exp, but what I listed isn't awful for LDoN</div></div><hr />
