<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>LoganHex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Would like to do this quest.<br />
<br />
I am currently level fourty three and wearing a full suit of Darkforge. The rest of my gear is common midrange stuff like the Fireclaw Carapace, Black Alloy Girdle, etc.<br />
<br />
What do you think my chances of soloing the quest are? <br />
<br />
I plan on entering the Wakening Lands through Kael Drakkel (amiable to Kromrif and Kromzek glaring to King Tormax). From what I understand the raptors spawn over near Skyshrine. I am most likely kill on sight to Claws of Veeshan. Anything over there I need to worry about?<br />
<br />
How about Woushi? I have heard nightmare stories about how this dragon wanders all over the zone? Does he? If so what are the chances of me firing off a feign death before he devours me (and does feign death even work on him)?<br />
<br />
As for the holgreshes my magic resistance is a sixty eight and the rest of my resists are right around where they start at (perhaps five to ten points higher on any given resists). Are they going to destroy me? From what I have read they pretty much chain nuke but they also only have six hundred hit points. Am I going to be able to take these bad boys out or are they going to own me?<br />
<br />
How rare are the drops? I have heard that they are as rare as can be. Is this a really frustrating quest to do?<br />
<br />
Finally who knows anything about the enraged walrus? I cannot find him in the bestiary. Anyone know about what level he is and if I am going to be in for a rough fight or not?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Menon Lifeblight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I was poorly geared at 48 (darkforge/ry-gorr with MoSS and SBS) and could not solo the holgresh consistently.<br />
<br />
A single holgresh is pretty easy to fear kite, but I seemed to get adds often.  I ate a number of deaths before I gave up and had some friends help me AE the caves.<br />
<br />
The raptors and the walrus were cake.  Only part that gave me trouble was the holgresh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hatre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What menon said.  The Hrolgresh are pains in the neck at your lvl/equipment,  If i were you id be waiting till at least 49 and maybe even 52 to try and solo to flying monkeys safely.  The risk of adds will be just as high but youll be more able to deal with them.<br />
<br />
Edit: Rolandl on the north wall of WL (COV dragon) will eat you if you kos.  likely the faires along the way won't like you wither and on mass they'll kill you too,  but just invis up and youll be fine.<br />
<br />
Iv never actually seen woushi and ive spent quite a bit of time in WL, but my understanding is that he only hangs around the dragon ring in the south east of the zone so he can eat the unprepared porting into WL.  I don't think you'll need to worry about him.<br />
<br />
Drops can be very rare i wouldn't even have started this quest (not that i've finished it mind you) if I hadn't lucked out and got the strong raptor gut after following a whim to kill the raptors on the way through to SS fro my blood lords quests.<br />
<br />
The enraged walrus is actually spawned by giving the strong raptor gut and the strong wooden branch to &quot;snowfang fisher&quot; in iceclad.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>LoganHex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for the feedback. Just finished this quest a few minutes ago. For anyone else who would like to take it this was my experience:<br />
<br />
First of all every spot in the Wakening Lands looks pretty much like every other spot in the Wakening Lands so be prepared to get lost if you are not skilled in the arts of navigating. <br />
<br />
My first stop was the raptors. I hit the area right outside of Skyshrine (if you are facing the entrance to Skyshrine they are literally just a few feet away to your right up on a ledge amidst some trees). I had heard that the strong raptor gut was a rare drop so I am going to consider myself very lucky here as I got mine on my first kill. It dropped off of a raptor (did not bother with the saurus) which was single pulled out of the group of about five of them. Pretty easy kill. Raptor did not have a lot of damage output. <br />
<br />
Thanks for the tip on Rolandl by the way. Almost had a heart attack when I ran across him. Thankfully I was invisible at the time.<br />
<br />
Next stop was the holgresh. My experience with these pretty much reflect what the other two posts said. Tough bastards. I found the elementists were easier to fight than the conjurers as I resisted more of their spells. Even so it was not easy by any means. In total I fear kited three to death and was killed twice by two others. Never even found the cave. Luckily a friend of mine (level fifty eight beastlord) popped on around this time and came out to help me. He found the cave and proceeded to route it. One clearing of the cave yielded the strong wooden branch.<br />
<br />
Went to Iceclad and did all of the necessary running around. Maybe my gear is more chump then I thought but I found the enraged walrus battle to be somewhat difficult. I did not fear kite him for fear of what might be in the water if he ran that way (completely unfamiliar with the zone) and he hits pretty hard (consistent eighties). Conned dark blue at fourty three though. Managed to put him down with twenty eight percent health left (did not have to drop harm touch). <br />
<br />
All in all the quest was more difficult than I was expecting it to be from the posts I read but definitely worthwhile for the item it yields. I would advise bringing assistance for the holgresh part of it if you attempt it at the level I did. They are soloable but it is pretty much a crap shoot.</div></div><hr />
