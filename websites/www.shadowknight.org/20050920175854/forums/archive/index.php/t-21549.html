<br />
Has anyone done any testing on furious bash hate?  I know the received wisdom is it's zero but then for an SK used to spamming CD and fear on mobs, anything less than an EB proc will seem zero aggro anyway.<br />
<br />
Just wondering whether by not spamming bash when I've got my shield equipped I'm missing a trick (doubt it but worth asking)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grem</div><div class="date">05-28-2004, 04:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Spam bash for the dps(lol?), not the hate.  Furious bash does nothing=/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dakkin</div><div class="date">05-28-2004, 05:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, that's what everyone says (remember everyone also clearly &quot;knew&quot; ND was better than CA until people parsed it), but has anyone done any testing?<br />
<br />
Clearly FB doesn't do fear or CD-type hate but if anyone's got hard data I'd be curious to know.<br />
<br />
Would test it myself but I don't have a second SK or FB shield user (that I know of) I'm friendly enough with to help.  I know somone suggested it to Brael during his testing a while ago but not sure he got round to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Inferna</div><div class="date">05-28-2004, 08:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually I think FB did do something at one time but it was nerfed.<br />
When it came out it increased the hate of spells and bash.  But they nerfed the spell part so now its justs adds some hate to bash which does not have much aggro to begin with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Siilvir</div><div class="date">05-28-2004, 02:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have done the testing (posted he results on this board about a year to a year and a half ago if you care to search for them). It does nothing at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dakkin</div><div class="date">05-28-2004, 06:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Siilvir.  Stuff get buried, oh well (still can't find your tests but no biggy, I was more curious to know if testing had been done).<br />
<br />
I did find Lucy says it increases bash hate by 10% for FB1, 20% for FB2 etc.<br />
<br />
Which is close enough to your defintion of doing nothing in my book - a 50% increase on nearly zero hate is still nearly zero hate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brael</div><div class="date">05-28-2004, 07:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It does nothing.  Besids Siilvirs post you can check the archives for the thread on aggro parsing, from there you can find out that shields are treated as offhand weapons for aggro checks.  Aggro mods are done on the damage bonus as well, offhand weapons have no damage bonus and neither do sheilds, that means that aggro mods can't affect it because the formulas screwed up, although it was possibly fixed very recently will have to test that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dakkin</div><div class="date">05-29-2004, 03:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Brael, but don't take any pains on my account.<br />
<br />
Even if fixed, if Lucy's right it'd just be a moderate increase on &quot;bash hate&quot; which isn't worth bothering about to start with.<br />
<br />
No spam bashing for me :)</div></div><hr />
