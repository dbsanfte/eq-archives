This is as good a time as any for it so lets make the new list.  I'll start it off and just say what you would like to see different, moved around, etc and can adjust off that feedback.<br />
<br />
1.  Increase to Knight tanking power bringing us closer to Warriors and seperating our tanking capabilities further from non tanking classes.<br />
<br />
2.  Addition of a method allowing us excel at our raid role (offtanking), rather than fill the gaps because you want your Warriors doing something else such as a 65% mitigation 20% channeling 12 sec duration 90 sec reuse discipline.<br />
<br />
3.  Access to nuke/heal crit AA's other classes (besides Wizards) recieve.  We currently crit a mere 7% of the time vs their 19% when it comes to nukes.  We also crit only 10% vs other classes 16% when it comes to heals.  This would give us a reasonable DPS increase while bringing our healing inline.<br />
<br />
4.  Removal or Toggle on Spell Casting Subtlety.  This AA brings nothing beneficial to the class in it's current form.  All it serves to do is make us perform our role worse.<br />
<br />
5.  Revision of Leech Touch.  This AA costs 30 to max out and is worse in all cases than our other HT AA which only costs 18 to max.<br />
<br />
6.  An increase to channeling.  As a class whos job it is to cast through hits we should excel at this aspect of casting.<br />
<br />
7.  Revision of focus effects aviable in GoD.  There aren't enough focuses for HT, MR, and Distance.<br />
<br />
8.  An upgraded FD spell, Deathpeace was designed for 3 year old content.  It cannot keep pace with mobs any longer.<br />
<br />
9.  An increase to our spell based aggro (espically non damage aggro).  It is the lowest of the 3 tank classes while we're supposed to be the highest aggro tank.<br />
<br />
10. SK sustained DPS is behind some classes which it should be higher than such as Bards and Warriors.</div></div><hr />

Also:  you may wish to include in the point about GoD focus effects, something to the tune of &quot;perhaps a careful look at Knight GoD itemization in general&quot;  *shrug*  just a thought.  Theres some very nice stuff, but not for many slots, at least from what I can see.</div></div><hr />

I think pallies should get somethign completely different. I mean, they are no more similar to SKs than any other class. It's obvious that the pally and SK are no longer two sides of the same coin. They are not enough alike anymore to warrant spells designed to be 'opposites' of the others, or discs, for that matter.</div></div><hr />

If pallies got a similar mitiagtion disc as well as upcoming OoW stuns, they'd be the only tank in the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jovec</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">1.  Increase to Knight tanking power bringing us closer to Warriors and seperating our tanking capabilities further from non tanking classes.<br />
<br />
Issue number 1 is complex, and probably deserves a more thorough description.  There are 3 areas of SK tanking that need to be balanced: War vs SK, SK vs Pal, and SK vs the remaining classes.  I'd suggest something like the following.  Comment as you see fit.<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
1. Analyze Shadowknight tanking in the following areas to ensure that the variances are as intended and within desired levels.<br />
<br />
  1a.  Shadowknight tanking versus Warriors: Tanking is the primary role for Shadowknights, and therefore we must be able to perform that role at a level suitable enough to maintain grouping and raid offtanking desirability.  Analyze the current situation with AC, HP, tanking mods, and skill caps to ensure that the warrior advantage is not now, and will not become, too great as to reduce Shadowknight tanking desireability to unnacceptable levels.<br />
<br />
  1b.  Shadowknight tanking versus Paladins:  The Shadowknight community believes that both knight classes should mitagate evenly.  On stunnable content, this is not the case and Paladins have a clear advantage.  Adding a Fear2 line (or modifying the terror line to act as Fear2) would bring knight class mitigation even, with the differentiating factors being the Paladin's spell focus on healing and the Shadowknight's focus on damage.<br />
<br />
  1c.  Shadowknight tanking versus Rangers, Monks, etc:  The lack of an immunity disc, coupled with the High DPS/Low HP concept taken to the extreme in GoD content, means that too often, guaranteed immunity is a greater advantage than the higher mitagation, AC, and HP of Shadowknights.  Address this situation to ensure that knights are always preferred ahead of the aforementioned classes as primary or back-up tanks in the new GoD paradigm where bosses and minis routinely die in the 30 to 60 second range.<br />

<br />
Don't tell ME, tell Sony.  Recall the warrior upgrade recently?  I'm not arguing FOR it, but I think its damn likely, IF we get one.<br />
<br />
Brael:  and while the discipline is waiting to be refreshed, the Pal is still stunning away on trash and XP mobs, while I am... waiting for my disc to refresh.  Is my point. One group lower content perspective, vs raid perspective perhaps is all.  *shrug*<br />
<br />
If Paladins Don't get a similar disc, then all is fine, but I have no confidence in the people doing the balancing anymore.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">They can't stun a ton of mobs Kod'taz+.  I'm going off the assumption they will balance mob levels similarly in OoW to keep stuns from being too strong.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Bunk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Most SKs who dont already have this AA should know not to get it.  You may just want to settle for getting a refund on SCS AAs for those who got it early and encourage work on the other problems.<br />
<br />
I also agree with Jovec, get the tanking issue broken down into smaller pieces so they can look at the multiple individual problems that cummulate into our inadequate tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Manslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">#4 is a bigger deal for those that already bought the AA, 18 months ago it was an excellent AA, now its just detrimental.  There shouldnt be any AA that actually makes you worse after buying it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Astrakan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Not sure if this is important enough for a top 10 list, however, I would<br />
still like to see our group taps moved off the buff list, and added to bard<br />

<br />
While they are at it, they could also move aura of pain to bard song window.<br />
Simple tweak, would make quite a few shadowknights happy.  Not sure if <br />
there is a downside, ie limit on bard songs active, as I've never had that issue.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Rueeliar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">The limit is 5 slots in the ShortBuffWindow, I believe.  Cleric wards, an AE song, and three songs if you're grouped with a bard, and you will have some very pissed off people in the group when the wrong thing gets blocked for Aura.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Ghismonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I would like to see that IHT and Leech Touch are on different timers added as a possible solution to Point 5.<br />
<br />
I think that the group buffs are complained about enough that they warrent being on the top 10 list.  Either put them in short duration box, make them click-removable, or blockable somehow entirely if a player so chooses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Fyrechyld</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Get rid of #4, it's not that important.<br />

#9 should be bumped up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Manslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">If they are going to remove #4 then they should at the very least refund the points/remove the AA if they arent going to change it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Actually #4 is important.  It's an AA that at one time had some merit.  It's now the only AA in the game for any class that is 100% entirely detrimental.  That is unacceptable for an AA.  Unless they're going to instruct GM's to refund the AA for every SK on demand for the rest of EQ's lifespan it either needs to be removed or given a toggle.  A toggle would be the better choice since it would enhance the AA for every class rather than just remove it from one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Crimson Tears</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Number 2 is still a pipe dream in my eyes, it meets with almost universal unrelenting opposition from warriors.  I have them down to an 18 second autoriposite on a 60 minute refresh timer, with SoE review and warrior outcry thats about all your going to get in the disc department.  Its a handout or nothing situation, but again its much better than nothing if you couple it with the appropriate spellbook revision.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">And Druids/Shaman getting better heals was met with universal Cleric opposistion, whats your point?  They get the tools to excel at their job, we get the tools to excel at ours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>sassafra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">#4 isnt really a hot button  issue as the solution is in our hands already: just don't choose the subtlety aa.<br />
i'd much rather gain parity with the paladin class by getting a necro rez ability.<br />
there have been multiple times when due to fd i've been the only one left alive after a raid wipe, where having the ability to rez a cleric would have saved the trial.<br />
that's a tangible raid asset ability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Crimson Tears</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">1. It was a scaled down CH, which was an existing spell.<br />
<br />
Nothing exists that is even remotely like the disc, its closest relative being defensive.  Not to mention it was a priest upgrade, all 3 are priest classes, we are hybrids going against the number one played class in EQ, that are pure melee. No matter what you say they are going to hold our spell books and &quot;class defining abilities&quot; over our heads because most of them dont understand our problems, and frankly dont give a fuck.<br />
<br />
2. Their class numbers warrented SoEs attention.<br />
<br />
Were not the most played class, nither are paladins.  This isnt some friendly circle of people, SoE is a business, by keeping the largest amount of its playerbase happy, they make the most money.  Sks cant even agree with each other let alone with paladins to make this kind of a voiced suggestion, in a numbers comparison with warriors we dont even come close.<br />
<br />
3.  Its SoE.<br />
<br />
Nuff said, summit or not these guys still have no clue as to what our class is about, where its going, or quick into testing or revising what we suggest.  They are going to slap the least stressful, least amount of work solution onto the problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Cool, so from now on the solution to something being bad that isn't supposed to be is to not do it?  Let's say you buy a new car, it works good for a year and you find out it has a part which is breaking.  The solution is to not drive it rather than get it fixed?  (best analogy I can come up with this late)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Actually it's closest relative is Stonestance not Defensive.</div></div><hr />

<br />
God thats a bad analogy, um...<br />
<br />
Only thing I can say is that I like the idea, Im behind it, I see its strengths through all the warrior bitching, however its so radical and opposed that I dont give it much of a chance of passing is all.  Just being honest.</div></div><hr />

SOE is a business, and it is because it is that I have hope ! <br />
<br />
Give us a short use fast reuse disc and sure the warriors might be pissed...but pissed enough to quit ? doubtful, if it is done properly and warriors remain the kings of tanking and knights get restored to being the kings of off-tanking<br />
<br />
Dont give it to us and they see knights quit due to single group content being next to impossable with a knight as the tank and so being unwanted.<br />
<br />
SOE is a business..they will go whatever path keeps the paying numbers up the most</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Androsulach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Don't forget, there are Warriors out there quitting from burnout.  So if we get them to consider #2 and it brings us and the Paladins closer to Warrior tanking ability, we might be able to save some of them from burnout.<br />
<br />
In that regard, it's a win/win situation.  I just hope someone on the production staff has realized that they broke it and it's time to fix it before the whole thing comes crashing to a halt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Zero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">1.  Increase to Knight tanking power bringing us closer to Warriors and seperating our tanking capabilities further from non tanking classes.<br />

<br />
10. SK sustained DPS is behind some classes which it should be higher than such as Bards and Warriors.<br />
<br />
If this is in order of importance, which i'm assuming it is, I would personally think it would go like this...<br />
<br />
1<br />
2<br />
3<br />
9<br />
6<br />
8<br />
7<br />
5<br />
4<br />
<br />
Although, yes, I realize SCS is pretty bad now, I don't think it warrants number 4 in the list. How many sk's have that? A teeny tiny amount. How many sk's have channeling/aggro/dps/itemization problems? A huge, majority amount.<br />
<br />
Also, I still think I would rather see the disc last a little longer than 12 seconds. 36 duration, 270 refresh at least.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Reason for wanting disc at least 36 seconds: As I see it, the server calculates &quot;ticks&quot; for dot damage, disciplines, and spell durations all at once, from server-side. Example being when you cast a dot, sometimes the damage will shop up instantly, sometimes it will take 6 seconds for the next tick. I think 12 seconds could shortchange us on the actual time by a big %. Say I activate it on the 5th second of the serverwide tick...then I only get 7 seconds of disc? That sucks. That means you could lose 40%+ of the disc's duration just due to bad luck.<br />
<br />
Of course I will concede I don't concretely know (lextensive parses) if discs run off the serverwide tick or not, so just disregard that and tell me i'm wrong if so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Carter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Like many sk's that raid GoD, I don't feel as usefull as I did when I was in PoP, is this a bad thing?  To me, yes.  Somethings, that I personally feel would help, such as a toggle for SCS, Necro rez (Or a version of some such rez spell), and yes I'm crazy but a twitch spell.<br />
<br />
Toggle for SCS:  Of course to me this makes perfect sense.  When I'm on a raid I can toggle it on and put out a bit more dps (if applicable) without the worry of drawing agro.  While I'm tanking I can toggle it off so I can better hold agro in groups.  (On / Off you can change around, it's 5am and it makes sense to me, you know what I mean)<br />
<br />
A rez type spell:  This is less of an improvement than it is just another utility item, which we seem to have a lot of.  Two fold here really, SK's are suppose to be a very self suffecient class, along with necro's; to me this makes at least a bit of sense.  It would also be nice to have more than one class whom can &quot;save&quot; a raid wipe.  There are generally two more more classes which can function to do a particuliar job, but one obviously better than the other. i.e. warriors are the best tanks, but knights can generally get by, clerics are the best healers, but druids/shaman's can generally get by, enchanters are the best CC, but bards can usually get by.  <br />
<br />
A twitch type spell:  Most will probably disagree with me on this, but it's my opinion.  We do get a transfer spell, albiet it's hp to hp, but that's where the line ends, just one spell from that spell line.  This will probably never happen, but I honestly don't see anything that's wrong with it.  SK's don't have the mana regen to make 'feeding' during an encounter a very viable option, but during small breaks of downtime, or to give someone a quick bit of mana after a rez I feel it could be a good addition.<br />
<br />
I agree with 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10.  But maybe not in the same ways expressed in some cases, as we all see different tweaks that could be set up.<br />
<br />
I don't overly agree with 3, because we can both spell crit and heal crit, to me there's no reason we need to do both of them as well as classes that focus on one or the other.  Sure pallies can crit DD, as can clerics; but how often do you see them nuking in non trivial situations?<br />
<br />
While I agree that anyone who tanks and casts spells should be able to better channel, I don't think it's really a big sk issue.  While tanking, we can hold agro just fine; regardless of where we're tanking.

From a general attitude on the eqlive boards, it seems that many think our lifetaps are a good way to improve self-healing and boost our tank-a-bility. If so, improved channeling is going to be needed, unless they plan on giving us 1.0 cast lifetaps.<br />
<br />
Same with debuff spells, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Carter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Fair enough assertion zero.<br />
<br />
If you're depending on our lifetaps to keep you alive, we've still got major problems.  The part that I don't agree with, and I probably didn't convey it well, is that I seemingly have little to no trouble with tapping, zbite, AoH, AoP, agro spells while tanking.  Yes, going to help tag/pull stuff in ikkinz where it hits fast and like a truck I'll get interupted on DP on occasion and die sometimes, but that's just the way it works.  DP is also nearly no fail, if we could channel it through almost anything like some suggest to help us, it would make us very strong in pulling fast hitting mobs, with or without the help of HS.  I just think that there are better things we, as a community, could come up with rather than our channeling.  <br />
<br />
What they are, could be anything; I'm sure plenty of people have suggestions.<br />
<br />
Mind you, I'm not trying to be the devil's advocate here, and I respect your opinion; just trying to make my point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Nazosa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">To me the main reason Knights are in a bad position concerning tanking atm is the Paladin stuns. Since SoE puts us all in the same box we get burned as well. If we want equal ability and desirability with Paladins make a new Fear line which should freeze the mob rather then making it run away.<br />
<br />
Put the same mob immunity on it as Paladin stuns<br />
Add it for the same levels as Paladin stuns<br />
<br />
This way we will be balanced as &quot;Knights&quot; afterwards real work on balancing all 3 tanking classes can begin. Unless we get an equivalent of stuns we will allways be lamest of the 3 tank classes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Although some points could use specification, you have to understand that each of those (pretty much) has many many different possible solutions. Some people like some, some others. I'm sure Brael probably has a more specified list he would like, personally. But think of it diplomatically, leaving it a bit more open leaves less room for bickering, more room for the devs to actually think of fixing it. Perhaps the one thing you specify on with a certain problem is one the devs, for whatever reason, will not or can't do. Now the whole issue could be ignored.<br />
<br />
= bad mm,kay.<br />
<br />
p.s. - for example, some people think raising skill caps is a stupid fix, and we should do something like put warriors at 8% innate mitigation, knights at 5%, and then leave other classes at 0%. others think skill caps are the answer.<br />
<br />
they both solve the same problem really, and we just have to hope the best way is going to be the one implemented.<br />
<br />
unless you want a poll or some other such useless crap that is supposed to show &quot;which idea we stand for&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">My reason for making examples of being specific...<br />
<br />
1) If you look at the issues that were addressed on different class boards you will see they are where the people were specific.<br />
<br />
2) I am going under the assumption (not right or wrong) of ...if it is specific and they don't have to think or conceptualize as much, maybe there is a greater chance it will get done.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I agree with Brael's list. I also agree how he has worded things to state why we need the fix without going to deep. However, I also know that developers will take the easy fixes first where they don't have to think, they just have to write/ change code.<br />
<br />
If you tell them...we should have tanking on par with warriors the developers will then get into a  3 hour conversation about how to put them on par. If you tell them...make our dodge skill 200...they may just go...ok and 5 minutes later the code is changed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Item 3,4,5 all talk about AA revisions. Why not we consoliate those 3 items into one item for complete AA revision and free up 2 items for other things to add? That way Brael and few other uber Sks who got SCS to offset their high aggro from weapon, high dps, etc in the past only to find out that SCS became counterproductive. I know its applies to only very minority of SK population. By consoliating 3 items into 1 AA revision item as a package could give a win-win situation for everyone cuz we get 2 extra items to add in the top 10? <br />
<br />
Like I said again and again in other posts in the past, my biggest WISH for OOW is upgrade to 1h/shield set-up for defense purpose  as viable route AND give us DAMN NECRO REZZ! :) DON'T give us gimped version!! I sure waited for necro rezz for long time. Enuf said.. <br />
<br />
Actually, we should be brought our mitigation back to warrior as in POP era. They shouldn't give warriors 5% mitigation  in the first place as part of taunt upgrade package. I screamed about it when I heard about that before GoD came but majority of SK community thought it was small and they didn't even complain til GoD came and now they screamed about it. Go figure. It was ok now that warriors got 500 hp off GoD AA cuz we got our COL fixed to give us extra hp so we are happy about it that cost us no AA to do it. ;)</div></div><hr />

I would also like to see SKs get a rez spell along the lines of what necros get.  Paladins, clerics, and necros can all rez at 90%+ so I don't see why ours should be signficantly worse.  I think something like 80% at lvl 66, 82 at 67, 84 at 68, 86 at 69, 88 at 70 would be nice.<br />

Heck no! No way that we get multi-spells for JUST rezz. GIVE US ONLY ONE REAL NECRO REZZ. This spell (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=1733&amp;source=Live) alone is what I want. Just add SHD maybe lvl 70 to it then I'll be happy. Hey, its &quot;only&quot; lvl 53 for Necro.. A WHOPPING 17 full level difference while paladin best rezz is lvl 10 difference from cleric.

<br />
1d. Knights need a 3 minute evasion discipline to bring us closer to Warrior tanking since we no longer possess an aggro advantage.<br />

1e. All tanks need an increased role of shields in combat so they provide more of an advantage than simply adding stats. <br />
<br />
<br />
Add this <br />
<br />
1f  Shadow Knights are now at a large HP gap to warriors I suggest adding an aa to grant us 300 more HP at level 65.<br />
<br />
2. SK's are supposed to be tied as the 2nd best tank but have the lowest damage avoidence of all melee classes.<br />
<br />
2a. SK's need a way to compete with Paladin stuns such as a modified version of Fear2. Depiste the intent of being equal tanks, on stunnable group content SK's are far behind.<br />
<br />
2b. Knights need to have the same damage avoidence skill caps as Warriors. This change is 4 years overdue currently from when we got 252 defense caps.<br />
<br />
I would keep this unchanged.<br />
<br />
3. SK spellbook needs to scale to evolving content better.<br />
<br />
3a. Heals do not scale appropiate to mob DPS. <br />
We need the same increase in power to our life taps as Paladins got to their heals.<br />
<br />
3b. Lifeaps do not refresh fast enough.<br />
<br />
Let mana determine how frequent we can use our lifetaps.<br />
<br />
3c. Damage portion of lifetap balance harms us in offtanking roles because damage is meangingless then.<br />

Remove this<br />
<br />
3d. Disease resist is too high across the board.<br />
<br />
Change resists on spears or give us a debuff for disease resists<br />
<br />
3e. Self only buffs non stackable buffs should be comparable to what other hybrids can cast on everyone (CoL should be same HP/AC as Brells/Rathe combo)<br />

3f. Group recourses need to goto the short duration buff box.<br />

3g. Undead needs to be more concentrated so we make better use of the Scythe line.<br />
<br />
Remove this who cares we are never going to be a force against undead unless we get slays its insignificant part of the game.<br />
<br />
3h. Much of SK utility is given out to other classes through clicks and procs. This needs to stop, it dilutes our spellbook severely.<br />

5b. SK's spells are taking too long to cast in comparison to mob delays.<br />

6. Itemization revision.<br />
<br />
6a. Grimror/Rayin armor sets need ac/hp increased to be between current values and Warrior values of equilavent sets.<br />
6b. Not enough beneficial focus on armor for SK's compared to Clerics/Paladins.<br />
6c. Rayin's armor needs a revision of focus effects. SK's need distance focus, magic nuke focus, etc... not what's currently on the pieces. Detrimental versions of Paladin focus do not work.<br />
6d. Ornate click effects need revised.<br />
6e. Grimror's BP needs a better focus. Disease focus doesn't give us any real benefit.<br />
6f. Non visible hybrid armor needs to be revised. It harms Knights tanking advantage over non tank pure melees when their versions are higher hp/ac/tanking effects.<br />
<br />

Remove all of 6 this won't change.<br />

6.  SK's need an ability for raids and other difficult situations to be able to rez.  This could be an level 65 aa to grant one 93% rez componetless every 24 RL hours.  The purpose of this would be for emergency rezzes on raids to rez a cleric or during single group trials to rez a cleric.<br />

<br />
7. Deathpeace is no longer sufficent as an FD tool.<br />
<br />
7a. A new FD spell is needed, preferably something that cannot be broken by spells (like the Monk AA), and is more difficult to interrupt.<br />
<br />
FD needs to be insta cast since just making it faster cast will be no help.  The server cannot recognize when you have stopped moving fast enough takes a full second.  This allows the mobs to start beating on you and your dead.  FD needs to be able to be cast while running to work now with the sow speed and bard speed mobs in GoD<br />
<br />
7b. An emergency FD hotkey skill is required such as a 36 minute reuse, instant cast, completly unbreakable (other than by standing), 100% memblur, unfailable AA.<br />

Remove this uneeded with above suggestion7a Add stonestance aa to give us the abiltity to stay FD through a precentage of spells being cast on us.<br />
<br />
8. Our spell based aggro needs fixed and designed to scale.<br />
<br />
8a. Terrors need a more appropirate level of hate, they do not scale properly, the level 65 one is only 3x higher than the level 34 one. This spell line should be capable of holding aggro entirely on it's own with no problems.<br />
<br />
Keep this<br />
8b. Terrors need an adjustment to their mana:aggro ratios, they should get better and not remain at 1:10 for their entire lifespan.<br />
<br />
Keep this<br />
8c. Terrors need shorter cast times.<br />
<br />
Keep this<br />
8d. Fear should not generate the obscene aggro it does in most zones, provided Terrors are fixed.<br />
<br />
Remove this <br />
Fear does not generate insane aggro in GoD. In additon it has a long cast time and recast time so its non factor.<br />
<br />
8e. Knight weaponry needs to be designed to provide more aggro than it currently does.<br />
<br />
Add give knights the abiltiy to use Anger augments.<br />

9. Knight DPS while not meant to be the highest should be higher than Bards. Far more progressed SK's can be KS'ed by Bards with ease from sheer lack of DPS on our part.<br />

Just my 2 cents,<br />
<br />
My top two priorities, without a doubt, would be numbers 1 and 2 on Brael's list (the tanking stuff).  Number  6 (the channelling thing) would be a distant third.  After that, I think I'd value rez as much as anything else on the list.<br />
<br />
With more and more timed, single group content coming out, you often can't afford to have more than one cleric along and if that cleric dies, the whole group is screwed unless someone else in the group can rez.  As it stands right now, I'd take a paladin over a SK for single group GoD or LDoN content just for this reason.  Giving SKs some sort of rez would even this out.<br />
<br />
This is from the perspective of someone who does single group content 100% of the time.  Raiders probably see this differently.</div></div><hr />

Don't discount this as an ability. If tied to an AA like this, it would placate necros to some extent. Saving the raid with a well timed FD and avoiding hours of lost time is nothing to sneeze at. Not to mention that having a second rezzer is a godsend on 6-man instanced content when the cleric bites it. It's a large advantage that Paladins have in jockeying for that Tank position in 6-man content.<br />
<br />
And the amount of XP returned is not an issue for me, even a non-XP rez is acceptable, tho the clerics will bitch at losing XP now with level 70.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">The main reason I put the exp on the idea was so for clerics why should they have to be the exp losers in this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">Good list Brael.<br />
<br />
Add:<br />
<br />
Terror line to be replaced by Fear2 line. From lower level SK access to our Ancient in Omens. <br />
<br />
I hear your arguments, and you have some valid points on why no stuns. But the fact remains, many mobs are still stunnable (I rarely get immune messages on my stun weapon on non-named in Gates), and even if it's effect is limited, Fear2 will be WAY better than Terror. It's not an aggro issue, it's mitigation. Give Paladins a group AC buff to compensate if needed.<br />
<br />
The discipline you propose is good, but the fact is that Paladins will get it too, and should. We should share the off tank role. To get it through SOE, we might want to reduce the mitigation to 50%, increase the reuse to 3 mins, and ask for a higher stun resist (make it stun resist instead of channeling so it's useful for pulling). Also, to help make us THE supreme off tanks, this ability should have an aggro modifier (similar to our voice line) for the spells cast and melee done while it's up. 50% modification would be great. Allow us aggro lock, and would scale in the future. This ability would also be a boon to pulling. Suggest this replace Fearless discipline.<br />
<br />
Add also the ability to click off the icons for our recourse spells (Aura of Hate and Pain). This might just be a bug.<br />
<br />
Rather than a new FD spell, I am in the camp of giving us Death Peace on a hot key, frees up a much needed spell gem.<br />
<br />
Again good work, let's see a modified list based on feedback.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Visvires</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">Stalward Endurance<br />
Necro rez<br />
Raise weapon caps<br />
Upgrade to Banshee Aura (x2 at least)<br />
Another Knights advantage or similar aa, all melee classes got some form of GoD melee dps AA besides us, unless you count improved bash + 5. <br />
<br />
These things happening are of course, doubtful. Unfortunately</div></div><hr />

Everytime we need to put something new on the list just paste in<br />

1. Increase to Knight tanking power bringing us closer to Warriors and seperating our tanking capabilities further from non tanking classes.</div></div><hr />

1) Necro rez (0% or more)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">Necro Rezz! :) The true version of necro.. Reason: As in business, we always request or offer best one and we have room for negotiation for weaker version or lower price. If other side grab our best offer then that's super. So.. We request true version of necro rezz as our best one. If SOE decide to weaken it, we still get rezz one way or other. :D <br />
<br />
If we ask for rezz stating that 0% is totally fine then SOE would grab that RIGHT away and give us 0% instead of higher version.<br />
<br />
I don't really want 0% cuz our clerics would be the ones who will suffer the most not us. I understand that its *VERY* SKish and evil way to hurt clerics but is that group friendly?? No.  Clerics might start to be afraid to have SK in their party cuz they are WAY too evil to ACTUALLY force clerics to lose their experience for GOOD cuz the entire group PRESSURES cleric to eat up 0% rezz so they can complete trial and cleric would be more than likely to give in. Over time, cleric would develop hatred toward SK cuz of this. Very RP-like yes but is that what we want?? We screamed for more group friendly role. This 0% is counterproductive in xp group setting expecially in instanced zones that have respawns...<br />
<br />
That is MAIN reason why I asked for REAL necro rezz with 93%. Only thing we lose is EE cost itself. It won't even hurt cleric in ANY way and they will GLADLY accept any SKs in group as a tank and they will KNOW that having SK in group will be a SAVING grace in case of a wipe in trials and in OOW instanced zones so we all can complete trial in-time. <br />
<br />
So.. I'll say again. DON'T ASK for darn 0% rezz xp!<br />
<br />
Hey! I have better idea!! It just came to my mind!!! Give us BRAND-NEW spell that SUMMONS player to a corpse and that player CAN rezz his/her own corpse! That way, its not called a rezz so that corpse is still tagged as rezzable and cleric can rezz his/her own corpse.  That would work BETTER than darn 0% rezz that renders corpse unrezzable. I still settle for real necro rezz cuz its the best one. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>Maicom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">totally agree with the necro rez, would give me a semi-roll cheating on jhiru using ripposte/parry discs.<br />
<br />
hihi HT, fd in corner and wait for loots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>Rhumba_Kween</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">I said it above. I think we should start with something smaller. And I like Slein's idea.<br />
<br />
My preference is to get disease debuffs added to the Malo line. It makes SK's look to be the good guy asking for an upgrade to Shammys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>Maicom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">agree with the malos thing as well, asking for their DR debuff, as some have suggested, is not an ideal solution. In order to make it worth memming said debuff you'd prolly have to have 2 spears up, that'd be 3 spell slots. I have issues as it is finding room for miasmic and decay, no thanks on malicous decay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u74"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p74">Could they at least agree to allow GMs to delete AA points from your character if you ask?  I don't know for sure, but if I was Brael, I'd gladly sacrifice those AA points in order to get rid of Spell Casting Subtlety.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>Askeer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">Brael's been petitioning for this for quite a while already I believe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>Slivers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">Until recently, I've been away from raiding since GoD so this suggestion may be out-dated, however, as part of our RAID and desire for identified purpose, would asking for an AA or Spell that increased the % chance of a MoB to be stunned (even 0% to, say, 5% or more for already stunnable MoBs) be of interest?  Different from our current AA, this would affect the MoB and make it more 'stunnable' by the raid or group force.  This would make both Pallies and Warriors 'ask' that SK's be included with events as even a small % chance of a stun sticking would be of benefit.  With single group content, it could create better odds of a SK stunning via bash/smash and therefore potentially close the gap to Pallies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>Onlee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">Would make us debuff sluts. We have enough of those.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>nytemyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">I think our zefveers bite line should have some sort of area effect to it. I think that would be very useful in raids. necros shouldnt complain its only 200 mana for the lowest one and it has a long recast time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u79"><b>Oberyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p79">...much like the addition of Disease to the Malo line.  Would up DPS a lot.  An alternative to that is the addition of much the same line as the spear spells, but poison based.  Actually being able to land something besides BoH and our top Tap would be really nice... and a good slight DPS push.<br />
<br />
If I had my druthers, I would make some form of pulling tool be on that list.  Stonewall (stance?) type disc (the monk one)  would be nice, or an undead Harmony type spell that actually worked on something of decent level.  <br />
<br />
Personally, losing the pulling role has hurt, a lot.  I enjoyed that immensely.<br />
<br />
Or we could call for a nerf to pacify type spells:P  <br />
<br />
(tongue in cheek for the dumb ones)<br />
<br />
<br />
Oberyn</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u80"><b>Visvires</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p80">Make malo effect disease, or<br />
<br />
Swap spears to poison resist, or something similar<br />
<br />
Both would be excellent ideas , however I imagine difficult to implement because of the current tuning of spells / focus's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u81"><b>Toothfairy_TP</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p81">Why the hell would an SK have bought SCS AA's in the 1st place?!<br />
Its blatantly obvious in the aa description that it reduces aggro from spell casting... <br />
  I understand you want it refunded or a toggle ...but Im wondering what  your reason for buying that AA in the 1st place?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u82"><b>Manslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p82">The reason a number of sks bought the SCS AA in the past was because getting aggro when you wanted was trivial even with the AA, while allowing you to increase your dps in situations while not tanking.  The amount of casting etc to gain aggro when you wanted it was essentially the same, while when you didnt want aggro you didnt have to FD or whatever to lose aggro quite so much which made for a decent DPS boost.<br />
<br />
Currently, getting aggro is no longer trivial, and with warrior aggro in its current state, you likely wont ever have to feign off aggro unless your MT dies or something so this AA is pretty much strictly detrimental.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u83"><b>Keyan Aubaine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p83">1. Increase to Knight tanking power bringing us closer to Warriors and seperating our tanking capabilities further from non tanking classes.<br />
<br />
 Fine.<br />
<br />
<br />
2. Addition of a method allowing us excel at our raid role (offtanking), rather than fill the gaps because you want your Warriors doing something else such as a 65% mitigation 20% channeling 12 sec duration 90 sec reuse discipline.<br />
<br />
 Fine.<br />
<br />
<br />
3. Access to nuke/heal crit AA's other classes (besides Wizards) recieve. We currently crit a mere 7% of the time vs their 19% when it comes to nukes. We also crit only 10% vs other classes 16% when it comes to heals. This would give us a reasonable DPS increase while bringing our healing inline.<br />
<br />
Fine, cleric nuking being more enhanced than ours makes little sense.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
4. Removal or Toggle on Spell Casting Subtlety. This AA brings nothing beneficial to the class in it's current form. All it serves to do is make us perform our role worse.<br />
<br />
 This is where i disagree. It does need to be changed, but i would put it under a AA revision section. Also to include: Leech Touch (Suggestion: Make the soul consumption and advanced soul consumption not affect the damage of Leech Touch, give it its own timer, and double the healing. This would get rid of the HT/LT being used back to back issue (an extra 900 damage is nothing really) but would allow to actually get a valuable heal. Since early luclin this AA has only gained 1000 points of healing, when mob DPS has increased many times that.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
5. Revision of Leech Touch. This AA costs 30 to max out and is worse in all cases than our other HT AA which only costs 18 to max.<br />
<br />
 See 4. Replace this with necro rez.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
6. An increase to channeling. As a class whos job it is to cast through hits we should excel at this aspect of casting.<br />
<br />
 Much needed, as it is, our usefulness is reduced a lot when taking hits. We cannot feign, use harmshield, or even taunt decently, which is kind of what a tank is supposed to do.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
7. Revision of focus effects aviable in GoD. There aren't enough focuses for HT, MR, and Distance.<br />
<br />
 Fine.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
8. An upgraded FD spell, Deathpeace was designed for 3 year old content. It cannot keep pace with mobs any longer.<br />
<br />
 Insta cast is pretty much required at this time... Or at the very least a spell that cannot be interrupted no matter what. A single mob is already hard to feign off if we are the target, but a pack of mob means death if they reach us due to the very short delays compared to when Death Peace went live.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
9. An increase to our spell based aggro (espically non damage aggro). It is the lowest of the 3 tank classes while we're supposed to be the highest aggro tank.<br />
<br />
 Fine.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
10. SK sustained DPS is behind some classes which it should be higher than such as Bards and Warriors.<br />
<br />
 Fine.</div></div><hr />
