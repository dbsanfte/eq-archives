<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Stumplin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was in bazaar tonight and there was an ooc that challenged anyone to duel in arena one on one.  I went as a joke because I am only lvl 20.  The player was a lvl 65 sk who sat and talked with me awhile saying that we are unbeatable in arena because we have an uresistable lifetap spell.  I'm sure he must be thinking of the lvl 65 touch of innoruuk.<br />
<br />
  Well a few minutes go bye and a lvl 65, I presume, paladin accepts the challenge and the two go at it.  Sk is using a weapon that looks like a blue staff that he called a Vanzer or something like that.  Paladin had a cool looking tearshaped shield and a mace weapon.  I tried to say as close to the action as I could and I saw the sk got a couple of exceptional heals in the 200pt range.  They fought for a few minutes with the sk trying to ss away but seldom being able to do it.  I'm thinking he was being bashed and interupted with shield.  Never did the paladin drop below 90 percent of his health.  For a few seconds the sk turned into a skelly but that didn't last long.  I was in awe this seemed like an epic battle.  But it finally ended with the sk at 60 percent health range and the paladin at 95 percent.  SK just stepped out of arena and I listened to them talking.  The sk said he never had a touch of innoruuk resisted or even partially resisted and he asked what the magic resistance was of the pally.  He said it was maxxed.  Not sure how much maxxed is but isn't that more than 200?  I think the sk was a little embarrased even though he didn't die.  I'm pretty sure the pally could have won if he didn't die of boredom first.<br />
<br />
  Was a great epic fight and the paladin said he has never lost a duel since getting his resists maxxed but said he had a hard time killing people as well.<br />
<br />
  My question is that is our 65 life tap spell resistable and if it is how much resistance would it take to do it?  <br />
<br />
Thanks all<br />

<br />
its -500 check. not unresistable but very difficult to resist, in fact i dont believe it can be fully resisted period<br />
<br />
all the info you need about resist checks on spells is on lucy..<br />
<br />
its a very powerful spell anyway. with the insane resist levels vt+elemental and beyond give you, many casters can't land a single spell on people, so between the lifetap and unresistable (with aa) harm touch coupled with high ac/hp SK are good duelists..<br />
<br />
the best necro lifetap is -250 resist, it's a joke to anyone with 280+ MR /sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">thats really odd no reason the sk should of been losing when he's fighting someone using a 1hander and he has a vanazeers. Never had ToI resisted myself in pvp myself in pve its resisted by MR immune mobs but thats about it. You said he didn't stay in skelly long? maybe paladin was anulling him and he had no instants?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Stumplin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I just noticed that it has a resist check of -500.  Could it have been possible that the pallys resist were that high?  Didn't think it would be possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tarrasque</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Resists max at 500, and Touch of Innoruuk has a -500 MR modifier, meaning that the paladin's effective MR would be 0 when making a resist check against this lifetap. You cannot resist or partially resist a spell with 0 in the appropriate resistance, so I am guessing the Shadowknight or Paladin lied, the Paladin somehow cheated/hacked, or cast Divine Aura (I'm not exactly sure if they get this spell since I've never played this class, but we get Harmshield so I assume they get Divine Aura too) and thus deflected the spell.<br />
<br />
I PvP many times every day and I have never had full or partial resists on Touch of Innoruuk. The only thing is that enchanters and other people with a damage absorb shield will indeed take the damage (which will be absorbed) but you will not be healed from the spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Krazaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Sanctification (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4518&amp;source=Live) might explain any resists of ToI.  I've never had ToI resisted by a PC, I don't think I've ever had it resisted by an NPC either, but I'm not positive on that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">DA for 3 ticks, Sanctification for 3 ticks...Sk might have only had some of his ToI resisted/invulnerable due to these two...but I imagine some must have landed...<br />
<br />
Went to help a guildmate do the broken/enraged golem in fear last night for his wizard alt, and since it is basically magic based spell immune ToI couldnt land. It happens pretty rarely, but it does happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have had some boss mobs resist ToI but its rare.  Can't remmber for sure which ones resisted it think some in SSRA</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kelv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">That shadowknight didn´t know what he was doing.<br />
<br />
Specially against a good paladin duelist, if a shadowknight does not save his mana to lifetap heal only when its really necessary, he will loose because the paladin will outheal him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Salaiin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i've had my friend resist TOI and he is a bard. I'm positive it can happen, he was probably playing song which got his mr up to 500. So it can happen, just rare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kormus the Dark Angel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Emperor anyone?<br />
Seru anyone?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Stumplin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">So does this mean at the very high end of pvp when it is possible for people to get mr to 500 that a class like paladin or even a cleric are almost unstopable?  I have noticed that on the server that the last few gm events have been won by clerics and bst.  Seems like they might not have the power to kill fast but could last for a long long time without any real threat of being killed.</div></div><hr />
