SO I have a 29 Shaman and a 28 Shadowknight, I’m going to keep the Shadowknight but figure I can use the Shaman to help level the Shadowknight for a few levels, I figure with hasting, healing and slowing mobs the Shaman will be usefull into the Mid 30’s then dump the account, what do you think?<br />
<br />
What are some good places to Level? I am twinked with an Iksar breastplate, War marshall blade, chitin handwraps and a couple of + HP items. Im thinking overthere to work on Sarnak braids for my Sledgemallet(Im an Ogre), how far do you think I can go before Shammy is useless?<br />
<br />
Also how is a Shadowknight for Soloing at Higher levels? I have a 55 Necro on that Same account and love to Solo with that Character.<br />
<br />
Advice is greatly appreciated</div></div><hr />

You can 2-box the pair all the way to 65 and beyond.  SK/Shaman is probably the best 2-box combo there is, and once your shaman has all his spells to 65 and canni 5, the two of you can go many places where once a full group of 55+'s were necessary.<br />
<br />
As far as soloing, the shaman has far greater soloing potential, and is a decent soloing class (good, but not great).<br />
<br />
I would imagine that with the combo and reasonably decent gear on both, you should be able to level both to 65 in about 20 days played or less.<br />
<br />
Places to go...<br />
<br />
DSP to 40 (work Velious faction in during this time, if necessary).<br />
40-50 - Gunthak, Dulak's, DL, Nurga, Jagged Pine<br />
50-60 - PoJ jail cells, ME, Acrylia Caverns, Nadox, Sebilis (after shaman is 58) PoD, PoN, PoI<br />
60-65 - PoI, PoN, PoD, PoV, PoS, Droga, CoD, BoT, HoH<br />
<br />
Check out the ZEM thread on this board for other places with good xp modifiers.</div></div><hr />

Shammy is froggy so I wont bother with Hammer for him.<br />
<br />
I could also try to power level the shammy with my 55 necro and duo them</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pest947</div><div class="date">03-03-2004, 02:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">would it be faster for my 55 necro to PL the shaman to 50 or so, then in turn have the shman pl my Shadowknight? or just group together? XP is so slow at Echo caverns duoing now at 28 and 29</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kenshi</div><div class="date">03-03-2004, 02:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would say duo them. That way you have the experience boxing both at the same time. Would also say go to a better exp zone like DSP, like at the shroom house or in CC at the orcs.</div></div><hr />

Ahh wouldnt dump the Shaman if I was going to stay 2, just dont want to two box as its soaking up even more time then EQ already should.<br />
<br />
Wana focus on my 55 Necro and continue to play MY SK as an alt, also may try Stormhammer for a couple of months as my friend can get me into a real nice guild there</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keevel</div><div class="date">03-03-2004, 05:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">that combo could rock in SolA until about 40</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oagan</div><div class="date">03-04-2004, 01:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, forgot about Sol A to 40, and The Hole entrance from about 44 - early 50's.  <br />
<br />
Your necro is a soloer, and one of the best.  The thing about 2-boxing a shaman/sk is that you never have to LFG, unless you want to.  A reasonably geared and AA'ed 65 shammy and SK combo will allow you to go to some great places, and actually handle camps in PoV that are often filled with full groups (which really pisses people off) if you really want to get some good xp (and are not flagged for other zones).<br />
<br />
The other benefit is that the combo will also let you camp some very respectable bazaar loot mobs, and make you some serious plat.  10k+/day is easy with that combo.<br />
<br />
Your characters are still fairly low-level.  The higher you go, the better it gets.  Quit now, or plan on being addicted.</div></div><hr />

Oh look now I am following you...</div></div><hr />
