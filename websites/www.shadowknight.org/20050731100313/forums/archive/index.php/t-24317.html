<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kelefane</div><div class="date">02-24-2005, 05:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just found out that my server (Solusek Ro) and Bristlebane are merging come March 23rd (Anyone else confirm this?)<br />
<br />
Im just curious as to how many Time+ American guilds are on BB~<br />
<br />
Solusek Ro has 3 of them - Age of Tyranny,Darkblood and Empyreal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gorgonbane</div><div class="date">02-24-2005, 06:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Conformation (http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=64026)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kelefane</div><div class="date">02-24-2005, 06:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yup....I just had that linked to me via AIM not long after I made that post.<br />
<br />
Solusek Ro has two American guilds in Qvic atm and one that farms PoTime and is working on Uqua.<br />
<br />
Im not for certain if this is good or bad and if it will make some guilds just vanish all together(Ive heard some rumors of people just server xfering and not wanting anything to even do w/ the merge)...I know Solusek Ro's population has been slightly down lately.<br />
<br />
Anyway, how many Time + American guilds are on BB?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Silvershadow</div><div class="date">02-24-2005, 06:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I guess I will ask the same question pertaining Euro guilds on Bristlebane then, since I am part of the half of Solusek Ro (or more than half possibly) that plays euro times. I'd also be interested in what guilds are at the elemental level, if any...<br />
<br />
http://www.lavanet.no/progress/ &lt;-- doesn't tell anything about time zones, nor does it say anything about EP's/Time anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kelefane</div><div class="date">02-24-2005, 06:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dont know...I feel as if this is being forced on us as a server instead of it being a huge plus....For one thing, Solusek Ro is losing its server name all together and Bristlebane is sucking us all in......This will honestly imo do more harm then good. Its gonna make people server xfer, cancel account etc...Its gonna cause some strife and to be honest, its all so sudden and w/o any real warning...A month from now? Come on, atleast give us 2-3 months to be prepared.<br />
<br />
And wasnt Bristlebane *already* one of the more populated servers right now? Why merge SolRo and BB then? SolRo is one of the smaller servers......Would think they'd merge a small server w/ a small server. Ah well~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Silvershadow</div><div class="date">02-24-2005, 07:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We used to be huge on server pop too, guess those days are gone tho... but yes, the crappiest part about this is losing the server name. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Luthaer</div><div class="date">02-24-2005, 07:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">- Arch Overseers is/was the most notable Euro guild on BB. They have been severely diminished recently, due to burn out and the wow/eq2 exodus.<br />
<br />
- Club Fu and Ring of Valor are both on american time.<br />
<br />
- Circle of Legengs.. I think they are on american time too, but I cant really say for sure.<br />
<br />
All of the above are recruiting heavily at the moment. Unguilded players that show their faces the right places, have to fence off &quot;offers&quot; almost daily. I guess they're bored.<br />
<br />
Those are the raiding guilds worth of mention on BB. There's probably some that will whine about their guilds being up there too, but thats my view on it.<br />
<br />
Personally I left AO just before the last dry spell set in.<br />
I kinda hope the merger kicks life into the raiding scene again, its so sad seeing them all running around bored in the easy content :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gorgonbane</div><div class="date">02-24-2005, 08:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sad to know AO is dimishiing/diminished.<br />
<br />
<br />
Their web site's my favorite</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krassus</div><div class="date">02-24-2005, 09:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">AO is euro and GOOD news is on Sol Ro we have some great Euro players who are just lacking #'s. Magna Charta and Wolfsclan both are pretty much stagnant atm because of low #'s and are both Euro so the AO people imo would fit in great with MC. Just looking at EQRankings I see a lot of similarities in gear.<br />
<br />
As Kelefane said we have 3 guilds which none have progressed past Qvic (like none even done stonemites in inuktuta) on Sol Ro american wise. Our guild is kind of the dont give a fuck guild, we just want to progress and not hold hands. We are fairly new having started 3 months ago. www.eqtyranny.org<br />
<br />
Darkblood is another American guild, currently doign Mshas in Qvic but they are a family and fun type guild. Lots of members, lots of people online and I think no inactive policy. www.darkblood.com<br />
<br />
Empyreal is kind of our special guild where if you get booted or rejected you will always have a home, but they do have some good players. www.eqempyreal.com</div></div><hr />

Our server hate boards, nasty no holds barred stuff lol<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xanathol</div><div class="date">02-24-2005, 10:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pretty much been covered above but...<br />
<br />
AO, Euro based, all but dead from my understanding, though I do see some heads popping up now &amp; again.<br />
<br />
CFu, American, CoA guild.<br />
<br />
RoV, American, Qvic I think.<br />
<br />
VF, American, Qvic I think.<br />
<br />
CoL, American, CoA I think.<br />
<br />
Also, I think only VF and RoV are hitting Time atm, with one guild approaching time. There is also Voodoo Dawn, but I have no idea where they are in progression.<br />
<br />
This merger is probably the stupidest thing I have seen SOE do in a while, and that's saying something. Historically, BB has been the heaviest populated server, and we finally have some relief with the exodus. WTF sense does it make to merge a high pop server with a low?!?!<br />
<br />
SOE's own statement was &quot;We hope that by merging some of our lower population servers with a higher population server, we will continue to enhance your gameplay experience&quot;.<br />
<br />
WTF!? Common sense says put the two low pop servers together...not to overcrowd a server yet again. Its not fucking rocket science....really...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kelefane</div><div class="date">02-24-2005, 10:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So Bristlebane hasnt even been hurting #s wise and yet SoE puts Solusek Ro w/ them? Is the recruit pool on BB down?<br />
<br />
Yeah, that doesnt make any sense what so ever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nocifer Deathblade</div><div class="date">02-24-2005, 10:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">WTF!?

<br />
Rock on and it actually saves maintence cost.. Actually, can put 3-4 low pop servers into one server that might equals to BB server heh. You eliminate the need of 2-3 server cost into 1 server that can save lot of money..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krassus</div><div class="date">02-24-2005, 10:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">right now sol ro has 100 people in bazaar, 41 in pok, 9 in PoTranq and 0 in RSS and 0 in PoFire...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kelefane</div><div class="date">02-24-2005, 10:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, Solro is deader then a doorknob in the early mornings American time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arturys Akunai</div><div class="date">02-24-2005, 01:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">AO was raiding Yxxta/RCoD if Im correct from the /who all &quot;Arch Overseers I did. Guess not too dead?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ghismonda</div><div class="date">02-24-2005, 01:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ugh.  Sounds like both of these servers have more active raiding guilds than Seventh.  Wonder why they chose them first.<br />
<br />
Is it possible that guild leaders spoke with GMs, similar to the zek guild leaders getting together and petitioning SOE for a merge?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xanathol</div><div class="date">02-24-2005, 02:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">AO, from what I gather, is not the AO of old ( obviously ). I know they have been getting new recruits, but to what extent, I do not know. All I know is most the folks I knew in there are gone, and if they possessed the strength they use to have, they'd be raiding MM in CoA, not Yxxta or RCoD. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Luthaer</div><div class="date">02-24-2005, 05:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">AO has like 25% experienced old players, rest is fresh meat getting trained and geared up in whatever content they can be dragged into.. I've seen quite a few in Qvic, and they asked to borrow my qvic enabled mage for CoH's.<br />
Its kinda sad, there was like 4 or 5 mages active at one point up to Qvic.<br />
<br />
Before they &quot;died&quot;, they did Anguish a lot.<br />
AO totally gave up on Time early in GoD, the drive that guild had was amazing.<br />
If they get some of the old driving force members back, they'll be up in no time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valkyria Grymreaper</div><div class="date">02-24-2005, 06:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We do Time rotation once a week still, farm Qvic often, still farm 69-70 rune mobs when up and had our first run at Inktu'ta last night.</div></div><hr />
