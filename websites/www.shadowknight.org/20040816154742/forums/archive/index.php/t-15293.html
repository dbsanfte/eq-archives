<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Qedemel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay, being that the new Nurga and Droga have gone live, and their respective levels have been raised significantly .... what effect, if any, is this going to have on the 7th khukri quest?  <br />
<br />
Temple of Droga was a 15 to 40 zone previously, but the mobs there have supposedly been &quot;toughened up&quot; to the point that they'll be blue to a 55 to 65 level player.  I'm assuming that this means that the Lord of Pain's Khukri can now only be attained by a player above those levels, or that the quest has been changed.  Anyone have news or ideas on this?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thacker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm not entirely sure since I didn't think to check that area when I was in Droga.  I do know that they have left it being a dungeon that invis works in.  I guess if someone is adventurous, or if I'm bored some time soon I may check, but I suspect it may be possible that the jail area was left untouched, or only moderately changed.  You can get in there invis still, so it would be doable.<br />
<br />
Anyways, if anyone feels like checking please post.  Otherwise when I get around to it I'll go down and check.  Already have greenmist though so it's not real high priority for me. ;)</div></div><hr />

In essence the jail mobs have been moved to the old Burynai caves in FM.  Just head over there and set up camp for your Khukri.</div></div><hr />

I can now resume losing lots of hair and sanity by the hour while camping for that elusive stone key.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>yuggoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Not just the jail mobs.... found Chief Rukgus and the Soothsayer up in another spot in the caves as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Arangar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">and the pottery wheel for the combine?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Talonmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If worst comes to worst, nothing in Droga sees invis and you can do the combine without invis dropping.   Gather Shadows and go to town.</div></div><hr />
