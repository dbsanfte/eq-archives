<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dizcord</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I always have metal corruption up.. and since patch it might go off 1 fight in 3  used top go off 3 times a fight. <br />
<br />
I talked to other Sk's on Bristlebane and they are having the same issue.  So I contacted a lead GM and he set my dex to 231 and it went up to procing 1 time every other fight... while my greenmist was procing like mad. <br />
<br />
Is it going off lots less for you or not at all ??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>The Zenogias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Mines been doing great at 200dex</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dizcord</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">SoD and greenmist go off alot  but we had sk's in my party MC would only go off 1 fight in 3 ... ugg used to 2 or 3 a fight at my 111 dex.<br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Keyan Aubaine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Works fine here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Hknightismaname</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Mental corruption worked fine for me it proc'd as usual with 200dex</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>itchy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">seems to be working fine for me</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Ronoh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I haven't noticed any difference in MC's proc rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>synnoira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I've seen no difference. The proc rate is very streaky i find, sometimes i will get this 2 or 3 times a fight proc rate people describe...then zip it seems for ages. Maybe you're just having a bad time with the rng.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Dizcord</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Synn I hope you are right ... cause right now this blows ..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Aaoogaa Soulhunter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Proc'ed four times for me yesterday in 90 minutes of fighting....seems broken.  It usually goes 3 to 8 times every ten minutes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Nikumu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Welcome to the EQ random number generator.  As any of us who do trade skills can tell you its the streakiest, most unreliable system in existance.<br />
<br />
As for MC (or any other proc) its just like that sometimes.  Been playing pretty heavily the last few days and have gotten MC to proc up to 4 times in a row, then it won't proc at all for the next fight.  Its been this way in EQ since the beginning.<br />
<br />
RNG is your friend :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Kahntun Derstand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Same here.  It's working as normal.<br />
<br />
Itchy, yellow armor is for girl paladins!<br />
<br />
Bick, don't say you're lazy and then bitch at someone with &quot;don't answer if it's too much trouble for you to type a sentence&quot;, lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Graznoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">SoChaos with 285 dex, seemed like it wasnt procing nearly as often as normal, but didnt actually do any parsing. I dont use MC often enough to judge, but it was proc'ing good for me on the only mobs I use it against (seru/emp). Can go through my logs later and check for actual #'s.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Melil Eskay</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Wait a minute... you were able to contact a GM on BB?!?!  *faints*<br />
<br />
Haven't noticed a difference in proc rate yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Ariakhis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">works well as ever for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Okami</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Seems fine to me,  but then I ahvent just left attack on the whole fight.<br />
One of my hotkeys turns off attack, begs, turns on attack, disarms. <br />
If there is something about it per battle, I'm not seeing much change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Xaphan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">SoC &gt; MC :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>synnoira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Kumadenie did a very nice log analysis a while back which showed that FD success rate has stayed the same through multiple patches. Perhaps somebody needs to do the same thing in this case to get to the bottom of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Chania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">It amuses me when people talk of the RNG as streaky or unreliable... How reliable do you want randomness to be? Anyone who has gone to a casino knows that streaks of 10 Blacks in a row, then 2 Reds, followed by 15 more Blacks are perfectly normal. I guess ppl would be happy if they proc'd a steady 3 times per fight, every fight, at 20 second intervals... Maybe then they can rename it the SNG, or Steady Number Generator...<br />
<br />
EQ's RNG works just fine. As a matter of fact, if you DIDN'T get times of drought, where you didn't proc at all, THEN I'd start to get worried.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Gwenix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I honestly have tried after I saw this thread and it hasn't procced for me once. Freaky coincedence or are some of us bugged?</div></div><hr />
