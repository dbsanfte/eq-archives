<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Culdahl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just got done looking at a few guild websites cause I was bored....Found it interesting that most mid to high-end guilds seem to be recruiting warriors and in some cases paladins but none were openly recruiting SK's...If that doesn't signal a problem, what does?<br />
<br />
  P.S. - I know there is no real point to this thread, but I was just kinda pissed knowing that even if I did want to raid more I probably can't cause most existing raiding guilds won't have me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Adomander</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The Main reason ive found (on Ab server anyway) for the lack of positions for Sk's in Mid to Hi end Guilds if the limitation to 54 people in God raids. At one point we had 6 Sk,s but now were down to 3 and not looking for more  :( Sadly were not the most needed class and our main job on GoD raids are usually to VoT the maintanks etc and you really dont need 3 sk's to do that.And due to the renown Viciousness of the God trash mobs we even got relegated from our normal offtanker jobs. And seeing as healer types (or Dps) are in greater need, knights simlpy have to make way. But im glad to say our Sk's have there own viciousness so after continously beating Our warriours to offtank Mobs ( and surviving )we got our jobs back  :D</div></div><hr />

It seems to be such  common state of denial, id say roughly half of the sks i know seem to think that the only problem with sk tanking , is a gear issue, and once they get their time/god gear they will be all set.    :(</div></div><hr />

Most guilds will take exceptional players, regardless of class. If you have trouble getting in, think of ways that you can improve yourself to be more desired.</div></div><hr />

Underpowered might be a bad word for it.<br />
I don't want new spells (I want mine fixed)<br />
I don't want new lines of capabilities (slow, SONGS?, cripples, etc.)<br />
<br />
We don't have the proper tools for tanking (defensive, stuns, etc.) at the high end.<br />

Hehe, three female iksar SKs ... When the server started up there was only 4 total iksar SKs.  Me, Trizon, Daikoku, Rebellion.  For the first couple months I checked that almost hourly.  Only reason I made one actually was because I saw all of zero in my time on Morell and Nameless.</div></div><hr />

<br />
but I do get to muck around a bunch wherever and keep progressing for the amount of time I have to play,  I got to EP's when I was rdy and wanting to be there.  I wanted to see, Kunark, TOV, NTOV, Vex Thall etc first.  I'm sure I will get to Time and high GoD too at some point.  Gotta stop and smell these flowers first though.<br />
<br />
I love my guild, way too fun for 3 years now!!!!  It has always provided me with what I want in game as much as a guild can.  Guilds can be made up of a core of good people, and if you invest your time and energy in them, you will get back tenfold.  Go jumping around and insulting others, and you get that back tenfold as well.<br />
<br />
and yes, the second trial was soo much easier than the first in GoD sewers!!<br />
Still think sk's need some work though<br />

Supersk and I are about it, we have a thrid (Raz) on the roster, but I not seen him raid in a long time, new app, but he will need a lot of flagginf, and with the changes in tipt I don't know,  If he can get flagged, and he raids, I think he will be good.<br />

Gatz was around someplace, or was he a server transfer?  Trizon being a PL'd twink from PN's heydays.  Cath and I in our House Hydra *cough*finery*cough* and Rebellion, I like rebellion, was guilded with him in SO2, but I refused to roll against him on a SoF fear raid.<br />
<br />
(Getting nastalogic here)<br />
<br />
ES seems to still have some SK's but they are just starting to get into time/God, same with TuT, though the CD influance there makes them an odd sort.<br />

<br />
What our leader does, is he pulls 2 mobs, has the WArrior tank one with the casters nuking, and me and the other high sk split tank the other one, we can hold the agro till the nukers and MT get on our target. Seems to work very well in most cases, allbeit, you have problems once in a while sure, but for the most part, its double the kill power.<br />

One thing I do find completely absurd is the fact that its an AA ability for SK's to hit criticals, thats total bs, I hope that gets changed more than alot of other things, and more combat ability tomes would be nice as well.<br />

I'd love to know what you base that on, cause it's certainly not from reading the posts of end-game SK's on this board.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Want to add that I probably agree with you on where the biggest problems are. To me it seems to me that the most broken range of SK's is not the very best geared SK's. Its the lesser geared SK's that see lots of single group content being tanked by warriors with simmilar gear, that they cannot even begin to tank. However, I still am not sure where you get that idea, because I see end-game SK's on this board saying they feel broken, mainly because much lower level Warriors outperform them tanking, not that there is any Single group content they cannot do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think it might all have been a spoof, like that one Epic 2.0 post that Brael put up several months back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I don't necessarily feel &quot;broken&quot;, but I certainly feel incapable of tanking in GoD.  We (the SKs in my guild) still pull, but we're so far removed from the level of contribution we had in PoP and before that it is extremely disheartening.  Its not easy to go from 4 years of solid raid contribution to being a waste of a raid spot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Surveyed 30 or so end-game SK's across various servers. Consensus was that although a few tweaks would help us (like a fear2/stun line, increased heals from life taps, improvement to FD, and a boost in off-tanking/pulling), not one SK felt they were broken at their level of content.<br />
<br />
If the lower level SK's don't feel broken, then my question was is it the SK's somewhere in between?<br />
<br />
There is no question we could use improvements, but most of the cries to &quot;fix us&quot; come with subjective experiences and not parsed proof showing the short comings of SK's vs. other classes. One exception is the effect of Paladin stuns on trash mobs.<br />
<br />
There was a serious problem with knight tanking when Gates first was released, but a lot of that has been addressed in content fixes. We still need improvement, but not to the degree some are advocating. We can still contribute a ton at every level of the game, but unlike other classes that have very rigid jobs, hybrids, with some imagination, can be useful in a variety of ways, and SOE has designed a lot of the new encounters with that in mind.<br />
<br />
Anyone who has had an SK for since the game started or close to it, knows that we have had to find creative ways to reinvent ourselves over the years. SK's used to suck, I mean really suck. We had so much going against us at one point that if some of you had to relive those days you would question why anyone would continue to play an SK.<br />
<br />
The sky is not falling. We need some love, have gotten some, and will continue to get more. The twelve page whine fests that pop up every time a new SK finds his gear/skill/group doesn't allow him to tank mobs in the new zone he just got flagged for are getting a bit tiresome and counter productive.</div></div><hr />

The problem remains - it is far, far easier to put together a group with a warrior (and sometimes a paladin because of their ability to not only stun but Rez) in lower end GoD stuff when you are elemental, light VT, some LDoN (no raids) geared. <br />
<br />
Parse me sitting LFG for fucking hours when pallies and warriors get preference to push through the guild, few people at a time, through some of the lower trials, that will clue you in.<br />
<br />
OMG I can totally tank vxed or tipt with only a bunch of deaths, 2 healers, mandatory chanter, bard slow on pull with heavier slow asap. No kidding!<br />
Funny that a warrior can go in there with one healer, more dps and rack in EXP at a much higher rate.<br />
<br />
This is where some leverage needs to be made. I don't know what &quot;low&quot; and &quot;high&quot; levels are but I do know that what you're assuming to be low level can be made up with gear, and don't come down to requiring the best slow and multiple healers to be successful.<br />
<br />
Some people consider being 3rd choice for tank a state of &quot;brokenness&quot; especially when it comes to raid and single group raid-in-a-can roles.<br />
<br />
Bazaar gear warrior shouldn't be &gt; than heavily VT/Ele geared SK in low level god. If I have no business bothering with the content till time, then how do you rationalize a tink-bot warrior being able to?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">no way, cause high end = the best drops available in time and gates... So if you dont have 20% sheilding, a ton of improved avoidance and parry, 8.5k+ 2k+ac you dont belong in gates as a knight... remember same doesnt apply for any other class</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">It's mostly a matter of semantics - it depends on how you define &quot;broken,&quot; &quot;fix,&quot; and &quot;tweak.&quot;<br />
<br />
I wouldn't consider... (like a fear2/stun line, increased heals from life taps, improvement to FD, and a boost in off-tanking/pulling) ... to be a tweak.  I'd consider that to be a major fix, and I'd consider a class that needs all that to be broken.  <br />
<br />
As it stands, there is no reason to use an SK over another class for anything except that guilds can't recruit enough other classes to fill our role - we are 3rd rate at best for everything, and that doesn't cut it.  There's a difference between being sufficient to accomplish something and being balanced.  Currently we're the former.  Content changes don't address balance, they address &quot;being sufficient to accomplish something&quot; - they mask balance issues.</div></div><hr />

If we're not broken, why the hell do we need &quot;fear2/stun line, increased heals from life taps, improvement to FD, and a boost in off-tanking/pulling&quot;? That seems like a huge list of items that would indicate that people think we need major upgrades to be made competitive... What is your definition of broken?<br />
<br />
If the lower level SK's don't feel broken, then my question was is it the SK's somewhere in between?<br />
<br />
I think I answered this above. Warriors at the level I'm at can tank single group content that I cannot. There are 5 classes that can pull this very same content and 1 class that can tank it. I don't need pulling improvements. I need tanking improvements so that I can participate in the same single group content that the warriors can.<br />
<br />
There is no question we could use improvements Once again you are contradicting yourself... Why do we need improvements if we are not broken?<br />
<br />
but most of the cries to &quot;fix us&quot; come with subjective experiences and not parsed proof showing the short comings of SK's vs. other classes. One xception is the effect of Paladin stuns on trash mobs. Personally I have an easier time knowing that I take more healling on trash than pallys do, then knowing that there are simply some single group mobs that I simply cannot tank, that Warriors of my level and gear can.<br />
<br />
There was a serious problem with knight tanking when Gates first was released, but a lot of that has been addressed in content fixes. Not from what I can see. Look at Barindu named for example. Warriors of my caliber can easily tank the named there with defensive and one healer. Yet, I have a terrible time with the very same mobs. Why? A level 65 SK with no AA's can tank all the non named in Barindu with ease, but yet the named there will absolutely shred that same level 65 SK. So I disagree with you strongly that its been fixed. Why would a group want me as their tank if I cannot handle the named?<br />
<br />
We still need improvement, but not to the degree some are advocating. We can still contribute a ton at every level of the game, but unlike other classes that have very rigid jobs, hybrids, with some imagination, can be useful in a variety of ways, and SOE has designed a lot of the new encounters with that in mind. Yet if we cannot tank things that similar warriors can, why would they group want us as a tank? I've yet to see one encounter where SK's in the tanking role offer any advantage over a Warrior.<br />
<br />
Anyone who has had an SK for since the game started or close to it, knows that we have had to find creative ways to reinvent ourselves over the years. SK's used to suck, I mean really suck. We had so much going against us at one point that if some of you had to relive those days you would question why anyone would continue to play an SK What does that have to do with the current situation? I'm trying to see, but I can't come up with anything. Are you telling us that we should be happy that we suck because at one time we really sucked? I don't see any valid correlation there. Sorry.<br />
<br />
The sky is not falling. We need some love, have gotten some, and will continue to get more. The twelve page whine fests that pop up every time a new SK finds his gear/skill/group doesn't allow him to tank mobs in the new zone he just got flagged for are getting a bit tiresome and counter productive. Well tell that to the groups looking to explore new content. I'm sure they will take the warrior that can do new single group content that we cannot. Is that what you are advocating? Maybe you are advocating, that sk's should strictly compete for pulling jobs in these places. Of course there are six classes of like geared classes that can pull these places, and only 1 that can tank the named descently. So why would a PUG take an SK over a similarly geared warrior?</div></div><hr />

improvement to FD,<br />

So having a slim chance of survival performing our main job, tanking, does not mean you are broken? Again, this issue addressed by possible mitigation/invuln discs not one SK felt they were broken at their level of content.<br />

<br />
<br />
If the lower level SK's don't feel broken, then my question was is it the SK's somewhere in between?<br />
First off, I don't feel broken anymore because I've bought into the crap that i'm gonna take only marginally more of a beating than a warrior. At my level, there is supposedly a slim difference between warriors and knights in relation to the shit I tank. I seemed to have noticed a bit bigger gap, but all the experts tell me there isn't, so who am I to argue?<br />
Second, this question you ask assumes that your summation of how end game knights feel is in fact, accurate. which I somehow am doubting. But I could be wrong! Im not expert, as I've stated.<br />
<br />
<br />
There is no question we could use improvements, but most of the cries to &quot;fix us&quot; come with subjective experiences and not parsed proof showing the short comings of SK's vs. other classes.<br />
Getting your ass kicked at 11000 hp and 2k AC when a warrior with 9k hp and 1600 ac does not, needs parsing?<br />
One exception is the effect of Paladin stuns on trash mobs.<br />
The one thing I can agree with you on is probably teh least likely to be worked on. It'll take a pally nerf to fix, and nerfs aren't popular.<br />
<br />
There was a serious problem with knight tanking when Gates first was released, but a lot of that has been addressed in content fixes. <br />
Not according to many of the SKs that post on this board.<br />

So you are not advocating a mitigation fix to knights?<br />
We can still contribute a ton at every level of the game, but unlike other classes that have very rigid jobs, hybrids, with some imagination, can be useful in a variety of ways, <br />
There is a giant difference between useful and preferred. They two are not often inclusive<br />

Well, I think what I'm trying to get at here, is that while SKs may be capable of doing their job (tanking) with success relative to other SKS, in relation to the other two tanking classes, most high end SKS (including yourself, if I remember correctly) are in fact, broken.</div></div><hr />

Class correspondant seems to me would have to give the devs the view points of all of the SK's, not just one's own opinions. Had they made me the rep, I would not have shoved my own views down their throat. Brael is the best choice imo.<br />
<br />
My definition of broken is that I am unable to do my job. To expand that we could define it as unable to do our job given reasonable gear/skill/group for the zone we are in. I'm still able to do my job, but changes would allow me to do it better.<br />
<br />
Need for improvements != broken. Semantics. See Brael's post above.<br />
<br />
Looking at the big picture, where do you really stand in relation to similarly geared warriors and paladins in doing your job? Seriously, share your experiences, because I'm interested in hearing them. I love this class and want to know as much as I can about it. Doing that requires as much knowledge as I can get about it from various viewpoints. <br />
<br />
I have had no complaints, and get asked to group every night. I don't feel I get passed up for groups over paladins or warriors, some of that is a function of my guild I suppose. Each class brings something different to the table. But the comparison is not really fair, what's challenging for me at the moment is off-tanking in the Zun Muram fight, and experience groups are just really grinds or farming. I have to say a big part of success in experince groups is attributable the group I am with. There is a vast difference between a great cleric and a good cleric, same for druids, chanters or almost any other class. Having a very skilled group makes a huge difference. <br />
<br />
Rhumba we have had the similarly geared warrior discussion before. They are designed to be better tanks. Is this ideal? Some say yes, others no. Regardless that's how the game works.<br />
<br />
As far as Barindu named, they are hard. For someone in bazaar/BoT/LDoN gear (despite it being some of the best available) Barindu named are going to be very hard without a really solid group. An SK with raid gear is going to have an advantage over you, so is a warrior with defensive. For some reason there are a few zones that are harder than the ones after them like Vxed/Kod'taz, and Barindu/Sewers.<br />
<br />
As far my recommendations to improve us, I have been posting in the Suggestions forum, and for the person that asked, one does include a mitigation adjustment. I would like to see us be better off-tanks, and as a result of off-tanking improvements, be better single group tanks and pullers. Like Brael and others, I don't feel a long-term refresh defensive or weapon shield discipline is the answer.<br />
<br />
I can respect your frustration. But before we scream that we are broken, ask yourself if you have done everything you can to make yourself better. If you feel you have, and you still feel there is a legitimate concern, parse the problem or show proof in some other way. If you have a valid point and can demonstrate it clearly, the devs have shown in the past to make adjustments. Brael has been a great example of doing this in the past and has gotten many things done for us.</div></div><hr />

I can repeat myself forever. Why would a single group take a SK over a Warrior if they were after Barindu named then? I've asked this to you before, and you never answer. We are perfectly fine on single group trash mobs, we are not fine on named. We could carry it to Vxed/Tipt Named (not bosses) also. Why would a group at my level take a SK over a Warrior that can tank the named? IF we can't at least tank ALL of the mobs available in Single Group content, then we are broken, because a group is stupid to take us over a Warrior in that situation. Silver, my biggest issue with your points is that you Always compare SK's in one loot teir level with with Warriors on another level. If I cannot tank all mobs in single group content that a warrior of the same level can tank, there is no reason to have me in GoD, where 6 classes can easily pull in single group content [I've done up through Sewers].</div></div><hr />

<br />
Vxed and Tipt are very challenging for any tank at this point.  A medium-equipped Warrior (pre-VT) will get waxed very quickly when defensive goes down.<br />

<br />
Rhumba let me try to answer your question. The answer is that that they would take an SK over a warrior if they wanted to grind faster and have more utility, yet still have a tank. In many zones SK's can add more overall sustained group DPS than a warrior or paladin can, and less down time. They would not take an undergeared SK that could not tank the named. SK's can tank Barindu named, have since Gates came out, and continue to. Undergeared SK's cannot, unless they have a solid group. If you are having trouble, look at how you can make yourself better able to perform in those zones.<br />
<br />
By the nature of the way warriors are designed, mostly due to their disciplines, they will be able to tank harder mobs before knights. It has always been this way. Once those mobs become more trivial (through experience with the fights, gear, and AA's for the entire group), smart groups often prefer knights, though all three can be used.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Howlitoezis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">Very nice post, Siilver.<br />
And yes, I suppose it is a matter of semantics.<br />
It kinda boils down to this:<br />
If you are capable of your job as a tank, but others are MORE capable, you wont be chosen to do your job.<br />
In some ways, I'm lucky to be in a small guild. There are usually only 5 to 8 people on in my range, so I am always needed in some role or another. Offtank, MT, dps, CC, scouting, whatever.<br />
People in larger guilds, or no guilds, face a different problem though. In larger guilds, there will always be a warrior or pally in your range who will be picked over the SK as MT in group because of the current tanking discrepencies. And guildless people deal with the same thing in their pickup groups.<br />
I define this as broken. Can we tank these? Yes. Will people let us tank them? No.<br />
I've built up a reputation in my guild, and they know I am capable. I hunt often with a full group of 65s from my guild, though I am only 58.<br />
But again, not everyone is as lucky as I am in this regard.<br />
<br />
Yes, having a skilled group makes things much easier. However, SKs should not be REQUIRED to be surrounded by a skilled group when other tanks are not.<br />
When I asked where you stand in relation to the pallies and warriors in your guild, it wasnt just &quot;do i get groups&quot;, it was also, how well do you perform in your task compared to them in the same content?<br />

<br />
It wasn't always &quot;this way&quot; because warriors didn't have snap aggro, whereas knights did. They also didn't always have such a huge mitigation bonus without at least some ground-gaining by the knights. Please explain which GoD aas even start to make up for the new gulf?<br />
<br />
Nobody is saying that SKs can't, eventually, tank portions of GoD. What is saying is that the gap between what warriors can do, and when they can do it, and what SKs can do, and when they can do it is grossly disproportionate.<br />
<br />
For instance, before I apparently had any business being there, I did a few sewer trials, and failed without 2 healers. Then a warrior who hadn't played for *months* logs on and succeeds. Then they say &quot;hey, we don't need 2 healers&quot; and grab a dps class and finish the next pass through the same trial in far less time.<br />
<br />
Your concept of being undergeared is short sighted, as an Ele SK is &quot;undergeared&quot; for GoD without certain AAs and heavy gear saturation, whereas a warrior and in some cases paladin can have less gear and aas and not be considered &quot;undergeared.&quot;<br />
<br />
The STFU and get some time gear argument would be nice except when a warrior complains its STFU and get some pop tier 2 gear 8P~</div></div><hr />

SK's and Pally's are very similar in their capability to tank in a group.  The main difference is that Pally's have LoH to bail themselves out in an emergency, and also have the ability to mitigate damage via stuns on some mobs.  Sk's on the other hand do significantly more DPS on non-undead mobs than a Pally and can play more roles in an XP group.<br />
<br />
A group that I was in would never pick a Pally over an SK purely for the reasons above.  In fact, most groups that my Rogue, Cleric or Shaman was in would much prefer the SK for the extra DPS.  We might prefer a Pally if our main healer was a Druid though, for rez.<br />
<br />
The Warrior question is different.  There is a substantive difference in the ability of Warriors to mitigate damage compared to Knights. The tradeoff is a slightly better ability by the Knights to gain and maintain aggro and the utility that Knight classes bring to the group.<br />
<br />
If I want to sit and grind XP all night there is just no question that I would prefer a Knight, and in most cases an SK.  If I have a specific targetted goal in mind and I know that the target is either unslowable or has tremendous flurry damage then I really prefer a Warrior.</div></div><hr />

Nope.  Stuns are grossly overpowered.<br />
<br />
The tradeoff is a slightly better ability by the Knights to gain and maintain aggro and the utility that Knight classes bring to the group.<br />
My guild's warriors can out agro me any day of the week and out damage me simply by turning on attack unless I decide to empty the mana bar.  Try grouping with a fully time/god geared warrior.  What does a group get with me that they dont get with a warrior?  Significantly more mana spent on heals and FT 21 that doesnt cover the difference.</div></div><hr />

I never seem to have trouble getting pick up groups and thats in old world content, new world content, and LDONS, tier one plains, no sweat, tier 2 we usually hit with the guild, as far as time goes, I'll never see it cause my guild prolly wont hit that point since we dont have the &quot;fantastic numbers&quot; needed.<br />
<br />
That being said, hybrids are ALWAYS a pain to push period, I have no trouble tanking mobs at my level, I usually have a cleric in the group and a shammie or two. And dont jump my butt for saying so, but what does a high end knight think? are you gonna tank EVERYTHING that comes down the pike? absolutely not, nor is a pally or whatever else, at some point they WILL need to be healed and buffed, therefore making it the rest of the parties deal to keep your plate wearing hind end alive.<br />
<br />
Being the fact im only level 56, dont tell me &quot;it cause you havent seen the WHOLE game yet&quot; or blah blah blah, Ive had this SK since i started playing 4 years ago, I know its ins and outs and I say Im not broken, I could use some refinements sure, but broke? please, thats a craptastic statement IMHO.<br />
<br />
Bottom line, do your job, pull the agro off the casters, get healed and tank, its what WE do, suck it up and just quit bitching about it till we get some refinements.<br />

<br />
I don't know how the pickup group game is going at this point, because I don't do pickup groups.  My guild has a half dozen Warriors, a couple of Pally's and a couple of SK's who are generally available for grouping in a normal play session.  I will happily group with any of them as the MA in an XP group.<br />
<br />
Now, if I'm going to Vxed or Tipt the list gets cut down to 3 Warriors, 1 Pally and 1 SK I would trust to tank.  If no Cleric is available, for BoV and fast heals, then I don't trust any of the tanks in my guild to stand up to a 3 hour pounding without falling down on the job and causing a wipe.  That's not saying anything about play skills, it's all about the mitigation and recovery that a Cleric brings to the picture.<br />
<br />
BTW, I would see a legitimate gripe on the Vxed/Tipt mobs if a Warrior could handle them backed by a Druid and a Pally/SK could not.  That's not the situation at this point, you need the Cleric more than you need the Warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>Rhumba_Kween</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">They would not take an undergeared SK that could not tank the named. SK's can tank Barindu named, have since Gates came out, and continue to. Undergeared SK's cannot, unless they have a solid group. If you are having trouble, look at how you can make yourself better able to perform in those zones.<br />
<br />
Siilvir, I've said it multiple times now, and apparently you think its better to just continue to ignore it. But you continue to compare different gear levels of characters. Of course an overgeared SK can tank the named in Barindu, which seems to be what you are arguing. /shrug<br />
<br />
If I want to sit and grind XP all night there is just no question that I would prefer a Knight, and in most cases an SK. If I have a specific targetted goal in mind and I know that the target is either unslowable or has tremendous flurry damage then I really prefer a Warrior.<br />
<br />
I'd agree with you Merf. Unfortunately, there is less and less need to grind XP in lieu of attempting harder content that can also net experience these days for most groups. Maybe OOW will actually present a reason to grind xp again, that we've not seen since the PoP days.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, they're talking level 70 in OOW, which is probably a mistake, but will clearly present an incentive to grind again.  And they're going to throw in the usual 50 pts woth of attainable and useful AA's, so I think we can safely say that grinding is not going away any time soon.<br />
<br />
Also, for the people who do not need to grind AA's at this point, well the odds are that they have the gear to tank fairly well except for the top bosses.  So I kind of think that argument is self-adjusting.<br />
<br />
Gear and AA's are about 90% of the equation for any melee.  Hybrids get spells as the other 10% and Warriors get disciplines.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>signa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">Nobody is saying that SKs can't, eventually, tank portions of GoD. What is saying is that the gap between what warriors can do, and when they can do it, and what SKs can do, and when they can do it is grossly disproportionate.<br />
<br />
<br />
Whats being said is that Sks, right now, can tank portions of god. Can we tank those portions better then a warrior? No, we can't. Thats not broken. You or others may not be happy with it, but thats how its intended to work. Warriors can and always will be able to tank content before SKs can. Its what the class was designed for, and what warriors work for. Thats what people playing warriors wanted when they rolled their toons. <br />
<br />
Everyone wants to be able to get groups, have fun, enjoy their class, feel useful and that they are contributing to their guild. What you need to do is look and find what you can have fun doing, what your toon is capable of accomplishing, and stop focusing constantly on what you can't -yet- do. Bitching because an equally/slightly lesser geared warrior can tank a named and you can't is pointless because you're griefing over what your class was designed for.<br />
<br />
Warriors being the best raid tank, being able to tank content before knights can, or other classes pulling some situations better then us, does not make us broken. Everyone in everquest needs a role, and specialist classes should be doing their role the best. In the case of warriors, they should be able to tank better then a hybrid. If they can't, whats the point in someone choosing to play a warrior over a knight?<br />
<br />
Right now I will say that I believe the gap between our roles and the specialist classes that also perform them is too wide. That doesn't me we're a broken and absolutely unusable class. I'm very undergeared for where I'm at, but guess what, I still tank Qvic xp groups and, while it may not be perfect, the group still makes sweet XP and we get to have a good time. We do need some tweaking to bolster our abilities to perform our primary/secondary roles and to bring us more in line with our knight counterpart. What we don't need is bitching that the sky is falling down because another class can perform a job better then we can.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Domono<br />
56 SK<br />
Fennin Ro<br />
<br />
<br />
It's not because you haven't seen high level content.<br />
I will attempt to lay it out clearly for you. <br />
<br />
1. The &quot;height&quot; of the level doesn't matter. <br />
<br />
2. Bazaar and LDoN bought gear only get &quot;a character&quot; so far, maxing at the 1492 point armors, some LDoN hard if you're really on your game, and filled in with ornate and perhaps a low tier PoP weapon. After that it's innate abilities and AAs. At your stage in the game, if you max all of your abilities and totally pimp yourself out in the best ldon/bazaar/low pop gear, you are pretty much the same as a warrior in a grouping situation, in some cases even better.<br />
<br />
3. The distance that carries certain classes, due to the nature of the innate abilities, is FARTHER than the distance it carries a knight class.<br />
<br />
4. So, at all points of the game where bazaar/LDoN gear and non-maxed/essential AAs are all factors, SKs can easily outshine warriors.<br />
<br />
5. Thusly, according to your level and what zones you have access to, you are simply unaware of what happens past the realm of relying on that mixed up jumble of gear and abilities to compensate. <br />
<br />
6. When we're talking about &quot;best case scenarios&quot; for guilds who are different sizes and let's say, at high tier elementals, in time, lowish tier god, mid tier god, high tier god, there's a hell of a lot of flipflop that can happen. Just because someone is one of 4 tanks in their guild and are permagrouped or hydra or are able to have fun doesn't mean there aren't hard coded discrepancies that separate classes' desirability with such a chasm as there is between warriors and pal/sk. The gearing issue is just rubbing shit in our face, when someone can spend far more time and effort getting gear just to lose out to someone with far less in the desirability category.<br />
<br />
7. For reference, look at desirability chasms between DPS classes, healing classes, or crowd control classes. Understand, now?</div></div><hr />

Brael stole my thunder.  Those were my lines.  :mad:  :mad:  :mad: <br />

<br />
All the people saying, &quot;well tanking is the warrior job - they should exceed us in all aspects of it&quot;:  If warriors have a god-given right to absolute tanking superiority, then what exactly do you envision the knight role to be?  Fill the gaps because your guild doesn't have enough warriors and you don't have time to start a new character?  <br />
<br />
Fact of the matter is, knights are tanks - we always have been.  It's not exclusive warrior territory.  Tanking raid bosses is traditionally warrior turf, but beyond that, it wasn't until recently, excepting the Kunark era.  Not only were warriors not the exclusive tanks in the past, but for offtanking roles, knights were preferred.  <br />
<br />
EQ has three tank classes, not just one.  All three should be equally viable for single-group content.  All three should have a role on raids: warriors MT the big stuff, knights offtank the rest.  <br />
<br />
Until recently, single-group content didn't require a warrior - all three tanks were viable, and each had advantages.  As it is now, a knight needs a higher of gear than the warriors he's competing with to be equally viable on current single-group content.  An EP warrior shouldn't be able to function in single group content that a Time knight cannot.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As for the people saying &quot;we're not broken, we just need upgrades&quot; - seriously, STFU.  Arguing semantics isn't good for anybody.</div></div><hr />

The problem is in GoD no matter how skillful a player you are Sks get owned trying to tank a lot of the single group content.

It doesn't take much really:<br />
<br />
- Watered down defensive style discipline (less mitigation than warrior version, slightly shorter duration, slightly longer refresh).<br />
<br />
- fortitude, furious, nimble, etc style discipline.<br />
<br />
- Innate mitigation, such as the warrior has, but slightly lower.<br />
<br />
- FUNCTIONING and REAL upgrades to the terror line.<br />
<br />
- Lesser form of Stalwart Endurance via AA.<br />
<br />
- Lesser form of Sturdiness via AA.<br />
<br />
For starters.<br />
<br />
This would put us above Rangers, Monks, Rogues, etc just as warriors are above us. Warriors remain the only choice for people with a brain on named, warriors remain a competetive choice in 6 man content. Knights are restored to their offtanking role, knights are once again an option in ALL 6 man content. <br />

Defensive is not going to fly.  I agree with a lot of what you posted but we won't get it.<br />

Just look at the error messages our spears get at .5 sec cast.  Also with the time we have to take to stop and turn so the server can see we are no longer moving and the spell refresh we are already looking at a few seconds to cast and FD.<br />

Noone is asking for defensive. The discipline I propose mitigates less, lasts less time, and takes longer to refresh. Quite a bit different. Warriors mitigation disciplines, and content made specifically with them in mind, are the absolute central problem here. Ignoring it makes everything else nothing but fluff.<br />
<br />
We need to be specific and reasonable to what we can get. <br />
<br />
What I proposed is quite specific, and most reasonable. Stop asking to be made a better weak sister, and start asking to be made not only viable, but competetive. The SK class has suffered battered wife syndrome far too long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u98"><b>Belyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p98">I would much rather have parry then riposite disc, it is much more useful for offtanking roles.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u99"><b>Domono</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p99">Well lets see you say you have been playing for 4 years but your gear is junk.  You have not even hit 65 yet.<br />
<br />
You dont show any evidence or raiding but your going to sit there and call the much more accomplished people of this board slackers ?<br />
<br />
If anyone is a slacker its you !<br />
<br />
Get a clue.  You don't know anything about this game.  I was 60 when you were killing firebeetles.<br />
<br />
I have a 65 sk with 870 aa, have raided plane of time, and done raids in GoD Ikkiniz.  I stared raiding in Kael years ago.  Worked my way up Hate, Fear, Sky planes, Plane of Growth, ToV, Ntov SSRA, VT All the pop tiers elemental, plane of Time, Passed the Tipt and Vxed trials and Raided in Ikkiniz.<br />
<br />
Did I forget to mention I am the Ldon leader on Cazic Thule with over 700 wins and all my armor is augmented?<br />
<br />
In addition I have a 65 druid with 100 aa, 61 Ranger with 50 aa or so including all archery aa's.<br />
<br />
So who is the slacker here you punk?<br />
<br />
Granted, its taken me this long to be this level, why, hmm, lets see, I have a life and it doesnt revolve around a game, or fuckheads like you.<br />
<br />
Its a game bonehead, get it? prolly not, your life revolves around it.<br />
<br />
What I cant stand is the minute someone posts something on here someone doesnt agree with, &quot;boom&quot; there retarded, an asshole or whatever, I have plenty of friends in game and RL that play, they play a variety of toons all at varrying levels, alot of them have uber toons that do Time and what not, and yes jackhole, I talk with them about it, Im over at their house while they are involved with it. I tell you one thing for sure, they dont constantly bitch about thier knights not tanking well, they do their job, and well I might add.<br />
<br />
So go do yourself a favor and fuck yourself. I know plenty about this game,  quote all your l33t skills, they mean absolutely jack. I could have come here and stated the same, but it would have been false, i came straight away and said that THAT particular argument meant exactly zero, knowledge of the game is one thing, being able to play it smart is quite another, and im assuming you arent in either camp. And actually cazic thule is the big and small lots of servers anymore, so again, go fuck yourself.<br />
<br />
Tell me, did it hurt when they cut your balls off asshole?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u100"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p100">No actualy, its not THAT friggin hard, Ive done it now for 4 years, so have others. Besides all that, look at my magelo, its not anything to write home about either, its not &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;uber&quot; but it does what its supposed to do for me atm. I say, suck it up, stab yourself in the eye with a sharp stick and do whats asked of you and be happy about it, or dont play the fucking game. That simple really. I hate people that bitch endlessly about things that arent that bad, or at least useable. People like you would argue christ off the cross and go back for the nails you bastard.<br />
<br />
Any OTHER pearls of wisdom you'd like to share with the class?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Domono<br />
<br />
1) You're 56 - you can't do the current content.  <br />
<br />
2) Please direct me to the part of that post containing your magelo.<br />
<br />
3) As paying customers, we're entitled to a quality product.  Glaring class imbalence makes us, the paying customers, unhappy with the quality of the product.  It's our right to voice our discontent.  <br />
<br />
SK's are not having any problems in old world content, LDON's and tier one and two pop.<br />
<br />
I would not expect you to understand the areas where we are having issues since you are not of the level to experience this. <br />
<br />
The problem isn't nearly as severe at the low-mid end, but it's still a problem.  This is naturally because our abilities don't scale and our competitors' do, but on anything but the most trivial content, SK's are behind the curve to a certain extent.  <br />
<br />
 Oh give me a friggin break, firstly, my english is fine, get the skewer out of your goddam ear jackhole, case in point I said earlier that saying I havent seen that portion of the game is a shitty argument at best, so blow it out your ass. <br />
<br />
It's a very valid argument.  Our abilities don't scale and our competitions' do, thus we're naturally more powerful relative to warriors and paladins at the lower end than the higher.  That's assuming your 65 though - you're not, so you don't even have the full range of SK abilities at your disposal, nor are you competing with the full range of warrior and paladin abilities.  You're not experiencing the same type of content either.  <br />
<br />
Second, I am simply saying that its irrelevant to bitch endlessly that yours and my class are broken or in &quot;dire&quot; need of repair, its a lame ass excuse for being a slacker in my opinion. <br />
<br />
Opinions are like assholes - everybody has one and yours sucks.  <br />
<br />
I'm not content to bend over and take it when my class needs fixed; I guess you are... score one for the lube manufacturer.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Again, do your job, quit bitching and just carry on, adapt to what you do moron.<br />
<br />
God, the only reason you exist is because the mailman didnt pull out quick enough, your a fucking waste of dna...<br />
<br />
<br />
Die! <br />
<br />
That pretty well speaks for itself.<br />
<br />
another newtank? or same old newtank? <br />
<br />
He's like the 5th retard of the month... Like I said, we need an official idiot of the week/month award; the voting results would be interesting.<br />
<br />
- Watered down defensive style discipline (less mitigation than warrior version, slightly shorter duration, slightly longer refresh). <br />
<br />
Wrong direction - we need something specific to knights' needs, not a watered down warrior discipline.  The goal isn't just &quot;to be a little closer to warriors&quot; - it's to have the tools to excell in our role (offtanking) just as warriors have the tools to excell in theirs (raid MT'ing) and restore some resemblence of equality in single group content.  <br />
<br />
Defensive is not going to fly. I agree with a lot of what you posted but we won't get it. <br />
<br />
Then quit calling it defensive because that's not what we're asking for.  We're asking for a tanking discipline developed specifically for knights needs, and the best way to impliment that happens to be the same as the way defensive is implimented... oh what a coincidence.</div></div><hr />

I have never in my life encountered so many bitches, ever. I know what im speaking of, may be offbase  a little, but not that much.<br />
<br />
I really think i dont belong here tho, you are all like opinions here, youre ALL assholes and shoud be rounded up, placed on an island and then nuked.<br />
<br />
I understand prejudism now, its not against colors, its against fucking stupidity.<br />
<br />
Stupid people should ALL be shot in the head, this board has a ton of volunteers, you all just dont know it yet you retards.<br />
<br />
I guess its true, dickheads rule the world and the internet is no different.<br />
<br />
You can all go self fornicate.<br />

<br />
Nope, my point is not lost, I have it, I know what I ws speaking of, I am just confident enough in my opinion and skill level to know when Im beating a dead horse, or your mom either one.<br />
<br />
Far be it from me to lodge an &quot;opinion&quot; here, I mean damn, everyone here is SO much more knowledgeable than anyone else in the free world its amazing. All you fuckers should collectively put your small brains together and solve world problems or something constructive.<br />
<br />
 I must clearly be out of sorts witha game I've played now for 4 years, gosh its a wonder I can even hit the login button according to you sheep fuckers.<br />
<br />
And besides that point, I have been gaming since most of you young punks were jacking off to underwear ads in the jc penny's catalog.<br />
<br />
If this board is at least a representation of 45% of the total SK population sererwide, its no friggin wonder we get no respect, we're all assholes bacause of this forum, so then i'd have to begrudgingly agree we're broken. I'll have to take a poll one of these days on my server and find members/ non SK.org members and see what the numbers are, was funny tho, last night I asked a few SK's higher than myself if they were or were not a member, out of 4 asked 3 were not, one used to be a long time back, those that werent had visited here and one of them amusingly enough told me that most folks on here should really come out of the closet and then they'd loose some angst.  I got a big kick out of that one.<br />
<br />
So yeah, I guess were all lumped into the asshole boat because of you leg humpers here, sad really.<br />
<br />
A huge bomb should be dropped on the server where this forum resides, that way a boil could be removed from the collective ass that is the internet.<br />
<br />
Enjoy your day.<br />
