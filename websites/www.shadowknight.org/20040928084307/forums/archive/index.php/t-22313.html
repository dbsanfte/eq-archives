On the Omens of War Website under feature of expansions.<br />
<br />
Extra spell slot - For the first time, characters can earn an additional spell slot allowing for even more versatility.<br />
<br />
Increased number of buff slots to Player Characters - Be battle ready with more room for buffs and effects as you take on the challenges that Omens of War has to offer.<br />
<br />
<br />
I thought I would share the light with you all.</div></div><hr />

you have an ass made of hair?<br />
<br />
The earning part worries me</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Keero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah I have to get up and comb it and stuff :( It  sucks :/ Personally I would rather just use gel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jorren Y`Kelt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">IIRC, they mentioned that things like an extra spell slot and extra buff slots could be earned via AA. /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Two very positive changes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Skoggel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I cringe at the thought of how many AA it'll take for an extra spell gem.<br />
<br />
Still a good idea, but I just know Sony's gonna gut us. :p Maybe I'm just still hating the intentionally inflated GoD AA pricing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Temet Nosce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">An upgrade to everyone but pure melees. I love it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thats because pure meles have unlimited spell slots :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vincente</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If by &quot;unlimited spell slots&quot; you mean &quot;no spell slots, but instead, unlimited /disc slots,&quot; then yes, I concur!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">discs are pretty much the same thing as spells anymore.  Hell you even get them by turning in the same runes in GoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Fyrechyld</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">can't cost more than 30aa, the bank doesn't hold more than that.<br />
<br />
or course, that may change with oow too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Rueeliar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It's gonna hurt when OoW comes out and they &quot;refund overpriced AA&quot; from GoD and all the peeps with 30 banked for the new stuff lose the extras.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">They damn well better refund overpriced aa's from GoD and elimiate the 30 banked aa's at the same time.  Get with it, SOE.<br />
<br />
-Bolas</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">they're refunding some GoD AA on the 11th... they might do some pricing changes then. anyway, whenever they refund AA people can have more than 30 when they log in until they zone or such... so they have to spend the extras immediately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Nycathis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Thats Ok,<br />
<br />
you will probably find that the extra spell gem can only store twice the AA spent as level allowed with a max of 60th level.<br />
<br />
Its the sort of nice fluffy and totally useless thing we can expect from Sony coding.<br />
<br />
(will probably apply to the extra buff slot as well....)<br />
<br />
ME? Sarcastic? Neverrrrrrrr.....</div></div><hr />
