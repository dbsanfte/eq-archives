<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kanekra Soulreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was wondering if a 65 sk (me) and a 65 druid could duo the commander? Druid has epic if that helps any.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kormus the Dark Angel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes, no problem at all. Get out Boner though so you don't fall asleep fighting.<br />
<br />
By the way: It's a Captain.<br />
<br />
Edit: Looking at your gear I have to say: Grab Focus and Kebab first or Druid might run oom (did I mention that Druid needs the 5k CH?).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">No offense, but your gear kind of leaves you short on hp.  Bring a shaman for disease slow and some more damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shielan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You already have 2 according to your magelo, and the druid cant use it, so why would you want to?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bruiser Bigins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">heh doesn't he have like 100k hp?  I remember I tanked him once back in the velious era and it was me with my ebon mace and a paladin for dps...man It took forever to kill that fucker...I had the feeling I was trying to chop down a tree with a rusty pocket knife.<br />
<br />
if you are 65 you can probably duo it...but sometime dr00ds die pulling so..that leaves you alone..more then likely thats not that good.</div></div><hr />
