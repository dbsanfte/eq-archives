I havent been to either zone since the revamp and couldnt find the mobs that drop these items anywhere.  <br />
<br />
Looking for an Earth Seer and a goblin death caster (if allakhazam is correct).  I know some of you 2-box here and have been since revamp...Maybe could direct me to where i may find these spawns or PH's in both zones.<br />
<br />
The items im after are<br />
A drogan Earth totem <br />
A totem of Death Casting<br />
<br />
for the attack +5 necklace and the soft leather bracer of gore<br />
<br />
appreciate any info ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Oagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Earthseer is a static spawn above the king's camp.  Actually, you can do the king's camp and still kill the seer/ph.  The drogan earth totems drop off of Earth Seers.  They are RARE.  After a shitload of hours (well over 100), I have looted one.  I have looted six depradator blades during that time (for aged earring of aptidude).<br />
<br />
Named Earth Seer is just inside a small alcove above the king's room.  Just inside that alcove is a safe camp spot that will not aggro the other mobs in the outside room, and the roamer that paths by.  In this spot you will encounter all the quest piece mobs (cave guardian, dust hoodlum, earth seer, bone depradators, ice masters).  Quest drops are just a matter of putting in the time, and killing the mobs.  <br />
<br />
The only decent thing is that these two camps drop viable bazaar loot (Bloodsworn blades and copper hammer of striking).  They also drop up to about 20pp, goblin skins, Mt. Death Salts, and gems up to diamonds.  They are all also 59-61lvl mobs, as well, and with the xp modifier in Droga, the xp isn't too shabby (below PoP, but still decent).<br />
<br />
The old BL site used to have a great map.  The LoY downloadable map has all the spawn points of the named listed, so follow that.<br />
<br />
Invis works all over Droga.<br />
<br />
Never go to Nurga much, because I can two box all the named in Droga quite easily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Nurga is easy.  For what you want I usually park on wall across fom the named Flame Chanter (listed on the map in the link).  expect one quest drop every 35-45 kills.  And you'll get one's you are not aiming for.   Be patient, sell other quest drops you see there and have fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nambkab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Droga drops are pretty ridiculously rare.  Might be easier to tag some of the named while you camp the drops and sell the stuff then buy the quest drops.  Your rogue can likely solo most of nurga, with a little down time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Droga drops are about the same 35-45 kills, but you need to know the right &quot;tier&quot; to hunt and also the right classes, sorry I don't know the area well enough to describe it.  Always camp by the named that is the same level and class as the mobs that will drop the quest drops you need.  Since the PH is always the same class as the named you'll be sure to have a steady supply of the right type of mob to drop the quest items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Oagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">35-45 is WAY low Keev.  I'd say maybe 100+.  I have never seen an Ice Fetish off the ice masters, or a cave lord sash of them, and I have killed hundreds.<br />
<br />
It's really just a crapshoot.  Depradator blades came streaky.  1, then 2 a couple weeks later, then none for a couple weeks then 2, then 1 about a week later.  However, in the main area where the mobs are all 59+, you get your shot at all of them, except the ph for the named.<br />
<br />
I thought since I got two off Maufin's area on the same camp that maybe that was a hint of how to get them.  But, that doesn't bear out on the King, or Ice Master Cialin, or Heaprit.  It's a frikken crapshoot, and a RARE one at that.  Plan on getting real familiar with Droga before you complete any of these quests.<br />
<br />
You would think that you could sell the stuff, and I do see the earth totems occasionally (for about 10-15k).  So, I try to sell 3 depredator blades and the Mark of Imprisonment, since I had an extra set.  No bites, no tells, nothing.  I was selling a decent AC/HP/Stat and FT earring for 45k, and no takers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nambkab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Friend of mine used to 2 and 3 box in droga for the named drops to sell (bloodsworn blade, kingly boots, etc) and made a couple hundred k off those and completed only 3 quest items off of the drops he got himself.  He bought the rest (he was helping others of us do the quests).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Is droga pretty decent XP for a 62 toon (my rogue)? if so i may two box her there and just xp with her and farm the drops if i can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">decent not great...pretty descent drops between bazaar loot off names, skin/salt to sell in bazaar and about 10-25pp per kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Nambkab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">AAxp is good there if you remember how old the zone is, but regular xp won't be anything very special...decent but not special.  I'm working on a shammy right now to box in there with Namb, just for the named drops in my spare time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ramgar SK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">We do guild groups there frequently and the exp isn't bad.  We've found the King camp is the best spot for exp.  Lots of level 60-61 mobs.  Good balance of exp and loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Seductre Digimortal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Currently my SK at 62 is getting pretty good exp compared to the difficulty of the mobs here. Doing king/Seer camp with sk, 65bst, 65shaman grouped and the exp for all of em is pretty ok. Its a hell of a lot less trouble then BoT and the mobs hit for less then the PoH tier 4 mobs.<br />
<br />
And yes the items are RARE. I completed 3 nurga quests and still have some items in bank and only 1 droga quest in the weeks (played time mind you) in droga. I sold 1 ice fetish and have no items in bank from droga.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Onoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">havent been there since the revamp and was looking around for some places to solo while i am lfg, bored, no one online, etc.....is it solo'ble by a 65 sk?( no two boxing or help of any kind)...my magelo is : http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=309232 <br />
<br />
The reason i ask is sometimes after raids and what not, I dont really feel like grouping and sometimes i hang out with some of my friends and I am getting tired of hunting in bot with them...was just looking for some out of the way places i can waste time.  Exp isnt really an issue</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Nambkab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">You should be able to solo pretty well, just don't get in a hurry with pulling multiples.  Get the AC up and you should be able to roll on through with no downtime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Onoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">forgot to note..ac and atk values are not correct...sitting around 1800ac unbuffed and 1635 atk unbuffed iirc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Nambkab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Solo away then  :D</div></div><hr />

Enter your skills and add your beginning points in the right areas to show the correct (or close to) #'s</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">i solo there, it can be tricky at times.... Ice masters can still nuke pretty hard for what its worth.  If i bring my rogue for a 2box if im not getting bad server lag its pretty easy tho, and any trouble i can usually toss enough dps (IHT / duelist / deadeye) to get out of it with minimal downtime</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Zakton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I am to the droga portion of the last khurkri before doing greenmist, are the jail areas soloable for the pieces?  I forgot this zone got revamped and I was a bit perturbed that everything was DB that had been green the last time I was there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Valkyria Grymreaper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">If you are talking about the penkeeper and penmaster for the keys, these were all moved to the cave south of Droga in FM. Argest is there too iirc.<br />
<br />
However, the combine machine is still in the jails in Droga, but nothing sees invis in there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Tukka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I've spent a lot of time Droga, and the drop rates for the rare items you need for the quests, as near as I can tell, is 1/40 to 1/60.  This comes from parsing over multiple hunts (comparing the number of kills of the appropriate tier mobs to the number of items looted).<br />
<br />
Here's my parsed breakdown:<br />
<br />
Blade of the Depredator: 1/29.75<br />
(119 killed, 4 looted)<br />
Sash of the Cave Lords: 1/74.5<br />
(149 killed, 2 looted)<br />
Hoodlum Symbol of Dust: 1/17<br />
(102 killed, 6 looted)<br />
Fetish of Ice Mastery: 1/53.5<br />
(107 killed, 2 looted)<br />
Drogan Earth Totem: 1/60<br />
(120 killed, 2 looted)<br />
Total Drops/Kill Ratio: 1/37.31<br />
(597 killed, 16 looted)<br />
<br />
I think the hoodlum symbol might be more common than the others, given that the drop rate I experienced for it was much better than the drop rate of the other quest items.  The hoodlum symbol is for the quest which results in an all/all ring, so it makes sense that it might be a more common drop, since there would conceivably be more demand for it.</div></div><hr />
