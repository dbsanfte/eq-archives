Merging Servers<br />
<br />
The most recent server merges are complete and both newly merged servers are showing a healthy population and, as with the combined Zek servers, exceeding their previous combined population totals.  As such, beginning April 11th and continuing until the completion of the process, we will continue merging all standard rule-set servers.  The servers will be merged in the following order, on the dates listed.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
4/7 Brell Serilis merges with Cazic Thule and will be listed as Cazic Thule<br />
<br />
4/11 Morden Rasp merges with Povar and will be listed as Povar.  <br />
<br />
4/11 Lanys T'Vyl merges with The Seventh Hammer and will be listed as The Seventh Hammer.<br />
<br />
4/14 Tarew Marr merges with Drinal and will be listed as Drinal.<br />
<br />
4/18 Mithaniel Marr merges with Saryrn and will be listed as Saryrn.<br />
<br />

<br />
We understand that server identity is important to our customers and we will be integrating server titles into the title system to allow you to display your server of origin, should you desire to do so.  The server title system will go live with our April 6th Update.<br />
<br />
Unutilized Character Purge<br />
<br />
Immediately preceding the merger, all characters below level 10 that have not been logged in for over six months will be deleted from each of the merging servers and will not be available after the server merge.  If you have a character on any of the servers being merged that is below level 10 and has not been logged in for more than six months, you will need to log that character in prior to the scheduled merge date for the relevant server.  <br />
<br />
Shared Banks on Merging Servers<br />
<br />
If you have characters on two servers which are being merged together, you will need to clean out the shared bank on one of those servers. After the merge, only one shared bank will be available on each merged server.<br />
<br />
Character Limitations<br />
<br />
If you have more than eight characters in total on the two servers being merged, only the first eight characters (in alphabetical order) will be displayed after the merge.  Characters other than the eight displayed characters will not be available for selection until currently displayed characters are deleted.  All characters from both servers will remain on your account provided that the character was above level 10 and had been logged into game within the last six months.<br />
<br />
Corpses<br />
<br />
Prior to the scheduled merge date for your server(s), please be sure that you clear any unclaimed character corpses from the world.  Character corpses will not be transferred to the newly-merged server.  Once the merger is complete, all corpses on the servers affected by a merge will have been purged.<br />
<br />
Duplicate Character Names<br />
<br />
It is possible that characters on servers affected by the merge will have duplicate names. In the event that characters on the new, combined server do share a name, the character with the most played time will be entitled to keep the name. All other characters will have the letter X appended to their name and will be eligible for a name change.  Characters can use the in-game /changename command to request a new name.  The new name is subject to the conditions set forth in our naming policy which can be found here: Naming Policy.<br />
<br />
LDoN Leader Boards<br />
<br />
After each merge is completed, as characters log into their newly-combined server, the leader board will be re-populated with standings. Although your points will be unaffected by the transfer, your standing may have changed based on the new, combined population totals.<br />
<br />
Complimentary Character Move<br />
<br />
Shortly after each merger is complete, we will allow all customers affected by a merge a one-time, complimentary character move to the server of their choice.  For each customer with an account on a newly-merged server who requests such a move, all characters associated with that customer’s account will be transferred to the selected server.  All characters will bring their items with them in the transfer. <br />
<br />
Please make sure you are aware of your servers expected merge date and prepare accordingly.  These dates are subject to change should we need to alter the timetable of merges.  Should we need to change the dates we will post the new list with plenty of advance notice.<br />

<br />
I'm not going to get sentimental about a name.<br />
<br />
However, play on Zeb has been great lately.  It's not super crowded, but it's not empty, either.  Immediately following EQ2's release, a lot of zones were ghost towns- but those days are long gone.  There's been some shakeups in the guild structure, but things have consolidated, guilds have recovered and licked their wounds, or died and people moved on.<br />
<br />
The thing is, if Xegony is indeed the higher population server as the resulting merged name suggests, this is going to end up being not a comfortable server, but a heavily overcrowded one.<br />
<br />
I don't think this change is about making a good playing environment, it's about saving $$$ on server hardware (they all of a sudden decide they need a ton more hardware for EQ2 servers or something?)</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is so much stupidity behind the contents of that list that I don't know where to start... let me point out some of the things that stand out.<br />
<br />
1.  Older servers should keep their names over the newer servers, that whole seniority thing with server names.  It's atleast somewhat symbolic, when you do away with the names of the older servers it in some ways is wiping out the older parts of EQ.  That in atleast my opinion is a bad thing.<br />
<br />
2.  There are currently 41 regular servers (non rp, pvp, etc), 20 of those have atleast 1 Anguish level guild.  In optimal circumstances each server would have a guild capable of being in the end zones of the game, essentially standing on its own allowing players to play in the level of content they want rather than some servers unable to do time and others sitting around because they clear OoW, GoD, and DoN quicker than respawns allow.  Doesn't it make far more sense to merge a non Anguish server with an Anguish server so players can choose where they wish to raid and have access to raid any area without changing servers (though every guild on every server obviosly cant raid everywhere, it's healthier for the game if every server has the capability).<br />
<br />
3.  This is only related to a couple servers but even ignoring the first two things I mentioned, the original 6 servers+Mith Marr really should keep their names.  The original 6 simply because in a sense thats EQ's roots and as I said before, destroying that is bad.  Mith Marr and Veeshan though are special in a way.  From Beta up through now Veeshan has been the server thats shown every other player in EQ progression, it's been the server to show players a dead Quarm, dead Mata, dead Rathe, dead Fennin, dead Vulak, destroyed Velious (hi Kerafym!), dead Phara Dar, the top of PoS, etc... usually before anyone else.  AL/FoH brought that to players for years and made their servers thought of by players for progression, they're still thought of as it even (espically Veeshan since it still leads the way with CD).  Removing that is just going to mess with players psychologically and probally make a few look at EQ in a more negative aspect than they currently do.<br />
<br />
4.  It's possible that these server lists were created with the intent of not artifically advancing servers, unfortunatley this logic falls apart past this.  When a player picks a server and wants to play its reasonable to expect to play in any area on that server with some work, this just won't happen with these server setups.  Players are going to transfer to where the big raid guilds are (I bet server transfer records support this already if you look), the current setup is just going to make servers like Seventh/Lanys get a surge for alittle while, then players who want to progress will simply transfer leaving seventh/lanys right back where they were and overcrowding the other servers.  Just like you want a good mix of classes on any server, you want a good mix of progression and levels... these transfer lists won't ensure that.<br />
<br />
Oh, for anyone that cares... heres the list of servers with Anguish level guilds from what I could find accurate as of 3/21.<br />
<br />
Antonius Bayle, Bristlebane, Cazic Thule, Druzzil Ro, Fennin Ro, Innoruuk, Luclin, Maelin Starpyre, Povar, Prexus, Quellious, Saryrn, Terris Thule, Rathe, Thoxule Paelis, Torvonilous, Tunare, Vazaelle, Veeshan, Zebuxoruk</div></div><hr />

Nomatter which name they go with people will be upset at losing a server name,  so unfortunatley they'll never make anyone happy with that.  It just seems to make more sense to me to keep the older servers names.</div></div><hr />

Fuck EQ2 for killing Stone (R.I.P.).<br />
<br />
There's a thread on the Zeb server board about the merger Jos.  From how I understand it, no guild on Xegony has progressed as far as DH and IL have.  Probably will have some competition for AoH and ML, then down the line.  There is some discussion about scheduled rotation vs FFA.  Currently it seems Xegony has a limited rotation and Zeb as you know, is almost all FFA.  Going to be interesting, but I guess it could be worse.  Not to cause an arguement, but Zebuxoruk is a lot cooler name than Xegony.  Wish we could keep it.  :( <br />
<br />
Dont' forget a &quot;Fuck WoW&quot; too.  EQ2's dagger was in our heart, WoW's was in our back.<br />

<br />
So if i understand well, if you are not pleased with your server move, you can move for free to the server of your choice after the merge of your original server. Correct ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
This rotation was actually put in place after years of training, hatred, and griefing that we all just grew .. quite sick of. honestly with the ego/drama fest on Xegony in the past (and the echo's of which still remain today to some.. more then most would like to admit to) I'm surprised it not only was agreed upon but has been upheld. I'm quite sure neither side is going to want to change how they do things.. its going to be.. so much fun.. to see how we end up working things out.<br />
<br />
edit: currently (as far as i can remember its 5am and I'm about to crawl into bed for 4 hours) only time, qvic, and txevu are rotated. Everything else is ffa.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its honestly crowded (300ish people in PoK at times during primetime if that says something) and some see that as a good thing and some do not. However, the Qvic + Guilds that were on SolRo are still going hard and I havent seen much of any drawbacks what so ever really about the &quot;Crowded high end game&quot; so to speak that alot of peeps were worried about.<br />
<br />
Its honestly all what you make of it. If you think of it as a negative thing, then chances are its gonna end up going that route for you. Sometimes, change is good. Ive not heard of anyone worth note from SolRo thats on BB atm thats even considering the /movelog.<br />
<br />
Stay where your friends are. EQ sucks if you cant play it w/ long time friends. Going to a server where you dont know anyone at this stage of the game would simply suck and get boring hella fast and make you have second thoughts. The /movelog option will not be used as much as some think simply due to that fact alone(Unless if an entire guild decided to do a mass /movelog, which I find unlikely but probable). I picture people quitting EQ all together before they /movelog.</div></div><hr />

<br />
potime was rotated, currently not really, because there's only 2 guilds there, we tend not to step on each other's toes.  Above that... well, DH would never agree to a rotation on anything, so good luck with that- but there's really no competition for them on Xego.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1.Communication issues on camp checks are still causing issues (naming conventions, size of camp)<br />
2.Guild leaders representing each of the old servers are complaining of the others.<br />
3.We had gotten spoiled with low populations and expanding the natural pulling radius of camps.  This has caused many of our 'social' issues to this point.<br />
4.We are currently, though slowly, building a regular guild leader channel that has dealt with the hard feelings between players.<br />
5.More than 100 Sol Ro folks did meet to discuss transfer enmasse considerations, the guild leader channel is helping, some.<br />
6.Some understaffed guilds that were getting by with make-shift solutions have to-date failed to fill their basic needs despite the increased population.<br />
<br />
Just my two cents.</div></div><hr />

If their backward enough to code the req level of each proc on each weapon separately (see a discussion where I was shocked in another thread), I'm doubting they've migrated to something as advanced and efficient as a blade farm.<br />

I'm guessing it's lazyness and unwillingness to see how much work flapping around lables in the naming convention would be.  I'm also very willing to believe tthat while the hardware got upgrades, their still the samve servers that originally existed, just with a few tweaks.<br />

Does that make it hard for large raiding guilds to get going with that much Public raiding? I'd think it would have some odd affects trying to merge that with Tunare that never had much for public raids outside of some initial Elem flagging that was happening for awhile before Oow came out.</div></div><hr />

While we’re on the subject of public raid…<br />
<br />
For CT peep, Brell brings with it a sporadic tradition of public raiding (Usually Elemental flags, but random old school raids like sky and what not) and Multi guild raids (not alliances, just we’re doing a raid, you’re one of our 3-5 friendly guilds if any of your peeps want to join we’d love it) sort of thing.<br />
<br />
Brell has enough former hard core now casual players that it’s not unusual  to see people who are now family guild tagged have elemental or time access.  (Several toons in the Get it Wrong Gang, for instance, are time + flagged – and we’ve never ever ever never done any PoP raiding)<br />
<br />
There will be a channel created every few months by one alliance or another that will have open raids, but you need to know the channel and have it on, it’s not ooc stuff.  <br />
<br />
Not sure if any of this is unusual, as I’ve never been on another server and I  haven’t done serious raids since before PoP came out.<br />
<br />
You’d have to check out the Brell boards for the progression of guilds, but expect to see a surprising number of solid solid players in more casual/light raiding guilds.  <br />
<br />
However, I've heard CT is a shithole, and the GiWG is discussing whether we want to use the transfer or not...</div></div><hr />

They'll be in anguish within a couple months most likely... they've got a few MPG raid trial wins already I think.  <br />

<br />
<br />
Tunare still have a massive guild alliance (Tunare Guild Alliance or some similarly obvious name) that kinda controls things there (I.E. no real defined guild structure across the levels of play there either)?

<br />
I've bitched about it several times in the past - a quick search should turn up something more detailed, but basically, we have almost no guild structure on E'ci.  We have one high-end guild that's far from anything impressive from an interserver standpoint, a PoTime Euro guild, and like 2 elemental guilds.  That's really about it.  Most guilds on E'ci are either extremely &quot;family&quot; oriented or are feeders for the public raids.  We have a lower-end group of public raiders too doing things like EP flagging (think they're recently into the EP's).  We have/had a high-end asian-schedule public raid group too, but I think they may have broken up - our asian population took a much bigger hit than I expected with the release of EQ2/WoW.  <br />
<br />
You can't effectively motivate a large group of people to work through the progression as a guild when they can just join a public raid and already be at the top of the server without having to worry so much about attendence or anything.  Sure, there are some people who are extremely loyal and would rather fight through the lower end of the progression with a guild than raid with the public, but there aren't really enough to make up much of a guild structure.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Its been both a blessing and a curse. <br />
<br />
I'm right with you on the curse bit, but how in the hell is it a blessing?</div></div><hr />

The premier guild on my server, Blades of Wrath (http://www.bladesofwrath.org/) , hasn't had any head to head competition for awhile either, that I heard about anyways.  It'll be fun to see, and maybe stories of the competition like the days of old might even draw back folks who've moved on.  Should definately be interesting to see how things go down.<br />
<br />
The guild my main's in, Darkstar Alliance (http://www.daguild.org/) , is doing ikkinz raids right now, Time every week, and OoW mobs that we can catch up and do.  We haven't started in RS or mpg trials beyond the single group level in most cases.  By the time the merger rolls around we should be in qvic or at the very least plugging away at Uqua.  <br />

However, it's a non-issue nowadays, as nearly everything we do is instanced.  The King and Queen in Rifts are pretty much the only exceptions, though we do them quite rarely nowadays.  I don't think we'd care too much if other guilds were constantly killing them.  We clear Tacvi every couple weeks, and if M'Shas are up, we might stop to wax 'em but the gear and augs from those are close to rotting for us anyway, so again, no big loss.<br />
<br />
In case anyone was wondering, no, we are not recruiting any more SKs.  However, if you know a well geared/AA'd cleric friend, feel free to send them our way :)<br />
<br />
As for my feelings on the server merger itself... meh.  I'm not really terribly attached to my server name.  I think some of the lower tiered guilds on both servers will benefit as the others with weak foundations dissolve.  Myself and my guild will remain largely unaffected.</div></div><hr />

no longer is a massive guild alliance.  one of the time/ikkinz level &quot;guilds&quot; is an alliance most call WAP (watchkeepers, aurora poralis, phoenix alliance).  it's essentially one guild with 3 different tags.  i'd be happy to talk to you SJ just toss me a tell, atm tunare has 1 anguish guild, my guild which is about to finish up with tacvi in the next month or so and has won 2 or 3 mpg trials, and 5 or 6 time/ikkinz type guilds.  tunare is pretty empty really, so it's going to suck having to compete for those qvic minis and old content for plat and junk &gt;&lt;.  seriously though, anyone in potime is going to be utterly, utterly fucked on this merger if they can't 1 night already.  and do i want to even know how you zerg RS royals?  &gt;&lt;<br />

I miss having scores of people to play with and talk to. 43 people in PoK sucks. As Ning pointed out, everything that the high end raider does now is instanced anyway, so this is hardly an affront to that demographic. To people who don't raid: This will bring more people looking for groups, which means more things to do, a larger bazaar population, which means more crap to buy or sell, and overall, probably more fun in general.<br />
<br />
I'll end all my run-on sentences and, I welcome the people from Tarew Marr who'll be coming to Drinal. I hope you don't quit because the name of your server changes. The name of my bank changed once... I didn't see cause to start banking elsewhere because of it.<br />
<br />
Edit - Afterthought. Regarding the server transfer: I guess I actually am looking for at least one more exceptional SK. If you can't take your server name being changed and gotta go elsewhere, or for whatever reason, shoot a ;tell to Mordosskul. My server is tapped for talent, and the good ones won't leave their current guilds for any reason.</div></div><hr />

Infinit and the zerg public (aka Eci public) is still around although not sure what their level of strength is anymore since a considerable chunk of them just this week left and formed the omg-we-2-ubah-4-joo guild of the week.  I think they are called Dai Shin or something like that....  <br />
<br />
Arete is probably the next strongest, but I've heard they are having some issues....don't have details.<br />
<br />
Morality/Awakened Fires seem to be the two factions of the ex-uber guild Recon and both are rebuilding...with what success?  unknown.<br />
<br />
FoB (Fellowship of Brothers) seems to have gotten a bit stronger since I retired from EQ a few months ago.  Not sure how they managed that...but whatever.<br />
<br />
Grey Horizon is fully elemental with FR and Xeog under their belts and very soon Corinav.  Strong guild with great guild leader.  Imo a great place for someone that wants to earn their keep and advance.  I admit the guild leader is a long time EQ friend of mine,  Sarkus.  (but he responds to  &quot;hey troll&quot;).<br />
<br />
and then there is my guild...lol which consists of just me.  (litterally)...I moved my guild to WoW, and play EQ a few hours a day with the rest of the time on WoW.<br />
<br />
ECI has lots of tards...but lots of good people too.  I hope the merger with Tunare will work out.  (slein is a tard! lol...j/k)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just for history's sake... :) TGA was never very far advanced. They had lots of guilds but were always at least 2 expansions behind. I used to do stuff with them with an Alt.<br />
<br />
Tunare has always had some very powerful guilds. Talisman being at the top for probably 5 expansions now.  <br />
<br />
Tunare is a very good server, at least in my experience. Lots of very good people, with very few rotten apples.<br />
<br />
It does surprise me that its being merged. The only place that is really hurting right now is the pre - raiding numbers. And even that is not terrible. Most nights you'll find at least 6 xp groups between RS and MPG. Wow/EQ2 really seemed to only really hurt the smaller guilds on Tunare. Although from my perspective, it may have hurt the larger guilds also, and they just sucked in the remaining people from the smaller guilds.</div></div><hr />

From what I see in the early morning hours they are farming Qvic for muramite armor and starting to explore Txcevu. <br />
<br />
I knew GoD was still around, but I wasn't sure how much the Asian public still did.  <br />
<br />
The only European guild is Anthem led by Sacilia. They are currently working towards Quarm in PoTime. <br />
<br />
They've had quarm dead for a while now.  They've done little in OoW more for lack of effort than anything.  GoD I believe they're in Uqua, but don't quote me on that.  <br />
<br />
Infinit and the zerg public (aka Eci public) is still around although not sure what their level of strength is anymore <br />
<br />
They were doing MPG trials like... a week ago or something (I got a tell from Ashorty asking me to come heh) so I imagine they're still doing pretty decent. <br />
<br />
a considerable chunk of them just this week left and formed the omg-we-2-ubah-4-joo guild of the week. I think they are called Dai Shin or something like that.... <br />
<br />
That's the thing about public though - if a bunch of people leave, they don't really get hurt much by it because they've always got a queue of people ready to take their place.  They're almost always forced to limit numbers by raid limit anyway.  At worst, they have to re-gear or re-flag a few people who had been forced to the fringe by lack of flags or whatever.  <br />
<br />
As for the &quot;flavor of the week guild&quot; - I'm not sure how it is on other servers, but we have one every few months who starts farming BoT towers and making decent progress toward the EP's and then dies within a few more months.  It's been like that for years (granted, with different content if you go back a ways).  It's usually some public raiders who got geared up from Ashorty raids and think they're the shit, then find out the hard way that that shiny new gear means dick all if you're a moron.  <br />
<br />
Arete is probably the next strongest, but I've heard they are having some issues....don't have details. <br />
<br />
They seem kinda stagnant at the moment, but they're still the top American guild.  <br />
<br />
Morality/Awakened Fires seem to be the two factions of the ex-uber guild Recon and both are rebuilding...with what success? unknown. <br />
<br />
They've been &quot;rebuilding&quot; for months.  Morality is the basis for the lower-end american public similar to how Infinit is for the higher end, though not quite as directly.  Awakened fires seems like it's doomed to stagnation - they've tried to recruit me twice, so I've looked into their progress a couple times and basically, I havn't seen much of any.  <br />
<br />
FoB (Fellowship of Brothers) seems to have gotten a bit stronger since I retired from EQ a few months ago. Not sure how they managed that...but whatever. <br />
<br />
From what I can tell, their raid times allow people to still raid with the public, and their recruitment process is... pretty unselective.  They've got a few very good players including a couple friends of mine, but I've always had problems with some among their ranks too.  They're pretty far along in the EP's I believe, but I'll differ further comment to Zaim...<br />

<br />
I'm right with you on the curse bit, but how in the hell is it a blessing?<br />
<br />
Let me rephrase that. That statement wasn’t entirely correct. I did 3/4 of the time flag in two-three weeks with a mix of public and guild raiding. Albeit mostly with public though. <br />
<br />
That statement alone gives insight to what is good and bad. Its good cause you can pursue flagging at no expense to your guild but then again when the public raiding system is doing better than your guild atm it pulls at peeps loyalty. So is there really no expense to your guild. You could argue both ways. <br />
<br />
The other underlying issue with public raiding on Eci is that some of the leaders of the public raiding system try to pull key personnel from raiding guilds to join there public raiding system. I guess poaching has always existed to some extent.<br />
<br />
It seems like a vicious cycle. If there was no public raiding, I think Eci would be a force to contend with. There is so much experience and lot of leadership abound. Problem is its split in 100 different directions. No singular focus. <br />
<br />
I see what Slein says and I agree with him 90%. The 10% that doesn’t agree is based on my personal view that I know if I am in a guild I am 100% dedicated to their cause until the thing falls apart. Every guild I have ever been in for the last 6 years I have been a member till the thing fell apart (or I was taking a long break due to military deployments). However, I’m looking at myself and not the health of the server. Loyalty is never a question for me.<br />
<br />
FoB does a little of both but leans towards a dedicated raiding guild. I will say though that even the guild leadership participates in high end public raiding. I think that FoB and GH are around the same raiding capability and progression wise. FoB has Xeogny and Fennin done and both guilds have been trying to tackle the Corinav event. I expect both guilds to hit Time in full force around the same time. There are good peeps in GH as well but there seems to be a passive aggressive attitude towards each other with some members. *shrug* does not bother me I think there are some good peeps in GH as well as FoB. To be honest I woulnd't be surprised if the guilds ended up merging due to announced guild merge.<br />
<br />
Back to the point: bottom line is Eci is all over the map.</div></div><hr />

I miss having scores of people to play with and talk to. 43 people in PoK sucks. As Ning pointed out, everything that the high end raider does now is instanced anyway, so this is hardly an affront to that demographic. To people who don't raid: This will bring more people looking for groups, which means more things to do, a larger bazaar population, which means more crap to buy or sell, and overall, probably more fun in general.<br />
<br />
I'll end all my run-on sentences and, I welcome the people from Tarew Marr who'll be coming to Drinal. I hope you don't quit because the name of your server changes. The name of my bank changed once... I didn't see cause to start banking elsewhere because of it.<br />
<br />
Edit - Afterthought. Regarding the server transfer: I guess I actually am looking for at least one more exceptional SK. If you can't take your server name being changed and gotta go elsewhere, or for whatever reason, shoot a ;tell to Mordosskul. My server is tapped for talent, and the good ones won't leave their current guilds for any reason.<br />
<br />
Yeah it should be interesting, if just for the fact, alot of us old school SK's have chatted with one another, will be fun to bring in &quot;new&quot; faces, who aren't new to the class, or have just been around a year or two, but for around five or six.  Hell, we lost Brael with the server transfer alot of ED folks did, so we have froom now! <br />
<br />
Like it was said, with the server merges, its' really not going to effect the high end guilds of a server, it's the ones who are in PoP tht will really be hurtnig, and those who just stared to farm Qvic.  All the MPG trails and Angiush are instanced so it's not like we are going o need to &quot;race&quot; for anything.  The one thing I hate about this is the looseing the server name... :(  Well that and having the server firsts come to us as easy as it has...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mulletess</div><div class="date">04-01-2005, 10:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I went through a server merger already on sol ro BB.  It went pretty smoothly.<br />
Everyone was friendly.  Found it easy to get groups.  Prices were kindof screwed up for the first day.  If you want to make some coin I suggest looking for larger price differences on certain items on a server.<br />
<br />
For instance  runes on BB were on the area of 5k less then they were on sol ro.<br />
Items on the other hand tended to be more expensive.<br />
<br />
Bristlebane being much more populated then sol ro I came up with a theory on the pricing.  Items tended to be more expensive because they tend to drop at certain popular camps.  Like say fiercly hooked claw drops at Nwall camp (cubbies).  It was camped mostly 24/7 on both servers.  Now on the higher pop server there was the same demand but less supply thus increasing the price.  But items like runes that drop all over the place there is a much greater supply on a greater population server since you can get a rune camp just about anywhere.<br />
<br />
Note on server transfer.  It took soe about 6 days to get the movelog feature activated.  Once they did It took them less then 24 hours to move me to tunare.  I moved to tunare since no late night pst guild existed on either BB or sol ro.  So the free transfer was great feature.  <br />
<br />
One thing when the server merges took place you have to get use to what certain camps are called since it may be different.  Loot in groups were also done quite differently.  BB seem more nbg then sol ro.  On BB when a random did occur it was always random 0 100.  ON sol rol you random variuos things like /random 5 555 or random 3 333.  What ever the group leader felt like at the time.  So make sure when taking a pick up group that everyone understands what ever loot rules are.<br />

<br />
With the mass exodus, CT lost it's 2nd and 4th tier guilds. The third tier guilds have shaped up well and are now moving in right behind us on progression. We also suffred a considerabe loss that put us back a couple months atleast in progression which seems to put us just about even with the top guilds on Brell from what I can tell. In the past there has been no public raiding to speak of, there simply wasn't a need for it as most of the upper guilds made flag sharing agreements and mob rotations. There is a Time rotation in place but in GoD and OOW Relentless consides everything FFA and will not join any new rotations as far as I know.</div></div><hr />

This is only related to a couple servers but even ignoring the first two things I mentioned, the original 6 servers+Mith Marr really should keep their names.  The original 6 simply because in a sense thats EQ's roots and as I said before, destroying that is bad.  Mith Marr and Veeshan though are special in a way.  From Beta up through now Veeshan has been the server thats shown every other player in EQ progression, it's been the server to show players a dead Quarm, dead Mata, dead Rathe, dead Fennin, dead Vulak, destroyed Velious (hi Kerafym!), dead Phara Dar, the top of PoS, etc... usually before anyone else.  AL/FoH brought that to players for years and made their servers thought of by players for progression, they're still thought of as it even (espically Veeshan since it still leads the way with CD).  Removing that is just going to mess with players psychologically and probally make a few look at EQ in a more negative aspect than they currently do.<br />
<br />
My theory is, that given that since both Afterlife and FoH left EQ for WoW that they're actively trying to remove their memory. I attribute this to active spite rather than to chance.<br />

No one cares what the names of guilds who are where here.

In a thread where others including the moderator himself is comparing/contrasting guilds from our server (including my own guild) to reply in a single post a clarifying summary of my guilds status in the areas *already discussed by others* (or am I mistaken and were the topics of guild progress, leadership, and longevity not raised???) hardly qualifies as an 'unsolicited essay'. I suppose if I spent time actively bashing the public raiding forces it may have fit into the 'solicted essay' category.<br />
<br />
When the replies veered from general merge issues and cold-hard progress listings to subjective opions and internal server relations/speculations you should have prepared that someone out there on E'ci may actually be a happy dedicated raider in an independent guild despite the public raiding systems impact on the server. So yes, I spend my time honored to be in a guild that is stable and that for 5 years has continually progressed, woe is me. <br />
<br />
There's a difference between discussing the guilds of a server and writing a lengthy post specifically to glorify one's own guild.</div></div><hr />

HAHAHAHA, I did the smart thing. Went to WoW. BOOYA.<br />
<br />
Seriously though, I still have a ton of friends on Tunare, and hope you all do well. I was almost thinking about coming back, but between the server merger and no longer having a guild, its just not worth it.</div></div><hr />
