no, eqw isn't that difficult to operate, but regardless i know that my shm doesn't do much healing on me because he's a lazy bastard and i don't usually need it, or at the very least if i need the shm to be healing me i'm likely going to be dead anyways so it's still a moot point<br />

because just over a year ago, i got a job that is 4pm to midnight... which effectively cock blocked me out of my eplanes guild for raiding since i could never be on when they were raiding. <br />
since then, i've been reduced to late night groups (if i'm lucky) and just doing things with my one group of friends when they all decide to stay up late enough to do something with me, and i had the bracers from when ldon had first come out and i was grinding a bit more then i do now, before everyone i group with got totally burned out on ldon and there was GoD stuff to do.<br />
as for the helm and bp, i'm working on it... ldon points don't fall out of the sky, especially when the only time you can consistantly play is late at night<br />
<br />
just admit, that shaman is turbo patching you<br />
shrug. they're not. though it makes no real difference to me either way whether or not you believe me</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>tearsin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Still doesn't explain why you'd buy 2 bracers before a BP or helm lol.<br />
you should have seen the bracers i had before i got those =P<br />
i had a friggin tier'dal reagent and an etched zraxthil.<br />
tie'dal is 25ac 30hp, 5vs all.<br />
that was replaced with 28ac, 110hp (seems a pretty good boost to me)<br />
the etched zraxthil was 19ac, 60hp, which i haven't finished yet because like a week after i got it, my friends and i discovered we could handle tipt and i went 'ah fuck, now i can get a tipt bracer... okay, that sucked'<br />
<br />
also, my current guild is farming vt and seru, and i'm up for my choice of bp's when they drop.<br />
the helm thing... shrug... i figured the bracer was a better overall benefit, for the time being, as the ac/hp increase was about equal in relation to other pieces, and i'd get to keep the ft2 for the duration of my ldon farming</div></div><hr />

Not to mention that you can buy a M-TBB for almost the exact same stats as a LDoN bracer (albeit less aug slots).<br />
well i suppose that depends on your perspective.<br />
keeping in mind that, at the time when ldon came out and i got this stuff, GoD wasn't out yet... group wise i was just doing mid-upper end PoP stuff and raiding, and AC wasn't that big of a deal in relation to my need for hp and resists.<br />
the choices i made for my ldon armor were, at the time i made them (and still to this day, minus that damned other bracer i bought) the easiest and greatest hp boosts i could get.<br />
now, whether ac or hp is more important is somewhat arguable (if you have to choose just between one or the other) and i went for the maximum hp i could get for the least trouble possible.<br />
was it a mistake? maybe. my understanding of stats and the importance of certain things over other things might be skewed or mistaken... but, going off the criteria i had (which was to maximize hp and resists) i made the best choices possible at the time, for the content i was working with<br />
<br />
*edit to add*<br />
the mana threaded vs ldon bracer.... the big catch is the availability of a 40hp aug for the ldon bracer, which the mana threaded doesn't have. and yes, the extra slots helped</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">*Commends himself on a skillful hijack.  Struzor should be proud.*<br />
<br />
1) AC was already king again in PoP.<br />
<br />
2) Yes you can aug a tak bracer better than a M-TBB, but you can aug something else with the points first and upgrade the M-TBB to a tak bracer after you run out of other upgrades.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>tearsin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">*Commends himself on a skillful hijack.  Struzor should be proud.*<br />
at least it's a somewhat constructive hijack, if nothing else<br />
<br />
1) AC was already king again in PoP.<br />
that again is a perception issue. i've simply never been of the 'ac is king' crowd. i spent 5 years doing MUD coding, and the original designers of EQ were old MUD junkies... i understand how THACO works in a coded system, and while obviously EQ is far more complicated and iterated then a simple DiKu mud code, there are inherent standards in THACO and how it works, points of dimishing return, etc etc.<br />
of course, without argument, 'the more the better' is a golden rule. but there comes a point at which bulking up ac won't do *as much* in relation to bulking up something else.<br />
case in point: i had a cultural bracer and a BP of eradication.<br />
ldon bracer nets me about 5ish ac and 90hp for around 2600ish points<br />
ldon bp nets me about 30ish ac and 40hp, and i lose 3vs a couple saves and 15vs a couple others, for the *same* amount of points<br />
<br />
at the point where my ac was, i considered that 40hp to be more important. is 40hp better then 30ac in a direct toss up? well that really depends... however, with the specific factors of where i was content wise at the time, i figured the 40hp was going to do more for me<br />
<br />
2) Yes you can aug a tak bracer better than a M-TBB, but you can aug something else with the points first and upgrade the M-TBB to a tak bracer after you run out of other upgrades.<br />
the exact same logic could be applied to the bp to work for my position, with almost the exact same results. it just comes down to whether you find ac or hp to be the more important thing to go for in what order.<br />
on a long enough timeline, it can be assumed i would have every ldon piece i wanted with all the augs i wanted. the question then is simply what to get first... what will help me the most to get from one to the next? will 30ac help me get 40hp more then 40hp will help me get 30ac? <br />
i might have answered that question wrong, depending on which you think gives the greater benefit, but i think in the end it's all about equal either way<br />
<br />
and it's not like i'm 'done' with my equipment. it's one of the advantages i have as far as game-play goes. while you, for example, have fewers and fewer directions to go with gear because of what you have, i have a WIDE range of options available to me, from a variety of zones, that will be upgrades. while you may certainly being enjoying (or not enjoying, depending on your opinion of the game) content that i am not currently capable of doing, i am still able to derive great amusement from my progress through the game (which, in the end, isn't that really the whole point?)<br />
<br />
getting back on topic though... even with my gear, tipt and vxed can be done. maybe i'm just insanely lucky. but i simply can't just sit back and nod my head and go 'yep, them SOE fuckers, this content is totally impossible for knights' when i know from personal experience that's not entirely accurate</div></div><hr />

It's a game of numbers. And these numbers arent adding up in your favor, yet you somehow manage to tank these where others with an undeniably giant statistical advantage cannot...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Manlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I've successfully farmed Tipt named and even completed with the following group setup...<br />

<br />
I dont know how much the paladin was healing himself during that, but the named fights really didn't seem all that difficult.  I even tanked it a bit before it got slowed presnaring it a few times so the BST didn't get owned.  Pal is all Time geared, and I'm only partial (6500 hp/1750 ac unbuffed).  Your healers just have to know how to heal for the encounters...  (Cheal is not a good idea).<br />
<br />
I just start the fight with a heal over time on inc then cast holy light at 70-80% and have no issues keeping me or the pal up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not really - AC was parsed to have almost linear returns in excess of 2k during PoP.  <br />
<br />
of course, without argument, 'the more the better' is a golden rule. but there comes a point at which bulking up ac won't do *as much* in relation to bulking up something else. <br />
<br />
The amount of AC gained from the BP/helm + the other stuff &gt; the other stuff gained from the bracers + the AC.<br />
<br />

ldon bp nets me about 30ish ac and 40hp, and i lose 3vs a couple saves and 15vs a couple others, for the *same* amount of points <br />
<br />
Your magelo has you with a vindi BP.  That's another 10ac difference.  <br />
<br />
LDoN bracer is a 3AC upgrade to DE cultural and 40HP upgrade before the augment (you could have augmented another piece with the same points equally easily).  <br />
<br />
LDoN BP is 14ac ahead of erad, 24 ahead of vindi.  HP is equal.  <br />
<br />
Regardless of whether you use the real numbers or the numbers from your post, you get a more meaningful upgrade from the BP/helm upgrades than from the bracers.<br />
<br />
at the point where my ac was, i considered that 40hp to be more important. is 40hp better then 30ac in a direct toss up? well that really depends... however, with the specific factors of where i was content wise at the time, i figured the 40hp was going to do more for me <br />
<br />
Unless you NEVER tanked/pulled and only needed HP for AE's and shit, you figured wrong.  <br />
<br />
the exact same logic could be applied to the bp to work for my position, with almost the exact same results. it just comes down to whether you find ac or hp to be the more important thing to go for in what order. <br />
<br />
Not really - it's a matter of getting the best upgrade for the points spent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Must get more AC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>tearsin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Not really - AC was parsed to have almost linear returns in excess of 2k during PoP.<br />
well then i missed that boat<br />
<br />
The amount of AC gained from the BP/helm + the other stuff &gt; the other stuff gained from the bracers + the AC.<br />
i looked at it purely in terms of hp and resists, so unless that's what you meant by 'other stuff' it never factored into my view of it<br />
<br />
Your magelo has you with a vindi BP.  That's another 10ac difference.<br />
brain fart. my magelo is accurate. it was a freudian typo  <br />
<br />
LDoN bracer is a 3AC upgrade to DE cultural and 40HP upgrade before the augment (you could have augmented another piece with the same points equally easily).<br />
well, 3 raw ac... i was factoring in actual ac though, which is a bit more.<br />
as for augmenting something else... yes, i could have. but that's not the point<br />
<br />
LDoN BP is 14ac ahead of erad, 24 ahead of vindi.  HP is equal.  <br />
Regardless of whether you use the real numbers or the numbers from your post, you get a more meaningful upgrade from the BP/helm upgrades than from the bracers.<br />
again, 'meaningful' is a matter of perception. and you have to keep in mind what i had before i got the bracers. my options were this, using a comparison of equal number of ldon points:<br />
45ac, 100hp, 15vs all -&gt; 69ac, 140hp, 12vs three resist types. gain: 24ac, 40hp<br />
25ac, 30hp, 5vs all -&gt; 28ac, 110hp, 3vs all. gain: 3ac, 80hp<br />
<br />
so, it's your position that a gain of 24ac would be preferable to a gain of 40hp, not even counting the resist difference and atk/regen loss. i respect that view, though i also disagree with it<br />
<br />
Unless you NEVER tanked/pulled and only needed HP for AE's and shit, you figured wrong.<br />
i tank/pulled all the time. maybe i was wrong, i'm willing to concede that<br />
 <br />
Not really - it's a matter of getting the best upgrade for the points spent.<br />
which is what i was trying to do, and i did... based on my personal criteria for 'best'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>tearsin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Must get more AC.<br />
yes, indeed i must... my equipment goals were truncated when my job stopped me from being able to raid. i'd have very, VERY different gear right now if not for that unfortunate scheduling conflict</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Well, TBH, the augs were a poor use of points either way unless you were expecting upgrades from a raid in the OTHER slots and not the slots you augged... that'd have been totally illogical though, as the bracers are alot easier to upgrade for someone progressing in PoP than the BP.

<br />
You might be the first SK since newtank to think 40HP &gt; 24ac.  Even people who skew the &quot;conversion rate&quot; in favor HP tend to put it at roughly 10hp=1ac.  Generally accepted is somewhere between 5-10hp-1ac.  Your above stated opinion is 1.66hp=1ac.</div></div><hr />

Somethings wierd with Tipt/Vxed mobs, i'm pretty sure something weird went through with last patch (unintended), it will prob be fixxed or looked into, i personally didnt have many problems doing a tipt but I both have a shitload of AC, and have stuns.<br />

when ldon first came out, i didn't have this job yet. my guild was just trailing off with VT raiding, had gained guild-side EP access, and was starting to work in that direction. as you can see from my magelo, i have the poair belt. that was one of our first raid drops. about a week after i got that, my new shift started... and totally fucked over all the plans i had up to that point.<br />
<br />
<br />
that, of course, assumes i think that as a blanket statement. which i don't.<br />
at the time of my decisions towards what armor/augs to get, i considered the 40hp to be a better upgrade then to add 24 more ac to what i thought (obviously incorrect) to be suffecient ac *at the time i got it*<br />
also when i got the bracers, my guild was still doing vt and i still had a reasonable shot at an aten bp.... in fact, i believe it was the raid in which one dropped and went to a twink, because i was at work and couldn't loot it, which led me to disband from that guild because between that and the elemental molds dropping, and me never being able to raid, i realized i was fucked<br />
<br />
incidently, i appreciate that you can't disagree with someone without resorting to the kind of intellectual 'shit filled bag on fire' of comparing me to newtank. i've been trolling here for quite some time, i know what calling me that would mean to you<br />
<br />
[quote]Even people who skew the &quot;conversion rate&quot; in favor HP tend to put it at roughly 10hp=1ac.  Generally accepted is somewhere between 5-10hp-1ac.  Your above stated opinion is 1.66hp=1ac.<br />
i hardly think that a simple gear/aug choice presents suffecient reason to presume what my personal conversion rate for ac/hp is. especially considering that i've said, multiple times in fact, that i was going with what i knew of things at the time and was totally willing to concede i was wrong.<br />
i will admit that my perception was that 1.66hp = 1ac at the time. and i will even admit i'm wrong, if ever given cause to do so besides 'slein said i was wrong, so i guess i am'</div></div><hr />

incidently, i appreciate that you can't disagree with someone without resorting to the kind of intellectual 'shit filled bag on fire' of comparing me to newtank. <br />

I compared you to newtank because I honestly can't think of another poster here who undervalued AC as much as he did.  To be fair, though, he overvalued regen more than he overvalued HP.  <br />

Not likely, because it means about jack and shit to me.  I did so without any more thought than any of the other phrases in my many posts (less thought than many - it didn't require any math or logic or anything...).

to be precise, i was defending that at the time, i did what i thought at the time to be correct. i am not admitting that what i thought at the time was potentially incorrect. i am now, however, necessarily defending hp &gt; ac, even though i may have thought so at one time, in one context, in a particular set of circumstances<br />

i don't take anything personally. i'm wholly indifferent to whether you're an asshole or a saint, as long as your facts are accurate. i merely found it interesting that you threw out newtank, and i further find it interesting that, despite your claim to be totally uncaring and unaware of it, you still cared enough to use the name newtank, instead of 'you obviously undervalue ac'<br />

far be it from me to doubt the wisdom of those with a lot of hp...<br />
but, if slein is so correct, and my decisions in gear and augs are so reprehensible, then why is it the OP, who has obviously far superior gear and stats to me, having such monumental trouble where i am not?<br />
<br />
one would think that if slein was so obviously and gloriously correct (which i'm not saying he's NOT, though i admit i must question that he IS) then one would think i would have a much harder time then i do with tipt and vxed.<br />
<br />
i know i am not remarkable in my gear. it's obvious to anyone who takes 5 seconds to look at it. <br />
the facts of the situation though are this...<br />
assumed premise: ac is king, knights suck at tanking, hp is secondary<br />
actual event: sk with far less ac/hp then OP succeeds without consistant trouble whereas OP fails enough to write this rather pissed off post<br />
<br />
it would seem there is some kind of logical inconsistancy here. something is not adding up somewhere.<br />
now, whether or not my gear/aug choices are idiotic or not (and i'll just hand the dick stick off to slein on this one: your gear and stats humble me, you have unbuffed about 40hp less then i do raid buffed, i should be so lucky to polish your boots, etc etc et al) the fact still remains that, despite the claims of the 'in the know' sks, lil' old bad-gear-choices me is still doing what they claim can't be done, or at the very least can't be done consistantly.<br />
<br />
when presented with two equal but contradictory pieces of evidence, one must check their premise. one of them is wrong. i can tank tipt/vxed, even with my shit gear, and i can do it *consistantly*<br />
why is that?</div></div><hr />

I have about 500hps less than you and I break 1500 AC unbuffed (which you do not). I'll assume you go with 1hander and sheild for tanking in which case you might come in under me still... and I can tank Tipt/Vxed ONLY when there is a charmed pet in the equation. In Vxed just a cleric was sufficient. In Tipt I had a cleric and two druids, one of the druids going LD halfway through. Except for me, the rest of the group was Time geared. Even with a pet in the equation I still run into mobs where the RNG screws me and I get splatted (gd noc spraybloods always). <br />

It depends on the DI and ATK of the mob you are tanking. <br />

In tipt (which I have only done pre nerf, and then as an enc) I saw SKs getting 1 rounded on trash and wars getting 1 rounded on nameds until we wised up and used pet tanking and weap shield tactics.  This stuff hit damn hard irrespective of your ac at that point.  <br />

vitriol aside, i'm not saying my procs, innate or otherwise, are the reason i'm living. nor are my skill mods. i merely suggested that perhaps it plays a part in it.<br />
i can't honestly say why it is that these people claim tipt and vxed is so god awful hard when i'm doing it with comparative ease (comparative to my gear, that is) but, regardless, it is happening. which says basiclly one of 4 things:<br />
1. i'm totally lying out my ass, which i can't prove other then to give me word, unless someone wants to step up and take me on that offer to come with us<br />

<br />
Exactly...A monk /disc or letting a Mage pet enrage on an early named like that crag would be viable workarounds maybe. But not a SK tank that is ~6k unbuffed. Tanking all the trash in the trial is one thing, but over the course of repeated attempts, the math will not be 'lucky'. Low-ish HP/AC vs. High DPS mobs simply cannot stay lucky over time. A group with pet or melee /discs at their disposal would be daft to have a pre-time SK just straight tank.</div></div><hr />

Yes, it is completely gimping the trial by using *2* ripposte/parry/dodge disc's, and a hasted charm pet. No I don't like the fact that a ranger in less than bazaar gear can &quot;tank&quot; this better than me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Daerkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">Since the most recent change to Tipt/Vxed I can say i have noticed a huge difference in the trash mobs. They seem to be hitting for much closer to their max damage now, and getting strings of hits that I previously would rarely if ever see. I farm the named mobs in Vxed quite a bit for various toons/alts as tey are fast to spawn and kill. The named mobs themselves seem about the same (at least no noticeable change to me), but the trash mobs are closer to wiping us than the ever used to be, you really have to pay attention now and start heals earlier. On named (cept for the caster ones which are gimp) it is always a case of quickfire healing - DI up, Holy Light, Divine Arbitration, while maxing total dps (IHT, chain SoS). <br />
<br />
Usual group is Sk (me), Wiz, Bard, Cleric, Pal, and either Druid or another cleric depending. Apart from Paladin all have some Time loot but not 'Time Geared' by any means.<br />

I haven't done Tipt boss (Maternal cragbeast seems unchanged) in the last week, so can't comment on him, but getting there seems likely to be rather more hazardous than it used to be.<br />

I used to do these trials with enchanter and really there is no comparison no matter how you dice it. Tipt with enc is one hour-ish, without is more than twice as long.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Ashrai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">Maicom, the people calling his bluff are those who do not believe he can tank Tipt/Vxed with his gear without a charmed pet in the equation. As you saw in my response, I'm lower than he is in HPs with higher AC and the ONLY way I personally can do it is with a charmed pet - hence everyone finding his claims difficult to believe. Like me, you have had to &quot;find ways around&quot; the situation in order to succeed at the Trials. Tearsin is claiming he straight tanks Tipt and Vxed without a charmed pet and much more minimal healing than one would think.<br />
<br />
This has already been alluded to but I'm going to ask a few questions straight up Tearsin:<br />
<br />
When you say &quot;tanked the trials&quot; do you mean from zone in to final mob, all the way through, (we'll exclude the named here and just talk about trash mobs) and there is NO charmed pet of any type in the equation at any time and the shaman is not spamming the living daylights out of you? The only way I can see this possibly happening is if you are in a group with insane enough DPS to down the mob before you run your healers OOM. And you are stopping for constant med breaks, therein taking 6 hours to finish the trials. <br />
<br />
The phrase &quot;we die a lot&quot; strikes me as odd considering the most hazardous thing you can have in the mix in Tipt or Vxed is a charmed pet. So, your group does not have it. Which means either you got adds and people died (which means someone's having a bit of difficulty pulling) or the mob killed people. How does the mob kill people if you are tanking? Most likely because you are now a stain on the ground and it's running amok.<br />
<br />
Maybe these questions are a bit too much like an inquisition, and don't get me wrong - if you are able to do this while the best of the best cannot then by all means I don't expect you to share your secret. But I find it hard to believe you are &quot;successfully&quot; tanking Tipt. As I said before I can only do it with a pooka in the mix to dish out insane DPS and thereby minimize the amount of time I'm toe to toe with the mob- so I would not consider what I do to be the equivalent of what a warrior can do in these trials. Unfortunately this is what the game at this stage has done and in order to be able to raid with my guild in KT, getting those flags is necessary and if I have to play speedbump for a pooka then so be it. <br />
<br />
I suppose it depends on your definition of &quot;successful&quot;. To me that means the trial is finished in a decent amount of time, and you're not having to stop and med up healer mana after every single mob. Sure, invising past stuff is a time saver- how much invissing past things are you doing so that you don't have to waste group resources on it?</div></div><hr />

well, actually, to clarify... i DID state that the monk in my group usually popped riposte disc on named inc. that, of course, handles the 'mob until it's slowed' problem. 10 times out of 10, his disc wears off at about 50% mob hp and i tank it from there. <br />
now, we've had a couple of occasions (like when umbiki spawned on our heads, or when we had 2 chavoor spawns in a row) when we didn't use disc's and still managed to get through them.<br />

yes. that is correct.<br />
granted, we've only *beaten* tipt once, and no plate bracer. the reason i don't have one is our win was so haggard and downright lucky we decided we needed to beef my ass up a bit more before we made it regular thing<br />
<br />
The phrase &quot;we die a lot&quot; strikes me as odd considering the most hazardous thing you can have in the mix in Tipt or Vxed is a charmed pet. So, your group does not have it. Which means either you got adds and people died (which means someone's having a bit of difficulty pulling) or the mob killed people. How does the mob kill people if you are tanking? Most likely because you are now a stain on the ground and it's running amok.<br />
yep. this is very true. i never said it wasn't a combination of luck and good timing that got us through things.  respawn adds, slow resists, those damned random huge damage spikes, etc, will plow me down the same as they'll plow down anyone else. i never said we did it smoothly or flawlessly all the time (which we don't, but sometimes we do on a good night)<br />
<br />
Maybe these questions are a bit too much like an inquisition, and don't get me wrong - if you are able to do this while the best of the best cannot then by all means I don't expect you to share your secret.<br />
i of course understand, and in fact i expected it when i made my first post on this thread. i know that what i'm saying goes against the grain of commonly accepted fact. i'm not here to say anyone sucks, or to blow my own horn... i'm simply stating 'hey, i can actually do this... so maybe something is missing from this equation'<br />

i've gotten a fair share of BS accusations. of course, i have no way to prove it here... but, i'm saying what i'm saying on good faith. you guys want screenshots? logs? i made an offer to let brael or slein or someone prominent even bot my mage to come with us on a tipt run, to prove my good faith on this. the whole reason i'm here is my passionate love of my shadowknight and an interest in the future of the class<br />
<br />
But I find it hard to believe you are &quot;successfully&quot; tanking Tipt. As I said before I can only do it with a pooka in the mix to dish out insane DPS and thereby minimize the amount of time I'm toe to toe with the mob<br />
well we do have very high dps. our wizard is time geared (though everyone else in the group is that delightful mishmash of gear that came from the post PoP era... vt/ssra and mid-planes) and we use a mage air pet (which can stun everything in vxed and tipt, btw... yellow or not)<br />
our fights are indeed very short. the cleric does indeed have to pretty much nonstop spam heal me (which is quite amazing how he pulls that off, considering he's 2 boxing the monk) and it's not a walk in the park, by any means. it's very difficult in fact. which is why we do it... it's a challenge.<br />
<br />
I suppose it depends on your definition of &quot;successful&quot;. To me that means the trial is finished in a decent amount of time, and you're not having to stop and med up healer mana after every single mob. Sure, invising past stuff is a time saver- how much invissing past things are you doing so that you don't have to waste group resources on it?<br />
we do not invis past mobs... and, provided we bother getting kei before we enter the zone (which we don't always do) mana is not ever a problem. we completed the vxed kill count in about... hour and a half? two hours? something like that... while moving back and forth from umbiki/chavoor and the named ukun beyond the bridge.<br />
we're also able to move through tipt from beginning to end with no trouble... well, excepting the occasional damage spike where i get my ass pounded.<br />
<br />
now, see, you bring up an interesting point about 'successful'<br />
so what is the main beef with sk's about vxed and tipt? that it can't be done *easily* or that it can't be done *at all*?<br />
i ask this because i've never understood everyone's deal with vxed and tipt. i've heard the complaints since GoD came out... and in the last month and a half that i've been going there i just haven't seen the big deal.<br />
i merely think that me, in my highly average gear, proves that it can be done *at all*. now, it may not be a walk in, take a nap for two hours while pulling/tanking, win, walk out... and i'm glad for that, because that crap is why we all stopped doing ldon... but it's quite reasonably doable with a high level of challenge.</div></div><hr />

this is true, brael... from the context of your position on this matter it is, and i will absolutely concede to you on that. i will also concede that my choice of words in the first comment you quoted was... poor, given the subject, and an inaccurate reflection of what i was trying to get at.<br />

from my perspective, i meant it simply that it's possible for me to get by... while others are having trouble, obviously ENOUGH trouble that they feel compelled to come here and right pissed OP's cursing SoE for what they consider to be fubared content. <br />

but the bottom line is that i don't see a major problem with vxed/tipt. and while i respect both the knowledge and experience of others, i can not just smile and nod and agree that vxed/tipt is too hard and sk's need boosted to be able to do it.<br />
now, as to whether sk's need fixes... heh... that's another story entirely. but, i don't vxed/tipt are a good cause to back that claim on</div></div><hr />

which, one would hope, is a large part of why they changed vxed/tipt to begin with. i have absolutely no doubt in my mind, from the accounts you and slein and others gave of vxed/tipt when GoD first came out, that i would be cream of wheat in seconds there.<br />
there's no room for doubt whatsoever that i'm undergeared for vxed/tipt (well, undergeared compared to minimal optimal gear) and, because i can do it, it might even be argued that vxed/tipt are currently too easy.<br />

as i have said, repeatedly, and i will say again.... tanking with ease compared to my gear.<br />
so there is no mistaking, i am absolutely NOT saying i can tank vxed/tipt named unslowed with a ranger healing me and just beat it down by myself. in no way am i trying to suggest that by some magic i'm just a better tank then anyone who fails at this. i'm not. i die a lot in vxed and tipt... on trash mobs and on named mobs (well, by 'a lot' i mean compared to an ldon group or PoP group)<br />
i personally don't think dying 2-4 times during a 3 or 4 hour group run is unreasonable, ESPECIALLY considering my gear.<br />
<br />
the point i've been trying to make since my first post is that vxed/tipt is not, in fact, as completely impossible to do as some people have suggested. or, at the very least, it's not so impossible that i can't get by. i'm not trying to make myself look good here. i'll be the very first to say my gear is average and my ac is crap. but this isn't about me... this is about vxed, tipt, and the sk class and what it is capable of</div></div><hr />

which is a big reason my group kills so fast. our wiz has the potime DD booster thingy (the big one) and the 750DD int caster rod, and they pretty much just chain cast SoS nonstop from inc (after they slow it with their shm) until the mob is dead. i've never grouped with a war who could out aggro me (though, granted, the best i've ever grouped with was a BF/BoC WA5, so i'm not even going to try and touch the subject of potime geared wars)</div></div><hr />

You went from tanking it with ease to tanking it while dying a lot to tanking it with luck to tanking it but dying once an hour.  You went from 90 minutes to maybe three hours to a &quot;three to FOUR hour group event&quot;.  We may as well consult a magic 8-ball at this point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u87"><b>Maicom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p87">The main problem I see with tipt in it's current state is this:<br />
<br />
With a knight, in the level of gear this trial is meant for, needs to bring a melee disc'er, or 2, along, as well as a chanter. If your smart your also gonna bring a malosinia'er and a long-term snarer. That makes the group somethin like this:<br />
<br />
sk<br />
cleric<br />
chanter<br />
ranger/druid(rng gives WS, dru gives extra spam)<br />
shm/mage(shm gives 7 in group, slows so chanter can focus on pet, and very minimal healing... mage gives malo and a bit of dps if it takes a while to get a charm mob, this can be negated by just gettin a new trial till you get one with a good charm pet early on) <br />
bard/monk(yes tipt can be pulled by most anyone, however these 2 classes make it very simple. Both get a invuln disc, but the bard gives mana/haste/and prolly most important, can help with charm breaks. However they wear plate, so i usually bring a monk  :D )<br />
<br />
<br />
A warrior in similar gear on the other hand(and I know, there are 2 people in my guild currently KT flagged, myself and one of our better warriors said warrior's magelo (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=378556) ) does not have to rely on bringing a charm pet, or another invuln discer. All they need is a cleric, slower, and a &quot;normal&quot; dps group(3 rogue's/wiz's/mage's/etc). They also get to actually tank the named~</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u92"><b>Ashrai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p92">Tearsin, thanks for the clarifications. Again, not to sound like I was putting you on the stand- but I think you can see now where the problem lies: so much of the issues with balance can be further compounded by the general masses &quot;perception&quot;. Much of the problem SKs face now is that the general populace has immediately caught on to the &quot;warriors are the tank of choice&quot; bandwagon just as they went on the &quot;knights are the tank of choice&quot; bandwagon in PoP. <br />
<br />
When you break down your experience then it becomes plain: your group was very definitely &quot;tailored&quot; to you as an SK and to your stats. No one wants to have to put up with that and most folks will usually say &quot;fuck this, I'm not mixing and matching and over compensating because we have an SK, just get us a warrior and let's go do the trial&quot;.<br />
<br />
I passed both my Vxed and Tipt trials as &quot;tank&quot;, and yet the main reason for our success was that the group knew how to work with a sub 8K (which I was at the time) tank, and I knew how to use a pet to my advantage. If charmed pets were taken out of the equation for Tipt and Vxed altogether, there would be no way in heaven or hell that I would ever be able to pull my weight as a tank for my flag without the group giving up after 5 hours and only halfway through.<br />
<br />
There are still problems for even the well geared at this stage, and for someone to say they had &quot;no problem&quot; is not a good thing to see because it makes it too easy for someone to point and say &quot;see, you SKs are fine, no problem here!&quot;</div></div><hr />

i've always known that. the problem with me (in relation to others) is my perception has always been the problem lie elsewhere then most think they do<br />
<br />
When you break down your experience then it becomes plain: your group was very definitely &quot;tailored&quot; to you as an SK and to your stats.<br />
yes, it was. there is no doubt in my mind that all of us having been friends in game for years is a major part of it.<br />
i haven't said a single thing about the viability of sk's as an LFG tank for vxed/tipt or in a non-optimal setting. i haven't done it, so i can't say anything about it. the *only* thing i've tried to communicate is 'look, you're saying this can't be done... but here, it CAN be done. so maybe the problem isn't *quite* where you think it is'<br />
<br />
I passed both my Vxed and Tipt trials as &quot;tank&quot;, and yet the main reason for our success was that the group knew how to work with a sub 8K (which I was at the time) tank, and I knew how to use a pet to my advantage. If charmed pets were taken out of the equation for Tipt and Vxed altogether, there would be no way in heaven or hell that I would ever be able to pull my weight as a tank for my flag without the group giving up after 5 hours and only halfway through.<br />
and i'm absolutely sure that had i tried vxed and tipt before the recent changes with the group i have now i would have met the same results<br />
<br />
There are still problems for even the well geared at this stage, and for someone to say they had &quot;no problem&quot; is not a good thing to see because it makes it too easy for someone to point and say &quot;see, you SKs are fine, no problem here!&quot;<br />
this is where the major disagreement stems.<br />
i think the sk class has a fair number of issues that need to be fixed. however, i don't think vxed/tipt is where those problems lie, and i don't think the direction the community is taking in trying to get their idea of the problems fixed is going to work, primarily due to my not thinking the problems are what people are saying they are.<br />
<br />
while you may look at what i'm saying as dangerous because i'm threatening the image sk's are presenting of the class being 'broken' in order to get... i don't know what, some kind of unnecessary overcompensation... i see what i'm saying as just trying to look in a different direction, to examine things in relation to everything else, and look into the areas that i truly feel are the problem (of course, no one has or WILL ask what i think the problem is, because no one wants to hear anything except 'sk's are broken and need defensive' but that's beside the point)<br />
<br />
You went from tanking it with ease to tanking it while dying a lot to tanking it with luck to tanking it but dying once an hour.<br />
kindly note in that sentence how many semantic qualifiers you used. 'ease' 'dying a lot' and 'with luck' are all EXTEMELY subjective concepts. <br />
when i said tanking with ease (in relation to my gear) and no one got what i meant, i changed what i said to 'okay fine, i got lucky.'<br />
when no one got that i was strictly saying i got lucky, i tried to reiterate that fact by stating i do die a fair bit, but no more then i would find reasonable for what i'm doing.<br />
<br />
i don't mind being questioned on consistancy... but if you're going to use a system of logic to try and disprove what i'm saying, you'll need to refrain from using wholly subjective measuring sticks, because subjectivism can not accurately determine facts. i am happy to answer any direct questions as clearly as i can<br />
<br />
You went from 90 minutes to maybe three hours to a &quot;three to FOUR hour group event&quot;. We may as well consult a magic 8-ball at this point.<br />
i also stated, not 4 posts later, that my estimation of time was likely wrong because it was late, and i retracted my arbitrary number and stated it was probably in the 3 hour range and i was wrong to say less</div></div><hr />

i'll bring this up only because it was asked. i'm sure no one here really cares or will even agree with me, but i'm not one to just bail on a thread, even if i know what i say is going to be ignored or rejected.<br />
<br />
i think the problem with class balance in general and sk's specificlly stem from a much deeper rooted problem then GoD or perceived 'class role' changes.<br />
the problem is that, since the velious expansion, they've been systematiclly changing the focus of the game. <br />
during the original expansion and through kunark, there was a pattern to gear. you had AC gear, you had HP gear, you had resist gear, and you had stat gear.<br />
while of course there were many overlaps, usually you didn't get more then 2 or 3 of these on any single piece of gear. this held true up to mid-level velious.<br />
<br />
take, for example, the 'top end' 1h weapons from original release through mid-level velious that were tradable.<br />
the best 1h in the original expansion was 8/24, 75DD proc<br />
the best 1h in kunark was 9/19 6str/sta 20hp<br />
the best 1h in velious was 12/22, 7ac, 60DD neg15ac proc<br />
luclin didn't really have any tradable 1h weapons that were much of an upgrade, they were just easier to get... luclin was when the 'raid oriented' idea that kicked off in upper-level velious really hit most of an expansion's worth of content and it changed the rules.<br />
now that's just the tradable stuff. if you look at the top end raid content... from kunark to velious you jump from lammy and a couple VP weapons that were barely upgrades, to BoC's and the katana from ToV.<br />
in the course of one expansion, there's this HUGE jump in equipment, where suddenly things are flooded with multi-stats, having everything you could need on one piece of equipment. compare for a moment the kunark class armor to the velious class armor, for example.<br />
<br />
when luclin came out, they were still struggling with how far to raise the bar. as many of you will i'm sure recall, when velious came out we were told NOTHING would ever have more then 100hp on it, nor would any rogue dagger EVER have more then 15 damage.<br />
when luclin was released, it's obvious that the bulk of the content was meant to be skipped by guilds who were at the top of velious. unlike kunark, where even the top end guilds had a lot to work with content wise (due mostly to the level cap increase and variety of new zones/equipment) and velious (which was difficult enough when it came out that even top end kunark people had a lot to work with in the lower areas) with luclin, the 'next level' of gear from ToV was limited to very few zones... like the deep, acrylia, ssra, VT (as far as a guild raid context is concerned, obviously other zones had some upgrades for certain people, but GE and AR didn't have a lot to offer a guild raid wise due to low number of named)<br />
<br />
now... this is where the problems started. since the content was no longer progressing on an equipment-based scheme (since the equipment upgrades were becoming less and less of an increase over what was in the last expansion until ssra and vt) the developers seemed to up and switch gears.<br />
before luclin, the content had been primarily tuned around the classes as they were, and you could just progress through it naturally with the equipment available in the new expansion (minus a few tweaks here and there that have been needed throughout... like druid/shm heal upgrades and ranger tanking)<br />
<br />
with luclin though, the gear didn't progress like previous expansions. items were comparatively small upgrades when replacing previous expansion items (for example, BoC vs BF, or PaS vs sword off ssra and BBB)<br />
however, the content (mob difficulty) still increased on a comparative level, becoming a hell of a lot harder then the last expansion's top end, but there was no gear to compensate for it.<br />
this is when the developer's started tweaking classes. things like AA's and the beginnings of the massive class balance changes started tuning classes so they could handle the content already available, instead of the content being tuned to the classes already in existence. (consider that from top end kunark to top end velious, hp upgrades on a bp went from about 50 to 100... double the previous amount! and from velious to luclin, it went from 100 to 125, a merely 1/4th total upgrade)<br />
<br />
since luclin, the classes have been systematiclly retuned every expansion to fit the content. it happened massively in PoP, the primary reason being mid-level PoP wasn't an upgrade over high-end luclin, and high end PoP was too difficult for the equipment that was available.<br />
at this point, the classes started being upgraded so they could handle the content that had already been made. damage and mitigation tables got shifted, skill caps were raised, new aa's were put in. the classes were being tuned to the content that already existed, instead of content being made for what was already in the game.<br />
<br />
this just got worse the further into PoP we went. as items got better and better, blowing away the previous expansion's gear, the mobs got insanely hard compared to the previous expansion, furthering the need for classes to be retuned in order to meet the content. <br />
<br />
this progressive issue is now reaching a head in GoD. granting even the admission that GoD and OoW were supposed to be released close together and GoD content was meant to be done at level 70, the content is a lot harder then the classes/levels it supposedly made for.<br />
and now, we see classes being retuned to match the content. wars got their upgrades... so did monks and rangers. them being retuned threw them out of balance with sk's and paladins, and now chances are good that we'll be retuned as well. then another expansion will come out, and my guess would be healers will get retuned to fit the content, or DPS classes. <br />
<br />
it's a systemic problem. the constant trend of making content far and beyond the capabilities of the classes current in the game, and then retuning the classes so they fit the content, is going to continually throw the classes out of whack in relation to each other and require constant and nonstop tweaking of the classes.<br />
<br />
thusly, i feel the problem we are now faced with is a content one. they're making mobs and scripts that are too difficult for the classes in the game, then beefing up the classes to meet the content. if this continues, it will never end... class balance will never be possible because classes will constantly be getting changed in relation to each other (as happened with warriors in relation to knights)<br />
<br />
the issue at hand is, in the end, the same: knights can't handle content that wars can.<br />
the root of the problem though, in my opinion, is the content... not the classes. when the issues about vxed/tipt first started coming out, i initially thought the problem was the content was too hard. same with ikk and beyond and the more serious problems going on there. i've never felt that sk's were lacking... simply that the content was made beyond what is possible.<br />
<br />
the conclusion?<br />
retuning content is the answer, not retuning classes. something may have to be done due to the fact the last war upgrade was, i admit, a creator of a tanking gap that is an issue and needs to be fixed. but i simply do not feel knights need a class revamp. the content is the real problem, and the systematic process of tuning that has been going on for the last 3 years</div></div><hr />

no, i said the tanking problems in general are content based, not class based.<br />
i do however agree that with the last round of war changes, the classes have been thrown out of whack in relation to each other, so certain changes need to be made. what i consider to be the tanking gap is that sk alternate skills do not balance out the gap in raw tanking ability between wars.<br />
i do not necessarily feel making sk's tank better is the solution, however</div></div><hr />

Love it, or hate it, the simple truth is eq, at least in terms of people on class boards espousing 'class vision' can only see incremental steps beyond what they currently are.<br />
<br />
And in that vision an SK's role is clear - group tank, raid ot tank.  SK's get a side order of situational pulling/cr, pallies get a side order of situational healing/rez. <br />

I struggle to think of how someone--ANYONE--could *EVER* think that, at the moment, SHD do NOT suck.<br />
<br />
While many of your comments are certainly highly dubious, some believe they are flat out LIES, the fact that you are making claims that your &quot;you have been found lacking&quot; character successfully tanked vxed/tipt is completely irrelevant.  <br />
<br />
What is relevant is that a SHD isn't anywhere near as good a choice to be the MT in those zones (or higher end of GoD) as a WAR is and this content is supposed to be single groupable.<br />
<br />
You can argue all you want about your stories about how you tanked those zones with considerable ease (I call bullshit right now), but it's all for nothing.  No matter what you say, a WAR, all things equal, will clearly be a far superior choice.<br />

Dude--the more you say, the more foolish you sound.<br />
<br />
&quot;Balance&quot; absolutely, positively means (in this case) equal.  The dictionary might define &quot;balance&quot; as:<br />
<br />
1) an equivalent counterbalancing weight or <br />
2) equality of distribution or <br />
3) a state of equilibrium<br />
<br />
SHD should be an equal *class* to a WAR in every way, shape and form.  WAR should, however, be the best *tanks*, which is, in my mind, equal to being able to take the biggest beating, as well as receiving the least amount of melee damage.  SHD should have other skills that make them as good as a WAR, or, in other words, BALANCED with WAR.<br />

When I started my SK, back in Feb 00, I had a simple goal.  To pull for raids in Fear and Hate.  A war friend of mine had told me that while wars got a go at tanking (I was in an evil rp guild at time, hell most of us were, I didnt KNOW any non evils), SKs got to pull or tank.<br />
<br />
In that scenario I have no problem with wars being raid tanks, SKs being raid off tanks, both classes being effectiviely equal in groups.  And I could care less about paladins full stop.<br />
<br />
However SOE saw fit to marginalise SK raid pulling and SK group pulling to the point where we come a distant 4th in both, and we are a bad third in tanking (lets ignore weapshield melees for a sec) - full stop - and woefully inadequate vs mobs capable of one rounding.<br />
<br />
Note that - ONE ROUNDING.  Its this single thing that makes warriors so truly powerful.  <br />
<br />
So now we are less efficient as tanks, without even the consolation of asap aggro on hard hitter mobs with short lifespans making a noticeable difference AND wars are raid tanks, AND we dont pull save for the occasiaonal situational.<br />
<br />
The status quo on this board, hoping for anything, ANYTHING, have got it wrong.  Fatally so.  Even if SOE were to heed your calls, what would the SK class be in the end?  A situational raid trash mob tank, that almost never tanks a tough raid mob until the encounter is trivial, who almost never pulls, and cant even make the ranger argument they have dps.<br />
<br />
As a raid tank you will just be a knight there to save warriors discs.  As a raid puller you are just there to be a last resort with the bonus of a summon corpse.  In this situation 2 warriors and one necro are FAR more desireable than 3 SKs.<br />
<br />
The only way for SKs to have raid viability that is balanced (sic) is where we actually offer a meaningful option to wars - or we are given a more significant pull capacity.<br />
<br />
And the only way to give SKs group viability is to ensure single group mobs are never one rounders - or give SKs a defensive.</div></div><hr />

We'd be (equally along with paladins) the first choice for offtanks, comperable group tanks to warriors, a distant second on raid bosses, and viable pullers when nothing needs offtanked.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The trash was really not bad.  Group was cleric, shammie, wizzie, rogue, monk.  I died once in the first 5 mobs when we were playing with healing vs mana efficiency to pull rate.  Slow steady couple hours for the kill 50 to hail.  The trash was fun but streaky as hell....most times a heal would land at 80% but if a yellow got a good round in it could drop 45-55% of my HP in a round.<br />
<br />
The named we tried after the win was at the front so we evaced to the front and started re-clearing.  I tried to convince my friends this would end ugly with me trying to tank but they wanted to try and not gimp it with how well the trash had been going.  Monk got him pulled out single but had to stay FD (he was also playing the cleric so it kind of worked out).  I tagged with darkness (immune), shaman malod on incoming, I kited backwards and ran back and forth a couple times in a tight area taking a few good hits, saw it got slowed, ran back to position, cleric filled me up, 327, 327, miss, shaman heals me to full, Stunned, 249, 1687, parry, 1767, 567, 887, 327, 1607, you are unstunned, 1847, loading please wait......<br />
<br />
I got raped before the cleric's next 2.5 second heal even had a chance.  The named are a little out of whack for the trash IMO.  I compare it to BoT at level 62-63 with respectable gear and I would do pretty well but the sand wing procers were pretty damn mean and it was streaky..a couple good procs and I could get killed.  I was still able to tank all the named and the wing boss at that level though...wing boss was close, but nothing like the vxed named.  That Vxed named wasn't even close.</div></div><hr />
