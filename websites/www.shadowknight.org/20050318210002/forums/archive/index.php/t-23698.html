<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Oh n0s why hasn't one of the 4 SK's to finish it come, spent a significant portion of his/her time, and written me a nice neat walkthrough so I don't have to think too hard!?!?  Wahhhh!<br />
<br />
Seriously; be greatful for the walkthroughs available, not whining because you don't have more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The actual quest to get 2.0 is more trivial in content than 1.5 , but requires a raid force to get the last bit and a time sink crap shoot to get the other bits as far as Ive seen.<br />
<br />
Use search!<br />
<br />
Oh sorry you wanted to forage it?</div></div><hr />

Oh crap I dont have that...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bjerlk Ferlock</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I knew my skillraising in begging from Goner would pay off in the end..<br />
WOHO!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Imothep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">There is really no need for a walktrough at this stage of the game : there is very few peoples ( aka those anguish  flagged ) who can do the quest,  and  usuallythose poples already know what to do.<br />
<br />
But  I think many peoples ( like me ) are just curious and would like to know a bit more on  the lore. I was very disapointed about our lame story for 1.5 and i would like to know if it's just end  with lhranc in  Rcod or if there is further steps.<br />
<br />
For spoilier, here you go.<br />
<br />
It's pretty straighforward from  1.5 and  all info up  to anguish loot is on this board : <br />
-Collect Lhranc's Ring in kithicor,Lhranc's Corroded Bracer in  HS and Lhranc's Pendant in com. <br />
-Hand them to npc in pok( the Female erudite ) to get Lhranc's Earthly Anchor.<br />
-Collect Globe of Discordant Energy in Anguish <br />
-Hand to  Filligno the Slayer in ruined city of Dranik. This should make pop  Lhranc and i supose you have to kill  him  again. Further steps weren't revealed yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>The Zenogias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You missed the first step, you have to kill the guy in CoM. The one that hits for 4700 and does the AE Plasma decay</div></div><hr />

<br />
im pretty sure this guy could solo him, with his l33t forage skeelz.</div></div><hr />

Probally because thats all of epic 2.  Besides the CoM guy you missed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Imothep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yep i forgot Kildena ( sp ? ) in com. I was at work and i just made this post from memory.<br />
<br />
So  that's all ? it's very short and disapointing imo.  Not really &quot; epic &quot;. Sk's storyline for 2.0 definitely don't compare with epic 1.0's  one or even other class epic 2.0.<br />
<br />
I hope lhranc 2.0 is as powerfull as he was when epic 1.0 was released.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Parasite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I hope lhranc 2.0 is as powerfull as he was when epic 1.0 was released.<br />
a.k.a soloable since hes outdated now?<br />
Sorry to bump an 1 month old thread yeah but, any info really on Lhranc how he is now? does one have to fight him at all?<br />
Just for the lore, im curious yup. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Adus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">He said he hoped he wasn't as powerful when epic 1.0 was FIRST released. How does that translate to &quot;as powerful as he is right now&quot;?</div></div><hr />
