<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vehement</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can someone explain to me how this works? I know FDing when you want to get rid of aggroe works, but what is the actuall way it does it?<br />
<br />
The way I always thought is once you FD, your hate number stays at that point, thus letting other tanks get ahead of you, then once you get up your back at the hate number you had when you FDed.<br />
<br />
Or does it totally mem. wipe if successfull? I always thought the mob had to reset to its spawning point for that to happen, so I dont know.<br />
<br />
Any insight would be nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sazzabi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This is my understanding of how I think it works.<br />
<br />
I think when you do a successful FD one of two things can happen. One is the common result and one is the rare result.<br />
<br />
1. (common) You stay on the hatelist but only have a hate of 1.<br />
<br />
2. (rare) the mob completely mem-wipes you from its hatelist. The fact this happens sometimes lets you lose aggro on mobs even if they havn't reset at their spawn point. Just keep FDing over and over and one FD is bound to mem-wipe the mob eventually.<br />
<br />
Also, most mobs typically mem-wipe when they return to their spawn point, if they have one (but not always).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dakkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">At low levels it's a little different.  I presume your question is about FD in high level melee fights though, which usually works as follows:<br />
<br />
If you have a solid hate lead on the mob (i.e. you have a lot of aggro and are getting beat on), and multiple melees are fighting it then most mobs see through FD unless you FD out of their melee range.  You won't lose aggro and they'll still hit you as you're lying on the floor.<br />
<br />
If you don't have aggro or have only had it by a small margin, any successful FD will drop you way down the mob's hate list.  Not sure if it's to 1 but it's very effective.  I'm uncertain whether FDing in fights with multiple melees engaged can give you a 100% mem wipe (a random guess says not), but it's worth testing.<br />
<br />
I know that when I've had aggro and want to lose it to another tank with FD, I usually stay down for a few seconds because I've had instances where I FD, lose aggro and stand up immediately only to get it back again.  Not sure if these were flukes though.<br />
<br />
If the mob isn't engaged in combat with multiple melees when you FD, there's about a 1/3 chance (people say) that it will mem wipe completely and forget you, even if it's a roamer.  So, if you get (say) 2 roamers you can't handle on a pull it's worth giving it a few FDs to try to get rid of one or other of them.  Some mobs are configured to respond in different ways to FD on pulls though.<br />
<br />
This is as much as I know; hopefully it answers some of your questions anyway :)</div></div><hr />
