<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Yabyab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I used shadowknights.org as a main source of all the info I get. And from what I've observed that AGI does nothing but making you skill up defensive skills faster, and adds 1 AC per 6 AGI. If this is the case, then AGI is definitely useless. However, I was told by a BeastLord that AGI 305 difference from AGI 100 is like Combat Agility3 (maybe she exaggerated?). She said it helps you avoiding  damage.<br />
<br />
 Anyone out there can confirm this with parses or direct info from the developers?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sepcieulus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well I could be wrong … but from my understanding (observation and reading):<br />
<br />
Agi affects your chance to avoid being hit.<br />
<br />
Sorry no parses or words from the GM. <br />
<br />
But here is what EQlive says ... if I remember correctly its the same as was stated in my first eq manual when I bought the game.<br />
<br />
Agility: Physical agility; affects your probability of being hit in combat, how much damage you take per hit, and how fast you learn some skills. <br />
<br />
Here is the link: http://eqlive.station.sony.com/manual/manual.jsp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Yabyab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thank you Sep, yeah I know AGI affects your chance of avoiding getting hit by adding 1 AC every 6 AGI, or is there another formula for this like % to doge every X AGI?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shummn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Agi increases your chances of learning defensive skills, raise your ac with 1 per 6 agi - assuming you're over the 75 treshold - other than that - nothing.<br />
<br />
If in doubt, go search for agility on the shaman board.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Yabyab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I got this impression that AGI does nothing but:<br />
<br />
 1. Faster defensive skill ups<br />
 2. 1 AC for every 6 AGI<br />
<br />
 and thats it, I got this info from this forum<br />
<br />
 However, reading Monk/Beast forums and talking to lots of BSTs they swear by AGI's. Would you link the Shaman forums for me so I can check their parsing/posts about this issue?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Yabyab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thank you Shummn, I read the posts so basically AGI does nothing but adds some AC according to that table. The parse was done (that I dont 100% trust) says that someone without AGI boost tanks slightly better (which just prove that AGI doesnt give us much). I'd rather get some updated parses, since that guy tested with AGI1 (how can you get to aGI1 and dont you just lose lots of AC below 75?).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shummn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You can get agi to 1 by carrying LOTS of coins, thus being overweight, and you will lose AC simply by going under the 75 treshold. And the way I read the conclusion that you tanked better with low agi was that it was a tongue-in-cheek comment, and the right thing to say would be that agi has no significant impact on your ability to tank - at least not possible to prove statistically with the given amount of data points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Yabyab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If this the case, and I agree based on my testing (dont feel that AGI does anything, not like when I get Dex I feel I do more procs for instance). I guess the lots of Boards have misleading strategies. Like the BeastLords/Monk boards who swear by AGI (I almost would have gone hardcore AGI when I read that AGI  305 is identical to CA3!).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tarrasque</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">When they say that agi decreases your chance of being hit and makes you take less damage, it doesn't mean that you get some kinda hidden % shaved off your damage. It's just the effect that AC gives you. And you get 1 AC for 6 agi.<br />
<br />
What's interesting is that my Everquest manual tells me that DEX increases attack speed. (Actually, it says &quot;DEX: Decreases time between attacks&quot;)...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Uwildi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I have heard that during beta, AC was split between avoidance and mitigation, with armor = mitigation, and agi = avoidance.

His pet was light blue, but with full shammy buffs, mine was dark blue with only augmentation, not only did his pet land  2x3x4x hit more often and for max damage(I'm assuming str and dex), but it was missed alot more. (not parsed, just watching the battle spam) While not a scientific approch, it would seem that adding a large chunk of agility will affect the miss rate more than just the few AC would do on their own.</div></div><hr />

Sorry but this just make me cringe - it seems sow is slower after patch, it seems darkness are more resisted after patch, it seems this or that - if in doubt parse it, and parse it against similar mobs otherwise the data is useless.<br />
Try buffing a pet with a stamina buff and note how the hp bar does not go down a bit before pet start regenning, and try getting a stamina buff yourself, and you will see that it is only your max hitpoints that go up. This leads me to conclude that pets are not affected by stat buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Norwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Overall I agree that the effects of Agility for Shadowknights are insignificant as long as your above a specific threshold (ie like Stamina @100+).<br />
<br />
I do think however that each class type has different ways in dealing with “being hit” and that while for Shadowknights Agility effects are minimal they may be significant for classes such as monks. So I would not be surprised that from some classes 1AC may be from 6 Agi while from others its 2 Agi.<br />
<br />
Further from investigations into AA abilities it has been concluded that for RANGERS Combat Agility has more effect than Combat Stability. I think that for plate classes it would be opposite and Combat Stability would have more effect than Combat Agility.<br />

Then why would our pet buffs include str? It makes them hit for full more often, so if str does affect them, why not the rest? More dex for more procs, etc... would make sense.<br />
<br />
I do agree that it is odd if the hp does not dip when they get a sta buff though. Never tried it on my own pet, so far.</div></div><hr />

Well I've come to know Everquest as a game that doesn't strictly follow it's own rules, and the developers are not always in tune with the actual game, so I can easily imagine the developer adding str to the pet buff spell simply because Players usually get a str buff - other than that I have no clear proof/evidence/parsings proving or disproving(is that a word?) if str have an effect on pets (it's hard enough to prove it adds a whole lot of dps on players...)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since AoD is 5% more haste than SLTW, I assume that the stat buffs do increase overall dps and therefore affect pets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Shummn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">4:  Increase STR by 50 <br />

1:  Increase STR by 68 <br />

5:  Increase STR by 35 <br />
6:  Increase DEX by 28 <br />
<br />
Just copied effects from Lucy IF all that stacks, you're adding 153 str, 83 dex, 45 sta and 60% haste compared to:<br />
<br />
1:  Increase Attack Speed by 65% <br />
2:  Increase STR by 52 (L55) to 55 (L60) <br />
3:  Increase AC by 14 (L55) to 15 (L60) <br />
<br />
So 101 str 83 dex -5% haste on the shm buffs compared to the sk buff. Sounds interesting, have you parsed how much of the added damage is from extra life tap procs? Are you positioning the pet equally and are the mobs of the same level?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">The damage your pet does on a proc (be it lifetap or weapon) doesn't actually show up and therefore couldn't be accounted for outside of the messages themselves being manually counted and added in.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think this is the closest to accurate.  For us, agi is pretty useless above a certain critical level.  But for monks and beastlords, it directly affects AC in a much more significant way.  This is offset by the fact that they have to stay under 15 weight or get a significant and direct penalty to their AC.  The idea is that they are avoidance classes and presumably spend their time during combat jumping around a lot trying to avoid blows.  We are not and don't.</div></div><hr />

How is that different from having all your defensive AAs and not capping your agility?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Vorrhees</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">You get hit more....Not quite sure what your asking?<br />
<br />
Agi helps Dodge, parry (you Evade more) . I Dont have l33t knowleadge of it, but I know from my own xps. I have a base of 206 agi atm, and when I get Wrulen or FA or both....the mob im tanking hits me alot less then it did. The healer in group Casts heal on me alot less (obviously). The only time I need a heal is when the mob Rampages at the end..and even then I only drop to 80%. <br />
<br />
If im wrong, well then So be it, But I know How my SK reacts to agi cap.<br />
Try it out for yourself, and tell me if you see a difference. Of course if you dont have all your Defense aa's yet, then you will Notice you getting hit alot less, But my defense aa's were my first aa's to get, so Im used to the migation/avoidence. So Agi is the last thing i can do to help my dmg/Inc melee untill I get skill mods.<br />

     As was already mentioned in this thread several times, AGI increases your AC (although not by a very big amount once you get it past 75). <br />
<br />
     Higher AC = you get hit less.<br />
<br />
     So yes, maxxing your AGI will allow you to tank better.  However, if it comes down to a choice between an AGI buff and a raw AC buff, chances are the AC buff will make a bigger difference than the AGI buff.<br />
     There is no evidence that AGI does anything other than increase your AC and increase you chance of skill-ups.<br />
     So yeah, max your defensive aa's and have a shaman cast Wrulans on you, and you won't get hit as much as you do without Wrulans.  Just like you won't get hit as much with Virtue on as you do without.<br />
     I have seen lots of people who claim that AGI increases dodge and parry rates, or other claims along those lines.  I've never seen anyone be able to show any evidence of that through parsing, however.<br />
     Just because I've never seen parsing prove it doesn't mean it isn't true, but the complete lack of evidence is good enough for me to click off Wrulan for an extra buff slot on every raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">To parse:  take an EQ log file and run it through one of the myriad of parsing programs, such as YALP or whatever is in fashion these days.  I'm at work or I'd run a search on &quot;EQ Parse Program&quot; in vivisimo or google and give you a few links.<br />
<br />
-edit-  Here's another question: in the groups where you don't get FA and/or Wrulan's, do you still have a shaman doing the slowing?  If the mob isn't slowed as much, you'll see a significant difference in the damage output.  The difference between a 60% slow and a 70% slow is more than you'd think.</div></div><hr />
