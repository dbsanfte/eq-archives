<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shurek</div><div class="date">06-21-2004, 03:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Guys, <br />
<br />
There are a couple of quests Im wanting to start (mainly the Loyalist shield) that require Katta Faction.<br />
<br />
Now since im an Ogre, or maybe cause im an SK, everyone hates me in Katta.  So I need to gain some faction.<br />
<br />
I can either solo (prefered) or 2box with a 65 rogue / 65 bard / 65 mage / 56 druid.  Or I can get a group from Guild (if there is one around) which most people are around 60 - 65, with a couple that are 50 - 55.<br />
<br />
Normal group of players on at my time:<br />
<br />
65 Paladin, 60 Paladin, 65 Bard, 65 Cleric (2), 65 Enchie, 62 Enchie, 51 Wizard, 55 Necro, 65 Druid (2), 59 Druid, 65 Shadowknight, 43 SK (me).<br />
<br />
Now most of the 65 will be off doing what they want to - aa grind or what ever, but the lower group,  62 enchie / 60 Paladin / 55 necro / 51 Wiz and myself (43 SK) would be looking at grouping together, with a healer (maybe 52 druid).  <br />
<br />
So looking for some suggestions for +Katta Faction.<br />
<br />
Cheers</div></div><hr />

Do everthing prior to ashes with a char that isn't KOS, do the handin of the first parts with him, then hand in the ashes with the char you want to have the shield.<br />
<br />
Theres a few technical points involved, but I'm sure with a little research, you can figure those out.<br />
<br />
Katta faction takes a long time to build up.  Unless of course you WANT to, then thats ok:)<br />
<br />
Just an alternative to spending a month factioning.<br />

Also, killing some stuff in Seru (especially Seru himself) will work. I think Grimmling picks can also be turned in for faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kassdax</div><div class="date">06-22-2004, 01:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Although this quest is generally for higher level players, would anybody be willing to share where I might get some faction work going at 34th level? Getting a bit of xp and/or coin wouldn't hurt either if it's available.<br />
<br />
I plan on doing this quest when I'm about 15-20 levels higher but would prefer not to sit in TM for a couple of months faction farming if I can start early.<br />
<br />
Not sure how much this matters, but I'll be soloing for faction or maybe rarely get a level 35 beastlord to help me.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Silvershadow</div><div class="date">06-22-2004, 06:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Best way to build up Katta faction is undoubtedly killing in Sanctus Seru, specifically the Praesertums and Lord Inquisitor Seru himself of course.<br />
<br />
I'd say that since you're likely to want to do the earring quest anyway (dunno your level of raiding, if any, but Seru is not that hard), you'll be camping stuff in Sanctus Seru more than enough to get enough faction for that quest and subsequently also for just about any other quest in Katta.<br />
<br />
If you don't want to do that, then it's off to kill vampyres you go, or slaughter the greenie guards in Neth Lair/Marus Seru that are on SSeru faction. That'd take ages tho. Big hits in Sanctus Seru, good pp and some exp, and a great earring if you manage to stick through to the end and get Seru's head :)<br />
<br />
Level the druid a bit and you can twobox a lot of stuff in SSeru easily, or bring a group for the bigger mobs. Good luck :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Klotar AngedeMorts</div><div class="date">06-23-2004, 01:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, basically I'll go out on a limb and state that it'd be extremely difficult to be able to have faction good enough, as an evil class/race, with Phenic (the quest giver) to do the quest without MQ or without pacify/harmony/invis/charm tricks, even with a good race illusion.  I'll try to explain.<br />
<br />
I won't pretend to know all the factions in Katta, but there are several that I do know of.<br />
<br />
Validus Custodius - Katta Guards.  Not specifically needed for the quest, but makes running around Katta easier.  I capped at Kindly I think.  Raised by killing vamps in TM.  Not that bad to work on because you can do it at the vamp castle trying to get Grolden to spawn anyways, get some merchant loot and plat.<br />
<br />
Magus Conglegium - Katta Casters.  Not specifically needed for the quest either but some hand ins and the &quot;shades fight&quot; takes place inside the Magus Conglegium building, and it's a lot easier to do this fight without having to clear the greenie guards or trying to stay in the exact center of the platform to avoid getting adds.  For hand-ins on the upper floors, there are some dark blues nearby and some can see invis.  I capped at Dubious I think, perhaps Indifferent.  This faction can be raised by fighting guards in Sanctus Seru or the greenie guards in DSP or Marus Seru.<br />
<br />
Nathyn Illuminus - not sure what it's for other than for Nathyn himself whom is part of the quest.  Don't remember what I capped at but it's above indifferent.  I raised this while vamp killing in TM.  I believe all you need is to not be KOS because he instaspawns after a hand-in as an indifferent version anyways.<br />
<br />
Concilium Universus - I have NFC what this faction is for but I maxed it in Sanctus Seru.  Someone told me it was for raising Phenic faction but I was still scowling after I maxed it so that wasn't it.<br />
<br />
You can get some +faction hits by doing some quests to hand in vamp fangs and bloods or something in Katta (invis to the quest area, the quest npc's are dubious) but that was going to take forever plus I had no idea if it would be the right faction or not -- since I already had gone out of my way to max the incorrect faction.<br />
<br />
I still don't know what faction Phenic is on or how to raise it.  Maybe you can get big +hits from killing Seru or doing the earring quest or killing for VT shards on the upper floors or deeper inside Sanctus Seru than I went), I can't say because I only killed zone in guards.<br />
<br />
Unless pride stands in your way, I'd highly recommend MQ.  A druid is ideal in that they will not be KoS to anything in Katta, can port around to do the preliminary hand-ins and runarounds, make for a good partner to clear the vamp castle while factioning or waiting for Grolden, plus can do the harmony and invis on you for the final hand-in.  Of course, any other good race will do too, but you might need more external help on some parts.  My vote is to skip all the factioning (other than what you get while killing vamps waiting for Grolden) and aim for MQ.  Everything, i.e. the entire quest, can be done in a few hours except for Valdanov's ashes.  Why be dumb like me and spend weeks doing faction?  (Okay I had to do the vamp castle but didn't need to spend any time in Sanctus Seru/DSP/Marus Seru).</div></div><hr />

I've never come up with a way to raise it, nor have I spoken to anyone who has.  If you're too stubborn to MQ, this quest isn't for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kassdax</div><div class="date">06-23-2004, 02:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the tips. I'll go back to killing for the sake of rising in power within Cazic Thule's ranks instead of some other purpose.<br />
<br />
/em runs off to North Freeport</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thank you Slein for confirming this - time to break out the cleric</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Klotar AngedeMorts</div><div class="date">06-29-2004, 02:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">He's on his own faction...

<br />
I'll bet that if one were to repeat this quest oh.... several hundred times that maybe we'd be non-kos enough to do the hand-ins without resorting to trickery or MQ.  /duck<br />
<br />
On a more serious note, thanks for the confirmation.  There is a lot of rumour floating around out there about Seru kill faction hits, doing the earring quests, killing house bosses in Sseru that it would solve all faction probs with Phenic, but I'm guessing that maybe it was good races and/or classes conning Phenic, found themselves non-kos and assumed it was the Seru kill (or whatever action).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Phenic Dionicas says 'You have done a great service for Katta Castellum and the Loyalist Empire. I award you for your honorable Services. Know that you will be remembered for your deeds.' <br />
<br />
Your faction standing with Concilium Universus got better. <br />
Your faction standing with Seru got worse. <br />
Your faction standing with Heart of Seru got worse. <br />
<br />
<br />
Contrary to my little joke in the first paragraph, those are the faction hits for the final hand in.  It can't be Concilium Universus, I'm 100% sure I am maxed.  Funny how Seru got WORSE tho'.  Heart of Seru I have no idea, as that went up and down like a yo-yo with the various mobs I was killing in Sseru.</div></div><hr />
