<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Eggborn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been pulling and assigning pullers for Bert raids lately.<br />
<br />
Often we dont have a lot of monks, but do have sk's to pull.  This is why I am doing it in the first place.<br />
<br />
We have a small guild, and tend to do raids with smaller number of people than normal.  Our normal force for this raid is 50 to 60, we got it once and popped bert with 10 to 15 mins to spare the other times.  I would like to cut this time to at least 30 mins to spare, with the same numbers in raid.<br />
<br />
Our tactics involve not an AE stun, but mez, and assign a tank assigned to break them off for the camp to kill.  We do have a lot of chanters / bards that can handle this job.<br />
<br />
We have constant comminucation with the tank who will MT the Kings.  Once a king spawns we commincate to the MT and get him a target.<br />
<br />
The one problem (besides the occasion deaths from us pullers eating several harm touches running back to camp/common hehe), is if one of us runs into camp without eating some harm touches or getting a small beating, the MT gets it all at the same time.  This can be handled by the healers.. but is a risky thing I think.. Sometimes we run the risk of wiping on a king if this happens, which messes up the timing.<br />
<br />
Has anyone else pulled for bert?  I am wondering if it is better for a puller to take some hits on the way in and have another tagger ready, or if I should just continue to try and avoid damage coming in and let the healers deal with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ashrai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">One of the first raids I ever pulled for was Bert and at the time my level and stats meant that I had no choice about taking a beating on the way in: if I got hit I was dead basically. Would pull the mob in right to the MA, and either FD or take my TL box so the mob would unload on the MA.<br />
<br />
Pull team didn't really comnunicate with the MA personally, the raid leader would just assign the MA for the next King, plunk him in position, and we'd get the pull in. All I wanted to know was who was MA so I could pull to the right person. <br />
<br />
<br />
Getting the Kings in was pretty straightforward. Other puller agros everything, tag King as he paths back, and run like hell. You've got more than enough distance to stay out of range of a whack or two. Usually by the time I took up my position next to the MA, the mob was just turning the corner on the last tunnel down to the raid. Which, if you tag and run fast enough, will be the first time the King has Line of Sight to a PC.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Deathabove</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Unfortunately the best pull team I've seen for pulling the kings is a monk - bard combo.  Have the bard cast invul on the monk.  Have the monk run in and aggro all the mobs around the king and run to a corner and flop.  Have the bard or any other class that wants to tag the king and send them up the opposite side the monk went.  The king paths back quicker than the adds, so he'll come single easy.</div></div><hr />

The bard isn't doing anything......all you have to do is tag the pack and flop, you shouldn't get hit.  Then anyone can tag the king.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ravenar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Here is how I ran my pull team on Bert and we pretty much go thru it flawlessly now.<br />
<br />
Use this map (http://members.cox.net/ravenar_of_ruuktaal/images/CODb2-Ravs.gif) to guide ya.<br />
<br />
After banshee chick is dead, I get everyone to number 1 room.  We wait for spawn and kill.  We then move to room 2 safe point.  SK or monk, monk preferable, runs through room and FDs at FD spot or soon after. As soon as puller aggros and runs, SK aggros ONE mob with snare spell, MA runs in to get aggro on that one as SK FDs.  Other mobs start to filter back into room and you kill em all.  Very nicely done and is nice on your necro and chanter mezzers.<br />
<br />
Once kings pops which is about two circuits of killing, we do the same as above excpet 2nd SK snares King causing him to run back while other mobs run after puller.  Be sure to FD the 2nd SK quick as MA gets aggro so as to not let other mobs rush back in.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
<br />
Edit:  Note you will run circuit about 5 times total before all 12 Kings are dead.  Also when 8th King dies, 9th one auto pops.  Also if monk is first puller he can sneak to opposite side of room before tagging for pull.  (gives monk a bit of a head start)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>XebarisTP</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">SK, Pallies, Bards, Clerics load their DA. One of them casts it and rushes into the crowd and sits to get aggro. Mobs get mezzed, and tank engages king.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zedlepln</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Get a bunch of bone chips.<br />
Park Kenny close enough to engage a mob (king or not) in the room you wish to pull.<br />
Target the king (or other mob) in the room and get a good lead back to the raid.<br />
Send Kenny.<br />
Run.<br />
<br />
When the pet dies, you will get chain agro (regardless of the pet level) on all the mobs in the room (I'm assuming you want to CC/offtank/AE). You can do this with a lvl 9 pet if you prefer. You will get a room at a time and never get hit until you get to the raid. If you target any king, the MA can assist on inc. It wont be hard to get agro off you. I have used this strat twice with no deaths on pulls. It just costs a lot of bone chips.</div></div><hr />
