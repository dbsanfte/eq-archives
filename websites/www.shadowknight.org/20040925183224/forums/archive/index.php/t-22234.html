<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gordrach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I did a search but came up empty (or in my case, with too many threads seemingly having nothing to do with my question).  I've tried to look at people's Magelo profiles, but all I get is a series of very odd characters on a blank page.  I've tried to go to the Magelo website and rather than arriving at a page I am prompted to either open or save a file.  When I choose to open the file I get another page full of random characters.  When I save to file and try to open it, I am prompted to choose a software program to use to open the file as it is apparently not recognized by my OS.  I'm currently at the office behind a corporate firewall.  Might anyone be able to give me some insight as to how I can get Magelo to be functional for me?  I'd like to take the time to set up my profile so as to be able to provide more accurate information for everyone once I do start posing questions about equipment.  Thank you very much in advance for your time and insight.</div></div><hr />
