<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Byttorr Ebonknight</div><div class="date">03-27-2002, 03:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Assuming you were talking about what I think you were talking about (CoS), I'm sure Verant is fully aware of how it is used. Remember, they decided to nerf the item but allow existing ones to remain as they were. Plenty of precednet for that solution, I think we have zero to fear on another nerf of an item that has already been nerfed.  I think Verant is satisfied that pre-nerf versions will thin themselves out by attrition as time goes by, and that the methods in which it is used really only imbalance the PVP servers.<br />
<br />
While that decision is lamentable, as many consider said item a defining item/ability for our class, that decision is also ancient history to Verant and I'm sure no further action will be taken. The nerf is no doubt &quot;working as intended.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">velourea</div><div class="date">03-27-2002, 04:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">when it was nerfed, verant said that the existing CoS' would not be altered then but implied that they might be completely nerfed at a later date.<br />
<br />
i have 10k saved for one but im really antzy on whether or not they will nerf the &quot;pre-nerf&quot; ones</div></div><hr />

No good can come of it. /shrug</div></div><hr />

I have my pre-nerf COS but I have no idea what this big hush hush thing is all about... lol    Is it about losing aggro after a FD?</div></div><hr />
