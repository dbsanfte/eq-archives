<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Australians play too much rugby league... go go new zealanders.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Daemoness</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There is one thing worse then league. Aussie Rules....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Aussie rules is kinda interesting (I even watch it occasionally, and always watch the grand final, though that's as much for the entertiainment &amp; spectacle that accompanies it as much as the game itself... they usually have some very talented musicians, unlike the rap shit we get at sporting events in america), but rugby league can suck a dick.  Play union, or don't play rugby.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>BRÆDOWN™</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I remember rugby having the supidess three rules, 1) No walking on someones face. 2) No sticking your thumb up someones butt. 3) No biting another players testicles. <br />
<br />
My friend said that some rugby players tape their testicles in their buttcheeks so they can't get hurt to much...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It's all about the compression shorts...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Daemoness</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Only time i watch a full game of Aussie Rules i saw a guy get his face split open and his team was penillised for him bleeding, have to admit i got a laugh out of it though. But over all there is waaay to much spandex in that sport for it to be watchable.</div></div><hr />

penillised <br />
<br />
I think Daemoness should be penalized for this transgression.<br />
<br />
I've never watched or played rugby. <br />
<br />
Please carry on with your discussion.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Ad breaks are out of control, watch a game in person thats getting televised, boring as hell just watching them sit down while ad's are going on.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">American football has, on average, 16 seconds of gameplay per minute according to ESPN or something else lacking any motivation to skew such a statistic against american football.  <br />
<br />
Soccer, rugby, aussie rules, galic football, etc. are almost 100% active play.<br />
<br />
I have better uses for the other 44 seconds per minute.  <br />
<br />
<br />
For the record: In spite of it all, I follow american football; I have season tickets to my city's NFL team and havn't missed a game in several years.  If we had professional rugby or soccer teams and I had to choose, you can probably guess which I'd be attending though.</div></div><hr />

Or is all that kevlar body armor knackering out the players and they need a rest ;)  <br />
<br />
As Vince Lombardi said, &quot;Dancing is a contact sport, football is a collision sport&quot;  - anyway at bears packer games I need the time to get beer.<br />
<br />
Soccer is fun to play but boring to watch, rugby is fun to watch but painful to play.<br />

In Alabama they combine pedophilia and incest. Also would that not make Denmark's consent age like 12?</div></div><hr />
