<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">what are your guys opnions on Human sk's?<br />
<br />
im a fantasy nut, so i see something like knights of thakisis type of thing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Trama</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Humans are alright.That is what i play. But personally if i could go back. I would have gotten a Troll or a Iksar mainly coz they look better and the regen. But humans seem like they dont have anything special with them heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>neferaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Humans are okay, there are a few threads on them if you use the search button. A little summary:<br />
<br />
Bertoxxulous is nice because you can have the smithed armor with nice stats (sta and int I think).<br />
<br />
Put all your points in int, instead of something strange like agi like I did. Sta is a good second choise too but with the power of most high end spells and the means to aggro kite int would have been my first choise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Flatstompa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'd consider putting as many points in sta as posible before going int.<br />
As a human you start with 75 or was it 80 int, so thats fairly good.<br />
But the general opinion is that hp is &gt;all, so the more hp you have early on, the better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Toltanus Thule</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Humans are pretty good Shadowknights and can be evil as hell.  Just think of Arthas from Warcraft 3.. heh..</div></div><hr />

They need leggings with skulls on the knees in EQ...<br />
<br />
Or do they already?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, I think Inkie Old Model Velious plate has Skull knees, Not 100% sure tho. <br />
<br />
Personally, I've always had a special love for Erudite and Human SKs anyway, because I've always thought of Shadowknights as very much KNIGHTS, with a definite code of Honor and Chivalry, just with a darker twist. Thus, as Humans and Erudites have thier Paladins, they have the fallen, Dark Side of those.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vuloshek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Humans also make a good substitute for dark elves in a way.  They're a bit tougher and stupider, but they're the only other non-ugly race that can be shadowknights, and if you want you can worship Innoruuk and be part of that whole scene.  Not hard to roleplay, just be as big a dick as you'd like to be in real life.  I picked human because I didn't want to be the big dumb person in the group, or the little guy everyone put down, or a lizard that everyone hated.  And above all, I didn't want to be a dark elf.<br />
Also, if you're starting untwinked, the human SK armor quest is a breeze, at least for Innoruuk worshippers.  Nothing to hunt but orc pawns and beetles, all in 1 zone.  Looks pretty badass too (someone else brought up in another thread that DE helmets look silly - human ones aren't so bad).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Scarus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Human helms aren't so bad?  A bucket with nose nose-guard is bad enough but they've got little wings as well.  Nothing says &quot;pansy&quot; like little wings!<br />
<br />
I'll take the &quot;somewhat silly yet malevolent&quot; DE helm over the &quot;my mummy made it&quot; Human pally helmet.<br />
<br />
Both races look much better (depending on faces/hair/colours) without any head gear anyway.<br />
<br />
<br />
Humans also run funny, twirling their weapons like 5 year old girls.  And their plate is dull and lacking a crotch guard.  Ow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Vuloshek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Alright, so the wings are silly.  Look at all of the helmets for each race and tell me which ISN'T silly.  I think they messed up on all of them.  Trolls, actually, are pretty evil looking, but the helmets are a rip off of Jaba the Hutt's guards.  How stupid all of the helmets in the game are should be a new thread altogether.<br />
I'd have to agree, take that bucket off when you go into town if you're at all worried about looks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Scarus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If they hadn't of made the humans run animation so astonishinly stupid I'd probably have played a Bertoxx despite the helmet.  Unfortnately I just couldn't get past going from posing with a huge sword and looking menacingly cool to running like a overjoyed preschooler.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Hsystah Shadowspawn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Who cares what they run like?  You don't have to watch them run, I'm usually in first person so that is about as irrelevant as extra fat on an ogres butt.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hsys</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ancatdub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Apparently you are missing the joy with which preschoolers kill lesser life forms :D <br />
<br />
Have to admit the wings on top make us poor humans look like Mercury. /rude SOE</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Mordin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'd have to agree on the helmut issue, the wings don't help when your trying to get a mean set of armor.  It's not so bad though, if they made the helmuts more like a skull or something it would be way more menacing, and no not just the item picture the whole thing.<br />
<br />
As for the running thing, I'm usually in first person too so it dosen't bother me too much.   I take screen shots when I am fighting not running so who cares what we look like then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Calamity_Daemon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Almost every human I see is either Monk (Duh) Paladin (Drives me crazy) or Shadow Knight (On Inny server anyway). Humans only look like holy beings when they have the wingies on their helms. I guess if you got like all black as night armor on you would look alright but...Humans are too basic for me but I guess as how Innoruuk chose a human to weild his &quot;Curse&quot; then they have the ability to become some killer SKs. But I believe the only races that can truly wield this magnificant weapon are the truly evil ones i.e. Dark Elves, Trolls, Ogres, Iksars, and Erudites because they pretty much started Necromancy and where would we SKs be withough Necromancy )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Rugs Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The only thing you cant fix is racial advantages and the look of the character in this game.<br />
<br />
Get a race that you first like the looks of.  <br />
<br />
Then weigh the advantages of the other classes (dont look at the stats if its within like 10 points either way).<br />
<br />
If I hated the way ogres look, I wouldnt be one just to get the unstunnable feature.  If iksars drove me crazy, I wouldnt choose to be one for the ac bonus or regen.<br />
<br />
Late in the levels all things come to equality (or close).  With buffs and decent gear, everyone maxes their melee skills except maybe dex, agility, and intelligence.  If you have primal going, then intelligence is the only one that wont max from buffs alone.<br />
<br />
Regen is nice for soloing, dueling, and FD'ing while dotted...its not going to make the cleric any happier when your gettin hit for 500s though.  <br />
<br />
The unstunnable thing is great if your tryin to get off a spell and are having bad luck, but with the sk spells you can hold aggro even if stunned half the fight.<br />
<br />
Slam is really handy but can be cured with 6 aa's.<br />
<br />
Raid buffed humans usually have better stats than me since my intel is pathetic (ogre), but then again, nobody ever has the exact same gear so its all relative.<br />
<br />
*Note: Just dont put points into str or stam...you will regret that one later unless your in banded armor your whole life :) *</div></div><hr />
