<br />
The epic only comes with one slot for an aug item,type 4.<br />
As far as I know type 4 aug's give proc'ing ability.<br />
So if you plan on getting the epic,then placing enough aug's to make it 60/45...not gonna happen.<br />
I'm all for getting the epic,but just get a WMBS.</div></div><hr />
