As in what targets to attack first (I would assume casters), gear to use, spells to mem, etc. I imagine a lot of it is common sense, but I wouldn't mind some advice from those more experienced than I.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Skurrge</div><div class="date">01-07-2003, 02:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, it's common sense.<br />
<br />
For casters, use magic resist armor and for melee use high AC.<br />
<br />
Attack healers first and attack enchanters.  Make your pet and use it and it will help in combatting casters as it will help interrupt the casting.  Everyone else just kill as you can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenadar W'Vern</div><div class="date">01-07-2003, 02:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It all depends on how prepared you are for this large battle.<br />
<br />
Firstly, kill the healers yes.  Especially the clerics.  Its always worth using pumice or cancel magic on Clerics to remove buffs before you lay into them.  Remember they can get an awful large number of hps from buffs.<br />
<br />
Next go for the shammies.  Can be tricky if they have a pet up but again pumice and cancel then lay into em.<br />
<br />
If you know there are enchanters present then dot yourself with disease cloud - stops them mezzing you.<br />
<br />
Always leave your first spell slot open (sap str a green before you buff, then click it off after buffs).  This way any roots etc will land here and you can pumice them off.<br />
<br />
Now you need to move on to casters and pet classes.  If possible fear pets.  May be worth darking Necro pets so you can escape em.  Then just lay into the casters.  Most casters tend to gate when they are getting hurt a lot.  Not sure what level you are but if you can open up with the spear lines on casters they will be shocked to see their hps drop so quick.  Also, pumice em incase they have harmshields up - dont rip yourself apart on em.<br />
<br />
Lastly the tanks.  Depending on whats there you may want to drop Pallys, Rangers or SKs first, then Rogues then Warriors.  Learn to joust - do a search on this forum to find out the details.  A good jousting SK will destroy a Warrior, Pally or Rogue.<br />
<br />
Biggest fight I've been in had about 10 people each side.  Its chaos but damn good fun.<br />
<br />
Good luck, and let us know how you get on!</div></div><hr />
