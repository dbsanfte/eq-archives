<br />
I've done the weakened ghoulbane quest awhile ago but now its time for me to do the named mobs to finish it off and obtain this sword for my own. This post refers only to &quot;Restoring Ghoulbane&quot; as to the previous parts are already posted so keep this thread on topic.<br />
<br />
My three main focuses are:<br />
<br />
Difficulty: What level, arrows, guards. <br />
<br />
Location: Where in the dungeon, what did you pass to get through to it such as an invis wall or a trap pit on the way there.<br />
<br />
Spawn: How long does it take to spawn? Have you seen it, whats your personal experience or what you've heard<br />
<br />
Let us take this blade and defile it to enslaving the souls of the dead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hurst</div><div class="date">01-04-2005, 12:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok I just got to this part... I have my ToV key (or at least on the final step of the access quest {zone in an kill boss mob}). <br />
<br />
I don't mean to stray far from topic (or at least the direction you intended this thread to go  :p ).... but does getting the clickable sword on the wall in ToV yield the Weakened Ghoulbane (with a continuation) or The real Ghoulbane (wuteva it's called)?  :confused:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not 100% sure, though. I just started the Ghoulbane quest myself. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you look in the ghoulbane thread section it tells you of the 3 mobs * I admit I was lazy and didn't look till now  :o  * but Hurst has a somewhat detailed post about this already...delete this post plz, i'll just continue on his thread</div></div><hr />
