<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bogor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am currently looking for a good place for my wife and I to duo. We have been killing in GD behind the giant fort but we are both extreamly bord of it. <br />
<br />
We have mostly been using fear kite tactics which have been working really well for us. My wife being the necro that she is really wants to find a place where the undead are abundant, I just want exp. lol<br />
<br />
Thank you for the help in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Feerot - near ent to Plane of Fear specters to pull from static outside + many inside cave spawns.<br />
<br />
DL pyramids (near druid port in) - Skellies abound and will give descent exp up to 51 (though you need the right pyra mid for the high end)<br />
<br />
Katta Graveyard - Undead spawns triggered by running over trigger points.  Can't fear kite as you'll cause more to spawn then, but undead and a ton of fun if you can get there and out alive (though that may be half the fun)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Reever Darksul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">hmm im not sure its been awhile but maybe the yeti caves in DL would be good for ya, i used to solo there along time ago cant remeber what level i was but it was around 40 im thinkin and they arent social so its pretty easy.<br />
<br />
but like i said this was during kunark so i have no clue how they are now but could still try.</div></div><hr />
