<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Stugein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was looking for a nice easy solo exp spot to work in at 55.  I wanted low downtime and decent exp.  I decided to give Nurga a visit.<br />
<br />
Advantages:<br />
<br />
- Good exp.  Exp seemed to be on par with Tier 2 PoJ on a &quot;per-kill&quot; basis.  Because the mobs have less HP than in the planes I was able to mow through them faster so the exp actually seemed to flow much nicer.<br />
<br />
- Mobs have a wide level range, but are all solid dark blue once you pass the &quot;entrance&quot; rooms.  Absolutely no shortage of easy dark blue mobs at 55.<br />
<br />
- The goblins hit like pussies and die quick.  I was able to go through 7-10 dark blues before having to sit and rest for a few minutes.<br />
<br />
- Stupidly small aggro range on the mobs.  You need to be almost humping their legs to get proximity aggro.  This makes constant single pulls easy as the need to FD split or have someone for CC is rare.<br />
<br />
- Cash is nice.  All the goblins drop anywhere from 6g to 10+pp straight up.  Additionally you can collect goblin skins and Mt. Death salts for selling off in the Bazaar if you don't care much about Chardok faction yourself.  Also, goblins uncommonly drop gems.  After about an AA and a half down there I walked away with 2 diamonds, 2 fire opals, a sapphire and a ruby.  All said and done I ended up with about 1.2kpp in cash and prizes.<br />
<br />
- Random nameds spawn that can drop decent mid-level gear for either useage or sale.<br />
<br />
- Chardok faction ++<br />
<br />
Minuses:<br />
<br />
- Zone is in a slight bit of a remote location.  No convenient place to run to in order to bank/sell/get buffs, etc.  OT Hammer negates this disadvantage quite a bit.<br />
<br />
- Many many casters.  Most of the goblins down there seem to be of some sort of casting class.  Not a huge problem.  My base (crappy) resists negated almost everything and with Resist Disc turned on almost nothing landed.  The annoyance comes when you are trying to pull something and it decides to stand there like a goon and toss 10 spells at you before coming.<br />
<br />
All-in-all a damn fine solo exp zone.  Duo with a healer and you can go non-stop.  Just wanted to post this to give those folks looking for a low-mid 50's exp spot some information on a zone they may not have considered or have overlooked.  As with anything, your mileage may vary</div></div><hr />

To negate the mobs that like to stand their and chain nuke etc what you have to do is run out of their line of sight, mobs will not start casting new spells on you if you're not in LOS, mobs will finish casting any spell they have started though.</div></div><hr />
