<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some suggestions:<br />
- Ranger with Weapon Shield and burn him down 10 seconds in<br />
- Bulwark of Alendor, Spellshield and super high MR are your friend<br />
- Charmed pet tanking <br />
<br />
Now figure out the rest yourself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tank eaten by lifetap?  Aggro loss on transition to 2nd MT?  Failure to control adds?  Positioning issues?  Or just gradually increasing chaos induced by unfamiliarity with the event?</div></div><hr />

We got to Bertoxx finally (2nd try). Warrior was MT and an SK was RT. Basically what happened was, SK was one rounded basically as RT and then all the healers started getting rampage and dropping like flies. We were bound outside ran in and Bertoxx depopped before we all got rebuffed. Im just wondering how to handle Bertoxx's rampage. I know like any other mob but.....This is kinda out of our league atm im thinking. Im thinking perhaps we rushed in too soon after Bertoxx without everyone being in position IE the healers for example. Just not being prepared. Getting to him isnt gonna be a problem. Now its gonna all boil down to rampage and CHchain along with the adds inside of his room. Was utter chaos so to speak.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ashigaru</div><div class="date">03-16-2004, 03:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bertie was the hardest encounter we faced in progressing to the Elemental Planes. <br />
<br />
His rampage is normal single target rampage, but his melee range is absolutely huge.<br />
<br />
This makes positioning him a bit of a pig. What we did, which may not be the best way, but it worked.... SK with HS on, runs up to Bertie, moons him, then runs into the corner neat to the corner where we want him positioned.<br />
<br />
Ranger then runs up to him, Warrior (RT) shoots an arrow to get second spot on rampage list, Ranger weaponshield tanks and builds some aggro. MA then runs up, and once CH chain is humming along, taunts off ranger.<br />
<br />
During this team Bertie's rampage eats me, eats the ranger, then eventually chews into the /disc defensive warrior - this gives the CH chain on rampage tank time to wake up, have a shower, kick the dog, and start healing.<br />
<br />
It isn't clean, it isn't pretty, but I did devise it myself and it works. I'd be interested to see how other guilds do it though.<br />

<br />
In my 'former life' I was a druid. Never used CH on Rampage Tanks in that guild for this event- RT got Druid spam heals only, and if you have at least 3-4 chaining NI you can keep up a tank np. Back then none of us had any Ornate, and we killed Bert before we ever set foot in VT, so that gives you an idea of the gear we'd all have been wearing.  The RT was always a warrior tho.<br />
<br />
So as you can see everyone has their own way of doing this event- they all work but it's always messy with this mob.<br />
<br />
<br />
Don't be frustrated, Bertie has a track record of dinging off raids the first and second times you try him. Getting him positioned (and STAYING in position) is key, as well as people understanding just how damn huge his hitbox is. You can do him successfully 3 or 4 times and then you'll do him and wipe like it was the first time- that's just how this event is.<br />
<br />
<br />
Get his nose in the corner, keep it there. Everyone at max melee. Everyone understanding that if they see Bert's face instead of his ass that they are to turn off attack and back the hell up. Don't kill your DPS off unneccesarily.  People have to understand where Bert will be, and where they are NOT to go. <br />
<br />
Anyone who may have to tank and/or distract (suicide turn him) Bert must be shrunk (actually in those small quarters down there everyone should be shrunk anyways except for those who have to stay tall)- this includes you.</div></div><hr />

heh one rounded?? how many hps he have...like above poster said tho usually dont CH a ramp tank quick heals are best bet.  i was slightly over 8k and we just had a warrior rt bert...im pretty sure we used a defensive rt on bert and MM.  especially with how much vt gear (+veng aob ID effects) our dps was pretty decent for being in the lower planes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Josahd</div><div class="date">03-17-2004, 11:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bert's a little bitch.<br />
<br />
For the lifetapping bastards towards the end of the event... make sure you use DI on the tanks (duh), spellshield is teh win.  And make sure that heal rotation is tight, tight, tight.  A knight isn't gonna tank him well unless he's really loaded with VT gear or you're already elemental.... quad 1500 + 5k lifetap... he can do close to 10k damage in a round on a non-defensive tank.  We usually lost our tanks on this guy at some point, until we got geared up a little more... but usually, unless you got serious adds, if you have enough dps for this event you can zerg him down before he gets you.<br />
<br />
If the problem was adds... there's a pretty simple technique for getting the kings solo (or with only 1-2 adds).  Won't say more... figure it out.<br />
<br />
Bert himself is nasty as hell for a pre-elemental mob.  The huge hitbox makes pulling and setting ramp a pain.  Play around with it some.  Rampage kicked our ass on that fight more than once.  Use a defensive warrior on ramp, not a knight.... not until that knight is elemental geared.<br />
<br />
This really is one of the coolest events pre-elemental.... it's just frustrating as hell to learn it sometimes... 2 hours then a wipe to bert ain't fun.... but really... if you can't handle the lifetap procs... pofire minis are gonna own you.  And if you can't handle the fast paced pulls, you'll never get to spawn the bosses on air avatars or earth rings.  If you get it, the frustration on bert will pay off in the end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Belyle</div><div class="date">03-18-2004, 04:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If its the lifetap guy ya died too, use bards to get tank to 500 MR, and pad him with spell shield and the other spell shield (named ?).<br />
<br />
For bert, pull the adds in his room first and keep em mezzed for the fight, away from the healers.  Wait for em all to spawn before you engage, think there is 6 ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dakkin</div><div class="date">03-18-2004, 06:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Unless your guild's in really good gear, Bert isn't one of those mobs where you can select a knight and give him one druid to heal for RT.<br />
<br />
Make a well-geared warrior RT, start him with furious or whatever that melee damage immunity disc is and put a small team of healers (including preferably at least one cleric) using quick heals on him when he goes defensive.<br />
<br />
If you're still not confident, give him DI too, at least one cast at the start of the fight, don't need organised DI kept up on him like you would for the MT.</div></div><hr />

<br />
True, but unless ya have a tight crew, someone will screw it up and aggro them.  If they get to the healers its over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bagan</div><div class="date">03-20-2004, 05:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Really, there is no reason why you shouldn't use a Warrior as rampage tank(unless you have a warrior shortage for MTing) because it doesn't depend on agro generation, just when they got on the hate list.<br />
<br />
One thing that might help you with rampage is casting BDA on the ramp tank, if your clerics got that AA. We use a &quot;BDA chain&quot; on the RT if we fight, for example, Magmaton with pretty low numbers. Depending on the number of clerics we have there the healers don't have to care about the ramp tank for relatively quite a long time...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ganaith</div><div class="date">03-21-2004, 08:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Positioning of bert is important, true. But you need to SET RT badly at the start. Let the RT fire an arrow. Bert will do his AE thing, then charge. MT pampers him with arrows and gets aggro. position him in corner opposite to camp so clerics can heal from corners and not get hit by ae /weee for blocking ae .<br />
<br />
The key to winning this fight is to get the adds out of the way. There can be up to 12 adds during bertox fight. Have a monk and a sk standing by, training away the adds that pop all the way into south corner, as deep as possible. monk feigns at the end or dies. SK doesnt attack bert (while raid is busy positioning etc) he is ONLY busy looking at the 2 exits so that the adds are NOT COMING BACK.<br />
<br />
You dont want even ONE caster getting aggro (these have a weird aggro range, really. I have nearly walked past em and not get aggro in the king rooms, but once i stepped foot into bert room i had them charging from a entire hallway into the casters. <br />
<br />
The *moment* the adds start coming back (and they will) Pop harmshield, charge into them , run as far back as you can with them, and simply die/fd.<br />
<br />
Bert needs to be dead in that time (3 mins)<br />
<br />
<br />
The last 5k hp tap king is annoying, but it can be done. We didnt use a WS ranger, but our tanks has over 10k pre elemental so far, so we kind of had the advantage there. Basically, he is like RD. eat him before he eats you, really. Max out dps, have a bard sing resist, spellshield, DI..there is just so much you can do. make SURE the clerics know the tank rotation. Set it beforehand. So if MT dies, he wont chew for multiple tanks.<br />
<br />
ToT ROCKS for this, get it with leadership aa.<br />
<br />
KEEP yourself to the MT chain, and you will be fine. Use SL chains, the fight should take longer then 1 minute.</div></div><hr />

Much easier and safer to handle with a classic CC team (2-3 chanters, a knight or two to taunt mezzed mobs and a healer) than by training or kiting.</div></div><hr />

Its a whole load of adds, of which some are pretty tough resisters. I counted more then 15 adds that were on me. One or 2 resists is a hell in there for your chaining clerics.</div></div><hr />
