<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>petras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">K I just dinged Level 54, and well I hate everywhere lol, I checked all the spots that brael listed, good spots yet same crap...I want somewhere challenging, I dont care if I die, I just want something hard and cool to kill...as long as it's possible to kill it, like last night, a friend and I hit up Sol B and went to kill the mob that drops fruity boots (the 9int 9wis ones) quite fun, we got hard beat because of a bad pull, yet still very fun.  Any other places that would be hard for us to do, yet well worth it if we succeed? We we're thinking about PoN lol :), any suggestions? thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>petras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks, never thought about those zones.  We we're considering doing the hole anyways, yet it's good to have it re-ensured that it would be a challenge.  Also,  we are trying to think if we can do some of my epic mobs with the two of us, so far we killed a 50++ druid for his epic, which was rather nice seeing as it was hitting for 180's and I was only level 54 :).  Thanks again :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xikuliz Litecleaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Howling Stones is expensive if you don't have an overthere hammer.  I'm an Iksar, and I usually go there until I can get a port out, I hate drinking gate potions just to get out, and there's no way in hell I can fight through solo, or anywhere deep.<br />
<br />
At 54 your undead lull spell will work on most mobs, and I mostly just tanked things down, speared, tapped, sometimes DOTed, but mostly speared and expulsed undead for the low cast time with spell haste.  It's good XP.  <br />
<br />
When you zone in, find a corner and FD.  Check the spawn layout and see what's floating around the center.  If you can lull one of the entrance mobs and kill the other, then the lulled one.  Under you is a pit full of good XP skeles, and directly under the zone in platform is a portal up to the entrance.  There is no way you could get out solo without some form of gate.  Just a few rooms away there's a mob that I have a hard time dropping with a trio (some big named sperm with teeth).  Get a map and watch out for pits, they are a PITA when trying to progress through the dungeon and ultimately lead to the big zone in pit, which I recommend you stay at if solo.  <br />
<br />
Do what you will, I've had a few CR's here, and have drank a few gate potions to get out, but I keep going back...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gaklaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">soloing sux at 54. if you are on CoV faction you could do CS wyverns and drakes (fear kite)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Seb and CoM might be fun.  And CoM gets hairy at times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Putrid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Highhold keep nobles and guards.  Hard camp to get, but good exp and loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Depending on the class and level of your friend, you might try duoing at the Hedge in PoN, if you're up for duoing.  Mobs range in level between 53 and 55, and it can be challenging when they're even con.  Xp is pretty good; loot is, of course, pretty craptacular.  All in all though, duoing there between 54 and 56 with a Shammy, we had to be pretty spot on or make a dash for the zone out.  I suppose if you're looking for a sadistic challenge, this might not work as there is a zone out very close to where you would set up camp, but I always looked at it as a last resort anyway.<br />
<br />
Seb I think could be very challenging, as well as some of the camps in CoM, some areas in Kael that I've done parts of at around that level (like Icehouse), sections of PoD that would be challenging for a full group at your level, the Grey can be fun (and if you don't have an EB item, a bit annoying), etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>evilspawndark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I find most of the first teirs of PoP rather boring, its Dreadlands outdoor crap all over again.<br />
<br />
For fun and challange you want dungeons  (ie. solb like you stated).  <br />
<br />
So I would try:<br />
<br />
-- Bottom levels of  Tower of Frozen Shadow<br />
<br />
-- Hole would be real fun, especially with the revamp<br />
<br />
-- Howling stones would be ok.  Crawl to Drusilla Sathir, at least theres a port out there.<br />
<br />
-- Sebelis (sp) - screw the normal crap, make a crawl to the Juggs, reets - then maybe can take out the named near trak ( Pujlump ??,  and some big golem guy)<br />
<br />
-- Kaseaora - lay a smackdown at the bottom, kill the named guy. This prob isnt that tough, but something different.<br />
<br />
-- Plane of Justice - forgot about joining the lemmings at the zone out, head down to the caverns. Personally, I never did this - but i didnt even know they existed until to late.<br />
<br />
-- LoY - most dungeons there are basically untouched due to the risk VS reward, but you said you want a challenge. Plenty of named etc.<br />
<br />
-- Western Wastes - bunch of dragons and crap there, you will probably be OWNED<br />
<br />
-- Sirons Grotto - revamped, some new named and drops, head to the bottom<br />
<br />
-- Velkator Labrinth - head down to the kobalds (not the upper town) , named<br />
<br />
-- Acrylia Caverns- some named in here, for harder stuff head into the castle part<br />
<br />
I could prob list a bunch more, but I'm out of Coke and must fetch more...<br />
<br />
Some of this stuff might be to high for you, been a while since i was 51.<br />
<br />
PS.  I'm a retard when it comes to remembering names, and I also talk outta my ass alot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">ToFS wedding room and floor before it...<br />
<br />
Veksar rocks<br />
<br />
go to Perma and hunt Ice Giants (in Perma not everfrost)</div></div><hr />

Actually, with ITU, harmshield, the master key, and a good knowledge of the zone, you can trivially zone out of HS through the south wing.  I've done it many many times.  You can occasionally get unlucky with a mob that sees through ITU, but harmshield can keep you alive long enough to zone out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Burek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Greigs End was a good xp zone for me at that lvl, as long as you have somebody who can single the pull, or split it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Mythicle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">well if you want killer XP and some shit loot except named mobs try out &quot;The Deep&quot; entrance you have to kill 4 mushrooms easily single pulls and the first mob on the right in main tunnel is a PH for a named mob who drops a no-drop mask i just acquired that is very nice for a SK/ all melee. <br />
<br />
but then again if you hate everywhere you can always go re-roll and make a chanter so your life would be much easier and your whining would stop .......... oh btw if you hit 55 and need to ask where to hunt also try pullin mobs from PoV outer camp untill 65<br />
