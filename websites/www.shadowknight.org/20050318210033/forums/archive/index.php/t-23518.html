<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Blackmerlin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Do the sk epic 1.5 mobs that you need to hail to activate them attack you instantly when you hail them or do you start the fight on yourself after activating the mob ?<br />
<br />
If they happen to attack instantly, does hailing while harmshielded work to eat up their harmtouches but keep aggro as long as noone else of your group builds up aggro ? Or do these mobs just switch to the nearest kos player if the hailing shadowknight is harmshielded ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sarrasis Darkmist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1. Yes the mobs instantly attack you when you hail.<br />
2. I imagine the mobs with act like any other mob when you are under HS.  Meaning if your group is close enough to get proximity aggro it will go after them and not you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Elkar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, the &quot;kind of&quot; attack instantly.  When you hail, they actually despawn and respawn a new KOS version instantly.  The new mob then attacks on the next server tick, so you actually can move away with good timing.  HS would work as well, but as warned, beware that you will have low agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Assuming the group is positioned at a distance HS should work. <br />
<br />
This tactic should be fine similar to positioning mobs in their lairs while invuln.<br />
<br />
So long as the raid force or group is far enough away and you are the only nearby the mob will aggro, attack, and follow you just fine.</div></div><hr />
