<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>gohansama</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Or is the SK epic quest complete garbage?<br />
<br />
<br />
I mean epic quest items are suppose to be really good for your class, but when I look at the Innoruuk's Curse I think to myself &quot;I am suppose to do this hard ass quest for this piece of garbage?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
The SK epic is probably the hardest epic to get in the game, only being rivaled by the mage epic, and I just don't really see any point in getting it.<br />
<br />
<br />
I mean my SK has a Windblade, and the Windblade is a much better weapon dmg/dly wise then the Innoruuk's Curse.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh well I'm just ranting. It's like the SK class is completely pissed on. Just look at the recent Gates of Discord expansion pack. The only two things SK's got in that expansion was &quot;jack&quot; and &quot;shit&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Diaar Fuilre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I f you need to ask this Question then you dont need one. &lt;br&gt;<br />
 The point is that you completed it. No it is not the most Uber weapon in the game but I will use  it over my overpriced slow a$$ Windblade anyday.  Whats your Dps with the Windblade you are using I bet an SK with good stats or the same stats as you will do more Dps with  as you say &quot; an SK epic that is Complete Garbage&quot;.  Is that really worth the 50k you spent on it?&lt;br&gt;<br />
 I dont think so. Well enough of this rant.  Go make a ranger they are good at crying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Epics are four years old...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Saruton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Like Catharsis said. You are comparing a Kunark Era weapon with a PoP Era Weapon. And you wonder why the Epic sucks ? :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>yuggoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The only epic really worth getting these days is the cleric one.<br />
<br />
That said, I enjoyed working on my epic.  Took me 18 months start to finish, but it was something I got a lot of pleasure from.  And having 50 friends show up to help whack Lhranc was an awesome experience.  Standing in PoK and having people stop in their tracks and say 'wow what is that?' is an experience you *won't* get waving a windblade around....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I would say that the Bard epic has some uses still, nice proc and it acts as if it is all instruments.  Also, the monk epic isn't bad until you can get some really uber gloves.  The rogue epic is really easy, and 41% haste is still 41% haste.  The first half of the ranger epic follows the same logic as the rogue epic.  For how easy the shaman epic is to get, the stats aren't bad.<br />
<br />
The epics have been surpassed, and rightfully so, but not all of them are completley useless yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>gohansama</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">But see I not a vanity type person. I don't need praise for my weapons. In fact it annoys me to no end when people &quot;OMG what is that chestplate?&gt;:!?!&quot; or something.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And I get around 80 DPS with my windblade.<br />
<br />
<br />
And I spent 25K on my windblade. And explain to me how a 40/45 weapon is better then a 50/44 weapon?<br />
<br />
<br />
Just saying the reward for such a hard ass epic quest such as the SK's isn't worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>ghosteater</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">to each his or her own i guess. to bad you play a game called ever &quot;quest&quot; and not get the whole idea of what it pertains to.<br />
hell there are better weapons than greenmist out there but i still use mine all the time and the added healing it offers is quite nice. i dont see a windblade healing you or stacking a dot on a mob at the same time. not to mention the personal effort put into working on a quest which at least you can say instead of spending endless days in bot or BB is much more worth while IMHO. if your looking for fast thrills and max damage perhaps diablo2 is more up your alley. <br />
<br />
there has been talk of a epic upgrade so if that does happen, at least the ones who have their epics wont be clogging up poa, poh, and pof to rush to get theirs. if this is so, i will sit back and laugh while waving my epic at you sorry souls.<br />
<br />
the test of a true shadow is the suffering of his deeds...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>gohansama</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">D2?<br />
<br />
<br />
lol, I've been playing EQ for about 5 years now.<br />
<br />
I just don't like how the SK class is crapped on. Take the ornate armor for instance. Everyone's ornate breastplate has a good clicky effect, or at least something that is useful, where as the SK effect is Shroud of Death.<br />
<br />
<br />
I mean that just makes me mad. Why do SK's get crapped on so much?<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah I see what you mean about the greenmist though. I have a Longblade of Vitality, but I;m still doing the Greenmist quest. Hell I'm calling it &quot;my Epic&quot; since the real SK epic is too hard for such little reward.<br />
<br />
But still the Greenmist is a badass weapon. Can't wait to get it as soon as they fix the friggin forges.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>tyrrax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The wizard epic is still actually useful too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Grimsouled</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">unless you want to get upset at how poor our epic is :)...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Lets see if I can explain this ... pretend for a minute that you dont buy any of your gear.  You have to loot it all.  All servers started out new, there was some wave of players that had to do just this.  When TP opened, I smithed the banded that equipped the little minions of cabilis, I quested the dreadscale, farmed Fear and Hate, yada yada.  Where were we?  Oh yah, you were looting all your gear, implying you're of the level and content progression to see it.  So here you are, you've just dinged 50 and your guild is hitting old world planes maybe twice a week to gear up.  You've got Velious to gear up for!  There is no windblade because you cant waltz into HoH and kill the mobs to loot one yourself.  That dark reaver is looking ragged and by the good will of innoruuk, a soul leech drops while you almost wipe to Fright!  So, you finish up your epic and, omg, its a big time upgrade.  It serves you well as you exp in Sebilis, get other guildies' epics, and go on your first kael raids.<br />
<br />
Point being, at some point it was an upgrade to someone who did this.  You can either impose this play style upon yourself and work through all content as it was designed, or have it imposed upon you by going to a brand new server where it has to happen (humor me, I know the race-to-time guilds on Stromm bypassed old-world for the most part).  By virtue of levelling fast and buying your gear, you've rendered the epic pointless and essentially content skipped.  You've got no one to bitch at but yourself.<br />
<br />
stfu.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Originally posted by Grimsouled <br />
unless you want to get upset at how poor our epic is :)...  <br />
<br />
I love the berserker Epic...hopefully it will be motivation for all classes to get upgraded Epics.<br />
<br />
Oh, if you go through the effort to do your epic, wouldn't you use it whenever it wasn't a serious detrement simply because of the satisfaction?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tescin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Here's a thought.  I used Black Bastardsword when MTing until recently when I got my epic about 3 weeks ago.  I had a Butterfly Stick (Windblade) but I couldn't stand the way it looked.<br />
<br />
Anyway...  Black Bastardsword is 40/38, 20 AC, and nice stats.  IC is 40/45, no AC, and good stats.  That makes it only a touch slower, AND, you have the proc doing additional damage and healing you.  Add to that an aug like the MMC lifetap aug, and your Mental Corruption, and you are doing similar, if not more damage than Black Bastardsword, and the procs also do well to generate aggro.<br />
<br />
This makes it easier to solo in non-pop settings, and maybe parts of PoJ as well.  The epic has saved my life on more than 1 occassion, while tanking in PoV, our healer died just before the last CH went off.  I was down to 1%, then up to 6%, then down to 1% again, and then the mob was dead, and I was alive.<br />
<br />
Whether you think the epic is worth it or not is a personal decision.  I know that I am glad I completed mine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Laymon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Never have I read through a debate such as this and agreed with every post.<br />
<br />
Yes the epics are all pretty much in need of an upgrade. <br />
Yes the time and effort involved isnt worth it when you can get a better weapon from a single kill or in the baz.<br />
Yes it is worth it because if quested at the right level it will still be an upgrade<br />
<br />
And yes it does look cool - but yes it should be about more than looks.<br />
<br />
I like Catharsis' view, but working for your gear isnt feasible when your the only one doing it. (who wants to join a raid and see your gear it 20 levels behind everyone else?)<br />
<br />
I, personally would join a server that had no player trading. No bazaar and every item is no drop (but can still be sold to npc traders).<br />
You had to work for every piece of armor and weapon</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>gohansama</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">yeah, but I have a nice 125 DD aug proc on my windblade.<br />
<br />
<br />
And if you don't use weapons based on they look, you're crazy.</div></div><hr />
