<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Averse</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">According to the warrior in our group who did these fights with me,  If you disarm the NPC SKs you have to fight their hits seemed to go from 800s down to the 500s.  I cant verify it since I wasnt the MT, but be interesting to see if this is true.  I also noticed upon looting that Falmont had a 2 handed hammer or something...should try disarm on him as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Arikash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you can disarm something that hits for 800, I'll give you a pat on the back, I think the highest thing I've disarmed is a HK guard =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Not everyone's disarm is capped as low as ours, though... regardless, it does sound highly suspect to say the least.  Mobs' damage isn't generally based on what they're holding - it's just a value inherant to the mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">In either case, they're pretty easy to tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Arikash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I know, but I thought he was talking about disarming it himself, and was like &quot;there is no way that's gonna happen&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I know, I'm dubious of that as well.  Could be that after a disarm, he just never noticed a higher hit than 500.  Also note that when you loot these mobs, some of them have disarmable weapons, some have nothing on them but the head.</div></div><hr />

Disarmable CRAPPY weapons.  I don't buy it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I miss the days when you could hand a quadding enemy a fine steel greatstaff, and he would then proceed to only double attack.<br />

Well ok, not really, it was a stupidly cheesy way to win a fight, but it was funny the first time.</div></div><hr />

I have the same thoughts.  That's why I posted here to see if anyone else noticed this or if those trying the fights later on can look into it as well.<br />

Arikash,  ...&quot;According to the warrior in our group who did these fights with me&quot;  First part of my post.  I guess you just read too fast /grin.</div></div><hr />
