Yeah, my bad, i wrote that up quick, I didn't mean it to come off that way. That was aimed at the moron that wrote whatever it was i just read; not americans in general. While i have found that a lot of the Americans i've personally met were morons, so are basically 90% of the people that live around me, so I'm not saying that americans are any more retarded than anyone else in the world. Every country, city, whatever, has their own share of morons that shouldn't be allowed to reproduce, obviously whoever wrote my original quote there is one of them.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
I'm bored again, so i'm gonna tell the story of the most retarded Americans i've met so far (again, not saying all americans are this stupid, they can't, be.... they just... can't).<br />
<br />
I was out driving in the country-side (I live in Saskatchewan, Canada, for those that know where that is and what its like), when I saw two guys with american plates (I think it was Texas plates, though I can't say for sure, it was a while ago) standing on the side of the road, with a bigass map, beside their car. Curious, i got out, and asked them if i could help them find whatever it was they were looking for (I get bored a lot, you see...). Anyway, they told me they were looking for the ice (this story takes place in june or july, it was summer, and it was hot as a motherfuck out), and that they hadn't found it yet. So, me being me, I asked them if they had a compass, to which they replied, &quot;yes.&quot; So, i told them to get back in their car, and just keep taking roads that will take them farther and farther north, don't even need to use a map, and that sooner or later, they'll pass over a hill and there before them will lay the great glaciers of Canada, and there will be Eskimos and Igloos on them. I told them they'd only have to drive straight north for about 8 more hours to reach it.<br />
<br />
They said &quot;Oh, wow, thanks so much!!!&quot;, and drove away.<br />
<br />
This is my story of two American's retardation, told just because... well... i felt like it. Not saying anyone else in the US is this stupid, just saying that these two morons are probably in the same IQ bracket as whoever wrote that egotistical quote. Now i've said my piece, have a good day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Androsulach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well, rumor has it that if Bush is re-elected, it could be the death of the Democrat Party as it stands, which is a good thing IMHO.  Then we have only 1 party to kill off, the Republicans.<br />
<br />
We have the largest elected government, but the fewest parties in office.  Look at most of the European countries, they all have more than 2 parties that are represented in parliament.  We have 2 in Congress.  Imagine what things would be like if there were 4 or 6 parties in Congress.  I think that would change fillibustering in a major way.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Naelyn- Having spent much on my life in the mid-north U.S. I'd have to say that I guess Canadians see alot of dumb Americans.<br />
<br />
I remember as a child taking a car trip around Lake Superior (a wonderful experience if you ever get the time) and my father being pulled over shortly after we entered Canada (Onterio I believe).  He wasn't doing anything wrong, the police officer just saw our U.S. plates and wanted to make sure that we understood the speed limits were in kilometers not miles.<br />
<br />
Another funny Canada story...<br />
I took my then girlfriend now wife on a trip around Lake Superior and it was her first time going to Canada.  She was really really excited about seeing a moose as she grew up in Chicago and loves wildlife but has never been out traveling in wilderness areas.  I tried to temper her enthusiasm by telling her there was now garauntee that we'd see moose.  &quot;It's not like you cross the border and you automatically see a moose&quot; I said.  Lo and behold, right after we cross the border a moose runs out in front of our car...<br />
<br />
Androsulach - also please note that the two parties we do have represent a much narrower ideological range than anything you see in European countries.  The purpose of this is laid out in the Federalist Papers where Jefferson lays out that the power should be kept from fringe opinions.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Kerry supports what he thinks is best for public opinion at the time - his voting record doesn't reflect his stance on issues, because he has no stance.  <br />

Quite frankly, both parties suck.  Washington sucks.  Sacramento definitely sucks.  Throw em all out.  Get rid of the money that puts these jerks there, because they no longer represent the common man.<br />
<br />
One thing everyone better realize...we are the little guys, and no one, not Bush or Kerry gives a flying shit about us.  It won't matter who gets elected, because Industry runs this country.  You don't take care of industry, you're gone in four years, or assasinated.<br />

Hit the nail on the head, Slein.  The apathy of the average Joe Six-Pack makes it so easy for those career moochers to keep sucking the cash out of our pockets.<br />

Personally, I've been voting Libertarian since 96.  I don't agree with every plank in their platform, but I really like the idea of returning the Federal government back to the strictures of the Constitution and the immediate ceasation of the War on Drugs.</div></div><hr />

Carroll, an eye surgeon from Waynesville, Mo., sat at his desk during a rare slow night last Wednesday and called up a digital photo on his laptop computer. The image was of a brain opened for surgery earlier that day, the skull neatly lifted away, most of the organ healthy and pink. But a thumb-sized section behind the ear was gray.<br />
<br />
&quot;See all that dark stuff? That's dead brain,&quot; he said. &quot;That ain't gonna regenerate. And that's not uncommon. That's really not uncommon. We do craniotomies on average, lately, of one a day.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We can save you,&quot; the surgeon said. &quot;You might not be what you were.&quot;<br />
<br />
Accurate statistics are not yet available on recovery from this new round of battlefield brain injuries, an obstacle that frustrates combat surgeons. But judging by medical literature and surgeons' experience with their own patients &quot;three or four months from now 50 to 60 percent will be functional and doing things,&quot; said Maj. Richard Gullick. <br />
<br />
&quot;Functional,&quot; he said, means &quot;up and around, but with pretty significant disabilities,&quot; including paralysis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Androsulach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Well, some are likening the War On Terrorism to the Crusades.<br />
<br />
Seeing as there have been a number of Islamic holy men who have blessed or at least condone a Jihad against the West, it's only fair to make like the Crusades, only this time, we should be playing for keeps.  Of course, if the church had done that 1000 years ago and snuffed out Islam then and there, we'd have a radically different world picture.</div></div><hr />

Well, Jefferson also said the Constitution needed to be scrapped and rewritten every 50 years or so.  By the time of the War Between The States, commonly called by the Yankee name of Civil War, it had been just over 80 years.  The South had taken Jefferson at his word there, as well, seeing Jefferson said that a revolution now and then was a healthy thing and they didn't like the increasing power of the central government, something even the Founding Fathers abhorred.  We all know what happened there.  Even if only the Cliff Notes version of events.</div></div><hr />

A Bush Grenade on Defense Spending <br />
<br />
Candidate: <br />
President Bush <br />
<br />
Images: <br />
Soldiers advancing on a desolate battlefield; tanks, missiles and fighter planes disappearing one at a time. <br />
<br />
Audio: <br />
As our troops defend America in the war on terror, they must have what it takes to win. Yet John Kerry has repeatedly opposed weapons vital to winning the war on terror: Bradley Fighting Vehicles, Patriot missiles, B-2 stealth bombers, F-18 fighter jets and more. Kerry even voted against body armor for our troops on the front line of the war on terror. John Kerry's record on national security: troubling. <br />
<br />
Analysis:  <br />
While the votes cited are accurate, the Kerry campaign says the senator voted for every one of those weapons systems – and 76 more – at other times, or more than $4.4 trillion in military spending. Kerry aides note that Vice President Cheney, while defense secretary in the George H.W. Bush administration, proposed a long list of weapons cutbacks, including elimination of the Apache helicopter now being used in Iraq. <br />
<br />
That began a period, as the Cold War was ending, in which both parties sought to trim defense spending, and most of the Kerry votes in the ad are from those years. But Bush aides point out that some of the votes are from the 1980s, when the struggle with the Soviet Union was at its peak. <br />
<br />
Kerry never voted specifically against body armor and had criticized the president for sending about 40,000 troops to Iraq without the new generation of sophisticated armor. Body armor was contained in Bush's $87 billion request for Iraq and Afghanistan, which the senator opposed as a protest against the administration's Iraq policy. (He earlier supported the $87 billion – the subject of another attack ad – if Bush's tax cuts for the wealthy were dropped.) <br />
<br />
The ad keeps stressing the &quot;war on terror,&quot; though many Democrats say the invasion of Iraq had nothing to do with terrorism and the administration has never proven a link between Saddam Hussein and al Qaeda. Local versions mention that some weapons are built in such states as Ohio, Michigan, Florida and Maine. The spot is part of a sustained campaign to erase the image of Kerry the Vietnam warrior and replace it with that of a soft-on-terror lawmaker. <br />
<br />
From the evil liberal media propaganda outlet, The Washington Post.<br />
<br />
<br />
So asshole republicans tacked tax cuts for the wealthy onto a bill for money Iraq. This is kerry's fault how? So if sony gave us defensive, but made up a leather class, if you said that's fucked up you're against us getting defensive. <br />
<br />
Why do you hate shadowknights so much Brael?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Yep, I knew about the tax cut's that doesn't change a thing.

Thats the type of guy I REALLY want in office it can be Spain part 2!</div></div><hr />

Every four years you sit around and argue about who will be the most benefit to you forgeting the fact that no matter who runs your country, somebody somewhere is going to get an assfucking by them while the whole time giving you, the voters, the biggest assfuck.

You think that the idea of Manifest Destiny doesn't play a role?<br />
<br />
We don't call it that much anymore, but it's engrained in the American psyche.  America does what it feels entitlted to do, just a Manifest Destiny dictates.  Most Americans won't talk in the terms &quot;Empire&quot; because they see America as eventually pursuing benevolent ends, rather than grabbing  power for power's sake.  But the idea, the actions, the instinct of Manifest Destiny is still present in all U.S. diplomacy.  With the distinct exception of Kenan's &quot;x&quot; papers which prevented and enemy from gaining power.</div></div><hr />

What strength are you speaking of?  Militarily?  Fiscally?  Spiritually?  Does the United States of America have larger Pectorals than everyone else?  IF you are going to try and make an argument at least try and formulate your opinions based on fact rather than rhetorical drivel you spoonfed, uninformed, jackass.<br />
<br />
*Edit:<br />
<br />
And Keevel, I do agree with the fact that Manifest Destiny is part of the American psyche.  However, the practice has not been used since the 1850's and as you and the article stated most Americans would not admit to being Imperialists.  <br />
<br />

Different name, same results. Whereas before empires wanted to take over the other countries and make them a part of the whole, nowdays we realize that's an unnessary headache. Capital is easy to move, and that's all we're after anyway. So with IMF, not-so free trade agreeements, and robber barons in the whitehouse, we can focus on building profits for multi-national corporations.</div></div><hr />

More rhetorical drivel.  Just because you say something is good, it doesn't mean that it is true.  That's like arguing that Moon-men exist with your main premise being:  because they do.  <br />
<br />
Furthermore, I never said that your country sucks.  I just went as far as to say that you are mostly unintelligent and quite self-absorbed.  Many good things have come out of the United States.

Japan - benefited from newer factories thatn the rest of the wrld when the U.S. built them for them after WWII.  <br />
Argentina has had multiple depressions, and currency changes in the time period being evaluated.  <br />
China's average yearly income was less that $3000 (equivalent) until the mid 90's and has yet to show staying power, though I'm not doubting it could.  <br />
Luxembourg has suchs a huge population difference with the U.S. that comparisons don't really stick, however over the same time period the U.S. has show a larger % of GDP growth, which is amazing considering it's easier to get a large % of growth from a smaller country (a $100,000 increase in a $1M ecomony is 10% whereas that same amount in a $1B economy is 1%, etc. - See the so-called &quot;Tiger Countries&quot; of the early 90's for comparison).<br />
Switzerlands largest Industry is banking and will always prosper as long as someone else is.  I'm also trying to avoid making remarks regarding Jewish wealth hidden there by the Nazi's since Switzerland has repaid proven claims on a regular basis.<br />
<br />
edit: the purpose of my analysis is just to show an un-fair comparison.  Anyway your comment was not needed, even if the U.S. is all powerful, the real questions that should be analized are:  At what cost?, Was it worth it?, Should the U.S. continue this policy?</div></div><hr />

Everyobody complains about Politicans. Everybody says they suck. Well, where do people think these politicans come from? They don't fall out of the sky. They don't pass through a membrane from another reality. They come from American parents, american families, american homes, american schools, american churches, american business, and american universities. And they're elected by American citizens. This is the best we can do folks. This is what we have to offer. It's what our system produces, garbage in, garbage out. If you have selfish, ignorant citizens, your gonna get selfish, ignorant leaders. And terms limits aint gonna do you any good, your just gonna wind up with a brand new bunch of selfish, ignorant Americans. Thought maybe, it's not the politicans who suck. Maybe something else sucks around here...like the public. Yeah, the public sucks. There's a nice campaign slogan for somebody, &quot;The Public sucks, fuck hope&quot; Because if it's really just the fault of these politicans, then where are all the other bright people of conscience? Where are all the bright honest, intelligent Americans ready to step in and save the nation and lead the way? We don't have people like that in this country. Everybody is at the mall. Scratching his ass, picking his nose, taking out his credit card from his fanny pack, and buying  a pair of sneakers with lights in them.<br />

<br />
I would have to say that the benefits of Canada outweigh those of the United States.  That is why I will choose them to represent the rest of the world as a better alternative than the U S of A.  Canada is the best in the following categories:<br />
<br />
-Life expectancy<br />
<br />
-Educational achievement -- adult literacy plus combined primary, secondary and tertiary enrolment<br />
<br />
-Standard of living -- real GDP per capita based on PPP exchange rates. <br />
<br />
(based upon the United Nations Human Development Index (HDI) which measures health, education, and wealth of each nation's citizens.)<br />
<br />
Canada ranked higher than the United States in all of these categories which I believe makes it a better country than the United States.  Second on the list was Norway, again another country that is better than the USA.  <br />
<br />
Other than the UN's observations, I would also like to point out lower crime rates (especially those related to firearms), less pollution, flapjacks wherever you turn, the largest body of non-WWII-surrendering-French-speaking people, and friendliness.  You will probably say something to the effect of &quot;Well then get out you pinko-commie if you think this country is better&quot; but, I believe it is my job as an American citizen to make the right changes around here to make this a little less of a crap hole.<br />

Its ignorant you moron...but honestly, I have pretty much stated no opinion at all in this thread.  There is nothing to agree/disagree with.  You're just coming off like a moron/asshole and giving all the &quot;US ARE EGOTISTICAL IDIOTS&quot; people all the proof they need to continue stereotyping us as egotistical idiots.  Whether you mean to or not.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u95"><b>Phoenix Connection</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p95">wow, you won an arguement with someone on a message board.<br />
<br />
Actually you didn't win. I chose to end it because arguing with you in like arguing with a brick wall. You hear nothing, and are too self absorbed in your opinions to listen to anyone else. And the second anyone tries to have a debate with you, you quickly lash out the unnecasary insults. Insults are for children. We are adults, or at least I hope you are, because only children insult each other when debating opinions. Or complete fools, like you just might be. I refuse to argue with people who just have to insult the other half.<br />

<br />
But still a round of applause for our main man, mutton. He has suceeded in winning an argument on an internet message board. Congradulations.</div></div><hr />
