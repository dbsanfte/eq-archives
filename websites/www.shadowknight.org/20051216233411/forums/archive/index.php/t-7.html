<br />
  So.. yes :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ardrick</div><div class="date">03-22-2002, 06:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">im thinking that Greenmist OWNS in ssra too</div></div><hr />

I plan on farming the faction myself when I hit 52 and get that new pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bludge</div><div class="date">03-23-2002, 03:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ogre Rallos SK's need not apply.  We cap our factions in Cabilis at indifferent and apparantly amiable is needed.  That in and of itself would lead me to believe that either the Greenmist will not be part of any major &quot;all race quest&quot; for SK's or that they will tweak the factions later.  Either way, I suppose I'm done for now :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jobrill</div><div class="date">03-23-2002, 04:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would guess it's an oversight, Bludge. After all, Quellious Human Monks couldn't do the shackle quests either (they capped at Aimiable) til that was changed. Bring it up to Dev Corner.<br />
<br />
Myself, no question I plan to try the quests. I did Bone chips up to dubious with most factions as my bard, and I will do the same as Jobrill, and have been Greenmist or no Greenmist.<br />
<br />
And with how sweet the Greenmist is, I woulda started if I hadn't already...</div></div><hr />

There is no reason to do this exept give the iksar another &quot;perk&quot;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bludge</div><div class="date">03-23-2002, 11:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, Mozo is a Warrior.  Crusader Quarg is on Scaled Mystic faction (shaman) and Crusader Bodli is on Crusaders of Greenmist (SK).<br />
<br />
There's a whole forum for this one item.  Check the guide in there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tazok</div><div class="date">03-23-2002, 11:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anyone have any idea if a Troll Shadow Knight who worships Cazic-Thule can get to amiable with the right cabilis factions, or is my faction capped at indifferent as well?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Skurrge</div><div class="date">03-23-2002, 12:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think the factions are capped anymore, meaning that if you go ahead and try and hand in bonechips to Trooper Mozo you should be able to raise the faction past any kind of old &quot;cap&quot;.  I think I remember Nocifer talking about this with some other quests around Norrath and I found that this was holding true to raising Cabilis faction as well.<br />
<br />
Also, Greenmist is very worth it.  If anything, you will leave all other non-Iksar SKs a bit slackjawed that you managed to get it. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pensuarr</div><div class="date">03-23-2002, 04:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Getting the faction up to amiable has got to take an excruciatingly long time to accomplish though.  Being just a casual player, I doubt I could dedicate the time to do the quest.<br />
<br />
However, the sword is pretty PHAT and I'd love to have one.  I just couldn't do the work innvolved in getting it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dregor Thule</div><div class="date">03-23-2002, 04:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I still get capped faction at warmly with Legion.</div></div><hr />

All factions have a max cap at the high end and the low end. <br />
<br />
There used to be a faction cap that would keep you from increasing all secondary factions once you had maxed the primary faction from whatever action you were taking.<br />
<br />
There was a change over a year ago that would allow you to continue to get secondary faction increases even if the primary was capped.  If you ate a death to the primary faction, I believe it freed up some &quot;room&quot; under the faction cap so you could continue working up the secondary factions, but I never tested it.<br />
<br />
For instance, turning in bone chips gives<br />
<br />
+Troopers of Cabilis<br />
+Crusaders of Greenmist<br />
+Scaled Mystics<br />
+Cabilis Residents<br />
+Swifttails<br />
<br />
Prior to the change if you hit the cap on Troopers of Cabilis, turning in more chips would not increase any of the others even if they were still far below their cap.<br />
<br />
So, when I started turning in chips, I had already maxed my Troopers faction at Indifferent.  However, I could still turn in chips and get + hits to the other 4 factions.  Unfortunately for a Rallos Ogre, they all capped at indifferent.  Scaled Mystics and Crusaders of Greenmist started off I am estimating 50 faction points lower than Cabilis Resisidents and Swifttails as they did not hit indifferent until I turned in another 200 chips.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xilr</div><div class="date">03-25-2002, 11:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is good news that some of you cant complete Greenmist.  Hopefully that means its not goign to be required for Epic V2.0</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">An_Ogre_SK</div><div class="date">03-25-2002, 12:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Does anyone know what the faction needed to do the pennance quest is?  I have heard that this can be done at dubious and will give a big increase in faction for doing, but can't find any confirmation on this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Syfon</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 11:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sebilis quickly maxes the first faction but I gather it takes ALOT of bone chips to up the other factions neccessary.<br />
<br />
I heard a rumor about bone chips being sold on a vendor in Luclin. Is this true to anyone else's knowledge if so that would make an INCREDIBLE difference for this quest, lol.</div></div><hr />
