<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Howlitoezis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Have you guys taken a look at the Sony Paladins class board?<br />
There are more posts by warriors (and their supporters) saying knights are perfectly balanced, than there are paladin posters.<br />
OK, slight exageration, but not much of one.<br />
Remember, Paladins and SKs will likely get similar melee upgrades, if they get any at all. While warriors have generally backed off from commenting here and on the Sony SK board, their posts, and resistance against knights recieving much needed upgrades on the pally boad affects us just as much.<br />
It's time a for a nice cup of STFU for the fucking warriors.<br />
Certain warriors, who at one time put themselves forward as sympathetic to our cause, have also shown their true colours as well.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Howlitoezis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You know, I'm reading more of thepally board now, and getting a bit pissed off.<br />
Even the warriors who agree somethign needs to be done say things along the lines of:<br />
&quot;Knights should be at a bit of a disadvantage.&quot;<br />
WTF<br />
We should be able to do the same job, but do it differently, not the same job with a number of restrictions, the same way or differently, but a lot worse...<br />
<br />
If we arent MTs, then by god give us the tools to do our offtanking role in a CLEARLY superior manner than any other class, including warriors.<br />
The warriors are drunk with their god complex power, and its a joke to read their rationalisations on why you and I should suck.</div></div><hr />

Defending their turf until they are the undisputed only tanks left in the game.<br />
I wont bother with trying to get them to not post on the pally board. Thats the pallies job, and SoEs job, to keep warriors from totally derailing any train of thought they have concerning fixing their class.<br />
Not sure how to hurt someones feelings over teh intarweb (tm), but i guess its worth a shot :\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">One Falicy of EQ I hate is SK's getting the &quot;opposite&quot; of pallies.  It just doesn't work right. Opposite of thier focii, opposite of thier abilities.  Leaves them able to heal, group heal and avoid damage while tanking while we get resisted and the ability to avoid MELEE damage if we drop out of the fight.  Sounds cowardly not evil.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">/agree- figure out what our basic 'theme' is, what our basic role is, and design spells and abilities around that.  Don't design an ability that works for a pally then give us the opposite.  Some things have been good- zev bite is an excellent, well thought out abities... like ZB.  Others are pretty sad... lifetaps are rediculously underpowered and don't even equal the total hp 'swing' of a pally's heals... cast slower, and have twice as long of a recast.  As a result, our base healing ability is less than 25% of a pally's healing ability.... actually it's worse than that when you consider the number of heals/group heals they can chain cast.<br />
<br />
It seems taps are balanced around their DD portion, and as a result, the only thing they're even sort of good at is damage output- but with the current balance of melee weaps vs spells, they're not even much good for that.<br />
<br />
Lifetaps need to <br />
1)  have a 1 sec cast time (max).<br />
2)  have a 5 second recast time (max)<br />
3)  Get a decent boost in base size<br />
4)  We badly need aa's that improve the heal portion of the taps significantly.  This is through both crits and something that directly affects the size of the heal, like healing gift, only *larger* (like 50% boost to heal portion, or larger).   This would bring us into the neighborhood of 60-70% of a pally's self healing ability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>vilesoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Really, I think it's about time we call for defensive to be removed from the game.<br />
<br />
If us, and pallies make a lous enough scream, maybe they can be the gimped ones....but that won't fix a damn thing, so just ignore this post entirely....I needed to rant about the whiniors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Defensive ain't gonna be taken out of the game at this point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Androsulach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">We need to get the Paladins and a number of the other classes to start screaming for a major nerf on Warriors.  They won't get rid of Defensive, but we might roll back some of their innate mitigation and/or their damage output.  They aren't supposed to be the only tank in the game.  If the devs have lost sight of the fact that there were 3 tank classes, it's time to remind the masses that we're supposed to be tanks and that since SoE broke the game, that they must FIX the game.  Either they give the other 2 tanks the same innate mitigation or pump up our DPS.  Personally, I think we deserve as well as NEED that 5% innate mitigation boost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Vincente</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">My fellow geeks and nerds, lend me your ears!<br />
<br />
Do not cry out for nerfs! Do not wish ill of other classes! Instead, demand for improvements of our own class.<br />
<br />
Bitter anguish will only get you sweet sweet apple pie...but not the goal you wish to accomplish! Unless your goal is sweet sweet apple pie, then yeah, bitter anguish will get you that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Warrior damage output is fine.<br />
<br />
Our spell output is a bit lower than it should be, and our pets are a bit less durable than they need to be.  Those 2 adjustments should bring our dps in line with where it should be.<br />
<br />
Innate mitigation is a bit stickier.  We do have an AC advantage with Aura of Pain.  It doesn't make up 5% on most stuff, and it doesn't do much for damage spikes, but it's there.<br />
<br />
There are 3 tank classes in the game.  All need some adjustment to bring the relative balance to where it should be.... especially SK's as we have no way to compete with warrior discs or pally stuns/heals.  But none are earth-shakingly broken at this point in time.<br />
<br />
I'm hopeful we'll get some type of disc to alleviate our problems in OoW.  The spell lineups I've seen so far aren't encouraging... they're keeping the same, if not increasing the tanking gap between SK's and pallies.  I'm crossing my fingers for an aa based solution that'll help with our healing abilities in OoW... but I'm not holding my breath.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>aress</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">warriors know that we need a lot of help.  That's why they post mostly on the paladin boards, they know the pally is the more powerful tank, and a thread to their class vision.  The new paladin stuns bring the paladin a huge boost in power, and warriors know that.  They try everything possible to block paladins.<br />
<br />
When asked, that their behavior also hurts the SK, the usual response is &quot;/shrug, I am sorry, I know you guys need help, but we cannot let the paladins get such upgrades&quot;<br />
<br />
Bottom of the line:  We SK will not get any true power upgrades, because of the paladin/warrior argument.  After OOW the paladin will do fine, widening the gap between pally and SK immensily.  The last nail on our coffin.  Forget about getting even an exp group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>vilesoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Jesus, some of you guys don't read my posts....I mentioned in the last part &quot;it owuld not fix anything...ignore this post...&quot;<br />
<br />
...I was jsut ranting on how annoying the whiniors are, they are practically the prince, and the hybrids are the whipping boys, and they are still acting like they have it bad.  I know defensive won't be removed...it would be amusing if it was...but we all know warriors will ahve a shitfest and try to lag out PoK in some server again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Feriin Cydovu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Who cares really.<br />
<br />
<br />
I care . I play this game to be a tank. I still tank on raids , but only when other tanks are afk or dead. I hate being a last pick for tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Androsulach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Well, seeing as the Warriors are into cockblocking the Paladins, then we need to end around them and do what we can to grab the ears of some devs to get US some serious loving. I can't help but feel that as a Shadow Knight, I've become the red haired bastard step-kid that gets the finger pointed at me because the other kids were fighting and I'm the one with the sore ass and the grounding.  That's not the situation I want.  We need to get sneaky, do what we can to stealthily call attention to the fighting that takes place, and see if we can get the prize by doing it the right way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kahntun Derstand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Why are you guys even responding to a level 40 Shadow Knight?  He has absolutely zero perspective on what our issues are at this moment.<br />
<br />
I don't agree with calling for Warrior nerfs either.  That should never be the solution.  However, I think we all realize that something needs to be done.  Hell, my guild has lost our top 8 Warriors (over the last 6 months) to extreme burnout.  If SoE doesn't spread the tanking roles out a bit to the other 2 tank classes, the only Warriors left in the game will be 2 month old powerleveled newbs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Have you guys taken a look at the Sony Paladins class board?<br />
<br />
No, I have enough drama in my life...<br />
<br />
Don't be so paranoid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Why are you guys even responding to a level 40 Shadow Knight?  He has absolutely zero perspective on what our issues are at this moment.<br />
<br />
Sorry Kahntuhn but the tanking, mitigation gap shows clearly in the late 40's.  The agro isn't an issue at that point yet, but the mitigation is across the board and is noticable at that level.<br />
<br />
I agree with the rest of your post though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Lynxal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">With all the available gear for level 40s I would be surprised that level 40s have much of a problem tanking anything and the larger apparent gap would be in the twink level of the level 40 more so than the warrior mitigation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Assazzin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I dont believe in a nerf either, but for christs sake this should show our dismal lag behind the two other classes that tanks. I would ask for a clear role in groups/raid as has alreay been said, and the spells to back that role up. Let at least some of our spells land on mobs, some maybe, not like 2 taps??? <br />
<br />
Crazy Idea inc!! Change our leech curse to add a damage mit% with a short timer that would be of use in groups? Off tanking would be less of a last choice and its group friendly. :confused:  :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">With all the available gear for level 40s I would be surprised that level 40s have much of a problem tanking anything and the larger apparent gap would be in the twink level of the level 40 more so than the warrior mitigation.<br />
1) There are not severe problems tanking current content<br />
2) Warriors get the same gear as SK's <br />
3) Content 40+ is changing (see Nurga, Droga, Old World Planes, Mob HP in LoY) and stagnating a class while everything else and other classes (Seee warrior across the board mitigation) scaling up at those levels is irresponsible<br />
4) While they can tank the content it is noticably easier with a warrior - why ignore the early warning signs of full scale issues just because the symptoms are worse only in the high end?</div></div><hr />
