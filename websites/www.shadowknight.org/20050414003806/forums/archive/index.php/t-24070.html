<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Oniel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I tried to do as much research on this site as I could before posting.  I realize there are many many threads on this topic, but finding the answers to my questions has not been easy.  So I appreciate you all taking the time to help me out.<br />
<br />
I created a Human SK on TZ and have obtained the level 24 just recently.  My main is a 66 Cleric also on TZ.  I made the SK because in my travels with my Cleric I filled up a locker full of SK gear and I have experienced many deaths at the hands of SKs so I want to learn about this powerful class and have some fun dishing out some damage.  My SK is a kinda-twink and I have some money to play with.  I am working on a magelo for my SK and I hope to post it soon so you can see how I have progressed.<br />
<br />
From all the threads on this site, I have learned that a SK at my level should concentrate on the following in order of importance:  AC/HP/STA/INT.  Did I get that right?  I am not sure where STR fits in.<br />
<br />
Now onto the basics.  I know how to solo, I know how to fear kite, and I know how to off tank.  So I am not looking for answers to those kinds of situations.  What I am looking to learn is what is my role in a duo situation or in a full group situation when I am the main tank.  Let's assume that I am grouped with no Warriors or Pallys.  Let's assume that I am in a group where I have to be the meat shield at all times.<br />
<br />
Am I more of a warrior or more of a Necro?<br />
Should I be casting, siphoning, and DoTing while I fight in this group?  This is what I do now and it seems I am always out of mana.  I know to use fear and darkness to keep aggro but do I also use taps, siphons, and DoTs for more DPS? <br />
Does all this casting actually lesson the amount of DPS I can do since all toons actually stop swinging to cast?<br />
<br />
My questions are all based around DPS and Mana efficiency.  My groups always do well in battle but I am always out of mana.  I am wondering if I am casting too much and wasting mana while I should just be controlling aggro and hacking away.<br />
<br />
I am trying to make this question as narrow as possible to get away from very broad answers.  Books can be written on strategies.  But what I am looking for is advice on how to be efficient when my group is looking for me to tank.  I believe I have a very good grasp of what to do when I am solo or when I am the off tank.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your replies.<br />
Oniel, Lvl 24 SK</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You are a tank<br />
<br />
You are a puller<br />
<br />
A necro is DPS (not our strong suit don't waste mana on spells that aren't efficient for agro ules you have the mana to burn)- you are not DPS<br />
<br />
A Warrior is only a tank - you are not just a tank<br />
<br />
Learn to pull (after 30 FD is life changing)<br />
<br />
Don't worry about spells effect on DPS.  <br />
<br />
Just cast only agro spells and spells needed for pulling.  After a few weeks of that you'll know if you have extra mana for taps and stuff (you will, but now you'll know how much)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>The Truth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">when the group starts out, and I have full mana, I generally go nuts with it. : /<br />
<br />
I widdle it down to about my last blue bubble, and try to keep it at that.<br />
<br />
personally I try to keep aggro, and the ac tap at the top of my casting list. if I have any mana at all, it goes toward these two spells(or three, in cast you need to use a no damage spell, like fear. otherwise I just use Clinging darkness for now). if I have anything else to work with, I lifetap.<br />
<br />
in xp groups I never have that much mana to waste. it generally stays at around 10 or 20 percent for hours, because eventually you know that good xp groups dont stop! as a cleric I magine you're generally at FM if the group is going good, at least at 66.<br />
<br />
it's true that sk's almots never stop pushing a button during an xp grind, even at lower levels.<br />
<br />
so dont be too upset about never having that much mana to throw out at anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'd much rather hover at 80% than 20%.  If you're hanging at 20% mana, and something goes wrong, you don't have the mana to deal with the situation.  If your healer goes down, you've only got a few lifetaps in you, or whatever the situation may dictate.  If you've got 80%, you're in a much better position to deal with an adverse situation... Blow your mana at the end, not the beginning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Oniel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">So is everyone in agreement with:<br />
<br />
AC/HP/STA/INT<br />
<br />
Does STR factor into this line-up or is STR after INT?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rynix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Was there not too long ago.  I go with spells to increase my tanking ability, like siphon str, the att recourse, etc.  I would pull with a bow in order to save my already low mana for emergencies.  Use a 1-H? and shield when tanking.  Hit CD for snare only at this point; you need to save what mana u have at this point, later when your mana pool gets better use can use it for aggro.  Focus on tanking pure and simple, but remember you are an SK, you have more tools to work with than a warrior, so make good use of them.<br />
