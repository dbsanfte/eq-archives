<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>SweetMeef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a Greatstaff of 4 Winds atm. <br />
I'm about to be Sol Ro flagged once I drop Saryn.<br />
<br />
1) Should I bother with a type 4, given that I will eventually be EP (next few months hopefully).<br />
<br />
2) If so, which? I imagine that a weapon upgrade in the future is quite possible, but I don't see it happening any time soon-soon; so I thought a mediocre type 4 may help out a bit.<br />
<br />
3) If &quot;NO&quot; to 1): I also have Secrets of the Planes and 8th shawl; I thought about tossing the guk FT2 type 7 onto either. Do you think this is wise or think I'd replace either of those any time soon once I get SolRo/EP.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the advice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't think you should waste your points with a type4 at this point.<br />
<br />
Go ahead with the FT2 type7 aug, but make sure it's an item you don't see yourself upgrading for a long time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nixpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ive had the same problem... spending alot of APs on an aug and then upgrade the item you auged is a pain :eek:<br />
<br />
My advise would be throw in a low cost aug just for the heck of it. Spending 40 - 100 APs isnt a big deal and I love procs so... :D<br />
<br />
Anyway, remember to do what you find fun!! Its a game and should be enjoyed as such (imho).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Once you get into SolRo there are a couple 2 handed upgrades, once you break into Earth you can get a SEWS from the Mud Ring. Probably just best to leave the aug out until you get a weapon you wont be upgrading for a good long time, Like the SEWS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Just get the 100pt cold DD from everfrost.  It's dirt cheap, even if you don't keep the weapon too long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>SweetMeef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ended up going with the 75 pt DD from EF for 100 AP. Cheap and fun. I proc for 75 a lot more now (since the GS4W procs a 75DD as well). Thanks for the great suggestions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Squigle D'Muerte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Actually the 50 pt DD from Tak costs 40 points that is less than one adventure if you just want to have something.  I got that while I saved up for a better one.</div></div><hr />
