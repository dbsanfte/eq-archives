<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>voxr zimslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am a lvl 50 DE sk. In reading other previous posts I have learned that the Greenmist is the result of many quests. My faction with Iksar is crap at them moment. Two questions: 1. Do I need to try and get faction up or can I get an &quot;illusion of Iksar&quot; cast on me instead? 2. What is the name of the first quest at which I need to start?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You need to have amiable faciton for most of the sub-quests, if I recall correctly, so I don't think iksar illusion will quite be enough.<br />
<br />
The first quest is &quot;Crusader's Test of the Pawn&quot;<br />
<br />
Just scroll through the walkthroughs stickied at the top of this forum, or do a search and you'll find a lot more information.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A way to test this would be to make a Dark Elf mule, cast Illusion Iksar and see how he makes out inside the city faction wise.<br />

<br />
Being simply non-KoS is not going to be enough to do the Khukri quests--you need to have &quot;amiable&quot; faction with Crusaders of Greenmist faction (SKs) in order for them to do this quest with you. If you can use an illusion spell to boost your faction with them, you might save yourself some time, but I don't think it's going to be enough to get you from scowling or dubious to amiable.  Let me know.<br />
<br />
You may be able to start the Greenmist quest before you are amiable to the turn-in people,  but by the time I had my items, I was at least amiable to them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I did a lot of research into using the Iksar Illusion's.<br />
<br />
I may be wrong, but I read on another post, that Illusion Iksar is enough to get you to indifferent, but still scowling with the Necromancers.<br />
<br />
It works fine with the Necro's.</div></div><hr />
