...but the fact remains that I, after three years of playing EQ, still have no idea if, in fact, there is a way to trigger the AC in Sro or if it is completely random.<br />
<br />
I've seen so many &quot;ideas and rumors&quot; about how one goes about getting him to spawn, but it always seems that just as I'm about to give up on the spawn (after 4 hours of trying all those rumors), he pops.  The point is I don't want to sit around killing greenies for 4 hours if I don't have to and I'd like to equip my entire mid-level guild with these wonderful boots (don't worry, when they start to hit 50 I'll be on the Run3 push).<br />
<br />
My thought is this spawn is completely random and I'll just have to log the 4 hours each time until everyone has their boots.  Please correct me if I'm wrong.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Konradd</div><div class="date">05-05-2002, 07:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This was written by one of my fellow guildmembers :)<br />
<br />
Someone brought up an interesting idea a while ago about the Ancient Cyclops spawn in S Ro. What he told me is that there are several “trigger” mobs in the zone that are all part of a cycle or list. In other words, when you kill one of the mobs on the list, another mob on that list spawns somewhere in the zone instantly. The reason I find this to be a possibility is because the same system is used in other places in EQ. <br />
<br />
I went to S Ro after he told me this and found a mob on the list he gave me. Sure enough, another of the mobs on his list instantly spawned after I killed the first one I found. So I killed the second one, and sure enough, the cycle was working. I know that there is more than one cycle. I believe there are 3 or more because sand giants were on the list, and I have seen up to 3 of those at once in S Ro. <br />
<br />
Now I want to give you my theory on how these cycles choose what mob will spawn next. I could be wrong of course but just let me throw this out to you. First of all, think of it like a slot machine. The big pay outs are much more rare than the small pay outs or no pay out at all. I believe that these cycles work close to the same way. I’ll explain in detail how.<br />
<br />
In EQ, I think there are random number generators running all the time. When EQ needs a random number, it pulls up the number that the specified random number generator was on at the precise moment that the request is made. I’ll give you a scenario. <br />
<br />
At the moment when the game says “I’m going to spawn a mob at location +500.00, +345.62, +20.98 from list #43”, it has to decide what mob on the list to spawn. So it then pulls up the number that the designated random number generator is on at that moment. Let’s say that in this cycle, there are 32 mobs on the list of possible spawns, 31 of the mobs would be placeholders for the AC. Let’s say that the random number generator runs random numbers from 1 to 32,000 constantly. Now the computer says “hey random number generator, what number are you on now?”. The random number generator says “Dude! I’m on number 12,432 man!”. The computer then thanks the random number generator and promises to buy it a cup of coffee later. <br />
<br />
Ok, now we have some numbers. 32 mobs on the list of possible spawns for location +500.00, +345.62, +20.98, which is designated as a spawn point for all 32 of the mobs on list #43. And we now have a random number of 12,432 at the moment the computer asked for a random number. Now, because there are only 32 mobs on the list and 32,000 possible numbers, we have to get a number between 1 and 32 somehow. And since they want some of the mobs on the list to be more rare than others, there has to be a way to regulate it. This is accomplished by taking the remainder of dividing a multiple of 32 into the chosen random number. Let’s say they choose to use 256 as that number. 12,432 divided by 256 equals 48 with a remainder of 144. <br />
<br />
Most mobs on the list are assigned several numbers between 0 and 256. Let’s say, for example, they designate the Ancient Cyclops as number 23 on the list for cycle #43. And let’s say that a ghoul is number 14. The AC has to be a rare spawn, so they assign only 1 number to him. A ghoul is not very special so they may assign several numbers to him. Let’s say that the ghoul’s numbers are 210, 35, 98, 114, and 36. When our random number generator does the math and gets a remainder of 114, a ghoul spawns. Now let’s say the AC is only assigned one number, and that number is 76. That means that the remainder of the division of 256 into the random number chosen has to be 76 for him to spawn. So you see that the ghoul has a chance of spawning 5 times greater than the AC does each time a mob spawns from list #43. These numbers are, of course, not the true numbers they use in the game I am sure, but it gives you a good idea how the whole system works. That is if I am correct, which I may not be. <br />
<br />
In OOT there is only one spawn point, but there is a list there, just like in S Ro. So the whole random number, division, remainder thing is in effect there also. Remember that EACH TIME a mob spawns, the random number that chooses which mob to spawn can be any number within the limits. That means that it is just as likely for it to roll out the number 144 three times in a row as it is to roll out 3 different numbers in a row. <br />
<br />
I have personally sat in OOT for 14 hours without ever seeing the AC. But, I have also personally killed him in OOT 3 times in less than 1 hour. In my opinion, the system that I am explaining to you explains how that is entirely possible.<br />
<br />
Following is a list of the mobs in S Ro that I know to be on one or more of the cycles that the AC may be on. I am sure there are more but I can’t think of them right now. Kill one and another should instantly spawn. If you don’t see one of the mobs on this list within the sand area of S Ro, then start killing stuff that is different from the norm. Don’t worry about the dervs, they aren’t on the cycle. Look for mobs with “a” added to their name when normally that mob doesn’t have an “a” in front of the name. Also vice versa. Look for mobs with one word names when normally the name is two words, drybones as opposed to dry bones for example. And kill anything else that seems out of place.<br />
<br />
A sand giant<br />
sand giant husam<br />
Terrorantula<br />
a young ronin<br />
Erg Bluntbruiser<br />
a sand mummy<br />
a rattlesnake<br />
a giant rattlesnake<br />
a ghoul<br />
a dune tarantula<br />
desert madman (not “a” desert madman)<br />
a zombie<br />
Scrounge <br />
a jackal<br />
a mummy<br />
a drybones skeleton (not a dry bones skeleton)<br />
Obretl<br />
<br />
When a mob is killed it &quot;triggers&quot; something to spawn every time. What I mean by this is that it can either be an instant spawn, or the death of the mob triggers a timer that later spawns another mob. Whether it's the same mob or not depends on if there are other mobs for that particular spawn place or not. Killing Nagafen &quot;triggers&quot; the timer that will then respawn him like a week later. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vistol</div><div class="date">05-05-2002, 10:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have also seen the idea about pumas and desert terrantuals.  This one seems pretty accurate.<br />
<br />
What it says, is that a group of either those two will spawn.  Say, a group of 4 pumas will spawn.  You can watch track and see this happen, they'll also most likely all spawn at the same spot.  Once you kill all of these, the next spawn group will load.  This could be anywhere from 1-6 pumas or terrantuals.  A sand mummy is one of the rares, as is Hussen and the AC.  Killing these should spawn it.<br />
<br />
Here's a posting from the Tunare board from someone who's hunted it a lot.<br />
<br />
<br />
*******************************<br />
<br />
I retired from AC hunting at around 40 rings acquired, all from SRO... only sold a handful, sold some super cheap to friends, and rest went as freebies to others, etc...<br />
<br />
I've heard every silly theory as to how the AC in SRO is spawned, and double and triple checked each and every one of them. FINALLY, with my druid alt in tow, I started marking what spawned immediately after the AC died... and tried to track what I killed just before his spawn. The pattern narrowed and narrowed to a certain point. I then killed ONLY those mobs, and BOOM... AC. The AC is a Very Rare spawn on a certain spawn cycle. The Cycle is as follows...<br />
<br />
COMMON: Pumas and Desert Tarantulas (spawn in groups of 2 and UP)... the next set on spawn cycle will not spawn until you've killed all mobs in spawn group.<br />
<br />
UNCOMMON: Sand Mummy (single mob)<br />
<br />
RARE: Terrorantula<br />
<br />
VERY RARE: Ancient Cyclops<br />
<br />
Example of a normal day in SRO hunting the AC... yes I've done this with no one else in zone to interfere many times.<br />
(THIS IS AN EXAMPLE FOLKS!)<br />
<br />
Kill all pumas and desert tarants to start, then see what spawns... <br />
group of 6 desert tarants spawns, chase em down and kill them, when last one dies...<br />
group of 4 desert tarants spawns, kill them all...<br />
group of 4 pumas spawn, kill them all<br />
group of 8 desert tarants spawn, (**whoops, 2 pumas spawned while killing tarants... HMMM, let's NOT touch those and see if they are part of cycle after last tarant is killed**), last tarant is killed and 4 more pumas spawn... guess those 2 are an odd spawn to be ignored...tends to happen at times, kill em or ignore them.<br />
kill the 4 pumas, more desert tarants, rinse and repeat...<br />
**Sand Mummy spawns (HEY!!! NO more pumas or desert tarants are spawning at ALL. Let's wait a bit on the sand mummy kill and see if he's related). 5 minutes go by, kill the sand mummy AND...<br />
group of 4 tarants spawn.. (WOW, amazing what logic can do), kill the tarants, more pumas, then tarants, etc...<br />
Sand Mummy again, kill him, another Sand Mummy...<br />
more pumas and tarants, kill last spawn of group cycle...<br />
Terrorantula spawns... Hmmm, let's wait a few on big &amp; ugly, Guess what, NO MORE pumas, tarants, or sand mummies, damn logic again!!! Kill Terrorantula and...<br />
more pumas, tarants, occassional sand mummy, kill kill kill...<br />
<br />
BOOM!!! Ancient Cyclops... Run over and beat the crap out of him. For giggles, CHECK TRACK!!!<br />
<br />
NO PUMAS, NO TARANTS, NOT a THING at all... None are spawning. Well hell Captain, logic does win at the end of the day.<br />
<br />
Ancient Cyclops dies...<br />
<br />
Hushed moment of anticipation...<br />
<br />
PUMAS!!! Holy crap, let's try this again (repeat for about 20 more AC's to validate theory into a bed of solid steel).<br />
<br />
I've done this so many times it is ridiculous... if you do NOT believe me, test this out for yourself.<br />
<br />
Mobs that do NOT HAVE A DAMN THING to do with the AC:<br />
Any other named, Sand Giants, Tower, etc...<br />
<br />
Bogus theories:<br />
Killing tower mob at certain times: bogus<br />
Killing only undead: bogus<br />
Killing (insert named singles here): bogus<br />
Killing everything in zone that moves: Works, but only because whoever is camping is eventually running over the placeholder mobs I've listed above.<br />
<br />
JERKS and WEENIES:<br />
Those that just sit on a hill while you bust you ARSE chasing down all the placeholders for HOURS on end. You do the work, they reap the reward. I've lost a few AC's in my time, and I don't MIND someone else getting the rat bastard, just as LONG as they are out there killing the placeholders, or at least blindly wiping the zone... they are at least putting forth the effort. I give those that work a big cheer, grats, and keep on struttin until I can get an AC of my own. <br />
The hill-sitters, who just watch track, or scan the horizon line, make me wish to stick a sharp pointy object up their rear end repeatedly until they die slowly. Sorry if I sound a bit vehement, but it's one of the reasons why I retired from the AC circuit so to speak. <br />
<br />
On one occassion I had an individual tick me off enough when I politely asked him to come help kill mobs, that I pulled a Sand Mummy, hauled him to the far bottom corner of the zone behind a tree, turned my back on him, camped my druid and left Birgit standing there to take an occassional 5 point hit, and left the computer for a long long time. No PH kill, no AC, rot in hell hill-sitter. Hope you enjoyed the long wait of nothing at all. If I ever do camp the AC again for a friend, etc..., and catch you blowing bubbles on a hillside, I'll do the same thing again, watch a movie and chuckle while you rot in endless hell.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aaedan</div><div class="date">05-06-2002, 10:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well.. my advice:<br />
<br />
After spending a couple of days in SRo at around lev 45 and not being able/wanting to drag a tracker along for such a boring quest and obviously not seeing any AC I decided to give up and wait till I was lev 50+ and go do the AC in OOT. <br />
None of the 'theories' for SRoare proven and everyone you ask will probably say something different, so the bottom line is you just have to kill everything you see to have more respawns and have a higher chance of getting the AC.<br />
If you are lev 50+ and still don't have jboots I would just go and camp OOT. At least you will make exp while waiting. Took me around 22 hours of camping over 5 days and made half a level of exp. Pain in the butt, yes, but at least you don't feel so bad if you are making exp :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Groobash</div><div class="date">05-06-2002, 11:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's not random...one of my guildies has been farming the AC lately and just got #50 recently. It seems to take him 2 or 3 hours each time. I don't know how he does it tho...he and I are not fond of each other so he won't tell me. LOL<br />

He sells the MQs or does them for other people in the guild.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thats how I got mine:D <br />
<br />
After several hours killing anything that moved with a couple guildies and seeing no AC, pretty much gave up on it. A couple days later, heading to feerrott, I zone in to hear giant foot steps walking my way. I had just enough time to assist it to make sure he wasn't taken, and mem fear befor he started hitting me. Turns out that there were only four &lt;20s in the zone at the time:D <br />
<br />
If you want to trigger the AC in Sro, go in totally unprepared and not even concidering the possability that he might be up:p</div></div><hr />

Basically a group of friends of mine sat in S Ro with a modified showeq build on for a week nonstop and parsed out the pops and how they happened, and this definitely corresponds to what was said before with the &quot;placeholders&quot; but it gets more specific.<br />
<br />
I've done this and I get 3 hour pops always. Have gotten 30 or so rings on about 60 pops<br />
<br />
~3 to 5 mins after you kill the, some of you might cringe, south east semi sunken tower trigger (NOT A PHOLDER) an event occurs. I'll get to the event later. It is obvious that this is a TRIGGER type mob because if you kill it, another one spawns on an exact timer and an event always occurs ~4 later. I don't have the number on the exact timer, I'm not at home Its ~18mins if i recall right. It is *not* a placeholder because it can be up while the event is up (if you leave a named spawned, for instance). If the event is up, you will not get another event until you kill the pholders.<br />
<br />
What are the pholders, then? Well, all SEQ evidence points towards it being ***NOT Tarrantulas and pumas and trash*** you will get a faster spawn if you keep those ALIVE.<br />
<br />
The reasoning for this? There are about 20 events that have a % chance of occurring 5 mins or so after that thing dies. Some of these you don't want, for instance you don't want &quot;group of tarantulas popping&quot; as your event. You don't want &quot;pumas popping&quot; as your event. <br />
<br />
The pholders are the named SG, named ORC, terrorantula, and those wandering weirdo mobs with the &quot;a ____ ___&quot; added or removed.<br />
<br />
Out of ~400 sw ruins pops in a week there were 9 ACs that popped. All of them were around 4 or 5 mins after killing the SW trigger mob, and out of the 9 that popped 6 of them popped with untouched junk mob in the zone.<br />
<br />
We mostly saw junk spawns in this timeframe, it's unavoidable and boring.<br />
<br />
So while it's true that the druid who pulled the pholder out of the way and let the hill sitters sit there was really denying the AC pop, it's false that everyone must clear everything. That just serves to pass the time, and even though time might go by faster because you're killing stuff, you're just adding possibilities to what event might occur.<br />
<br />
Half my rings are gotten during off hours where noone is bothering to clear everything that moves... I get a much higher % of nameds spawn then, as per my guide =/</div></div><hr />
