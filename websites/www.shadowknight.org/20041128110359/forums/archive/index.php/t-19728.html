<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>angarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey, I did look at other threads before I posted this, so please don't flame me =) <br />
<br />
I'm looking for a place to box my 65 shm and 55 sk. My main goal is XP for the SK, as I want to get him to 60 ASAP. <br />
<br />
SHM has all lvl 65 spells except no LDON spells. He's wearing some ornate and can buff himself to about 3k hps. SK has ornate boots, and a War Marshall's Bladed Staff. Buffed he hits 5k with virtue.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have seen Droga and Veksar sound like good options, I have spent some time in Veksar, but found that breaking the shopkeeper's room was difficult. SK was only 49 then though hehe.<br />
<br />
I'm wondering if there are any other places I can look, or if Droga/Veksar is my best option... <br />
<br />
First, I was wondering about the frogs in PoS... SK could snare, shm slow and dot them all to hell. Would this be good xp for the SK?<br />
<br />
Second - Could I duo sk and shm in Nightmare or Disease effectively?  Shaman has Q for heals, but would SK dps be enough to make killing there worth the while?<br />
<br />
<br />
I appreciate any hints you can offer for my situation, thank you<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Weenie McMeenie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I play 65shm and 65sk it's going to sound boring im afraid but when i was duoing at around those levels i found that velks, chardok were easy but slow. whooped thru the kills. worked quite well<br />
<br />
PoJ basement is probably the best for you up to lvl 60 as mobs give better xp and are quite easy kills, trouble is it can be camped quite often.  For sure you can tank PoI, PoN, PoD well enough but things will slow down considerably as mobs have many many more hp's</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ramgar SK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You best bet for exp is get into a fast pulling PoJ group.  <br />
<br />
Try the flies in PoD.  They are equivalent to PoJ mobs.  Plenty for a duo to pull.  They hit light, and have few hitpoints, and are pretty whimpy once slowed.  This has my top vote for getting you to 60 quick just 2boxing.  You could probably fear kite them with your sk, and just have the shammy back him up.<br />
<br />
Velks should be fine for you, lots to pull and easy kills.  The lack of exp here is made up for by the sheer number of kills you can do.  Spiders start going light blue at 61 I think.<br />
<br />
Droga has great loot but a lot of casters.  Level ranges 55-58ish.  You shouldn't have any problems here, just invis and move to where you can find a good spot.<br />
<br />
PoN should be good for you, but depending on your tanking skill, you might need to heal a lot even with slow.  The mobs hit pretty hard here.<br />
<br />
The Veksar goblins were pretty easy for me at 58 2 boxing my enchanter.  I just tapped for heals and was fine.<br />
<br />
Torgiran Mines is another of my favorite spots, but kinda out of the way.  Zone in from Nadox and set up in the hall outside the fake wall.  Lots to pull and several named here.  Exp isn't that great, but it's ok.  More of a loot spot than anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dester</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Try the Hole (down by the old ruined city, just bring a gate potion for SK or get his OT hammer), Plane of hate (though you need a port up exp is good till about 58 - 60). OS, or any Teir 1 planes<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nzab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">When i was PLing my Shadowknight with my shaman i did Velks from 45 to 60...yeah it was boring but whenever it got too boring i just did a LDoN adv..they are pretty killer Exp on hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grarg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">When I was Pl'n my SK at 55 i went to POI.<br />
<br />
Mainly cause it was easy to pull singles and if you were a little bit carefull no adds.<br />
<br />
And if you do *achem* miss that heal 8)<br />
<br />
Its easy to get a cleric to zone into POI and rezz you and toss you a virt, as opposed to having to extract yerself from a dungeon and try and get a rezz.<br />
<br />
Its easy to get to.....<br />
<br />
Cash drops are shite, so the kiddy trainers avoid it......<br />
<br />
Mobs dont run.........<br />
<br />
You can do the old Dot/Dot zone out and back in if you want to speed the process.<br />
<br />
But i found at 55 ruppie puppie couldnt KS me, so i would weap up the doggie and pull, slow and go to sleep 8)<br />
<br />
Only pain in the butt was the occasional guild raid zoning in and killing all of yer xp mobs, but they never stayed long, and you could soak up the ae buffs.<br />
<br />
Rowf! rowf rowf!<br />
(Now with Grargh toooooo!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Oagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Undead in Nadox is blue to 65.  Gems drop enough to make it profitable, and you pop a named occasionally for decent loot.  The Furious are also decent xp, but lt blue to the shaman.<br />
<br />
I camped at the ledge going down the tunnel to the undead.  2 mobs there and first 4 or so inside the room.  Capt. spawns in 2 of those places, and the first mate will sometimes spawn, too.<br />
<br />
One wanderer to worry about.  Sick doggie on it if it adds.  Zombie skins for pottery, too.<br />
<br />
XP is not that bad, and actually pretty good for the sk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>angarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thank you for your replies, I will certainly check most of them out =P<br />
<br />
I'm now 57 on the SK, I have had success in GE, killing with SK out of group from SHM.  Fairly safe, not too difficult to CR, and fairly good cash drops.  Made around 5.5k in 90 mins last night (named drops and gems).<br />
<br />
I think I will give PoJ Basement a swing, that sounds like a good idea.  I have gotten a number of upgrades for my SK, so he can tank decently.  Hardest part is how long it takes to kill mobs.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Followup question - <br />
<br />
Are there any good places to box SK from 60 to 65 with a 65 SHM?  or when I hit 60 will I need to start relying on groups again?  I really like to be able to just do my own thing sometimes...<br />
<br />
Thank you!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Hunga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">In PoN, try the hobgoblins at the ledge at the east side of river.<br />
<br />
You can get 1-2% normal Troll xp per kill if you leave shaman out of group.  Even at 59, you get 1% xp per kill.  They also drop diamonds and ethereal parchment which will be helpful once you get to 61.<br />
<br />
Shaman should be able to keep up with healing with just Quiessence.  Play around with offensive spells, I could get the SK xp with 90% consistency if shaman only casts one blood of saryn and epic.<br />
<br />
Note:  Getting there for the first couple of times can be tricky, especially 2-boxing.  So get SOW and try with SK first.  Also, if you see people crossing the river, get ready to run.  Most people are unable to cross the river without training you.</div></div><hr />

I am 60 &amp; 2-box w/ a 54 cleric,  and I get 1-2% XP  normal per kill, and thats w/ the cleric in the group.</div></div><hr />
