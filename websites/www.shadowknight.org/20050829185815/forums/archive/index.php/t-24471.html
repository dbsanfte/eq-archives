<br />
Was working on a Tirranun raid this morning...<br />
<br />
Got through Version 1, got through the adds, working on Version 2: Ancient Protector....<br />
<br />
have a question about managing the adds to help us the next time we try it....and looking for a nudge in the right direction...<br />
<br />
a) are the adds timed, and unlimited in number? like the adds for RZ in tactics....where we should be burning the named and figuring out how to kite/offtank the adds while he gets burned?<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
b) are the adds at % of life triggers? like the adds for RZ in time....where we should hold dps on the named while the adds are killed?<br />
<br />
obviously we could figure this out on the next attempt in 3+ days, but i'd rather have a nudge in the right direction so that we go in next time with a clear and focused strategy...<br />
<br />
my hypothesis is (B), but again i'd like a nudge if someone who has done it can advise...<br />
<br />
PM me if you dont want to post it...<br />
<br />
thanks in advance...<br />

<br />
they despawn once it dies.<br />
<br />
Just deal with the massive debuff properly, and you should have no problems.<br />
<br />
good luck.<br />
<br />
BTW.  Sword that dropped for us was kinda cool looking, but it really sucked statwise. Let a warrior have it for a toy or something  :cool:</div></div><hr />

SK.o is not a spoiler site, especially on new raid content. If you want information, use in game tells or PMs, there are plenty of people that don't mind helping.<br />
<br />
The reason we don't post spoilers is that for many (most) of us, figuring out how to beat something on our own is what makes the game fun.<br />
<br />
In the future please use thesafehouse.org or similar sites.</div></div><hr />

I didn't think they were boobies, I thought he just took a-lot of steroids to beef himself up.</div></div><hr />
