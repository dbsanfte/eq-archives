This seems to be a coldain ring - like quest that require faction work for both Seru and Katta, and iirc last rewards give you a &quot;key&quot; allowing you to entre the arx to kill Lord Inquisitor Seru.<br />
What I find interesting is the stats on the 4th earring:<br />

You say, 'Hail, Torsten Reidan' <br />
Torsten Reidan says 'Oh, hello there. Sorry I didn't notice you before I was thinking of an old friend. This used to be his room. I guess no one else has been assigned to these quarters. <br />
You say, 'What old friend?' <br />
Torsten Reidan says 'His name was Bregun Dorey. What a funny little halfling he was. He had a good heart and worked hard. That is up until one day he just started acting odd, very nervous like he was hiding something. Then all he would talk about was Bixie Treats and then show off some weird heirloom charm bracelet. His time for the question came and due to his odd behavior he was sent to Marus Seru. I sure wish I knew how he was doing. <br />
<br />
Head out to Marus Seru and fine Reotho at one of the Recuso camps: <br />
<br />
<br />
You say, 'Where is Bregun Dorey?' <br />
Reothe says 'Bregun Dorey... I have not heard that name in many years. I will never forget it. He was very unique, always running around with an odd metal hat on. He swore that it would keep out the mind probing magics of the Question. I know where he was last seen, and I will tell you if you help by getting us some [supplies]. <br />
You say, 'What supplies?' <br />
Reothe says 'Get me two Bark Potions, a Spring Crystal, and a Harvest Crystal. I will tell you where I last saw him headed. If you buy them in Sanctus Seru do not tell them you are giving aid to the Recuso or you shall be prosecuted as well. <br />
<br />
<br />
Head back into Seru, get him what he wants and hand it in: <br />
<br />
<br />
Reothe says 'This is great! We can treat our ingured and have something to eat for weeks. I can vaguely recall Bregun heading towards the Lair of the Netherbians. You might ask a guard there if they have seen him. <br />
You gain experience!! <br />
<br />
You say, 'Where is Bregun Dorey?' <br />
Legionnaire Dalini says, 'Yeah maybe I know Bregun. You know, I sure am thirty with all this guard work I am doing. I know what I want, some Dawnshroud Cider! Yeah, go fetch me a cider and we will see if I remember anything when you get back. <br />
<br />
Vantak Mere sells Dawnshroud Cider for 52pp at loc 830, neg 600 in S.Seru. <br />
<br />
<br />
Legionnaire Dalini says, 'Ahhh! That is the stuff! Yeah I saw the halfling with the crazy hat. He runs around in the caverns, hanging out with the Troglodytes. It seems he somehow befriended them, I guess they enjoy his madmen antics. <br />
<br />
You say, 'Hail Bregun Dorey' <br />
<br />
Bregun Dorey says, 'Trog trog trog trog?' <br />
<br />
You say, 'Trog' <br />
<br />
Bregun Dorey says, 'Ha! What are you talking about?! Strange thing you are. Wait a minute, come closer. Are you from Norrath? <br />
<br />
You say, 'I am from Norrath' <br />
<br />
Bregun Dorey says, 'I thought so, you armor looks to be made from things found not here. Have you heard of Rivervale? <br />
<br />
<br />
You say, 'I have heard of Rivervale' <br />
<br />
Bregun Dorey says, 'Good. <br />
<br />
Say 'Good' and he he will respond and tell you he wants 4 Bixie Crunchies. When you give him the crunchies you get a bixie charm give to torsten and run back to dorey again handing himt he note torsten sent <br />
<br />
[Thu Feb 07 06:37:52 2002] Bregun Dorey says 'Trog trog trog trog? ' <br />
[Thu Feb 07 06:38:01 2002] Bregun Dorey says 'Hahaha! Silly Torsten. Always snooping over my shoulder. Well I have nothing to lose... take this to him, it's directions on how to find the Journal I kept. I hid it where no one would look! Haha! Trog trog trog! ' <br />
[Thu Feb 07 06:48:00 2002] Torsten Reidan pulls out a hollow book entitled 'A Detailed Look at Etiquette and Proper Grammar' and opens it to find a journal placed inside. 'This is astounding. The information in this journal is invaluable and must be brought to the others attention. Take this insignia. When you are ready to help us further seek out Euzan Jurek, tell him you were sent by me, and he will tell you what you can do to further our cause. I can not tell you more than this, but keep the insignia close to you for now.' ' <br />

[Thu Feb 07 06:53:04 2002] You say, 'torsten sent me' <br />
[Thu Feb 07 06:53:05 2002] Euzan Jurek says 'So Torsten has sent you? He must see the potential within you to help us. I cannot give you any information right now as to who we are. That is a trust you must [earn]. ' <br />
[Thu Feb 07 06:53:23 2002] You say, 'how do i earn yoru trust' <br />
[Thu Feb 07 06:53:23 2002] Euzan Jurek leans in and whispers to you, 'Let it be known that assisting us will show your distrust in everything this city stands for. If you do not want to get involved I urge you to walk away now. However if you wish to [bring about change], stay and I will tell you how to earn our trust.' ' <br />

[Thu Feb 07 06:53:50 2002] Euzan Jurek says 'Good, you must do something for us. One of our members, who needs not be named, is due to be called for the Question. We need you to go into the Heart [Consillium] and replace their records with this one. This false record shows that they have completed their Question and still have time until their next one. Changing the records will make the question pass over us so that we avoid being discovered. Go in stealth, when you have completed this task bring me back the original records and your Insignia Earring. ' <br />
<br />
saying consillium gets you a general response everyone tells you <br />
<br />
Give the replacement files to the File Cabinet, you get back the old records and a guard spawns and attacks you, I got killed but no matter still had the records. Take the old records to Euzan and he rewards you with the 2nd earring. <br />

Tilbok Furrunner is located @ neg144, neg1971. <br />
<br />
He is in the large castle on the second floor. <br />
<br />
Tilbok Furruner reads through the report, hands you a small satchel then starts to explain, 'Finally news from Euzan. I knew that it would take a long time to get planted within Seru, but i still worried about their mission constantly. This report shows that you have earned trust from Euzan, so I in turn will show the same trust. Euzan and Torsten were placed in the city for information. They are deep undercover and risk their life everyday. Every person in that city is ingrained with the [purpose] of either destroying Katta or converting his people.' <br />

You gain party experience!! <br />
<br />
You say, 'what purpose?' <br />
Tilbok Furrunner says 'The teaching in the city is that Katta feigned his death to blame it on Seru. When in fact Seru actually poisoned Katta. The crusade that Seru leads is false and must be stopped. We must gain access to Seru's [chambers] and destroy him and show the city the truth. <br />
You say, 'what chambers?' <br />
Tilbok Furrunner says 'We do not know much about Seru's Chamber, that is what we need you to find out. This will require great effort on your part. We need you to head into Sanctus Seru and bring back reports from each Consillium. I do not know who will have these reports, and I have only heard rumor that they exist. Return to me with the Satchel full, and your Etched Earring. <br />

We must take [action] now. Do not underestimate the power of Sanctus Seru for what they do they feel is right. ' <br />

Ask her about the [Arx Key] she will no doubt ask in your service retrieving it. I salute your service to the city and wish you well. ' <br />
<br />
[Thu Feb 14 23:03:59 2002] You say, 'what arx key' <br />
[Thu Feb 14 23:03:59 2002] Lcea Katta says 'The Arx Key, yes. I have read the compiled reports that have been brought to us and it seems to gain access to Arx Seru you need four shards, one from each Praesertum leader. When the time is ready each leader inserts their shard into the door of Arx Seru at the same time, and they are transported within the building. We need you to retrieve the four shards. When you have done so seek out Elnerick Augustleaf, and tell him that you serve Katta. His powers over the arcane are great and I believe he can form the shards into a single master key. Once you have received the Arx Key, place the seal given to you by Elnerick and your Runed earring in this jewel box and give it to me. I eagerly await your return. ' <br />

If it is arcane knowledge that you seek you have come to an excellent place to study. Not only do we have wondrous magical resources available at the Magus Conlegium but the teachings of Tsaph Katta are well known to all of our citizens and aid in preparing the mind for the freedom of thought and mental and emotional discipline needed to become a great wizard.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drooska</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 08:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">and from here, once you have the 4th one and the key, make a load of Seru Bane weapons, kill Seru, and hand in his head for the Godly 5th Earring...<br />
<br />
No I haven't done this but there are a lot of threads over on Safehouse.<br />
The early earring are pretty poor. Note that the difficulty of the quests rises very sharply - have fun collecting those reports.<br />
<br />
Also to start these quests you need Katta faction and SK's and Necros start out KOS - you will need to do a LOT of faction work to even initiate the quests, tho you only need to get to Dubious with Torsten.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nocifer Deathblade</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 09:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, it was my old thread over at TKW about factions how to raise to be able to do that quest.. Not in mood to re-list or whatever. Heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Malaegue</div><div class="date">04-04-2002, 08:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Any more info on this quest? and off hand what's the effect of truesight?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neq</div><div class="date">04-04-2002, 08:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Truesight is seeinvis + ultravision (always perm not click that I have seen)<br />
<br />
And I think this post has pretty much all the info there is about this quest (tells ya everything to do it looks like) was there something in particular ya were wondering about?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Malaegue</div><div class="date">04-04-2002, 08:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kinda referring to nocif's post about factions.. any particular notes to worry about here regarding factions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drooska</div><div class="date">04-04-2002, 09:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">this is a Katta quest in essence that involves spies in Seru and then killing people in Seru for info. Your Seru factions (about 8 diff ones) will go up and down but don't matter for this. THe faction you need is katta, Validus Custodus (although Katta Castellum Citizens and Magus Conlegium may help -these are other Katta groups).<br />
Also note that your Coterie faction (Luclin vampires) will also get worse doing these quests. Personally since I think the FD mask is worthless I kill coterie along with Seru mobs to raise my Katta faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Malaegue</div><div class="date">04-04-2002, 10:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hrmm.. think what I need is a luclin faction tutorial then...<br />
<br />
I'm clueless.. and pretty much a luclin virgin in that sense..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Did that EB necklace quest in Katta while KOS myself. /snicker</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mystina</div><div class="date">04-04-2002, 01:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would myself be very interested in tips regarding faction needed-recommanded for different parts of quest and best way to raise em.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gash</div><div class="date">07-03-2002, 03:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What kind of force is required to get those reports?<br />
<br />
What are the names of the Praesertum leaders and what force is required to kill them?</div></div><hr />
