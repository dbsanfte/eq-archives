In my guild we don't tank often but when a knight tanks its usually in SK over a Pally.  But my previous guild it was Pallys over me so I guess its the RL's preference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DConquest</div><div class="date">03-12-2004, 08:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Depends on your guild really.  I usually was the &quot; Hybrid MT &quot; for my guild, the Paladins where used more for patch healing.  I think it's the perception that Paladins are more of a defensive class than us, and they have that 300 hp buff that stacks with Brells... thus Paladins usually boost larger hp totals.  On stunnable mobs, they mitigate quite a bit of damage and are able to effectively grab aggro and heal themselves with their HoTs / quick heals.   Other than that, we're pretty on par defensively.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sesshou</div><div class="date">03-12-2004, 09:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In my guild it depends on who is there.  I get to offtank when our better equipped paladins aren't online, and I'm just DPS and random_observant_tank_01 when they are online.  There have been a few times when I have seen a couple adds charging the raid and I have been the first to get there to deal with them.  I also often get the job of grabbing the attention of mobs while the enchanters get around to dealing with them, which is kind of fun.<br />
<br />
I guess it just depends on your raid leader and your tactics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ghismonda</div><div class="date">03-12-2004, 11:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In addition to other reasons offered...<br />
<br />
In my guild, our paladin officer has about 1500 more HP than any other knights.  I think because of this, the raid leaders assume that all paladins have more HP (or are specifically better geared) than the shadowknights.  Not the case.<br />
<br />
Or they've seen a lot of shadowknights break mez while trying to get aggro with snare.<br />
<br />
Or we have no (and possibly have never had any) shadowknight officers.<br />
<br />
Or the majority of our shadowknight members haven't been around as long as the paladins being asked to tank.  Sometimes it's just a matter of familiarity-- they know the paladin they're asking to tank can do it, so why risk it on the new SK?<br />
<br />
Or perhaps a combination of all of those things.</div></div><hr />

I tend to reserve the better geared knights for tanking trash in tougher situations. But rotate it completely evenly across pallies and shadow knights.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mdiyan</div><div class="date">03-12-2004, 01:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For us it just depends on the encounter and who is online.  We usually have one paladin and one SK that raid consistently, and when the encounter calls for a knight to tank it is either myself or her.  However, most of the time it is her, for the simple fact that she has more HP then me and like has been stated on mobs that are stunnable, they reduce the mobs DPS and can grab and hold aggro a lot faster with the stun the we can.<br />
<br />
Bottomline:  I think it depends on the raid leader and how famailiar they are with the knights they are choosing.</div></div><hr />

The one 65 SK in the guild usually handles tank mezzing and aggro control on mobs, since she can quickly grab and hold aggro without doing damage untill the CC and lock down the adds.  <br />
She also was our MA for a long time, and doesn't like doing it any more if anyone else is arond to handle it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dakkin</div><div class="date">03-13-2004, 07:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I presume you're talking about offtanking since for raid MTing, /defensive means non-trivial mobs mostly get tanked by warriors.<br />
<br />
For offtanking, palys are kind of easier to play than SKs, so it's understandable they're often seen as better offtanks and chosen first.<br />
<br />
Once you're really comfortable with your spell selection (i.e. you're a bit further up the pole than just spamming CD), SKs are just as good.  But they do need noticeably more skill once you get past the simpler stuff.<br />
<br />
But to offtank VERY well, at a level where everyone's solid in the basics of aggro and mez breaking, CC and mob positioning skill is key.<br />
<br />
And then both classes become kind of even so the skill of the individual is more important.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why the hell are you snaring mobs for aggro if mezzes could possibly be applied anyways?<br />
<br />
Anyways... my guild pretty much ignores SK's as tanks unless there's just no one else available, which is rare.  Lower hp/ac pallies will get tossed into the tank rotation before an SK, even when the mobs are mostly immune to stun.  Once in a great while I'll get called on to add tank.  I usually end up add tanking anyways, because our warriors are fucking lazy, and the healers would be dieing repeatedly if someone wasn't hitting taunt.</div></div><hr />

Paladins get like 100HP over us in the end which doesn't help at all when youre tanking a mob that triples of 1k+.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Josahd</div><div class="date">03-18-2004, 05:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aotc is offset with a minor gear advantage over the paladin.  I guess being able to LoH yourself or toss in a fast heal might be a plus... dunno how practical that is, never really played a pally on a raid (twice for flagging a friend, didn't do any tanking).<br />
<br />
Stuns, sure, but once you move past the zone enterance or areas with exp mobs... most the mobs are gonna be immune, or be very resistant to stuns.<br />
<br />
I think it's mostly perception personally.  Part of it with my guild is we have a couple pallies with more hp/ac than most of the warriors, with no SK really close... but even the lesser geared pallies still get put into the tank order over SK's with more hp/ac.</div></div><hr />

Note: If you are looking for information about an SK and how they play, do not pay attention to the above post.<br />
<br />
Warriors can tank most MOBS better and pallies tank undead and stunnable mobs better.  The rest is hogwash</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Paladins are perferd as second tank due to slight more HP, stuns, rezz group buffs<br />
<br />
<br />
Bst can easily tank because they have slow, good damge, great pet  if well equiped in a regular exp group<br />
<br />
rangers can tank also if equiped well in a regular exp group<br />
<br />
rangers and bst can tank because they out dps us the mobs dosent stand for more then a few seconds<br />

your so blinded by your stupidity  you fail to see the truth</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keevel</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 07:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let's see I already listed warriors as preferred tanks in my above post as well as pallies being preferred on stunnable mobs (thier 100 extra hp at the end means nothing.)<br />
<br />
Rangers and BL's would need to be way overgeared as neither takes a hit really well, and when you are tanking things that rampage and enrage, it's a big difference.<br />
<br />
This thread is about tanking in raids and if you have the BL slowing on a raid, you have an issue.  Also rangers may tank in exp groups but the title of the thread clearly states tanking in raids.<br />
<br />
While Rangers can out DPS us, they can do that while not tanking too and let a class who takes a hit better do the damage while still putting in great dps.  BTW a high end ranger will probably be using 2H weapons as archery sucks in places with corners, debris and assorted other archery issues often found on raid mobs like MOB too high/low or can't see target.<br />
<br />
Edit: Yes they have discs that handles spike damage well, but if the mob takes any amount of time to kill you don't want to risk it.<br />
<br />
I'm so blinded by my stupidity that I read what I'm responding too not posting irrational emotional blather (well okay I post that occasionally too)<br />

<br />
I never said to use SK's over Pallies nor over Warriors for tanking, so i wouldn't go just for the third best class, though I would go by best quality of player between the top 3 classes if the mob and the gear worn by the player warrented such a distinction.  Also, SK's aren't always the 3rd best tank, often it's the second and rarely the first.<br />
<br />
I know you were referring to exp groups with bsts and rangers, but  not everyone looking for SK info would have realized it since this is a tanking in raids thread, which is why I put the disclaimer in.  Also it's a SK vs Pally thread where the hell did the rangers/BL's and warriors come in?<br />
<br />
Yes, most every raid I go on does have a Warrior MT.<br />
<br />
I think you are arguing with things I'm not saying...<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">UGLA</div><div class="date">03-31-2004, 02:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Silly newbs.  You know there are still some circumstances where the SHADOWKNIGHT is the best tank OVER a warrior.  Lets see...maybe when the mob procs or casts some kind of SLOW where a warrior will have a hard time to generate weapon aggro.    <br />
<br />
Between a paladin and a sk...the person who should tank is the person with the most hps/ac.  Just because they're  a pally isn't gonna mean they should tank over us.  If they have more ac and hps then you, then sure maybe they should get the nod to tank some boss over you.   It all comes down to gear.<br />
<br />
P.S.  If you play a SK and you think a ranger or beastlord can tank better then you, please do us all a favor and delete your character and start a ranger or a beastlord ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vezax</div><div class="date">03-31-2004, 04:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If a mob is stunible the the pally has a big lead over sks.  If the mob is unstunible and disease immune then pallies have a 300 hp on sks.  If the mob is unstunible but disease lands then a pally has 300 more hp, but the sk has 100 more ac.  <br />
<br />
So in conclusion (IMO)<br />
<br />
Pallies &gt;&gt;&gt; SKs when mobs are stunible.  (Very few situations where is is applicible.  Not much of a raid if a pally can stun lock a mob =P)<br />
<br />
Pallies &gt; SKs on unstunible and disease imune mobs.  They Have a 300 hp cushion on us =P (which happens quite a bit)<br />
<br />
SKs &gt;&gt; Pallies on unstunible but disease landible mobs.  100 ac &gt;&gt;&gt; 300 hp.  (Also happens quite a bit)<br />
<br />
This is my humble opinion.  I happened to be the 2nd or 3rd most tanking knight in my guild.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would have to agree with you on that one for the most part. Every once in a while you meet a pally or warrior who hands down knows what hes doing.. but thats only once in a while. Hell I met a Warrior whos taunt skill was lower than my old rangers(he was even about 2-3 levels higher than ranger). But I often meet very reliable Sks who understand their role and &quot;what buttons they need to push&quot;<br />
<br />
Thats my 2 cents, flame what you want if you own a pally/warrior, I enjoy a good laugh every now and then</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd have thought more of an issue for ramp tanks is if you're DA'd you can't be healed, though I've never seen this used myself.<br />
<br />
Random DA procs with heals bouncing off the RT at unpredictable intervals - is this really popular with raid ramp healers?  Or are we talking about groups here?<br />
<br />
Genuinely curious, as I've not seen it done.</div></div><hr />
