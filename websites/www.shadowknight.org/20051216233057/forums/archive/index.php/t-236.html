Other than being able to talk from your pet, is there any other good use for voice grafting? I read from another forum that you can do certain quests with it since pets are indifferent some npc's.</div></div><hr />

I can't think of any quests that can be completed verbally without some sort of item transfer.<br />
<br />
By all means, if somebody can cite examples of using a pet in this manner, I'm all blue pointed ears.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If your KoS you realy can't, but if Indiff is all thats needed you can do the /hide trick wich takes some timing. <br />
<br />
/hide<br />
open window<br />
/con<br />
<br />
The trick is to get the Window to open the instant Hide hits leaving window open and indiff.<br />
<br />
I can't say I'm any good at it, takes a bunch of tries to get it right.<br />
<br />
As for pets giving stuff back, if it's not No-Drop, /beg will get the items back off your pet. Next time your medding and bored give him some cp, or a wep and /beg it back.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chania</div><div class="date">03-31-2002, 03:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It was Ronoh I believe, he also said you need over 100 CHA and 200 beg skill and even then it takes 50 tries or more.<br />
<br />
Still, very interesting.<br />
<br />
Going to try the hide thing some more, I've always hated that sneak lets you do so many quests when KOS, and we never get sneak as Dark Knights, but pansy rangers and even monks get it :( I guess its hard to sneak in Plate hehe. But Halfling Warriors can do it :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rikkar</div><div class="date">03-31-2002, 07:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">guhmol our only voice graft option (that i know of) is a clickable proc on the sentient axe (drops from sentient armors in... i think WL)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ghumol Fleshcarver</div><div class="date">03-31-2002, 07:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks ,  Im level 30 atm and can't play till i get my new Comp Set up  but i can get 46 in a week or less :)  Could 46 sk take the Sen armors solo?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaiyn</div><div class="date">03-31-2002, 11:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It would be tough to take those guys solo at 46, I would suggest to bring a group of friends. They spawn in multiples in their little buildings and if you fell to the ground once while trying to split, you would more than likely be dead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pajita</div><div class="date">03-31-2002, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you can't convince your friends to go hunt the armors, you could probably buy an axe, they're not that expensive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zemi</div><div class="date">04-01-2002, 02:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I overpaid for mine, like 450pp total.<br />
<br />
Best money I ever spent, next to my CoS.  You can get it to beg for buffs and annoy people on raids, and almost everyone will blame the necros :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ronoh</div><div class="date">04-01-2002, 10:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, the pet begging tip was from me.  I've tested it and it does work, though it is tedious.<br />
<br />
If your Cha is below 100, you have less than a 1% chance per beg to get items back (or so my findings went).  If you have cha at 100, it jumps up to (roughly) 5% chance per beg.  Of course the higher your Cha, the higher the percentage will be to get your item back from pet.<br />
<br />
This was tested at a begging skill of 200.  All the times prior to having begging at 200 resulted in nothing being begged back.  But then again, I never had my Cha over 100 during those times either, so you might be able to get items back prior to a 200 skill level if you have very high Cha to compensate the lower skill level.<br />
<br />
I have tested it by handing pet a tradeable weapon and someone else with high Cha and high begging skill, and they were able to beg the item from pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LaBlade</div><div class="date">04-01-2002, 11:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Over a year ago, you could cast &quot;numb undead&quot; (or whatever the spell we get early that takes 1 BC to cast) on your pet, and if it was resisted, the pet would no longer be your pet, and he would attack you.<br />
<br />
Then you could try using our disarm skill (snicker) to try to get a wep back.<br />
<br />
Not sure if it still works, and it's kinda off topic, but still......<br />
