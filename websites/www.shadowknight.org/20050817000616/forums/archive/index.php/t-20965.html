What are your reasons? Post em here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ghismonda</div><div class="date">04-05-2004, 02:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1)  It looks cool.  <br />
2)  It's being able to say, &quot;I have finished a tough quest.&quot;<br />
3)  It's 95% soloable, and an easy cure for boredom.<br />
4)  It's Shissar bane, providing an alternative to corrupted weapons.<br />
5)  Kunark is super cool.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ashrai</div><div class="date">04-26-2004, 01:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Non Iksar do this quest so that we can spend the rest of our days responding to threads asking us why we did this quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Naelyan</div><div class="date">04-27-2004, 12:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally, i got it because spending days in Dalnir gave me a lot of time to look at porn. So did faction work. Yay porn.<br />

P.S. I'm looking at porn right now, isn't that COOL?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Amphitryon</div><div class="date">04-27-2004, 12:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did the quest because it was HARD but it was also attainable w/o countless fiutless raids to planes like the SK epic peices!<br />
<br />
Because most folks would take the easy way, and buy some generic thing in the bazaar<br />
<br />
because nothing says &quot;I am NOT a twink!&quot; like a Greenmist<br />
<br />
Pretty much if you own a Greenmist, you arent some powerleveled d00d, you actually know your toon inside and out.<br />
<br />
and for me it was about being one of the rare SKs who got both the Greenmist AND the IC (I got my Greenmist over a year and a half before i finally got my IC, and it made the wait for the IC much better since I knew I had a weapon worthwhile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Naelyan</div><div class="date">04-27-2004, 11:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm still looking at porn.<br />

And i'm just the FUCKING CHRIST GODDAM CHARDOK greenish metal shard away from my greenmist, and its driving me FUCKING INSANE!</div></div><hr />

did VP key, VT key, multiple epics<br />
<br />
also love katana look and this one seemed easiest obtainable</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nnod</div><div class="date">05-21-2004, 12:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Becuase this is everQUEST, not everEXPGRIND. Quests are fun. and if you read the text while doing this quest, its actually a pretty good story.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shainaen</div><div class="date">05-30-2004, 12:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did it because i am a quest junky.  Did it to say i did it.  Did it to have Ssra bane weapon.  Did it because i think Kunark (and some of SoL) content is best EQ has to offer regardless of its &quot;dated&quot; material.  Did it because i am a Shadow knight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bakatengu</div><div class="date">06-14-2004, 02:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Because early on, My Troll Sk wanted to be on good terms with his fellow followers of the Faceless. So he became warmly with the Heritecs of Paineel and the Iskar of Cabillis (I.E. he can sell and bank on Odus and Kunark).<br />
<br />
Because It was, and still is one of the best 1hs in the game, and probably the best I can hope to. Unlike the Epic, this weapon isn't completly obsolete.<br />
<br />
Because the Iskar have the best set of quests for any race. Progressive weapons, quested armor, lore and history. It was thought out and implemented far better than any other city. As a troll, I had a choice of questing for a rusty 2hs, a crappy hat, a face mask that was better served on my newbie de wizard, and some oven mits (no joke). There was the Luygia quest which was decent, but it hurt my faction at home.  So Racially, I was pretty SOL when it came to quests. <br />
<br />
Lastly, since the fall of Grobb, I have been living in Cabillis. I dislike Neriak (why would anyone stay in that rat infested city?), as I refuse to duck my head all the time. Iskar's are much closer to being proper size, and I hardly have to duck at all. Kael is a decent city of good proportions, but it is always so empty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nyrvel</div><div class="date">06-16-2004, 06:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I first started playing, the only help I received was from Iksar Shadow Knights. Eventually a group of them would keep checking up on me, making sure I was learning new things and basically keeping my Skills up to par. Note, they never gave me Gear or Power Leveled, just watched and told me what I was doing wrong, making me do it again. When I finally got my Fear Kiting practiced and down to an Art, one of them said, 'Lil sis is turning out alright.' Another replied, 'Can't be our Sister until she proves she has the guts, when she gets Greenmist and only then, will we call her Sister.' Didn't know what Greenmist was and they wouldn't tell me, so I did my research. Many retired when I finally got Greenmist, but all my Brothers brought their Shadow Knights out of retirement to initiate me in an Iksar Hunting Party. It was a blast to finally hunt with them and be called Sister. The time and effort to acquire Greenmist seemed as nothing in comparison to the final joys. To my Brothers for helping me and getting me started on a path that I will never falter from, thank you.<br />
<br />
I am a Sister to Iksar...Coldain and Claws of Veeshan hail me as ally, what more need I?  Alas, you...you will soon need allies, if you insult me or mine again.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nyrvel</div><div class="date">06-24-2004, 06:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">LOL! Keep wondering...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zakton</div><div class="date">07-07-2004, 03:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am doing it because I can and because of the shissar bane which means I have a shissar bane usable weapon without needing to farm corrupted.</div></div><hr />
