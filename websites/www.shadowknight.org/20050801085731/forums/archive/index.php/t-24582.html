<br />
B) save Tunare.Tyking and Tunare.ERinfo, does anyone know of any other existing linkbots?<br />
<br />
its been a pretty persistent question in guild chat and in SK channel, if there are other operational linkbots out there would be nice to know<br />
<br />
(if for some reason you wanna keep a bot you know about on the down low, PM me I wont spread it around)</div></div><hr />

server.bot tells you, 'Ring of the Dead (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=13394)'</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tunare.tyking<br />
tunare.erinfo<br />
luclin.zivil<br />
fenninro.ximena<br />
<br />
Some you just send the item name or partial and it gives you the link.<br />
Others, you need to tell them !link then the item name. With Erinfo, you can also send !loot and the mob name to get a drop list linked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dohn</div><div class="date">04-03-2005, 01:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">According to a message attached to the ERInfo links, the linkbots are being shut down.  I quote:<br />
<br />
&quot;ERInfo may be shut down without notice.  SoE is threatening to ban ERInfo for violating the EULA.  It is my belief that this service arguably complies to article 9 of the agreement.  Please voice your concerns by emailing eqmail@soe.sony.com, or !feedback me&quot;<br />
<br />
Which explains the sudden dissapearance of every other linkbot on the planet.</div></div><hr />

Regardless of it being true or not, somone made a linkbot dedicated to him<br />
Cazic.Xemian<br />
&quot;!link &lt;Item Name&gt;&quot; is the only command I know of, it likes to spam you with fancy tells and I sware it's close to being on the verge of being an Ad ware, and start marketing things close to being a banner if they keep it up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Croix VorAbaddon</div><div class="date">04-06-2005, 05:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My question is, how does it work with EQIM. I can't send or receive links between in game and EQIM logged accounts. I'm thinking that however the Linkbots do this is what SOE's nailing them on.<br />
<br />
That being the case, then sony needs to provide. Especially for the !loot command erinfo ((My linkbot of choice)) has. Doens't help my alliance much ((Loot is droppable, so we just ML and distribute)) but I'd imagine where time is of the essence, during downtime before, say, Fennin.<br />
<br />
;tell tunare.erinfo !loot Fennin Ro,The Tyrant of Fire ((Yes, you need the full thing))<br />
<br />
Get loot list, link all but molds in /rsay or raid channel.<br />
<br />
/rsay &quot;These items may drop, as well as EP leg molds. If you wish to bid, please be prepared.<br />
<br />
So people can take a look and determine beforehand &quot;Is X loot worth the bid and how much should I bid&quot; to save time. It's just a helpful tool, and I can't see how it affects the game all THAT much.</div></div><hr />

I came to look at that last one that was posted so i could try it. But the post is gone now.</div></div><hr />

Any other linkbots show up yet?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shadowsoal</div><div class="date">04-18-2005, 04:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">from what I heard linkbots are now banned by SoE<br />
<br />
I have heard two things - one they take up too much bandwith, two they are against the EULA</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bolas</div><div class="date">04-18-2005, 09:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's gonna be the &quot;banned&quot; thing because of taking up too much bandwidth.  Not even any question there really... it's too much bandwidth and costs them too much to provide more bandwidth to accomodate linkbots.<br />

-Bolas</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">window</div><div class="date">04-18-2005, 09:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">oh yeah, they're banning linkbots because the huge text messages taking up tons of bandwidth.<br />
they're also gonna turn off all the universal chat service tells, and then next they're banning anyone who engages in combat with NPCs, cause all those hits/miss data are a ton more bandwidth than text messages.<br />
<br />
if you didn't catch the sarcasm, that idea is fucking ridiculous.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kilkulan Darkwarrior</div><div class="date">04-18-2005, 10:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">there banning them because they use a Data miner to pull information Directly from the SoE database</div></div><hr />

Are you sure?  I think they don't name butter specifically but refer to &quot;all non-petrollium based food product lubricants&quot;.<br />

Since bots are scripted automatic programs and thus probably considered 3rd party stuff they logically are against the EULA.</div></div><hr />
