<br />
Your Bush posts are getting old.  Who the fuck cares?  And, even if Kerry wins, contrary to what you think, little if anything will change.  The major parties have no interest in rocking the boat on either side.  They don't make their money off of your $10 donations, trust me.<br />
<br />
Or, go log in and play for a couple hours.  Give it a rest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Azudno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">During a commercial break on the David Letterman show, producer Maria Pope was on stage and discussing something with Letterman, and while she was standing there in front of Bush, George leaned forward, grabbed the back of her sweater and used it to clean his glasses. Check out the Quicktime video.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Daywalka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Whoopdy do. Next you're going to tell us he took someone's kleenex and wiped a booger on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kebsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">That's awesome.  I wish I was president so I could wipe shit on peoples clothes without asking them, and without having to run away afterwards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Rothund</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">If you're subtle enough about it, you can do it without being the president Kebsis. Just takes skill, and practice.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Shurlock</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">If Grim thinks Kerry's a better alternative, he's more of an idiot than he appears to be spewing his political shit all over these forums.</div></div><hr />
