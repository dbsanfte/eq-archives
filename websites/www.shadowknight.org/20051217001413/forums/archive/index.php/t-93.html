<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Walil</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 02:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I bought mine off the necro spell vendor underneath EFP. I didn't see the coffins for sale though. From what I've heard you can get those in neriak, paineel, and cabalis. I swear Verant just forgets about human sk's. We are suppossed to have the best faction which we do for every city except the ones with rival sk guilds :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
A guildie says they found LSC the spell on one of the &quot;alove cave&quot; necro vendors in West Cab.<br />
<br />
Anyone know the exact vendor?<br />
<br />
Also, anyone know the exact vendo that sells BC Coffins in West or East Cab?<br />
<br />
Thanks, I have been looking all over.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Odd place for it except that now any SK can buy them.  The level 51 coffins are in the Cleric guild.  I'll need my wife to buy them for us then.<br />
<br />
Someone else said they got them in Paineel, but I don't know where.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps some.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vadrigar</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 03:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Coffins can also be bought at the Bazzaar (http://www.eqatlas.com/luclin/bazaarmap.html) in building #6, by one of the two vendors closest to the Nexxus zone.   :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sorill</div><div class="date">03-29-2002, 10:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anyone find the coffins in Kunark?<br />
<br />
Is a level 12 Iksar Necro expected to run thru DL to get to the Luclin spires? Or Paineel? Or Neriak?<br />
<br />
The spell was on the second or third necro spell vendor (from the left) in the Alcove next to the Arena in West Cab.<br />
<br />
I have checked every merchant in fob, loio, ww, east cab and west cab except for the warrior guild area merchants. Anyone checked the swamp? Or rechecked lately?<br />
<br />
The ONLY coffin I've seen in Cabilis is the Crusader's coffin sold by the Mortician in West Cab.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rabdos</div><div class="date">03-29-2002, 01:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since he asked about the *spell*, not the coffins; The necro spell vendors in Lodge of the Dead in Neriak 3rd gate sell them. Haven't looked for it in other cities, but you didn't say what race you are anyway. (Me == Dark Elf). Heck, now I need to put in a new .sig again. Sigh.</div></div><hr />
