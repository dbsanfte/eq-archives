<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Keep killing Explorers and Droga/Nurga/FM gobbies.  They give troopers faction, which is what the knife turn in mob is on.<br />
<br />
You can also go stomp the shit out of Seb, as the frogs there give trooper faction as well.  Oh, and Ikky bandits, purse snatchers and other Ikky ne'er-do-wells in LoIO, Warsliks, FoB, et al will raise not only trooper faction but Necro faction.  Kill a bunch of those too.<br />
<br />
You'll need at least 3000 kills of these types of mobs before you're out of KOS range, presuming that you started at max KOS, so it could be a while.  I'd personally suggest snuggling up with the Lead Explorer and his warm pinky family for some quality time, since the knives that they drop are going to be your best bet for making the jump with the other factions to amiable, but Ikky bandits are a close second, as you'll need to spend time killing them to get Necro faction up (this is the only way to get necro faction up by killing mobs).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zeralenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Two questions about the Brood of Kotiz faction:<br />
<br />
1) Are there any particular camps that are good to wipe out -- relatively easy, several mobs in one place, fast respawn rate? If so, where?<br />
<br />
2) Is there something on necro faction in our out of Cab that is a relatively safe distance /con to check faction without dying horribly?<br />
<br />
All my other factions are at least dubious, most are amiable. Found out about Brood faction the hard way and had to have my brave DE necro friend summon and converge me once already.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>LoganHex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">This is how I did my Cabilis faction work as an Erudite shadow knight:<br />
<br />
Kill bazillions of explorers. After turning in bone chips, Marauder Snout Ring 'MM' and explor knives I can positively say that explorer knives give the best faction hits (cannot comment on the Veksar turn ins as I am only level fourty but I would imagine those would be the best if you can get the weapons). <br />
<br />
Once I had turned in enough knives to become maxed out on Legion of Cabilis faction (one hundred or so maxed me out at warmly) and devious to everyone else I went to the marauder cave out in the Field of Bone. The marauders and manslayers there give higher faction hits than the brigands in Warsliks Woods and respawn a bit quicker. There are two bonuses as well. If you go at the same level I did (thirty nine) Kerosh Blackhand still gives you decent experience. Also you get a lot of Marauder Snout Ring 'MM' which you can also turn in for faction with everyone but the Brood of Kotiz. This also gives decent experience (about a blue bubble for every five turn ins). <br />
<br />
After I had gotten to dubious with the Brood of Kotiz I went back to the explorers for more knives. Between every twenty and fourty knives I turned in bumped me up a full faction level. I am now maxed out at warmly with every faction in Cabilis except for Brood of Kotiz (still at dubious but will max it out eventually).<br />
<br />
You only need to be amiable for the quests from what I have read here but I figured why stop there and went all the way with it. <br />
<br />
Getting to dubious with Brood of Kotiz was the roughest part followed closely by getting to dubious with Legion of Cabilis. Once you can turn in those knives though it is cake.<br />
<br />
Getting ready to do my Test of Betrayal now. Anyone know if I can raise my faction with Firiona Vie (it is max negative after killing explorers) to dubious so that I will not be attacked by pilgrims and drixies while doing this quest? I have been told that Iksar can never be dubious in Firiona Vie because they follow Cazic-Thule. While I am an Erudite I follow Cazic-Thule as well and would like to know if I can raise it to a non-kill on sight state before I set about slaughtering goblins for no reason</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Malevalence</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There is a tunnel in WW that has around 15 or so outcast iksar in it.  This is where I raised the faction for Brood of Kotiz.  Also in WW is a lake that has several spawns around it of outcast Iksar.  I would clear the caves, then clear the lake.  I would make it back before the caves respawned with run 3.  Also, a safe npc to con for faction standing with the Brood of Kotiz is the Iksar Hermit.  He is just inside the Cabalis zone from LOIO.  Approach him inviso to target him, then move back to the zone, drop inviso and con.</div></div><hr />
