<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Akronis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well I just got my emp key tonight and followed it up by looting a planar rift... and I need 4 more shards for my VT key - Acrylia, The Deep, Akheva, and Fungus Grove.<br />
<br />
I don't have a lot of resources to tap in terms of friends to call in to help, so I was wondering how realistic it would be to solo each of those 4 shards, and if it is, anyone have any tips?<br />
<br />
I'd appreciate any info... btw I'm 65 with only about 25 aa spent, I think my magelo is in my sig ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Acrylia - sure, should be soloable.  go after a raid so you're fully buffed.<br />
Akheva - definately soloable.  the rock guys are totally easy.<br />
Deep - I soloed this once.  agro kited on the far side of the bridge.  it just went too slow to be worth the effort.  took a guild group of 6 and did all of ours in 2 hours.<br />
FG - no way.  waaay too much hp.  did mine in a duo with a cleric, but without much damage it goes really slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Saruton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I did FG solo, it isnt that hard, just takes a while. Or you are lucky as i am and get your shard on the first mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Braellar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">AC shard now drops of Grimlings called &quot;Sanctum&quot; wich the highest concentration spawn at Inner Acrylia.<br />
<br />
Though one Sanctum mob spawns exactly at the zoneline wich can drop it, they can also see invis depending on the spawn. <br />
<br />
Can be anything from melee to a caster, though by far the Sanctum Corpsemaster (necro) Are the weeker of the spawns to solo, really low hp and casts spells you resist all time, the melee take a lot longer to kill.<br />
