<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>pazuzu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just started playing EQ after Luclin so I never really got involved in the &quot;Old World&quot; raid stuff.  <br />
<br />
Are there any worth while loot drops - from previously &quot;raid only&quot; encounters which a single group of Level 70s can now do?<br />
<br />
Like can 1 group kill Trakanon or King Tormax?</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
Trakanon can be solo'd by a well equipped SK.  I've cleared his entire lair solo, but was never lucky enough to find him up.<br />
<br />
Tormax I'm not sure about.<br />
<br />
Velious wandering dragons are soloable or groupable.  <br />
<br />
IV in AR is easily one groupable.  SV I've heard is possible, but is tricky cause of the DT (actually 20K DD)<br />
<br />
All of plane of fear is one groupable including CT<br />
<br />
Venril Sathir is one groupable, soloable by someone with the right equipment.<br />
<br />
I'm sure there are plenty of others people will reply with.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bazaar gear will easily take you to Luclin level encounters now (assuming level 70 pluss a healthy dose of AA).  For now though, skip those encounters and farm low level PoP enouncters.   Start with BoT names, upgrade sufficient to do BoT towers.  While you do that, fill yourself out in ornate plate. <br />
<br />
You can progress passed that into OoW gear, which is some pretty solid stuff.  Solid tier 1 PoP stuff complemented with best of bazaar stuff with some OoW stuff mixed in will let you into Ssra easily.  Jack those magic resists up and you can do a fair chunk of Ssra.  Once you can do a fair chunk of Ssra, it's my understanding that theoretically the Emporer is one groupable.  If you could swing that, then you can get yourself into VT.  Much of VT is one groupable, but lord that'd be tedious.</div></div><hr />

Gorran, if AHR alone is a 1 hour fight, how long does it take you all from start to finish?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>GorranVZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">5 days.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure of his exact method, because I only do a couple different mobs with him on occasion, usually TVK and AHR.  The guy knows every square millimeter of VT and knows where to stand to not get aggro and usually pet pulls to get singles.  You can single TVK using pet pulling, he was clearing the entire room until I taught him that trick.  The guy is a necro, and he'll log in a shaman to slow the mob that aggros and after that he can solo out the spot to log in the other chars.  Once everybody else is logged in, he starts clearing to the boss. To get to other mobs, he uses his monk twink to train and then the posse runs by, sometimes he'll uses a rogue also.  Usually he has a lot of different setups, a pally with DA hammer for rampage, and some other characters depending on the boss.  Usually minimal clearing takes place, but it takes him the better part of 3 hours or so just to get setup for 1 mob. Normal boss mob fight takes about 25-30 minutes.  TVK being probably the hardest,   AHR is super gimp as long as one of the Diabo's doesn't repop.  You can snare AHR haha it's a great tactic to use when the tank goes down.  All of the chars are Qvic+ geared, besides his super twink level 60 monk with over 400mr.  Heheh it's got two rings of resistances.<br />
<br />
Like I said, I don't sit there and clear all the bosses with him because it takes forever, so I'm not sure exactly how he does it.  I'd post some screenshots or something, but we stopped doing it last week.  We are selecting new targets, but our next goal is 2 group emp and eventually 1 group.  I think we have a tunare one planned, but we don't see that one coming out smelling like roses. :rolleyes:  I don't know, somethings might be easier on pvp servers because for example, you can mindwrack other players or tap other players and stuff like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Elkar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">They all may be gimp, but hit points are hit points.  You have to chew through them in VT before repops, plain and simple.   Unless some uber weapondry of 2000 dps has come along, I just don't see it and call bullshit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Wyrdlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">The benefit of one group over a raid though is that if you can maintain healing over dps, you have much more flexibility in how you do things.  For example, if you can cram your entire group into a tiny corner, you don't have to worry nearly so much about agro'ing surrounding mobs.  You can fit 6 into a corner, and bring the mob in tight and not worry about assists as so much.<br />
<br />
I definitely believe it's possible.  WORTH it is a whole different question.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hah... ok... <br />
I've seen it done multiple times on multiple occasions and it's not a fluke.  Believe what you want, but it can be done.  I have parses at home on how long the fight lasts.  I don't have others hits and shit turned on, but I can post some of it if you want.<br />
<br />
Doesn't this come up everytime something is &quot;impossible&quot;.  Kind of like the Dojo axe back in the day.  NO WAY that exists, pure bullshit.  Now you see the Dojo axe everyday.  The sleeper was impossible to kill... it was killed.  I'd be happy to post some screenshots the next time he does it... In fact I'll tell him to do TVK another time just so I can get screenshots to prove you wrong.</div></div><hr />

I believe the question was, on how did you take down the Vulaz Ring event not on what group formation you have,How'd you pull, keep from getting aggro, etc..explain</div></div><hr />

I know).  You'd be surprised what you can do with a little applied raid knowledge...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Ghismonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Hate to break it to you, but if you're DUOING, then your raid knowledge means nothing at all.<br />
<br />
See Gorran's posts on clearing VT if you want some instructions on how to reasonably explain something highly improbable.  And if we ever want an example on how to be a dumbfuck troll with not a sliver of credibility, I'll point them to your posts Bludrain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>BludrainHalovex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Speaking of dumbfucks reading my posts... oh hey I did type the word &quot;applied&quot;.  Man I really did think I missed something there for a moment.  Think before you post please.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Ghismonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Reading comprehension &gt; you<br />
<br />
Your &quot;raid knowledge&quot; is not APPLICABLE and thereby not able to be APPLIED to the situation where you + one other person are taking down a mob.  That, sir, is not raid strategy.  That is DU-O-ING strategy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>BludrainHalovex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Ugh... ok... I'll dumb this down, just for you.<br />
<br />
I pull on raids, therefor I have pull knowledge of the area...<br />
<br />
People on raids know what to do and what not to do to not get additional aggro... therefor I know what to and not to do about that too.<br />
<br />
Am I going too fast for you?  Let me know when I need to slow down.  I know this learning thing can take some time...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Ghismonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Here's my last attempt...<br />
<br />
Being able to pull a single mob out of a crowd is not something that can *only* be learned by being involved in, running, wiping to, or pulling for a raid.  Not from Kael to Anguish is there a situation where 'raid knowledge' is being applied to your duo situation that cannot be learned via a non-raid means.<br />
<br />
There are certain things that I would call raid knowledge.  To do them, you need a raid.  Things like, say, a ch rot or say, tank switching.  Participating in one of those would qualify as &quot;raid knowledge.&quot;  Single pulling a mob does not qualify as that.<br />
<br />
Now, to my original point.  There's a right way and a wrong way to prove that you did something.  Logs and screenshots help, but a plausable explanation such as &quot;Well, he starts by logging in his necro and soloing a mob, then when it's clear, bringing in the rest of his group.&quot; or &quot;He sometimes uses his monk to train all of the stuff out of the way.&quot; and such perfectly reasonable, if not improbable, offerings of factual proof on how someone might one-group a difficult boss encounter.  The wrong way would be something like, &quot;LOLOL if you fags had more than 3k HP and had raided Saryn [sic] in teh Po Time you might know!  wafflehats!!!!11shiftone,&quot; which you have so brilliantly demonstrated to the shadowknight community.<br />
<br />
So.  In closing.  Unless you have some kind of proof or reasonable strategy to share with us on how you and a shaman (and his ranger and necro bots, which I'm sorry to break it to you, does NOT 'technically' constitute a duo you fucking moron) then I, and I assume the rest of us who use more than 1% of our brains, will write you off as the knuckle-dragging ground-dwelling completely creditless board troll that you are.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Obviously you do care what we think, or you wouldn't be here defending yourself.<br />
<br />
Speaking of epenises, I can't see any other reason to brag about killing Vulak with 2 people, without giving a shred of evidence how you actually pulled it off.<br />
<br />
I believe the problem with Vulak is there's gobs of freaking mobs that spawn, and you don't have much room to work with because of the DTing mobs.  So either there's some trick/secret you're not letting on, you exploited, or you didn't do it.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying you didn't do it, but forgive me if I'm a bit skeptical unless you provide more supporting evidence.<br />
<br />
You aren't 'passing on information from experience', you've provided no useful information whatsoever.  You're bragging, and you're getting your ass kicked by skepitcal SKO readers.  Slight difference.  Tell us how you dealt with all of the spawns that occur during the vulak ring, and if it sounds plausible, we'll believe you.  Until then, most of the people here will continue thinking you're full of shit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Aphyon D'Veldrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">I dunno it's killing me since Bludrain isn't going to post any evidence on the event<br />
<br />
It's been a while i dont remember how many mobs spawn,when the event starts, and ive never done it but im gonna take a crack at it<br />
<br />
Scenario 1<br />
Shaman/SK starts event (if it's possible to do so with only 2 people)<br />
Mobs start to spawn,(not sure of aggro radius) so i would guess the duo players would be against a wall or a corner, or behind a wall, they both pet up,shaman sends pet in to take DT,sk pulls with pet (if it's possible in VT),fight ensues for amount of time (but this is a timed event with mobs that repop,so depending on the Bludrain's weapon,his shaman's line of spells memmed and the amound of wolfs his aa ability is up to,it's hard to say, in any amount of time that each mob is taken down,) when and if they could get to their 3rd or 4th mob i can beleive there will be a repop<br />
<br />
it confuses me, because:<br />
<br />
They can rinse and repeat the pulling method,(if you can pet pull in VT)<br />
The Aggro/Pull radius has to come into play<br />
The Amount of Mobs(number of hps they have)<br />
Bludrain/Shaman- line of spells/weapons they are using<br />
(and from what is described by people, who we know has done the event, im estimating there has to be more then 10mobs that spawn ?)<br />
How long they have between each kill,after and if they get past the first one with just them<br />
<br />
There is no Scenario2 until something is said on how Bludrain handled the DT mobs that spawned and how fast were there kills as not to be overwhelmed by the repopping spawns (are all the mobs that spawn DT, or is it just the first round of mobs that DT and rest are same as first but without the DT ability)<br />
<br />
BRAIN FREEZE! :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>BludrainHalovex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">I'm not bragging at all, I just stated that it could be done.  Weither or not an exploit used or not I was just following what the shaman told me to do because he wanted to equip his alts.  I didn't see ANY DT's, I dont know if the shaman's pets were taking them or what.  As for DPS, would assume shaman had some dots on it, necro wasn't doing any damage, the shaman just had him setup to twitch the crap out of him while he did some sidewinder controller trick to autofire with the ranger.  Had no problems with DPS at all.  <br />
<br />
Unfortunately the entire guild the shaman was in moved to WoW so I wasn't able to get any parses or ask if it was an exploit or what, but I do plan on trying again to check/get another set of parses.<br />

But you can't remember anything you done besides your role of standing there and taking hits ? i dont care about parses, i just want to know how a SK,Ranger,Necro,Shaman took the event down, i see 2 major factors, positioning and pet pulling, or a exploit on how to pull them with out aggroing the other spawned mobs</div></div><hr />

Agreed.  But none of those encounters requires you to fight waves of mobs, death touching mobs (except cursed which you used 7), or kill 2 million hit point mobs to clear death touching warders before 20 minute repops of Eoms.</div></div><hr />

I didn't know it was an exploit before, but not I do.  I've said this in different posts.  Full of shit or not, at least I can say I've read things before I posted comments on them.

Third, I will look for the parses.  Yes... I do have parses.<br />
When caught &quot;page 8ing&quot; himself<br />
also never said I've used logs, <br />
When asked how handled the Vulak ring event<br />
how did I pull?  there should be a thread to teach you how.  how did I keep from getting aggro?  common sense (rare... I know).  You'd be surprised what you can do with a little applied raid knowledge...<br />
Oh, and Blue Drain (I know what you want to be called I'm just refusing), YES!, my SK is 50 something, but if you knew anything about EQ you'd know that it doesn't limit you to just one character.  OMG in a 6 year old game a 50 something charater CAN know shit from shinola!!!!!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!  And a level 70 one can be totally clueless.<br />
<br />
In fariness though, it's not just your character, it's you.  You think being level 70 with 3K HP would be less challanging than being uber geared.  I think it is you who has no reading comprehension.</div></div><hr />

Your barely even able to enter ToV let alone know what the hell we're talking about.  And omg calling me Blue Drain?  Your getting more creative by the day!

<br />
2) Again, yes my SK is barely able to enter NToV, but that says nothing of my play experience as a whole<br />

I fail to see how the mob's spells being directed at themselves did much for you either.  Most of the mobs are melee DPS and the ToV AEs they would be casting on themselves would never exceed 500dmg/tick.  So you get the equivelant of a level 60 paladin added into your DPS output in the best case.<br />
<br />
There are 16 waves before Vulak on a timer that is no more than 10 minutes each wave...think it's 9, remember it being odd.<br />
<br />
3 waves...Named...3 waves...Named...3 waves...Named...3 waves...Named...Vulak.  Wave mobs spawn in in front of you and behind you if you are on the bridge.<br />
<br />
I don't recall hearing they ever fixed the problem of the ring trigger, so who was in the room triggering the event.....the necro?  You didn't fight in the room because you said you pulled, if you were in the room you are agro and there is nothing to pull.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>BludrainHalovex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">What can I say?  Ever since I came back to playing and got a smartass answer for a simple question, I've made it a point to make you all squirm and show what kinda geekish losers all the assholes on this board are by means of criticism, petty arguments, or yes... bullshit.  To this day though I dont see what was so hard to understand... you want details on how to use the mob spell exploit?  I can do that for those who are challenged with the lack of common sense.<br />
<br />
Step 1... get into a room nearby that isn't jam packed with dragons<br />
Step 2... pull as few mobs as you can (I'm sure theres a thread explaining this)<br />
Step 3... keep aggro on all mobs (theres also a thread on this) while doing as much damage as you can and watch them AE and DT themselves (*slight?* dps boost?)<br />
Step 4... once mobs are dead, pull named<br />
Step 5... reduce named hp to zero (can refer to parts of step 3 if I'm going too fast for you)<br />
Step 6... repeat until final wave<br />
Step 7... VULAK SPAWNS!  WOOOOT!<br />
Step 8... pull Vulak...<br />
Step 9... tank him until he more or less kills himself (DTing yourself may not sound like much dps to some of you, but believe me, its plenty)<br />
Step 10... exit ToV<br />
Step 11... whatever you want!  its over!  theres no more minor details I can offer you!<br />
<br />
Did I go to fast?  Well I'm sorry, but I just can't dumb it down any more than that.  You'll have to leave it to your own imagination!<br />
<br />
You want some additional tactics for the same exploit?  well I did the same thing to the giant croc in plane of earth SOLO!  <br />
<br />
Step 1... FD your way to the top of the platform<br />
Step 2... croc spawns<br />
Step 3... croc dots the crap outta himself<br />
Step 4... once the croc is down to 1% HT, you type /disc unholy<br />
Step 5... hit spear so you get summoned quickly before mobs around you get to you<br />
Step 6... HT and finish off the croc!<br />
Step 7... FD till mobs are back in place and loot<br />
Step 8... FD your way back to zin<br />
Step 9... LEAVE!  Theres nothing left to do here!<br />
<br />
You see... even if there are exploits.  There is somewhat of a challenge to be had.  And seeing such named fall by your own hands still brings some satisfaction.  Not as much as soloing smaller mobs the legit way, but its still a great way to say &quot;I did this and that&quot;.  And seeing you all squirm with your whole &quot;DUDE!  nuh uh! *cry*&quot; bitch fest only adds to the satisfaction. =D</div></div><hr />

No, I never said this.  I simply stated that it could be done (with or without exploit) because I'm a wiseass and take pride in making you all squirm and cry over menial things.  Its like saying Captain Picard was the coolest captain at a Star Wars convention just to see people getting pissed about you talking about Star Trek instead of Star Wars, or as crudely stated before... flashing blind people.

There is no near by room that isn't jam packed with dragons....you cleared all the dragons before you fought Vulak so he doesn't summon them, and the Vulak encounter is in a dead end.  If someone is not standing in the dead end the event resets iteslf.</div></div><hr />

First of all, I'd like to ask you to only post when you knew what you were talking about, but then I'd be worried we'd never hear from you again.<br />

... oh wait. I think never hearing from you again might be a blessing.  <br />
<br />
Now that that is out of the way, I hope you are a better player than you are a liar, because you just outright suck at it. Wait, if you're a better player than a liar...well you wouldn't be posting your lies anyway. Your magelo is nothing but bullshit.  Why the hell would you buy innate wisdom? Are you a retard, or just french canadian? You don't even have COMBAT FURY, yet you claim to have veterans wrath. Last time I checked, combat fury, as well as fury of the ages are prereqs of that. You sir, are a terrible liar. <br />
<br />
I didn't look much further than your AA's and flags, because let's face it, why would you also do the alternate entry quests? For fun? For completeness? Or are you just a retard? I think I'll go with the latter. What class do you really play (and don't say monk. You probably play a level 27 Palladin)<br />

The PoM event referenced had to do with the puppets in the PoM v1 theatre, a mob on a baziarre faction, and repops.  It was a nasty (meaning very quick exp) exploit, that I never used, but one heard about it.  The exploit was eliminated (by changing a little bit of faction in the theatre area) about 18 months ago, then completely gone.  But still Blue Drain will do it and video tape it for us.  Thankfully he'll also claim to have a flux capacator to travel back in time to do it.</div></div><hr />

I could even respect Wylderan or whatever the fuck the pickle guy's name is just because he's one of the few with intelligent comments on this board.

<br />
I believe the point with the AA's is that it's showing you having AA's without having the pre-requisites. It does detract from the legitimacy.<br />
<br />
As for wisdom... I can't think of a single skill that uses wisdom as a skill up that also does not use Intelligence as well, the higher of the two taking precedence... and, being, you know.. an Int based caster, you SHOULD have more int than wisdow.. making innate wisdom utterly utterly pointless.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u144"><b>DConquest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p144">Both Bludrain and Duck_72 ( Meckwell ) are actually SKs on Mith Marr. Hell, I even did a few Hard LDoNs with Bludrain.  It was long ago, and the only notable thing I remember back then was that had told the group he one grouped the Giant Croc on the way to Rathe Flag mob and was the MT ( This is back before GoD, and he was pretty new to his guild and had a couple peices of basic time / EP gear ).  I had mentioned how that was almost impossible in my guild's officer chat, especially since we had similar gear at the time...<br />
<br />
I haven't played EQ since EQ2 came out, but if any SK on the server was &quot; reknowned &quot; for doing things most SKs are afraid to do it's Meckwell.  Anyway, I find it odd that Blud would be &quot; pulling &quot; for his guild considering FR has some of the best equiped and skilled Bards, Rogues, and Monks in EQ ( at least at the time ).   <br />

Personally, I think Blud is a little fond of telling Tall Tales ... but it's his way of going about it that makes him the real winner.</div></div><hr />

Your continued attack on Keevel based on the level of his alt SK shows your lack of knowledge, and how childish you really are.  Fuck off kid, we don't believe your bullshit, and your insults are without thought or merit.</div></div><hr />

ANSWER: raiding isn't about liking who you're playing with.  It's about knowing that when the shit goes down that the people you're with will do what they are supposed to.  No matter what kind of lying annoying obnoxious bastards they are otherwise.<br />
<br />
NOTE: It's easier to get kicked out of a raiding guild for fucking up as a player than it it is to get kicked out for having a fucked up personality, low self esteem and the constant urge to stretch the truth (as long as you don't lie on your app).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u150"><b>Aphyon D'Veldrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p150">re-reading from beginning to end of the thread begins with Pazuzu asking what old content can be done with a group of lvl 70's,everything was going fine till Blud Stain posted this:<br />
<br />
Have duo'ed Vulak with a shaman, not hard at all, just tedious.<br />
<br />
<br />
Then the Tea Bagging begins, with everyone asking for proof of this great accomplishment all we get is this:<br />
<br />
As to the earlier comment... gee no dumbfuck I passed the whole ring event cuz of the magical fairy patch that removed it. YES I FUCKING DID THE RING EVENT TO GET TO VULAK! As for the not believing me, your problem. Some of us SKs actually have fun challenging ourselves, while the others rot away at lvl 70 with 3k hp and a stick up their ass. Enjoy =)<br />
<br />
and this:<br />
<br />
<br />
Can ask anybody on the mithaniel marr server about the shit I do. As for self gratification, none needed, and certainly none wanted from morons who think things can't be done simply because they cannot do them. I simply posted that it can in fact be done. Not my fault your epenis got smaller.<br />
<br />
Obviously he misunderstood the question on how he did the even and gave these words of wisdom:<br />
<br />
how did I pull? there should be a thread to teach you how. how did I keep from getting aggro? common sense (rare... I know). You'd be surprised what you can do with a little applied raid knowledge...<br />
<br />
He's dismantled by a few posters after that, then starts reffereing that his GF(MoM) is telling him that he has to play nice with us -tries to keep a straight face-:<br />
<br />
My mom said I'm not allowed to argue with ignorant morons =( Dont let the door hit your helmets on the way out!<br />
<br />
Holy SHit keevel is lvl50, im going to so Pwnzor jo0! :p :<br />
<br />
YES!, my SK is 50 something, but if you knew anything about EQ you'd know that it <br />
<br />
<br />
Then this was posted:<br />
<br />
There are 16 waves before Vulak on a timer that is no more than 10 minutes each wave...think it's 9, remember it being odd.<br />
<br />
3 waves...Named...3 waves...Named...3 waves...Named...3 waves...Named...Vulak. Wave mobs spawn in in front of you and behind you if you are on the bridge.<br />
<br />
For Bludstain to spew this rehashed version of what Lynxal posted:<br />
Step 1... get into a room nearby that isn't jam packed with dragons<br />
Step 2... pull as few mobs as you can (I'm sure theres a thread explaining this)<br />
Step 3... keep aggro on all mobs (theres also a thread on this) while doing as much damage as you can and watch them AE and DT themselves (*slight?* dps boost?)<br />
Step 4... once mobs are dead, pull named<br />
Step 5... reduce named hp to zero (can refer to parts of step 3 if I'm going too fast for you)<br />
Step 6... repeat until final wave<br />
Step 7... VULAK SPAWNS! WOOOOT!<br />
Step 8... pull Vulak...<br />
Step 9... tank him until he more or less kills himself (DTing yourself may not sound like much dps to some of you, but believe me, its plenty)<br />
Step 10... exit ToV<br />
Step 11... whatever you want! its over! theres no more minor details I can offer you!<br />
<br />
Some good one liners:<br />
<br />
I triple dog dare you to shut the fuck up.<br />
<br />
You are retarded beyond human comprehension.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u167"><b>Daeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p167">Normally I would blow off all any magelo without an Authentic Symbol but since he claims it's real i went through his magelo and AA choices which seems really strange.<br />
<br />
He Decides to Max all Innate Stats isn't too wierd since some people exploited AE groups via that way, Yes Wisdon is wierd but i have seen wierder. <br />
<br />
It's the Fact that he decides to max all the Advanced stats over the advance resistance.<br />
<br />
He also Claim he is master of pet pulling yet he can't find the time to get /pet hold and decides he would much rather spam the hell out of the /pet back off command. He gets Innate Wisdom over Improved innate Resistance AND pet hold.<br />
<br />
Leech Touch- Sure it has it's uses at time but he get that over Mind/body Rejuvination at 5 points <br />
<br />
Planar Durability-Why the hell do you get wisdom and STATS when you don't have any rank in this. How is More int/str/dex/agi going to help you since you should be nearing max anyways, Geared Supposedly the way you are<br />
<br />
Bash AA's can't blame you but Why not max Shield Block as well if you have All the Bash AA's from God. Also 2 ranks in Vetern's Wrath over shield block or Fury of magic?<br />
<br />
<br />
There is Just so many stupid choices and holes through your AA's that it makes no Sense what so ever. I'm pretty sure a guild that raids Time+ requires Durability/Resistance AA's. Especially for a person with 600+ AA you sure spent them poorly.</div></div><hr />

I have my resists maxed... I only got leech touch lvl 1 and never touched it again cuz it was such an irritating waste of aa's... I have all hp boosting aa's... I didn't invest in shield block much because at level one it was a couple days later I even noticed any blocking and I thought I wasted more aa's...  And yes... I have fury of the ages too.<br />
<br />
Where these holes came from I have no idea.  Probably the same reason a lot of high end people have their atk bugged down to around 250 on their magelos.  Either way I'll run the magelo update later tonight, maybe that'll also explain why I'm 200ish hp short.  Hopefully that'll put a smile on your geeky little faces =)</div></div><hr />

I didn't send them a little letter asking them to put it there, I used the magelo update to put it in the system.  Too ignorant to believe me?  Well I was also marked on Lucy for having the first one (was put on there by Raker who is a monk in my guild but still has my guild tag).<br />

Maybe as much as I suck my dad huh?  ... ... ... what are you in elementary school?  Or are you just that obsessed with homosexual thoughts?  For fucks sake ravenclaw just do yourself a favor and stop talking... seriously... just dont open your mouth... while there are still 1 or 2 people in this world that think you have half a brain.  Its utterly rediculous, from you, I would honestly expect an &quot;I know you are but what am I?&quot; or a &quot;girls have cooties&quot;.  Every time you open your mouth you prove to everybody what a dumb fuck brat you really are.<br />

On a side note... EverQuest has been rated T... for teen... teen = teenagers for all idiots out there... teenagers = people ages 13-19 for ravenclaw.  Please don't open your mouth and lower the intelligence of those around you if you are under 13 and only playing cuz your parents say its ok.<br />
