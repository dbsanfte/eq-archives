<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Isthar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all i play on the nameless, i have a 44 SK but it seems like i am not having fun anymore. awhile back i was going to quit EQ, i dead in SolB and really didnt care so i lost my body with over 60k worth of gear. but now i am back but with only a full suit os validus armor because it only cost about 300pp. the point i am getting to is does anyone think i should start a new SK and work my way up again, or will i be ok with what i have. BTW i am only 4 blue from 45 then my weapon will start proc of rampage 2hs 27 for 42 +6str +6int.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Skrap</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Why would you want to start over?  If only because you don't think your gear is good for your level, well you can always farm some greens to make cash again, and it's a lot easier as a 44 than a low level character.<br />
<br />
If you can handle the geonids in crystal caverns that's a good spot to make cash that I know of, I'm sure there are plenty I don't know about.<br />
<br />
Or you could do something really ghetto like harvest spider silks and sell to desperate tradeskillers :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Isthar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ok never mind last night i spent 4 hours in Solb and DINGED lvl 45. A old friend of mine helped me and i got enough money to trade out some armor now i have black ice leggings and sleeves a Brig tunic i think it is call, and a rygor head coif. thx you for your reply but i think i am going to be ok now. oh and i switch my weapon to a mith 2hs for the haste till i get another haste item, so i can use my higher dam weapon with a higher dly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gnax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Suck it up, go to DL, and get to 49.  By the time you're 49, you'll hate DL, but you will be 49.<br />
<br />
with lvl comes loot.  don't worry overly much about your hat.  you'll get a new one eventually.  obsessing over gear (even the epic) will only slow down your leveling ...thus keep you from getting better loot without overpaying for it in bazaar.</div></div><hr />
