Allo peeps, been browsing these boards for a few years, and it seems my old account is fooked, so here I am again. I like the way the site is looking these days, great job! <br />
<br />
Normaly I do not do this sort of thing as I usually do not have to. But you hit a nerve.<br />
<br />
I like the way the site is looking these days, great job! <br />

Sorry, but it does not look as good as it used to. And I am not even talking about the IGE banner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>BullMarkOne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The 'ol sight does seem a li'l rougher than when I first started lurking god knows how long ago (what day is it anyway)...<br />
<br />
But personally I'd just attributed it to growing pains.. didn't someone post a comment about 'Board Puberty' or somesuch in the flames forum... so think of all the ugly as pimples that'll go away in a few years... if your lucky..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Allo<br />
<br />
and the site could be worse, it could be on ezboard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rony</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Old one is much more readable to my like, honestly.  However, it is pretty impressive that there is/are still people care enough.  <br />
<br />
To whoever is/are still maintaining and trying to keep sk community attached as whole, thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rony</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Oh yeah, I am not even talking about IGE banner.<br />
<br />
Look at the bright side.  It doesnt pop up ige's main page.  ^^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Synafey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ya but every board you go to these days has a banner. It could be like alla's which has pop-ups and shit like that, could be worse. Overall, its lookin good.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Enter the site via www.shadowknight.org , the reason you are not seeing the logo is due to you entering through an old link that does not have the correct paths set.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>vilesoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I liked the old layout...now being presented with having to click on &quot;forums&quot; then where you want to go is a bit annoying.<br />
<br />
It's almost like they are trying to increas the mount of clicks to get anywhere in order to increase viciblity time of the IGE banner....given ti's the same banner on all pasges, so WTF?<br />
<br />
Either way I have no real idea why it's the way it is...maybe they are jsut experimenting, but it seems a bit counter-intuitive.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Kinda like how the current cazic-thule corner has gotten.  I sthill havent figured out how to directly go anywhere in there without cehating by clicking on the &quot;most current threads&quot; and going up a level.  Just more steps to get anywhere.</div></div><hr />
