If I'm near water, I'll even keep my fishbone earring on, in case I shadowstep into the water and have to fd on the bottom :)  I also keep shieldskin up (the one that takes a cats eye agate) - if I have to I can chain cast it (or alternate with invoke fear attempts), while waiting for FD to refresh if it fails the first time.</div></div><hr />

Basically anything that aggroes ya you can snare and outrun. It's also nice to have bobbing corpse up if you're running through a zone with lot's of drop offs.</div></div><hr />

Lifetap<br />
Bloodboil<br />
Lifeleech<br />
Shroud of Undeath (or one of the other optional spells above)<br />
Shadowstep<br />
<br />
Now granted, my choices are sligthly different than most since I play on a PVP server.  I use a circlet of shadow for insta-cast invis, jboots or white chain bridle for travel speed.<br />
<br />
Abduction of Strength sometimes I switch for one of the other spells.<br />
<br />
Invoke Fear unless I want a faster casting lower mana cost for pvp vs pets, in which case I use just &quot;fear&quot;.<br />
<br />
Same with Dooming Darkness -- if I want a faster casting cost lower mana cost for pvp, I switch it to clinging.<br />
<br />
Lifetap for getting life back, Lifeleech for finishing move.<br />
<br />
Bloodboil for damage to the other player<br />
<br />
Shroud of Undeath for disguise (I'm a pet! Really!)<br />
<br />
Shadowstep as an escape spell.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kellisanth</div><div class="date">07-27-2002, 12:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What would be a good listing of spells to keep up?<br />
At 15, 22, 30, 39, etc etc (when getting new spells and such)<br />
<br />
Generally, I never know when I will be in combat, thus would rather have my combat spells up.  (the only spell casting area I really suck at is Evocation - it's in the teens I think - which means my &quot;Ward Undead&quot; fizzles A LOT!  Everything else is mastered...  What's the easiest way to get this one mastered?  I'm just _now_ wanting to go about and use it -at 30, *duh me* )<br />
<br />
[would be nice to have a 10-spell slot, instead of 8... why 8!?]<br />
<br />
Would be handy to have ideas of what spells for differing levels.<br />
Thanks!<br />

2) Vampiric Embrace (22)<br />
3) Gathering Shadows (_Hate_ the fiends in Paludal!!) (30)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Orthogonon</div><div class="date">08-12-2002, 04:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are 2 spells i usually have up when travelling to rid myself of unwanted company.  <br />
<br />
1. Fear (the low level one)<br />
2. Clinging Darkness<br />
3. Feign Death (but i always have this up)<br />
<br />
I have cos, so no need to waste spell slot for invis.  I have clinging up, because i am just concerned with making any attacking mobs slower than me, rather than damage.   The cast time, with ring of goblin lords, is way faster as well.  Additionally, i almost always have bobbing corpse cast on me when travelling for the obvious reason (avoiding falls), but also in case i need to go underwater.   Bobbing corpse, since it lasts so long, doesn't need to take a spell slot either.<br />
<br />
If i am going through a particularly nasty area with both live and undead mobs (e.g. ME) i sometimes put IVU up, just in case.</div></div><hr />

Summon your level 9 pet and chain-cast your level 22 undead nuke.  The pet won't take damage, and you'll slowly get your evocation skill up.  Mind you, if you are 30 and your EVOC is under 20 you are in for one painfully long process, as you will fizzle so often that you will get off one or two casts per bar of mana.  I don't know how long it took to get my evocation to 50 or 60, which is when fizzles become less of a problem and skill increases started to occur more often.  But it felt like it took forever.<br />
<br />
If you have some spare training points you might want to use enough of them to get your skill to 30 or 40.  Getting to 50 was a nightmare and even at level 41 my EVOC is 168.  For comparison's sake my Alteration is 207, Abjuration 198, Conjuration 191, and Divination 200.  I used to train them all up each level, but now I use most of the skills so they go up on their own except for Divination (use a CoS for invis) and Evocation.  Maybe when I start hunting some undead spots I'll finally break out the undead nukes, until then I'll try and max out Evocation by blasting my poor pet over and over and over . . .</div></div><hr />
