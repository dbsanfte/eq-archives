<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kelefane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">For some reason, I cant log into my own account but yet I can log into my brothers account on the same computer just fine.<br />
<br />
I client crash everytime right after I select my character and about to zone into EQ on my own account, but I can load up my bro's account/characters and play just fine. Weird.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts/ideas on what the problem maybe and possible solution?<br />
<br />
<br />
Much appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>logbash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Can you load up a different character on your account?  Might be due to the port EQ is using for the particular zone you're camped in.  Alot of internet providers block &quot;commonly used virus ports&quot;, just out of practice.  Bad thing is, that occasionally, EQ will use one of those ports for packet transfer.  ISP may be blocking that port for you.  If that's the case, say goodbye to your character until the next patch/server down.  Or, you can beg a GM to put you into another zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Skvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">More likely is your character file inside the EQ folder has become corrupt.  Try deleting the character files and trying again (pain in the ass unless you have made backup copies of them as you lose all your hotkeys and stuff :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Flanders</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Its not going to be a port issue.  Im almost 95% for certain almost all zones use the same ports.  Even if the port was blocked it wouldnt cause eq to crash it would cause your latency bar to turn red or say you have been dissconnected before you even popped into the zone.  <br />
<br />
Chances are good you can probably login to a different character, your best bet is to do that and contact a GM or SOE support, there could be upwards of 20 different reasons why this is happening and they would be the best people to tell you what those are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rargon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It could also be a corrupt zone file, if you know what zone you are camped in, delete it from your EQ directory and repatch.<br />
<br />
The most likely reason is corrupt character files or UI, back up both, delete and repatch...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vekanos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Is it possible that your character is in a zone/expansion that is not installed on that particular computer?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Khat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">First thing I would try is to make backups of the eqclient.ini and the char's .ini and then delete the originals.  They will be recreated at next load.<br />
<br />
If it fixes the problem you may need to redo any customization settings.<br />
If it doesn't correct it, delete the 2 new files it creates and rename the copies back to their original names.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Parasite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">- Zone File corrupt or non-existant on the computer you use. try deleting &amp; repatching.<br />
- UI that character runs with is outdated and sOo broken that it wont even let you load your default UI instead which can happen yup~<br />
- Character Info on the Server is broken. (I once had my Character getting corrupted while zoning.. in 3rd person it showed me wielding my weapon, else I was naked. but had stats like as if i was fully equipped.. wasnt able to unequip items tho or klick onc hest slot to exchange anything.. only left on my char was the money on bank.. had to get a GM rollback.<br />
- I would also check my journal files in your Everquest/UserData and delete /backup them perhaps... Didn't hear of issues with em yet, but you never know what sony gets broken next and wont fix :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kelefane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It was my UI /sigh. I guess my UI decided it wanted to stop working all the sudden. I deleted my old Drakah UI folder and bam! I could load my Characters up again.</div></div><hr />
