Bottom Line: You are the one drawing so much attention to me. If you think I'm such a prick, then stop obsesively reading my posts,  stop adding your two cents about EVERYTHING i say, and just stop making such a big fucking deal out of nothing.<br />
<br />
-Bick [/B] <br />
<br />
Bick, I have not posted a reply to you or said anything to you for quite a while now. There is no point to it, but I can and will agree with people who see you for the waste of bandwith that you are. And I will post to that effect. No one is impressed by your lame ass mother comments, or your links to pictures of random skaters with bad 70's haircuts that you claim are you. Nor your L33t d00DZp33!&lt; bullshit randomly inserted into any thread you can weasel your way into. <br />
<br />
You are the one who has added your &quot;two cents&quot; into every thread you can find, and not once actually added a goddam thing to any of them. You are the one who says that people &quot;make a big fucking deal out of nothing&quot; yet you are the quickest to start with the &quot;fuck your mom&quot; routine at the slightest hint of anyone saying anything negative about you.<br />
<br />
I ask you this &quot;Can you fucking read you white trash peice of shit?&quot; Because if you can maybe you would like to explain why you think that the rules of this board do not apply to you. You want to make lame ass comments about someones mother? You want to tell someone they &quot;SuXoRz d00DZ&quot;? Fine, do it where everyone else with a fucking fifth grade or above education does IN THIS FORUM. <br />
<br />
I give a shit less about you, what you say, whatever your obsession with mothers is, or how much of a &quot;l33t Sk8t3r&quot; you claim you are. What I am tired of is that every fucking post in the main arena, in the fucking armory, in the goddam spells and skills, IN EVERY MOTHERFUCKING FORUM ON THIS SITE has been befouled with your ignorance. <br />
<br />
So go ahead tough guy, lets hear the reason why you think you are so much better then all of us, and that you shouldn't have to follow the rules that the moderators of this site have requested.</div></div><hr />

Nothing pompous about him, he's just an asshole, another worthless internet board troll.<br />
<br />
The reason you missed a lot of his idiocy is because his first two accounts were banned and a number of his messages either locked or deleted.  Why the admins have not continued to ban him, I dunno.<br />
<br />
In any case, I just ignore him now.  The more people do that, the faster he will leave.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How stupid are some of you? This is a flame and rant forum, that is why I posted here. Comments like &quot;you for getting your panties in a bunch over it&quot; just prove how stupid you are. This is the place to go when you &quot;get your panties in a bunch&quot; You completely miss the point. I wouldn't piss on him if he was on fire. Which, since he is a flaming board troll, he needs to be pissed on by someone. <br />
<br />
I never said that I am not an ass Akeikyl, or a dipshit sarumuen, I can be a huge fucking asshole when I want to, but I have the respect for the rest of the people who visit this space to &quot;take the fight outside&quot; so to speak. Many others also abide by these rules, I just want to know why Bick feels they don't apply to him.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seriously though, besides the &quot; A GM friend told me CoS's are going to be nerfed next patch so you better sell yours&quot; post, he really hasn't been that offensive.  That was enough to ban him, but since that he's simply been a mild troll: a kid that keeps forgetting to take his Ritalin at best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pheargore</div><div class="date">01-16-2003, 02:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That linked thread just shows how much a few SK's hate Druids.. Bick got pissed and told them to fuck off.  I would too if I were him.<br />
<br />
That said, druid still suck ;)<br />
<br />
As far as the other post.. GM said CoS being nerfed so sell it crap.. Is that all it was?<br />
<br />
I see posts like, &quot;Epic v2.0 is in game, Reliable source told me&quot; Do these people get banned?<br />
<br />
And what if a GM lied to poor innocent little Bick.. And he was coming here to save us from a 15k??-30k?? loss.. We should be thankful ;)<br />
<br />
My point is, anyone who sells their CoS cause someone posts a GM told them they were gonna nerf it is pretty retarded.<br />
<br />
Rule #1 states no posting about its use, not about the item itself or the cast time or its state in Verant's eyes...<br />
<br />
But without reading the CoS post, I can not say what Bick was doing. <br />
<br />
Lastly, if someone posts about CoS and is not aware of Rule #1, how are they guilty? I seen a lot of new members come in and break the rule, get corrected and fall into line behind the other 500+ jaded assholes here ;).<br />
<br />
Maybe Bick didn't know about rule #1?<br />
<br />
Anyway maybe he and the mods can answer these questions and then this nonsense can be cleared up and closed publicly so everyone can live in Evil Harmony! Don't act like chickens<br />
<br />
- Peace</div></div><hr />

Harmony, even with evil ahead of it, has no place on the SK boards let alone your vocabulary! Were did you learn that word ? The boys at school ? Go up to your room and wash your mouth out with 14 year old scotch!</div></div><hr />

When judging actions, the consequence of the action and the intent of that action are both taken into account.</div></div><hr />

It's not like it is hidden somewhere, or vague or anything. I've said before, that personally i think that rule #1 is a bit overboard, but since I assumed that posting here meant that you agreed to the rules set by the mods, I have never bitched about it. <br />
<br />
It's not my fault if someone doesn't know the rules, and 9 out of 10 times when someone violates them, there is at least a few replies in the thread with a link to the actual rule in question.<br />
<br />
Seriously, some of the rules may be considered harsh to some, but so far they have worked to keep this the best class specific site out there. Sad that in the last few weeks, one poster, and multiple peoples reactions to him (yes I know this includes me) has turned every other thread into a steaming pile of turds. I really am sorry for my part in it, but honestly did not expect it to keep on for this long, once again I am partly to blame. <br />
<br />
So, I offer my apoplogies for wasting all of your time, and making you each just a little bit dumber.</div></div><hr />

I'll make sure to remind you that you said that the next time you post another whiny rant about me in oh, 10 minutes or so. <br />

Those are both posts from the 2nd page of this thread. Now read rezzbaggs post right above this one.<br />

There will allways somebody posting stuff and telling there friends like WHOW, look at me, they made a thread to flame ME, i am so uber etcetc...<br />
<br />
I stopped giving a shit about these boardtrolls unless they start posting really disturbing and offensive shit. Only boring thing is seeing the dumb comments in allmost every thread you try to read. <br />
<br />
So i actually dont give a shit if bick is banned or not, he is atm an annoying part of the community, like most communities have a shitty part. Just hoping he would cut down the number of posts he does in every thread and i think most of us can live with him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azariah</div><div class="date">01-16-2003, 07:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Earlier today, I was doing some searches on old threads about haste items and shit, and I noticed that Bick used to have constructive and helpful posts.  Once in particular, he actually took a moment to help someone decide which haste item would be most fitting for his gear / income.<br />
<br />
Since then, he's become obnoxious and deconstructive.  He goes out of his way to be annoying, and floods our board (which for the last 3 years I've found to be relatively mature and helpful) with shit that is neither helpful, nor entertaining.<br />
<br />
Bick, if you'd just grow the hell up, and stop being such a festering asscunt, we'd all really appreciate it.  As it stands, I suggest the mods offer him just that choice: <br />
<br />
Grow the fuck up, or shut the fuck up.<br />

People like bick are the ones that ruin this board every day, i remember a time when this board was full of just good info and good players, and it was a good learning enviorment for even ppl like bick, unfortently the masses have taken over.<br />
<br />
Now we have the uber leet, whose guild gets owned in HoT every other weekend, commenting on the end game, or the n00bish lvl 60 who is certain a quading wiz cant out solo him, or the lvl 45 sk bitching about warriors tanking better, and the list goes on.<br />
<br />
To that we add the countless posts of the same lame ass info and questions about ac, taunt, what is better MoSS or a Mith 2h, etc etc etc.<br />
<br />
The point of the story is, that this board is not a god given right to all of us, its a privelage and it should be take as such, before asking a lame ass question use the fucking search function, before you post your dumbass views make sure your sources are semi ledgit at least, and finally stop fuckign talkign out of ur ass, we were all n00bz once, but that doesnt mean u have to stay a n00b, fucking listen and respect ur elders u migth fucking learn something.</div></div><hr />

Heh, I know that has to be a bad thing...<br />
<br />
Seriously though, is there really a need to have 3 threads in the flame forum about Bick? Can't we all just keep the animosity contained within one single thread? I know Bick is a very important topic and all, but we have other important stuff to talk about in the flame forum, such as blowjobs and shit. Sheesh...</div></div><hr />

People actually ask questions there, and I don't get flamed if I answer. Here if I make a post, no matter what it is, I get the 6 posts of &quot;STFU BRIK U R A FAGGOT!1&quot; underneath mine.<br />

And no, I'm not saying that about everyone, because there are a lot of posters here who I respect and/or think are funny as hell.<br />

But, you just spent 10 minutes typing, 5 minutes making sure it was spelled right and the grammar was correct, and a few seconds to hit the post button.  Blah blah blah, I'm right!  No one gives a shit...why the hell does this guy get such a fucking rise out of everyone?  HI, IGNORE HIM?  Ever hear of that?<br />
