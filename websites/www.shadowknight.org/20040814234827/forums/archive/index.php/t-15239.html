<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>LoganHex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have just completed the last portion of the Erudite shadowknight Fell Blade quests and thought I would share my experience with those who wish to undertake these trials as well.<br />
<br />
These quests are given out by the blacksmith Faratain at location number fifteen in Paineel (take a right out of the guildmaster hall and enter the first door on your left for those of you who do not have access to a map). <br />
<br />
There are three major components to most of these quests. They are kobold pelts, bricks of crude bronze and calcified bones.<br />
<br />
Allakhazam states that the bricks of crude bronze as well as the various kobold pelts may be obtained off of the kobolds in Paineel, Toxxulia Forest and the Warrens. This information is incorrect to the best of my knowledge. Unless the drops are unbelievably rare you will never find thim in Toxxulia or Paineel. As a matter of fact the appearance of kobolds in Paineel seem to be rather rare in and of itself. In thirteen levels I have only seen them in the newbie zone twice. Once during the day and once at night. If they are triggered there I have no idea how to trigger them.<br />
<br />
So that leaves the Warrens which is where you are going to get all of your bricks of crude bronze and kobold pelts. Oddly enough I have found that the lower level kobolds yield the most loot. I retrieved more bricks of crude bronze off of the runts and the guards than I did off of the rabid and fierce. Another oddity (in my opinion at least) is that the intact pelts drop far more often than the ruined pelts do. <br />
<br />
Obtaining the ruined and intact pelts as well as the bricks of crude bronze is relatively easy and not all that time consuming. Just hang around the entrance and pull there. As far as the pristine pelt is concerned I was unable to obtain one from a kobold. I eventually broke down and bought mine off of another player who happened across it for twenty five platinum pieces.<br />
<br />
As an added bonus you will see a lot of kobold molars drop. Hold on to these as you can turn them in to Royal Guard Lilkus at location number one in Paineel. I have found that about one in every ten turn in yields a random piece of ring mail armor. If you get lucky you will acquire a piece of armor for a slot not covered by the Fell Blade pieces you will create. I never got lucky. I got duplicate slot drops and ended up selling them for a few platinum apiece.<br />
<br />
That brings us to the calcified bones. I went about this two ways. First of all Allakhazam says that the calcified parts will drop of of calcified skeletons in Toxxulia Forest. This is only partially true as there are no calcified skeletons in Toxxulia. The bones will drop off of regular skeletons (not decaying either). There are a couple of problems pertaining to the hunting of the skeletons in these parts.<br />
<br />
The first is that there is no set spawn point. All of the skeletons spawn randomly and wander. If you are of the ninth level you will have the Sense the Dead spell which will assist you in tracking them down. This leads you to your second problem. There are two skeletal miners at the entrance to Paineel as well as an abandoned heretic pet who will wander through the mining tunnel to just off the platform. Nine out of ten Sense the Dead spells pointed me right back towards Paineel while I was on the Paineel side of the river. Not exactly helpful.<br />
<br />
So then I tried the Erudin side and no longer had a problem with the Paineel skeletal crew. The problem with this strategy is that the Erudin half of Toxxulia Forest is the weaker side. Nine out of ten Sense the Dead spells on this side led me to decaying skeletons which were not particularly helpful at all.<br />
<br />
So then I decided to try Nektulos Forest. There are two places to hunt here which are beneficial. The first is the graveyard which is right outside of the Lavastorm zoneline. I wuld not really reccomend this area as you will be prone to attracting adds, there are no set spawn points and there are a couple of higher level undead wandering about (the steward and the annal keeper spring to mind immediately) who will put a serious hurting on you.<br />
<br />
Which brings us to the monolith which is right outside of the Eastern Commonlands zoneline. I found this place to be preferable. There are four set spawn points at the monolith all of which will yield undead. Regular skeletons are the most common spawn (regular skeletons will not drop calcified bones in Nektulos) but you will also see calcified skeletons as well as greater skeletons spawn here rather regularly as well (both of which drop calcified bones). The only problems you are likely to find here is the occasional zombie or mummy spawn (of which the mummy is the most dangerous). If you have all of your spells intact as well as your skeletal minion by your side than you should be able to take anything that comes your way. Keep harm touch up as much as possible just incase you get the rare yellow conning mummy spawn (I think the highest level the mummies achieve is twelve). <br />
<br />
You will also get the occasional wandering mob springing a surprise attack on you. Sometimes it actually proves beneficial as I had been jumped by calcified as well as greater skeletons a number of times. Every once in a while a deathfist orc will wander over (which should not be a problem as even the templar was dispatched with relative ease thanks to a well trained bashing skill). The one you really have to watch out for is the young kodiak who will rip you up. Thankfully the zoneline is close by and your skeletal minion will hold off any adversaries long enough for you to make a quick get away.<br />
<br />
Once you have obtained all of your quest items the combines are rather simplistic as they are no fail.<br />
<br />
This completes the armor portion of the quest. Now you have to put together the Fell Blade Cutlass.<br />
<br />
You will need a few items for this. The first of which is the Clan Kolbok Blacksmith Traditions. This is dropped by the kobold master blacksmith (not the named blacksmith Rrarrgin) in the Warrens. Information on his location is sketchy over at Allakhazam and I fear I cannot provide any verifiable information here either. I do not know if he has a set spawn point or is a triggered mob. When I found him he was actually in the waterway (to the left of the entrance) swimming around. I do not know if he spawned there, wandered there or was pulled there but when I saw him I jumped right on him. He conned dark blue at level thirteen and did consistent damage in the twenties. Fortunately he missed a lot when he swung so I was able to get off multiple lifetaps. He never ran when his health got low which can only be a bonus considering what a train station the Warrens can be.<br />
<br />
Once you get the traditions bring them back to Faratain. He will give you the Dull Fell Blade Cutlass. Sharpen this up in a forge with a sharpening stone. Finding them is near impossible. I eventually had to bribe a human warrior over in Western Freeport to go snag some for me.<br />
<br />
The last two items you will need are a large briar snake skin and a petrified eyeball. The large briar snake skin is the easier of the two to obtain. Snakes are all over the place in Toxxulia. I got my skin on my first snake kill (oddly enough off of a giant briar snake rather than a large one so I am not sure if it always drops off of the giant or if it can drop off of both).<br />
<br />
The petrified eyeball drops off of a fading spectre (a somewhat rare spawn). It spwans randomly and wanders as well (only on the Paineel side to the best of my knowledge). After spending sometime wandering around the forest to no avail I finally set up camp at one of the kobold holdings (location number eight on the map) because the undead seem to wander around this area for some reason. Bingo. Got my spectre there.<br />
<br />
Turn in your items to Faratain again and he will give you the Fell Blade Cutlass.<br />
<br />
Hopefully this will be of some help to those of you who want to run untwinked Erudite shadowknights like myself. Good luck.</div></div><hr />
