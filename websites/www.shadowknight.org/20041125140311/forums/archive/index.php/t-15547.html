<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>scpio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was going to post in the broken or bugged section but its not class orientied rather universialy game orirented.<br />
frankly i am tired of no feedback from the dev team on the current range of problems so here goes:<br />
in no particular order of importance -<br />
<br />
1. charm bug - get charmed after it breaks you no longer can do damage or spells untill the mob is dead in certain cases not recive experiance either.<br />
<br />
2. the LOS bug for all Ele planes there is no reason for this its an open zone.<br />
<br />
3. the horse summoned indoors by accident and spells being grayed out permantnely bug<br />
<br />
4. the sayrn zone crash bug<br />
<br />
5. the corinav repop timer upon failure should not be 3 days, it should be 1 day like emp sra, the event is to easy to screw up and penalizes the rest of the server for one guilds failure.<br />
<br />
6. there should be a helm turn in NPC for elemental and ornate helms to show a visible graphic. concurently you should also be able to return it for a non graphic helm.<br />
<br />
7. either decrease the drops of ornate armor or UPGRADE the drop / success rate of tradeskill items for high end (teir 3 and 4) blacksmithing and tailoring tradeskillers. the current rate is destroying the risk vs reward of those who invested time in the skills. i would prefer more tradeskill drops and successes. i belive the rate of any decent melee armor entering the game is to low.<br />
<br />
8. there is no reason why a group / trash only tuant button cannot  be made for warriors that wont work on boss mobs but will on trash mob to improve the viability of the class. <br />
<br />
9. ele armor drops increase the drop table to include one more drop per mob. at the rate of guilds entering the elements no guild can even hope to be equiped in any time close to Xmas to engage god targets. everyone understand timesinks but this barrier will drive players from the game.<br />
<br />
10 the melee options for POP wpn wise is a joke make this a priority. pure casters (both Int and wis) have tons of decent upgrades spell wise and held item wise, melee have mabey 1 or 2 per class for all of teir 3-4.<br />
<br />
11. the final arbitor of earth for POE A should not go for a stroll outside of his lair and fall to the bottom of the zone when he is triggared.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Damphere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">2. the LOS bug for all Ele planes there is no reason for this its an open zone.<br />
<br />
<br />
LOS should be implimented in all elemental planes...  People were abusing the hell out of this in places like plane of time.<br />
<br />
You could clear the wind cycle, then nuke mobs in other areas.  If 18 people were in that event you could not be summoned regardless of how much agro you generated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Feriin Cydovu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Don't forget the up arrow acting like the num luck key. This problem only happened for me after they &quot; fixxed it&quot;..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Slagnath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">yea the up key acting like num lock thing is anoying. it makes it a pain in the ass to kite and talk, or move mobs and talk.<br />
<br />
if they ment to do it, then they damn well better put an option to turn it off.<br />
<br />
it already dropped me in the soup at katta heh.<br />
<br />
-slaggy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sarrasis Darkmist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">LFG dropping when you zone needs to be fixed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The utterly useless effects on our Ornate BP and Greaves.<br />
<br />
Other classes get useful spells, yet we get Cloak of Ahkeva and Shroud of Death. Two spells someone capalbe of getting Ornate armor will never use. Seems like the armor was designed by someone that does not play an SK.<br />
<br />
This really needs to be fixed.<br />
<br />
Suggestions:<br />
<br />
BP: Voice of Terris<br />
<br />
Legs: Mental Curruption<br />
<br />
Still lower level spells, but ones we might actually use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Naubi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">3. the horse summoned indoors by accident and spells being grayed out permantnely bug <br />
<br />
I worked out how to fix this without /q ing or zoning (im sure others have too)... you just need to proc something and your spell gems will refresh etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Manr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">&quot;decrease the drops of ornate armor&quot;<br />
<br />
You must be joking.<br />
<br />
Regarding Ornate legging and BP, I already sent the feedback.  Those effects are completely useless and no one who gets Ornate legs or BP will use them.  And you are correct about other classes actually getting effects they would use.  For example Paladin legging and BP have effects they use at level 65.<br />
<br />
Other SKs should feedback this as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The effects on ornate legs and bp were about as big a joke as the color that were assigned to them.  Useless effects, and they made them pink.  Insulting to say the least.  But we are SKs, they really dont care about the SK class much.  Look at how long IC was broken where it would harm instead of heal.  Sure wasnt a priority to fix that.<br />
<br />
You can ask for effects to be changed to something useful, but you are asking the same people that already came up with something they thought was useful.  Can they screw them up worse?  I bet they can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">1. Didn't know about that one.<br />
<br />
2. LoS needs to be in every zone or none at all, they're putting it in every zone, fine with me.<br />
<br />
3. Will be fixed soon I would assume.<br />
<br />
4. Thought this was fixed<br />
<br />
5. Leave it the way it is, make other triggered spawns that aren't already this way the same.<br />
<br />
6. Wouldn't mind this, but its not something i would be upset without.<br />
<br />
7. Ornate/tradeskill armor drop rates right now are perfect<br />
<br />
8. Yes there is, warrior taunt as it is, is already high if not to good<br />
<br />
9. The further you get in the game the less mobs drop, be glad you arent in time atleast you get 2 items+runes in elementals.<br />
<br />
10. Ornate Greatblade, Stone Etched War Sword, Earthspined Staff, Opalescent Two-handed Sword, Gem Axe, Heavy Bludgeoner, and a few others... thats more than 2<br />
<br />
11. Didn't know about that, if its true it needs fixed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Rykor Bloodscream</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hell, even if they don't wanna give us spells on our BP/Legs...give us a frickin' caster focus.  Mana Preservation IV anyone?  Or how about Improved Damage IV.....mmmm, I.D. IV :p <br />
<br />
Warriors and Monks, etc get the Arcane Shield...free HP gain, so their BP is actually worthwhile when there isn't BSS.  Someone in my guild said: lets do water tower named for the BP mold...I'm like: I'd rather do water mini downstairs for the boot mold :D  Or Elif for the Arms mold :p</div></div><hr />

1. charm bug - get charmed after it breaks you no longer can do damage or spells untill the mob is dead in certain cases not recive experiance either.<br />
  <br />
<br />
Press ESC to clear your target bar and then target and you'll be able to attack again unless they've changed something else recently.</div></div><hr />
