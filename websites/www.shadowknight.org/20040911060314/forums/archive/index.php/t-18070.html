<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Darknyz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anyone done this fight recently ?  I am wondering what kind of forces I will need.  My room mates guild is time equiped and plans on helping ( how ever many I am going to need ).  Honestly I did glhomor with 1 group.  Not sure if this is common.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Could use any insight regarding strats and #'s of people.  At the moment I think I plan to use the rune strat with enchs doing a rune chain on the MT to absorb the taps as well as the Spell Shield wizards.   Thanks again<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lynxal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I did not fight him in his human form after turn in but we killed him two weeks ago when screwing around in CoM with 4 level 65 characters....cleric, shaman, enchanter, SK.<br />
<br />
I would not get too hung up on strategy it's a massively trivialized encounter at this point.........I was the only melee with the 4 characters so needles to say DPS was far from impressive.  We could have cut the fight in half if the Cleric would have been swinging.  The only annoying thing was he started walking away at low health and wandered a bit before I could kill him.<br />
<br />
The chanter and I could have duod it for as much help as the other two were.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Maranthus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">In his form after turn in he is most definately not trivial.  My epic fight with him was witnessed by 30 toons.  It was most definately overkill, but do you really want to start your epic over?  No way would I want to face him with less then 3 full groups, all over 60.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>yuggoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The ghosty lhranc is not anything like the post-turnin lhranc..... that 500pt DD proc with almost every hit is nasty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Darknyz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">2-3 group doable ? or should I get a full force ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Space</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I did lhranc on sunday with about 14 ep guildmates, was overkill and he died within a minute but a cocky cleric and paladin got smushed hard by his constant stream of 500dd procs.  Hell the Warrior with nearly 10k hp went zerker twice cause clerics underestimated lhrancs dps hehe.<br />
<br />
My suggestion 2 balanced groups with a cleric and a spot healer in each group<br />
or<br />
4 sk's with 8k ht's ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>cauchy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">you could use a WS ranger too, if your raidwide DPS is over 2k.  Innate procs don't happen on misses.  Otherwise, it's all about spam heals -- I think you could do it with 2-3 grps just fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sorack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I 2-boxed my sk and my ranger.<br />
After handing in with my SK, I FD-ed, then chain snared with my ranger and activated Weaponshield as soon as I started taking hits. One mana burner and about 6 other people for DPS and Lhranc was dead in under 20 seconds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>velin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">DId Lhranc today on the Rathe with 8 people.  2 lv 65 SK's,65 ranger, 65 shaman, 65 cleric, 2 lv 65 rogues and a 65 druid.  FIght lasted 1 min at the most. (now just need to do my Green Mist next)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Hudroponik_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I did him about 3 weeks ago with 2 solid groups .. and we were raped hard (60+) <br />
<br />
his melee is a joke at best, i think i got hit for 100 and 200 at best .. the HT is something to laugh ayt as well , 1.2k i think and not chain, its kinda random 5 min refresh or so.  <br />
<br />
Now the hard part is the chain AE (possably) lifetap proc crap thats chain casted and hits ALL the time, i think with 300+ MR at the time i was still taking in 200+ DD from it .. its sick fast is the problem, 7.2kHP at the time and i got raped.  I boxed a 63 CLR and all i could do was chain cast fast cast heals.  <br />
<br />
Your BEST bet is to grab a WIZ or two and toss in like 3 AM3 rangers.  He doesnt have many HPs as my 7.2k HT kicked his ass.  Watch the casters and no one should stop hitting even at 1% ..  hard ? no , but one hell of a pain in the ass.  I wish i had a few parts of the log to post to show you how fast the fight can go .. but alas , i perge them to make long-term parsing faster.</div></div><hr />
