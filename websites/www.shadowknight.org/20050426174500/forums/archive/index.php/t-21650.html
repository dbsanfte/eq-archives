<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kassdax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been working on the Khuri quests from the beginning. I'm finally to the part where Dalnir is on my hitlist. However, after talking to several people about all the casters in there I'm a tad leary about venturing in now.<br />
<br />
Would anybody be willing to tell me about where my resists should be in order to not get blasted into nothingness?<br />
<br />
Part two of this post probably belongs in the armory area but I didn't want to cross post (sorry if this annoy's anybody). Currently I can get a full set of diamond/blue diamond resist gear for:<br />
<br />
Velium diamond ring(s): 400pp each<br />
Velium blue diamond wrist(s): 500pp each<br />
Blue diamond electrum earring(s): 300pp each<br />
Golden blue diamond pendant: 300pp<br />
Platinum blue diamond tiara: 500pp<br />
Golden diamond mask: 250pp<br />
<br />
Are there other good options for resists a mainly solo level 34 sk could get through a quest? or other gear that's generally overlooked in the bazaar due to having some kind of sk (or sk/pally) only tag on it? I'm looking for something cheap because getting a full set of the gear listed above will break the bank (thank god for foraging so I'll be able to eat).<br />
<br />
1) Include an up-to-date Magelo Profile, with correct skills, AA, etc.<br />
In the sig<br />
<br />
2) Include a specific budget. Don't just make a general statement like &quot;cheap upgrades&quot; as it's too subjective. Note that this does not mean your current bankroll. A budget is how much you can and are willing to spend, not necessarily how much is in the bank right now. <br />
Let's say 2k after the above is purchased.<br />
<br />
3) Briefly describe your available killing force. Numbers, progression, and standard targets. Saying &quot;I'm in a guild that's RZ away from elemental&quot; for example, doesn't help me. I need to have an idea of what you are killing, and what you could be killing. <br />
Solo, maybe get a 35 beastlord on a rare occasion but am not counting on it.<br />
<br />
4) Mention your playtime/playstyle. Tell whether your willing to work on tradeskills or quests, or if you spend much time in LDoN. <br />
Prefer to group/ldon but with my middle of the day playtime I tend to solo 90%+ of the time. Quests are fun....hence I'm doing this one. I do some minor trade skilling but mainly just to make money (leather padding, baked goods) but am always on the lookout for advice if it'll help me advance in any way.<br />
