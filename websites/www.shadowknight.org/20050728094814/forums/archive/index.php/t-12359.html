<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ZaithFV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, I think there are way to few shadow knight quests, for all seasons. I have scrounged around Allakazams, Shadow Knight Den, Everlore and Caster Realms and only found a few but there are so very few. <br />
<br />
Considering how many quests Paladins have, for all seasons, there are just so very few. <br />
<br />
I started playing a shadow knight because I havent play one in the 4 years I have been playing EQ. I have tested all classes, for the most part, and enjoy playing a shadow knight. But I am playing one as my alt. I have this same feeling twards rogues, since I have played a rogue since EQ opened. Not many quests for rogues either.<br />
<br />
The game is called EverQUEST, not EverLOOT. Every class should have quests for equipment, weapons and items during every season. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Requiam O'Souls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Meant to respond sooner.<br />
<br />
One of the reasons I love the Shadowknight class, is that completely untwinked you can equip yourself very well.<br />
<br />
<br />
For the &lt;40 crowd, you can obtain a very nice weapon. The Soul Lance, considering SK's don't obtain a leach spell until 49 it's great. (especially considering the spell quest costs 3k :p)<br />
<br />
Then there's the Greenmist, scaleable for all levels once faction is attained. This will last you a good long while.<br />
<br />
All the while once you hit 35 you can work toward your epic, obtaining Darkforge armor. IC is a nice weapon, especially if you don't have 10-30k just lying around.<br />
<br />
If you still seek quests for weapons, though not exclusive to SK's there is this quest:<br />
<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=6453<br />
<br />
For a Ethereal Bladed Naginata.<br />
<br />
Some say getting to 175 smithing sucks, well so does camping something for 3/4 months. Save up your pp and work it up, getting to 175 isn't that hard. Pottery to 128 is a joke.<br />
<br />
But, this is only my opinion. I'm certain others will have different opinions :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>ZaithFV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well the problem with this is that I am having a hard hard time finding quests for the lower season knights. <br />
<br />
I've done a few but most of my equipment has been given or bought in the bazaar. <br />
<br />
Once I get to 30, I will be doing my dark forge quests and others that I can do..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Requiam O'Souls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Then the soulfield lance, and the beginning of Greenmist are within your means with some healer/chanter support.<br />
<br />
The hardest parts of starting Greenimst is faction, and marauders and pariahs are within your means at the moment.<br />
<br />
<br />
-edit<br />
<br />
I spellz gud</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>ZaithFV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Alright,<br />
<br />
So I can go pick up Kunark and start whackin on the Cabilis faction. But I read the quest right, dont I need the newbie weapon that the Iksar shadow knights get? <br />
<br />
Maybe Im reading it wrong..<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jobrill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yes, but you can either do the penance quest to get your own Iksar newbie weapon (I believe Squire Grizzle starts it for SKs), or you can make a level 1 Iksar newbie SK and multiquest his 1st Khukri (I.e., do the 2nd Khukri quest, he turns in the Khukri, you turn in the rest of stuff and get the 2nd Khukri)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>ZaithFV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I cant seem to find the quest for the Soul Fiend Lance on Allakazams..<br />
<br />
Ok, well I just need to pick up Kunark now..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nyrvel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">For new Dark Elf Shadowknights only, there is the Bone Mail Armor Quest as well as a Weapon/Shield quest (you get both from the Guild trainer). The quest took me from 1st to roughly 15th level to accomplish. The items are all No Drop and Lore (Bracers are not Lore):<br />
<br />
Bone Mail Helm - 5AC 0.8Wgt +1DEX +1INT +3HP<br />
Bone Mail Bracer - 4AC 1.5Wgt +1STR +3HP<br />
Bone Mail Vambraces - 5AC 1.8Wgt +2STR +1DEX<br />
Bone Mail Gauntlets - 5AC 1.8Wgt +2STR +1INT<br />
Bone Mail Breastplate - 12AC 4.5Wgt +1STR +1INT +5HP <br />
Bone Mail Greaves - 6AC 4.4Wgt +1STR +2STA<br />
Bone Mail Boots - 5AC 3.0Wgt +2STA +1INT<br />
Bone Hilted Long Sword - 1HS 5Dmg 30Dly 8.5Wgt +1 STR +1INT <br />
Scaled Femur Shield - 7AC 2.5Wgt +1INT +1SVDis +1SVPoi</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zakton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I agree that the lower level quests are lacking in EQ but given their idea of what is &quot;overpowering&quot; they probably aren't going to change it.  Old world is exactly that Old.   They aren't  going to monkey with it since they know they break stuff more often then fix stuff.   You have the bone mail quests those take a few levels to do.  Also if you want you can collect fire beetle eyes for that guy in third gate.   Or if you care about your bard faction you can try and deliver the mail from two tone.   Also you can do the rogue quest where you have to get an item from the Freeport bay that is guarded by a shark.  Or if your real guttsy you can get wolf form and try to turn in orc belts, the scary part being that wolf form is on a random timer.  Shade weavers thicket has a bunch of quests.  Or how about turning in Greater lightstones to mira in NK for faction and coin?  Want anymore quests?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>ZaithFV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Those are nice quests for a lower season shadow knight. I am 24, almost 25 now. I just completed my Soulfiend Lance quest. <br />
<br />
I am curious what season the lance starts to proc at though. <br />
<br />
Yes, I know my dark forge armor is next and the Greemist will be an on going project.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Requiam O'Souls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Proc's at 25 I believe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Zakton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Unfortunately for any quests around the level 30 range or higher all involve either lots of tradeskills, lots of time to camp spawns, or lots of work doing errands (think coldain ring).   And yes your right there are no real SK only quests for us they decided they would rather have us camp ubah rare mobs for our gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>ZaithFV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">joygasm falls very very short of what I was thinking of</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kalendrox Grimblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Someone wrote up an awesome quest for a weapon similar to the natures defender.  Its buried somewhere, and im too lazy to search for it.  Whoever wrote it has way too much spare time.</div></div><hr />

As far as the quest: http://forums.shadowknight.org/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=4450&amp;highlight=Fell+Blade<br />
<br />
Still waiting for SoE to get back to me on implementing it dammit. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>ZaithFV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I read that quest and it sounds really cool. It would be nice if SOE would actually read player written quests and impliment them, because they are normaly well written and not exactly easy.</div></div><hr />
