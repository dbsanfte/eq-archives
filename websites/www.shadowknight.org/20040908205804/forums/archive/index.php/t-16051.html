<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I finally decided to go up to hate, with my duo box and a friend duoing his as well. 12 Drakes down no drops, I figure another 150+ more to go! Will keep you updated. Do these things spawn slow or were we just unlucky. We did zone in, and I only saw these 12 in about 5 hours of clearing out the front few rooms.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Auronan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You are actually fighting the double whammy for these mobs and this drop in particular because not many drakes generally spawn up there AND the hide is a very rare drop. For my Epic, I had to go on over a 100 hate raids (before the plane was toned down) so it can be lengthy to get the hide....</div></div><hr />

A friend told me he got his hide from a hatebone drake, not from an ashenbone drake. Is there any truth in there ? Can anyone confirm this ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Make that 15 and counting.</div></div><hr />

I have been hearing that both drakes can drop it. Maybe it's more common off the hatebones, since they are higher level?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Goregan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">fyi i got mine from the 3rd drake AT zone in, just up those small set of stairs to the right near the zone in well. so at least now you know its possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Talonmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've never seen it off a Hatebone, but then again I've never seen it off an Ashenbone either, since revamp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dester</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">200+ drakes now and counting ... Ive seen just about every other epic quest piece drop in Hate now except for the hide.  In fact i have the Rogue book and the Mage staff for MQ to guidies.<br />
<br />
On a side note, I have yet to see the minor signit of the knight drop for the new range items, or the one for pure melee. Yet I have seen probably 10 sorrcerer and 15 priest drop.<br />

Guess Im just that unlucky.<br />

The next time I see a Mage staff drop (I've seen four so far) or an Essence of Vampire (at least two), I think I'm going to hold it hostage until someone can bring me my freakin' Hide. I've gone from 55 to 61 and gained six or eight AA's in Hate (at least 90% of that time, anyway) without ever seeing the one thing I went up there for. I knew going in that the drop rate was insanely low, but holy crap! This is something you just have to experience to appreciate. I just keep telling myself how much sweeter it will make it when (if) one finally does drop for me. But then the Fear grind will start.<br />

I've seen all of the signets drop multiple times, it just never seems to be the one you're looking for. Just about everyone in my guild has the first range gem, and several of us are holding extra pieces for those that don't. Now we're working on the second gem, but i don't think I've seen anything other than sorcerer's crests drop yet. No hide, no knight's crest... something about the mobs in Hate, they just don't want to give anything up for Shadow Knights.<br />
<br />
And what's up with the rot timers up there? I've seen several mobs (including Drakes) with the 30-minute decay timer like they've got something important on them, but they aren't holding anything at all. Is that a bug, or what?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Talonmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">All mobs over a certain level (55 I think) have a 30 min corpse rot timer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Only if there's an item or money on the corpse.  A completely empty corpse has a 30second rot timer.</div></div><hr />
