<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Matrix_Chicken273</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I havent been able to decide the answer to my big question: Necro or SK ? I'm going to remake my troll warrior because I feel he is just too weak, and needs spells. I want a good soloing class. I've heard necros can solo better than SKs, but can't SKs make for for their loss of spells by meleeing ? In that case I think they would be just as good soloers. Anyways, any help / input would be helpful, and thanks in advance =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Oagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Necros outsolo SK's by a longshot.  They are arguably one of/if not the best solo classes.   DoTs, nukes, debuffs, lich, fd, and a very nasty pet in the later levels makes them quite formidable soloists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>nimic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If your looking to solo more then group, Necro &gt; SK.   Necros are completely self sufficient.  SKs have no easy way to recoup mana until the 50s - Necros get mana recoup spells much earlier on.  Also, while our lifetaps will help keep your hitpoints up, they are a very small percentage of your hitpoints compared to a necros.  As an SK soloing, you will have a LOT of downtime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kuvak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I agree. If you want to solo a lot, the only choice is Necro. The only thing an SK can do better than a necro is tank. If you solo, you're much better off letting your pet tank rather than you, since you can heal your pet, but no one would heal you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Darcloakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Necros can solo very easily compared to a Sk or any other.  I have noticed at later lvls and in ldons not too many people are looking for necros so plan to solo alot. As a Sk i never have a problem finding a group as a tank or another melee.  I also soloed alot using a Fungi tunic and it was very easy up until lvl 50.  As much as i liked soloing, when i was in groups it was much more fun then being alone.  One of my friends who has a 55 necro has been stuck at 55 cause its hard for her to find groups cause evreyone wants a cleric, druid, chanter, or shammy as their casters.  Just a heads up as a necro its a ton of fun but can get lonely, the great thing about eq is grouping imo.  If u like to solo then necro it is but plan on soloing alot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Matrix_Chicken273</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Wow input has been great so far :D Not much to say except for thanks for all your help =) Also, couldnt Sks make up for their small mana pool by meleeing ? Like, couldn't they solo as well as necros if they just melee-ed ? It seems like the answer is no, but I just wanna know why SKs can't solo by fear kiting / meleeing ... Other than that, your input has been great :D I think I am going to make a DE necro now... maybe iksar, but I  already have an iksar BST and I like keeping to 1 of a race (don't ask it's a balance thing) <br />
<br />
thanks for everything :D :D :D :D :D :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Oagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you just want to solo, be a necro, mage, wiz, druid, maybe bl.  You want groups, be an sk, shammy, cleric, chanter.  However, no class is worth a shit if you don't know how to play it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Matrix_Chicken273</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Would a necro be better at soloing than a mage /druid ? io currently have a 24 druid... but was thinking of trying out a necro, because I heard they could solo better than any of the classes. Any info on this ? I just wanna make a good farming class:D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>DiggleDoggyfeets</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Have a 65 druid and a 60 necro. I've found that they are pretty equal solo classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Vost</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have a 57 SK, but my main is a level 65 necromancer currently with 92aa. <br />

With my necromancer, I solo camps in halls of honor almost as efficiently as some full groups do. I also solo some mobs that I have watched multiple groups wipe on, like Black Reavers in City of Mist. As someone else said, a necromancer is pretty much a self-sufficient class if played well. A large % of teh EQ population does not realize how useful necromancers can be in LDoN or other groups untill they get a good one in a group with them. We add some very good DPS on mobs that have large amount of HP, we also can be very good pullers, and have a variety of utility spells that can be helpful if not lifesaving in different situations.(like the ability to FD on a bad pull and rez the cleric back in on LDoN hard missions)<br />
<br />
With a shadow knight it is possible to solo by fear kiting and meleeing. However a shadow knight does not have the mana regeneration to sustain this for more than 1 or *maybe* 2 kills before going OOM. A shadow knight fear kiting *might* be able to kill a given mob faster than a lone necro of same level could but the shadow knight is likely going to be sitting on his butt for teh next 10 minutes getting mana back to do another, while the necro keeps on killing. For groups though the shadow knight is far more in demand.<br />
<br />
Just a word of caution though, some levels for a necro are a down right pain in the arse, the epic is almost as tough as the SK epic, some of the higher level spells rae extremely rare and very expensive when you can find them, and despite being very useful in groups the majority of the peopl that play EQ don't realize it. The worst part I think though is that after soloing almost exclusively from 1-65+93aas soloing gets down-right boring. The whole reason I made my shadow knight is that it is easier to get groups.<br />
<br />
Just some food-for thought before you make your decision. If you do decide to go with a necro the best place for information will be http://necro.eqclasses.com<br />
