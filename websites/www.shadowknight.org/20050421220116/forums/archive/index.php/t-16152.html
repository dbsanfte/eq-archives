<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>hdaana1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">snuck into cabilis and turned in some MM rings to the warrior guy on the bridge. i kept gettin a msg about healing and the pustules going down on his skin and Bertoxx leaving him or something but no faction msg. i turned in 36 rings and started at indifferent and finished at indifferent. was it just not enough rings? or do i need to say something first other than the i am a legion soldier line? thanks in advance.<br />
<br />
as a side note i was non KOS but there is a crusader that paths there and i was kos to him and when he got close the turn in guy started smackin me around as well.when the crusader is not by i was fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>DrMobius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There are 4 main factions inside Cabilis: Legions of Cabilis, Crusaders of Cabilis, Merchants of Cabilis, and Cabilis Residents.  Then many of the classes have their own faction, but the only one you have to worry about is the Brood of Kotiz for the Necro's.  Doing the dagger turn in, then bone chips, and then clearing the tunnels will raise the Legions, Crusaders, and Brood of Kotiz so you can do the Greenmist quest.  I have never heard of the ring quest, to get my faction up I did the dagger quest once I was at dubious with the guard in LOIO.  If the ring quest is similar to the dagger quest it only raises your faction with the Legion of Cabilis, the Crusaders will still not like you.  There is one specific Crusader who patrols (Crusader D something) who always has one faction level above the rest, so if he is at dubious then all the other Crusaders are still threateningly.<br />
<br />
I needed about 2800 bone chips to get the Crusaders to amiable, and I cleared out the tunnels with the outcast Iksars about 200 times (3 hours a day for a week).<br />
<br />
As I said though, I've never heard of the ring quest so I may be spouting off info you already know.  Hopefully you can find this useful.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Calamity_Daemon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well the shadow knights are Crusaders of Greenmist first of all and I went on a 3-4 hour killing spree in LoIO against the explorersby the lake. I collected approx 3 stacks of daggers and when I had finally gotten that much I went to the dude and gave it to him. When I gave him the daggers I got faction with EVERYONE in Cabilis that includes Crusaders of Greenmist. I started dubious with the bro and ended with warmly. I am going on another spree soon but cuz I am still KoS to Crusaders and Brood as well as the Shamans but the guards are a start. I estimate to collect 4 more stacks (My goal) and then hand them in. You still get faction with Crusaders and Brood and the stupid shamans too! Getting Cabilis faction wasnt as hard as I thought it would be...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>DrMobius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Here's the catch though, it gives you faction for Legion, Crusaders, and either Residents or Merchants...but the Legion will cap first.  Once Legion has hit max faction the faction for the others slows way down.  This is why once you hit amiable you do about 2400 bone chips.  Bone chips raises Crusaders...once they're to dubious the merchants will be dubious too.  Lastly you need to get Brood faction wich you can get from killing the outcast Iksars or making bone granite powder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>hdaana1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">the MM rings i was refering to are what the outcasts in the tunnel in FoB drop when you kill them. there was an older post that said you could turn these in for faction and it raised necro faction as well as the others. so you can do this once you turn in the knives and raise necro faction at the same time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thaleles Darkshine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Uh..MM Rings don't give Brood faction from what I've noticed.  I turned in about 16 of them yesterday, didn't notice any Brood Of Cotiz faction increases.  :(<br />
<br />
oh well</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Malevalence</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">What tunnel in FoB has outcasts in it please?  The Brood faction is the last one i need to raise to start the Greenmist quests, but it is annoying running all over trying to find them.  It would be much easier if I could find an area with them lumped together.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Thaleles Darkshine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Head out to the beach and hang a left, keep going along the wall eventually you'll come across a ramp leading to a cave.  There ya go, there are about 14 (?) or so bandit's in here.  Occasionally a named mob will spawn, but he was green to me at 53 and my pet damn near soloed him.  Spawn seems to be fairly quick, not sure what the actual time is though.  <br />
<br />
Enjoy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Malevalence</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thanks for the information.  Are there any outcasts in the tunnels under Cabalis?  I have never been down there to find out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Thaleles Darkshine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yeah, it's not really a tunnel under Cabilis it's more of a cave converted into a hideout (for lack of a better term).  There's one rough tunnel the leads back to a large room on your left, back right corner is another hallway leading to a smaller room.  First room has two sets of 4 spawns, back room has 2 sets of 2 spawns and the hallway usually has 1 or 2 spawns as well</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>DarkWyld</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The Outcast Iksars in FoB are stacked up pretty good, though.  If you are doing this for XP as well and don't have crowd control, you are better off going to the caves (that lead to LOIO) in Warslik Woods.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Thaleles Darkshine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Might be a better option anyway, FoB cave only has 13 mobs where WW has, at a minimum twice that.  You can drop about 60 outcasts an hour (probably less) if you run the loop between the four sites there.<br />

While you're there might want to pay a visit to the giant camp and grab the two spell pieces you'll need later on.  That is, if you're high enough to handle that camp.</div></div><hr />
