<br />
Can all classes right click it from inventory?<br />
<br />
If so, I will add it to my &quot;want to have but never will list&quot;, if not, I can stop dreaming about it =)<br />
<br />
IMHO, its just cool.<br />
<br />
Also, IMHO, we should get an illusion skelly spell at like 30 or 39, no benefitial effects, just coolness.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now, I must spend a life time, wanting that which I will never be stupid or rich enough to actually pay for.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lejina Bloodbath</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 01:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its also a totally worthless item unless you are a Troll/Ogre and need to get slim, or a gnome/halfling and need to be tall to climb some stairs.<br />
<br />
Complete waste of cash for a mid sized race, unless you really really really want to be blind.</div></div><hr />

Same skelly as AoN and saves you a buff slot since combined with the lifetap proc you would have up anyways, most times</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Utterance Unholy</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 01:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I at no point wanted it for any functional reason, I just think skelly form is cool =)<br />
<br />
I agree, its a total, complete waste of money ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alhazro</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 01:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah its cool. I never had luck at the shroud of undeath camp. yesterday I saw it auctioned. guy wanted 8k for the spell. didnt want to spend that much just to be blind hehe, afaik shroud of undeath also brings you humie vision like AoN does.<br />
Deathly Temptation includes ultravision on the other hand so its nice for shrink and even as deadeye/shadowsight replacement for humies. Too bad its uber rare and if it would be sold prolly cost a fortune...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krazaak</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 01:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh, I've been offering up my AoN for a copy of Deathly Temptation on Saryrn for a month now, with no luck.  People offer 40k for AoN easily, but it seems no copies of Deathly Temptation exist to be sold.<br />
<br />
I'd probably sell it off if I got Shroud of Undeath, but I haven't seen that for sale either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Graznoth</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 01:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">After the last patch my vision doesnt change when using skele form from my AoN, not sure on Shroud or Deadly as I dont have either.<br />
And besides, before as soon as you turned into a skele and went blind, just equip something with true sight/serpent sight/etc, then take it off. You get the vision as soon as you put the item on, and its bugged when you remove the item, you can still see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Naelael Sang'Noir</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 01:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dont you guys think its kind of funny. SK's wanted skelle illusion so bad, so they give it to us butit's damn dearimpossible to get. <br />
<br />
Thats just as funny as the Ralduken armor in Umbral plains being Pink!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaiyn</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 01:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What is the shroud of undeath camp you guys are talking about? I am curious as I have never even heard of it before</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krazaak</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 02:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Doesn't remove your name anymoer, but it does remove your AA titles.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">trun</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 02:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I liked when skel form stripped your name. No more nameless pile of bones sitting in the back of a raid afking. But skel form really does suck unless you're a large race that does need the size reduction. Shrinks are still better than skel form cause you can slam and aren't blind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DaClifster</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 03:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I use Deathly Temptation the vision improves slightly better than shadowsight (as in brightness), wish it was see invis though. I find myself soloing in velks with Deathly and deadeye up alot.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ghob Owar</div><div class="date">03-29-2002, 11:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know I asked this before... but is the AoN the only source of &quot;Ghetto Shrink&quot; clicky items (with no charges)?<br />
<br />
Seems sort of lame that SKs are the only class who can be Large Raced, and not get some sort of item that shrinks 'em. Hell even warriors get that Cobalt bracer.<br />
<br />
Even if it was a mid-level item, it's still better than trying to either save up or kill for an AoN.<br />
<br />
It's either that, or stock up on my damn halfling masks ;). (Just wish they weren't LORE).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krazaak</div><div class="date">03-29-2002, 11:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only other uncharged shrink item which an SK can use is the Child's Mask, which I believe comes from Veeshan's Peak.  I'm also not 100% sure it is uncharged, since I've seen two screenshots of it, one with and one without charges.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Utaldain</div><div class="date">03-29-2002, 12:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shroud of Undeath comes off the Battlemaster in the Graveyard in Chardok.  Nice XP camp in addition to two useful items drop for SKs there.  Be prepared to spend a lot of time there, it's his rare drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kahntun Derstand</div><div class="date">03-29-2002, 12:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">AoN is a great crap buff for ToV.  Get that and a goblin skull earring and a bracer of the hidden and you're set. :)</div></div><hr />
