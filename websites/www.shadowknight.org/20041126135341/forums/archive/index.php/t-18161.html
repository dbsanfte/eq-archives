<br />
I'm all for warriors getting some help with aggro where they need it, but the site linked doesn't list any of the demands to be made in this demonstration.<br />
<br />
Without specific grievances and specific suggestions on how to fix the problem, agreeable by all involved, this, like so many other player contrived &quot;disturbances&quot; will most likely go un-noticed by SOE, their Devs and most players.<br />
<br />
I suppose that you feel you're at the end of your rope, however, and that no other course of action will work, so good luck to you.  I hope that you can get what you're looking for without hurting any of the other classes who suffered so long in the shadows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jodgrim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think it would send a stronger message if any knight willing to do this logged their mains and made their AFK message that they as a knight support the warriors.<br />
<br />
Seriously, a bunch of lvl 1 warriors will look more like you are just trying to fill the seats than send a message.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>DarkQuark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Holy crap and I thought we were crazy ass whiners!<br />
<br />
<br />
/bow down to the Kings of Whine....<br />
<br />
<br />
We all got problems EQ-wise with our classes.  But last I looked just about any raid (of decent target) ain't gonna happen unless you have a few good warriors.  You know how many raids cannot happen without SK's?  Like maybe 1.<br />
<br />
I am sympathetic to your problems and acknowledge some of them but get off ur high horse (and the crap your smoking) and take a look around.<br />
<br />
Also, try not to lose site of the fact... ITS ONLY A GAME....<br />
<br />

They should all sit there and mash the taunt key every time it pops as well.  They'll get the same effect that they have in an xp group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>shikariiTSW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">To those who come by and help out; lemme just say Thanks.<br />
<br />
I hope things get resolved one day.<br />
<br />
and to DQ :<br />
<br />
Yeah; it's just a game. I just hope SoE decides to take a long hard look at the rule book. It's skewed from the day we pop out of the database and pick a set of pixels to be our creation right down to where we collectively piss on Quarm's corpse and dance around naked and....err, well, skip the second part :D<br />
<br />
Again; Thanks guys and girls for letting us come by and post this</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Wrong, not even close to being skewed wrong, in need of some slight tweaks sure... but you guys arent even close to being as unbalanced as you make it appear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Derok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I dunno... when things like This (http://www.archoverseers.org/) are being posted, it's not hard to see why warriors might be just a tad upset.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Silence</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i think its pretty funny that they think soe cannot ignore them if they do it... as long as they still get their checks they really dont have to give a damn... u want it to change like we keep saying stop fucking with  us and find a fix to your problem present it to them</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Phaelyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I feel their pain and all, but I just don't see how you are going to keep a knight from being able to MT these mobs without screwing the knights over.  The fact that knights are already able to MT these mobs means that nothing short of nerfing knights will remedy the situation in the warriors eyes.  Improving warriors will not.  So, really, it sounds like the warriors want the knights to help this civil protest to nerf ourselves.  Pfft.  <br />
<br />
I mean, really, the fact that guilds are using new spells and knights to screw around with the encounters means little to me.  What class honestly couldn't, in any way, tank one of these encounters if you brought enough healing to dump on him?  I know this has more to do with the knights ability to tank efficiently but I maintain that this can't be fixed without nerfing knights, and modifying knight itemization counts as a nerf and a B.S. one at that.<br />
<br />
I guess you could remove the spells they are using in the encounter, but those spells might actually have been implemented in light of things to come.  I don't know.  Don't really care.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Belyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Wonder if he was being padded with rune by an army of enchanters.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Naubi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">SOE can't make a quick fix for warriors. <br />
<br />
Being a class that just has bigger numbers might be good for warriors egos but it won't work for balance with EQ as it is today.<br />
<br />
We just have to hope that SOE are really working on adding depth to the pure melees... would be helpful if they could say what ideas they have so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Phaelyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">They have - zero.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Shadowsoal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I like the part where he talks about a SK tanking Quarm! now, I just wanna know why this makes warriors furious, yes multiple paladins have tanked quarm a SK did it too, but wtf, warriors tanked him as well.... quarm fight is a very bad example of what they are representing considering in the extremely high end game when a warrior is duel wielding agro weapons and has 300+ AA's they really don't have much of a problem with agro....<br />
<br />
Now... if a ranger tanked quarm yeah then I'd be in PoK as well....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The problem with Quarm is that he was specificially designed to be tanked with rotating warriors under discipline. This is not some pansy ass dragon that's 4 expansions old, this is the top end of the current top end. There is very little mudflation past time, in terms of gear. (Ohs nos, 320 raw HP!!!!!) Bulwark of Vie, on the other hand, is pretty huge. <br />
<br />
However, the basic problem is the fact that both damage from the encounters, and healing on our side has become far too overabundant. If you don't get one rounded, you live. That's a really sorry way to run the system. There's no difference between planting a 10k warrior in front of Quarm, a 9.5k Paladin/SK, and a 9k ranger... Worse, there's no valid way to fix it.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I also don't see anything that will come of this little demonstration other than maybe Absor wielding the banhammer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>BrikBludgaard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">What you don't understand is that the knoghts underneath him have 10K+ HP....  after beating quarm 1800 times with a warrior, they are finally getting to use knights as everyone's armor and weapons are so powerful as to allow the knights to finally tank him.<br />
<br />
The warriors are still better tanks for quarm, these guilds just have nothing to lose by allowing a knight to try it.<br />
<br />
We have NEVER had a warrior lose aggro on Quarm except if the warrior falls...  not even slowed... not even with everyone else beating on him.  Aggro isn't a problem on Quarm. Survival is...  Quarm hits like a mofo.. and every HP counts.  What is happening is that these knights are reaching the minimum HP to tank Quarm due to Bulwalk and Augments (and some of them using a shield for the extra HP).<br />
<br />
There is nothing wrong with knights being able to tank high-end mobs... indeed it takes WAY too long to allow us to do so.<br />
<br />
<br />
Flesh out the warriors when it comes to taunt...  (add numeric taunt equal to kick skill whether it hits or not every time kick is pushed) no one is hurt by this...  Flesh out the knights with some raid-worthy transition tanking abilties (auto-block with shield... give to warriors too).<br />
<br />
No one loses when knights and warriors are equal but different tanks against both raid and XP and adventure groups.<br />
<br />
Brik</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Vermadas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Quite honestly, I see nothing wrong with the way knights have closed the gap in tanking ability with warriors.  Whoopdee-doo, a knight tanked Quarm.  Oh noes!  But it was designed for a warrior only!  If they didn't want knights to be able tank Quarm then they should have taken itemization in PoTime into more consideration.  And it's not like AO, or any guild, is going to start using a knight tank on Quarm regularly.  As Brik said, knights give you better aggro but it's an advantage that means next to nothing in that encounter.<br />
<br />
That's not to say warriors don't need help... because they do.  Paladins and SKs have tons more utility than warriors.  What can warriors do?  Some nifty tricks with rampage?  Using /shield and /disc defensive?  Hitting AE Taunt at the right time?  Warriors have had jack for utility for a long time, but they didn't complain until recently because they knew they had such a big advantage in the tanking department.<br />
<br />
What I think warriors need:<br />
-Give them a little boost in aggro capabilities that would help them out in exp groups, but not so much for raids<br />
-Give them something to do other than hit /autoattack on, kick, taunt when needed... etc...  Give them some uitility of their own.  Make warriors a more fun class to play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Phaelyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I think  Arathena hit the nail on the head.  I get the impression from this whole thing that warriors are wanting mobs that only they can tank and for everyone else to just choke on it.  Something along the lines of how CH has made a team of clerics a required element of high lvl raid encounters.  Course, that's been going on for so long . . .<br />
<br />
The whole thing leaves one with a sick feeling.<br />
<br />
P.S.  I don't see how anyone didn't see this eventually happening though, and the way pop mobs where designed differently from the rest, this was bound to be when it happened.<br />
<br />
*NOTE: The CH comment was just out of reflection.  In no way do I remotely suggest that clerics should be nerfed.  Just figured I'd make that clear before someone raged over it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This Gandhiesque demonstration will more than likely not make a difference.<br />
What does SOE care how you spend your time on EQ, as long as the money keeps rolling in.<br />
If they wanted to make a difference, they should all cancel their accounts at the same time…hurt them where it counts; otherwise, be content with the standard response: “Our development team will look into this.”<br />
<br />
The changes that they want made, is based in the real world by real people using real resourses. So in essence, a real world demonstration needs to be planned.<br />
If all the warriors on all servers cancel their accounts for one month, I think that will make SOE stop and listen, more than a sit in.<br />
<br />
Good luck I guess…<br />

ill cut off my own balls before i make a warrior alt. requirement isnt it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Xovian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I do agree warriors need some help with agro... but to me thats as far as it goes.<br />
<br />
Sorry to say but i will never agree with anyone who says they need more utility or anything else. They are warriors, they knew what class they picked ( thus the simplicity ) when they made them.  Period.<br />
<br />
Warriors are supposed to have two things ( at least in my book ): Highest HP and the best defence.... they still have that from what i've seen. Honestly, weapon depending I have seen no problem with agro either... just my opinion though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Drakkimor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I do agree warriors need some help with agro<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't.  For years now I've had no problem with warrior agro.  What warriors need help with is better players, in both warriors and other classes.  A smart player who does his/her homework will have a warrior that can generate good agro.  I've seen warrior friends who generate an ungodly amount of agro that could give an SK a hard time keeping a mob on him.  Smarter players in other classes would help too in them knowing how to keep their agro down.  Hell, Playing alts I've seen Knights that couldnt' keep agro for shit.  Does that mean Paladin's and SK's can't taunt?  NO! It means it's a stupid player at the controls.  A lot is the same with warriors.<br />
<br />
Dumbing down the whole game is the wrong path to take.  As some warriors say, &quot;Any idiot can out taunt a warrior, but then only an idiot would&quot;.  Figure out how agro works, get some good weapons based on aggro and go to town.<br />
