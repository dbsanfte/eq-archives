<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Morgosha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings all, I am curious as I am wanting to start a SK Gnome (not twinked)<br />
<br />
But Do Sks solo well at all?  I love to group but I also like to be able to log on for a hour and play alone as well.<br />
<br />
And gnomes are the only race I ahve ever played in Everquest including EQ beta on the rathe.<br />
<br />
I love em to pieces :) So I am gonna try my hand at a challenging race/combo as I prefer that over a easier combo.<br />
<br />
So dont pick on the gnome to those that were, one day you never know I may be the one pulling the thorn out of your paw....<br />
<br />
Hugs!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Moktu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I Love Soloing, Atleast half my life was spent soloing, soloed in the following places in order i beleive<br />
<br />
WFP (noob area)<br />
WC<br />
NRO<br />
OASIS<br />
High Hold Pass<br />
High hold Keep<br />
OT<br />
Raider room in High Hold Keep<br />
Kobolds in Solb<br />
Dreadlands<br />
Bats in Solb<br />
<br />
 and I am Still Soloing the Bats in Solb through lvl 54, I ofcourse have randomly joined groups and raids in between but that progression should lead you thru to about 54 or 55 as I hear that is where bats slows down a bit.<br />
<br />
As you can See, Sk's Have a great ability to Solo, In open areas like OT and DL, you can Fear Kite all over the place, and in dungeons such as solb and highkeep it's just a matter of picking a small group of mobs (raider room, bats) and keeping the spawn right to solo them all (KEI helps)<br />
<br />
Hope this helped<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Poxy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've soloed from 12 to 20 no problem in Paludal.<br />
<br />
Had a friendly competition with A DE Sk as we shared a camp at the hollowshade entrance once. I was 12th level, he was 14 and better outfitted than I. (I was in total newb armor, he had a Neth BP at least, we both had aviak charms with the extended affliction)<br />
<br />
I out fought him and wound up shooting by him in levels (got ta love the shorty exp bonus)<br />
<br />
It might have been that he just suciked.. but from what I have seen Gnomes solo at least as well as the DE counterparts. How well that is at upper levels, I will leave you to argue over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Baraxul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">51 and still soloing, SKs don't need nobody.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shiverr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">35 levels solo so far SK's Rock!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gnax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">imho, soloing is great for xp, however,  it's about as fun as watching grass grow.  i can honestly say i've had more fun on a trip to the dentist office than 90% of my solo time ... the other 10% of solo time being in the right place at the right time with KEI ... a rare cosmological conjunction.<br />
<br />
EQ is a social game.  Find some friends, and have fun.<br />
