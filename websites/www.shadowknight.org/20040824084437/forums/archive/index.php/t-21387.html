We should give Saddam an official apology before the UN and provide him with some complimentary nerve gas. Saddam Hussein is my hero.<br />

Just seen that stuff on FOX news, you should have seen the way they made it look... of course you dont see the americans/britains kicking, pissing on, and beating the shit out of tied up POWs..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dark Lord John Denver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah, I can see now that the same people who have been getting all worked up over the &quot;Iraqi prison abuse&quot; scandal won't even bat an eye at this. &quot;He was an American, he deserved it.&quot; or &quot;It's justified because of the POW abuse.&quot; is what they'll say. Because forcing someone to stand around naked is so much worse than cutting someone's freaking head off. <br />

<br />
The real sad part is that this guy was a volunteer who was over there trying to help the Iraqis rebuild their infrastructure. He didn't have anything at all to do with the military.<br />
<br />
We should seriously just carpet bomb the entire middle east and call it a day. Fuck that place.</div></div><hr />

You dumb fucking hippy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>nezzka is bad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">they didnt really just make them stand naked, they hit them in the groin when they were tied up, broke a few limbs, pissed on them, then through them out of a moving vehicle and left them for dead tide up, but whatever, i dont care i hope both sides kill eachother<br />
<br />
im not going to agrue though because then i would = grim, and then i would hate myself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you're source?<br />
<br />
*And I don't see how that would even matter anyway. They were prisoners. They were obviously arrested for something. Probably killing Americans. This guy was a civilian who was just trying to help them. They beheaded them only because he was American.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying it's right. The people who were caught abusing Iraqi prisoners are going to severely punished which is a good thing. But god damn, son.</div></div><hr />

Yeah you can see that on every single other channel 24/7.  I saw &quot;the way they made it look&quot;.....they described what during the beheading happened.  Those bastards!  How dare they report the news!<br />
I dare you to say this to a GIs face.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Flargle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">So if you are against the occuption in Iraq you are for terrorism? It's the ridiculous black and white mentality that got us there in the first place. Do you think it might be possible to be against abuse on both sides? <br />
<br />
Both sides are fucked up. Bush got us into an unwinnable situation. If we stay more GIs are going to die and be tortured. If we leave the country will fall in the hands of a puppet of the US. And if we really give Iraqis the right to vote for whomever they want, we'll see someone even more brutal than Hussein rising to power.<br />
<br />
And if I hear one more hillbilly say America: love it or leave it, I fought for your freedom, your right to disagree came from the blood of patriots yadda yadda I'm going to puke.</div></div><hr />

Oh, and the IT IS A US CITIZEN, REVENGE routine is really getting boring, if you didn't want it to happen, then dont go there and STFU.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unfortunately, I see our world at a crossroads.  We've destroyed civilizations in the past and it looks like we're about to go there again.  I just hope enough members of one or more of the current nations survive to rebuild again.  Sure, we'll be knocked back a lot, but we might be able to get back up to a close to current tech level.</div></div><hr />
