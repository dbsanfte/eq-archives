<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Peye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know there's been a lot of hearsay and he say/she say about an &quot;Epic 2.0,&quot; but I have heard tonight that a guild on my server, Tarew Marr, has discovered the starting point for the Epic 2.0 in the Plane of Time. I hate listening to rumors, but it'd only be too nice for Sony to add in upgrades to all the epics.  Can anyone confirm or deny this rumor? Thanks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Solan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's not true.<br />
<br />
 Read my lips and repeat after me, there is no epic 2.0!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jabbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Rumors and speculation.  <br />
<br />
Btw... I heard there's a new class coming out with all the skills of a shadowknight plus the buffs of a shaman.<br />

(see?  I started a new rumor)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>LoganHex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My brother and I have done a bit of talking about new classes being added and what we would like to see. The only one we could both agree on was a nija type class that would have been a hybrid between a monk and a rogue with a bit of magical power sprinkled on top (mainly geared towards stealth).<br />
<br />
They would eventually get critical throws (with shurikens and the like much like rangers get critical shots with their bows) and critical strikes (with their monk like abilities). They would be able to apply poison like a rouge and have a line of ninja specific weapons such as the sai and nunchuk. <br />
<br />
Their magic powers would be geared around stealth (as mentioned before) and feature something like a smokescreen which would wipe aggro as the ninja was escaping. <br />
<br />
They would be able to hide and sneak as well as have a backstab type of ability which would only work when performed while hiding and sneaking.<br />
<br />
Of course we have to have some drawbacks to offset all of those advantages so ninjas would only be able to wear cloth based armors (making them the weakest damage absorbing class there is). <br />
<br />
They would have the same weight restriction that monks do only going over it would drop their armor class more drastically.<br />
<br />
That was about all we came up with but I think that would be a pretty killer class (naturally my main character is a monk while my borther plays a rogue as his main character which is probably the only reason we came up with this combination).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Peye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ok, after asking more friends on Tarew Marr, I have found that it's just a weapon that drops. No quest involved; just a drop. Still I don't know much about it. If anyone has any info, please post it! Also, keep in mind that Sony (Verant, or whoever the hell it is) doesn't tell you exactly what they're going to do when it comes to quests. I remember a couple years ago, before Greenmist was put in-game, how everyone was trying to piece the quest together. Some of the info was valid data, some of it was rumor. In any case, everyone was bitching and crying about a weapon that didn't even exist as an attainable item in-game. If we dismiss EVERYTHING that we here as &quot;Rumors and Speculation&quot; then what is going to be the motivation to dig deeper in finding info about any quests. Think about that next time you hear a rumor and immediately try to dismiss it.  I, for one, am a believer in the (eventual)  &quot;Epic Upgrades&quot; ideal, as well as a believer in the Iksars' eventual capture of Old Sebilis, and the Paineelians' eradication of their brothers in Erudin. With the original EQ, they added new zones like Warrens and Stonebrunt Mts. With Kunark, they added Veksar. They also changed Grobb into Gukta (which I believe is a DOWNgrade, considering my disdain for the frogs).  Look at the Planes. Hate was renovated, and with PoP we found out that gods like Rallos Zek were actually tougher than most of the dragons.  I'm just saying that, while I take every rumor with a grain of salt, I do file away what I hear. With all that said, I won't be the one surprised IF/when the day finally comes that you see a shadowknight whipping someone's ass with an upgrade to Innoruuk's Curse, or Rile's Greenmist. Thanks! =) Sorry this is sooooo loooooonnnnngggggg.<br />

PS: BWT, Moonslayer, I didn't think LoganHex was &quot;rumor-mongering.&quot; Looked to me like he came up with a pretty good idea on a possible new hybrid. =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Look, the Devs themselves have said, at a Fan Faire, that there are no plans to create an Epic 2.0.  We've gone around and around here with this topic so much that it's sickening.<br />
<br />
I realize that many of you who are new to the boards, or who have lurked for quite some time but read infrequently, seem to think that those of us who post regularly and bitch about people not using search are just being assholes.  Sometimes that's the case.  However, most of the time, it's because of shit like this.  Once a month, without fail, we get a &quot;Hey, guys!  I heard from this guy who heard from his sister's cousin's brother's roommate that a high end guild on Xegony knows this uber guy on Zebuxoruk who knows this other guy on Vallon Zek who has completed every quest in the game and he says that he found a super secret quest mob only up on a full moon when the planets are in alignment who gives you the option to begin a quest for Epic 2.0!&quot;<br />
<br />
We've heard it all before.  It's not true.  There is no Epic 2.0.  Period.  Never has been.  Probably never will be.  Chances are you're just catching the month or two old tail end of a rumor that was started here in the first place.<br />
<br />
Case in point, probably the beginning of this rumor:<br />
<br />
http://forums.shadowknight.org/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=14519&amp;highlight=epic <br />
<br />
I'm not seeing the thread that has the interview quoted in which the dev's state that there is no epic 2.0, but if you do a very thourough search, you'll find one.<br />
<br />
We're not bitching at you to be bitching at you.  It's just that you think this is new or something, that it's a big deal.  Meanwhile, the rest of us have become sick of hearing it.</div></div><hr />
