<br />
1 years old to 12 years old<br />
lived in newport beach surfing, skateing, and growing up.<br />
<br />
13-15 years old<br />
lived on newport coast, the upper-class part of newport beach<br />
found the pure essence of god that is marijuana and became more annoying than michael jackson to a primordial dwarf ( a birth defect in which the body stops growing after about 3 years but the mind continues).<br />

16 +<br />
moved to chatsworth/central valley because my mother fell in love with some guy who has a interactive value equal to that of steve hawking.<br />
still smokes weed, drinks much more, posts on retarded flamer forums at 11:00 at night waiting for something good to come on TV inbetween working out<br />
<br />
and so is the current history of eq=tehdev1L!<br />
<br />

I don't consider it time wasted.  Given i don't play every breathing minute..i have too much other shit to work on...like getting myself in shape to try out XC mtn bike racing when next season comes around...that takes up plenty of my time....on the other hand I do put in a reasonable amount of gametime, but merely as a break from work and my training.<br />
<br />
As far as how hard....I'm shooting to average 30-35mph on a mountain bike on a road for 50 miles straight.  so far i can do nearly 20....and even that's tearing the shit out of my current bike..so that has to be upgraded....basically that hobby is 80% of my freetime :p<br />
<br />
EQ hasn't wasted my life....it's tempting to get tied up into a game like that, but it's all a matter of priorities.<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW: this is SK-O, we are used to getting flamed...heck, I made that &quot;OMFG  :(&quot; thread jsut to get flamed...it's kind of a pastime here.</div></div><hr />

At most people around here have wrinkled their brow, and said &quot;WTF is that lame ass shit&quot; Your posts aren't flames, they are annoying uncreative heaps of crap, and I doubt anyone has felt flamed by you.<br />
<br />
<br />
Your post about me was humor, hell just about all posts about me are humor. Nothing is taken personally. <br />
<br />
Now, get off your high horse about being the best flamer there is, because lets face it, you suck, and move along.</div></div><hr />

Pull the coat hanger and broken glass out of your rectum and kill yourself with it, penis lover.</div></div><hr />

Fuckness maintained.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>KÄPT'N K</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I know him irl and told about this funny sight, he got bored and registered just to post some flames, he'll probably never even go to this sight again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Moonslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">First, I think you meant &quot;site,&quot; not sight. That makes you retarded. Further reinforcing that fact is that you tell cocksticks like EQdbilone1one or whatever the fuck ever his name is, about these boards. He sucks at flaming and you both suck at life. Get the fuck out and find the nearest pool, wash basin, bath tub, or ocean and drown yourself. No, better yet just crawl into a forest and die so you don't pollute the water and breed more fungus like yourself.</div></div><hr />

Kids these days...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>nezzka is bad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">well my mom gave birth to me next to the dumpster next to 7-11, my dad died because he fell asleep in a parking lot, from ages 6-12 I had many relationships with my many new dads that seemed to show up, at age 13 i started to drink and do cocaine. one of my dads was a dealer, now at 16+ I cant afford the habit and have to sell my body to old japanese men to try and live, and btw im sorry for all the flames, i thought i was cool and i was like wtf im so cool, sorry i love eq  :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">i myself have never played everquest, but i have a few made up friends who have wasted their lives playing eq for the last 4 years and its a sad sad thing.....................the reason why i started my pathetic flaming in these forums is my friend (who we will call Mr. Invisible BoB) led me here when i asked him if i could flame on forums with him, and he said sure go to www.shadowknight.org and i was like &quot;cool&quot;, cuz, well..... i'm thuper leet<br />
<br />
also if u want my actual background<br />
<br />
1 years old to 12 years old<br />
lived in newport beach surfing, skateing, developing my brain defects, and growing up.<br />
<br />
13-15 years old<br />
lived on newport coast, the upper-class part of newport beach<br />
found the pure essence of god that is marijuana and became more annoying than michael jackson to a primordial dwarf ( a birth defect in which the body keeps growing after about 3 years but the mind stops all together).<br />
<br />
16 +<br />
moved to chatsworth/central valley because my mother fell in love with some guy who has a interactive value equal to that of steve hawking, though I must admit he was a really good fuck.<br />
still smokes weed, drinks much more, posts on retarded flamer forums at 11:00 at night because I have no friends, and i'm waiting for something good to come on TV inbetween working out my penis muscle with my dad<br />
<br />
and so is the current history of eq=tehdev1L!<br />
<br />
also 'id just like to point out that all these years ive been wasting the valuble air of everyone else in the world, because i'm a useless sack of shit, and not worthy of life.<br />
<br />
btw chayde, sorry about everything i said on the other forum and sorry to all those who i made laugh at my pitifulness, but it will still happen btw, this is my sane side, im a skitzophrenic. In fact, one of my other personalities is a six-year-old schoolgirl who whores herself out to everyone, as long as they're over 60 and won't pay more than $2.<br />
<br />
FACT: I got REALLY fucking bored, and fixed your quote.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Armorace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Anyone who tries to brag about drinking and doing drugs to try and seem cool should have their prostates ripped out of their ass with a rusted coathanger. So annoying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>morbbidd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">He's a flamer? Hmmm who would have known. =)</div></div><hr />
