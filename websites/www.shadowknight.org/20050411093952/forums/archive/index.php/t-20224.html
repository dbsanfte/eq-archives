<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Amphitryon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am looking to take myself (60 SK) and my 54 Cleric twink to PoN, <br />
<br />
heres my Magelo..its mostly up to date<br />
<br />
 http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=424255<br />
<br />
Im looking at maybe hanging out near the waterfall in PoN mainly and pulling singles (of course)<br />
<br />
Firstly, since I dont have a slower, just how bad would think I would get beat up if I just went toe to toe with the mobs and used my cleric to toss on Mark of Retribution and keep me healed (Im looking at minimum of having Resolution and Symbol buffs from the cleric), as well as having Banshee Aura and Cloak of the Akheva for a DS.<br />
<br />
Im looking to get an idea of how much beatdown Im looking at and if the damage I put out in combination with retribution and the damage sheilds (I also use DS potions to augment my own DS potions since they stack.(and dots and the pet) and heals would be enough to keep me alive through the confrontation and would i be so beat down and the cleric so OOM as to make for a lot of down time till the next fight? Ive seen how fast some mobs hit (like the ravens for instance) and realize how fast the HPs will go. My concern is the cleric being able to keep up and not running out of mana before the fight is done.<br />
<br />
or would aggro kiting be a better way to go even with the cleric?..i seem to have little problem keeping mobs snared in PoN and my dots land ok (though I have problems getting the torrent line to stick at times), hoever it seems this way would be more mana intensive for me, and the fight would take longer<br />
<br />
id also be open to opinions on other zones and tactics to try with the 60 SK 54 Cleric 2-box combo (and yes I am actually going ahead and expiramenting with tactics with this combo, so its not purely academic)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Oagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't think you'd have much trouble at all.  Your cleric is going to draw aggro on the CH, but a cast or two of CD and/or taunt, and you should be back on top of the hate list.  Your cleric can also root the mob and move away, and/or cast atone.  Is your cleric going to take a few hits...yep.  Is it something you'll both survive?  Yep, as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>cames</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think you will get clobbered in PoN but you probably won't die.  I had a lower level SK/Higher level cleric and duo in Veksar and Nadox.  Veksar I did the Goblins at the zoneline and in Nadox I did the Temple (hidden) entrance from Gunthak.  Velks or Seb would also be doable.<br />
<br />
Probably the best way to tell is to work your way up to it.  If you want to reach back and start in ME or UP then go to PoJ then PoN that might give you a better feel.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>lot3k</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">yea, I would just try to work my way up to it, gonna need to catch a rhythm but once you do then you should manage just fine, only question is how fast you will go :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ashrai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">As soon as you get some defensive AA you will be able to straight tank those without much more than a patch heal at the end. By the time I had CS2/CS2/PE and about 4K hps unbuffed I was able to do WF or stalkers area and needed about 1 heal per mob. Even a lifetap dot, Greenmist proc, and a couple of ToI would be more than enough to keep me healthy.  <br />
<br />
PoN is where I go to AA since there's no one there, it's 1%-2% per kill and now with tribute buffs I have no downtime- so while the exp may average out to be less per time spent than other places, it's constant activity at least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'd say you should have no problem, Amph.  I duo'd mostly in PoN from 61 - 63 in Treant Valley (between GY and river towards the hedge), where there are 3 static treants plus one static raven/treant/spider all within view.<br />
<br />
This was right after PoP release when I did not have access to any Tier2 zones (didn't pass trials until lvl 65) and back then my gear was not that hot (not that it is now).<br />
<br />
I duo'd with my druid, who although he was 60, did not have the better lvl 63 partial-CH nor any heal-over-times -- so yes he did aggro a bit more than I'd liked to have but nothing unmanageable.  Aside from self-buffs, I would have had PoTG and druid DS/regen.<br />
<br />
That said, the world has changed in the last year and it's easier, for the most part, than ever to duo in PoN.  My 60 monk twinkie tanks duo now at the same spot; although the druid is now 65 which does make it easier for the monk to tank, although there is still no heal-over-time, slow, etc. but has better buffs, DS, regen, etc. than he did at 60.<br />
<br />
I've also duo'd with my cleric there (although with the monk, not the SK), and the only disadvantage there was no snare for runners [and they do run], so I rooted with the cleric, but as a SK you have snare covered.  With heal over times early on and CH for when you need it after aggro is established, you should be good there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">if your cleric doesn't have a horse/lizard get him one the slowest one is fine with that he should be able to sit there and just chain cheal you without losing too much mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Moongarm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Something I always try to look for if I want to go off and duo with my SK and Cleric for exp is a good population of undead.  Clerics can deal a respectable amount of damage on undead mobs which can shorten the fight and increase the experience rate.   <br />
<br />
You'll see a point with the duo where you can tank the mobs all day long without straining mana supply so your cleric will be nuking more as time goes on.  At that point hunting undead is your more efficient route to good exp.<br />
<br />
There's a good spot in Nadox with a big population of undead that will give you about the same experience rate but also give you decent coin as well.</div></div><hr />
