<br />
So that would make Xtill, Ronak, Adus, Mardark, Reny, Rimgruk, Teleran and Yazalinni at least with epics on Xegony now.  Fun little quest.<br />
<br />
I know we got like 2 more close to being done in our guild.  But we got 11 freaking SKs.  So sitting at 3/11 so far, lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">For a &quot;final&quot; fight the mob was absolutely pathetic, but I guess that's a given as it was a paladin :b You guys are lucky ;x</div></div><hr />

Add Me (Teleran) and Rimgruk to the list of 1.5'd Xegonite Archfiends.  Got mine on 9/25 and Rim finished on 10/2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Adus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm just glad I got it, I don't care how easy it is or how many people get it...</div></div><hr />

I agree 100%.  The quest is just how it should be.  You shouldn't have to gather mini-raids for half your epic mobs.  Its just stupid if you do.  They didn't make the SK epic too easy.  They made the other epics too hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shurlock</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Congrats, guys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zyraxx Shadowleezard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Are all the SK's in JC doing it Mardark? Mnayar told me he wasn't sure if he was because he got mad at PoG...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I dont know if all JC SKs are doing it, but most are.  I know some are waiting, since they are working epics for their other chars first.  PoG is a pain, if you dont get lucky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Daywalka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">There's 7 SKs in Val'Kori, none of which are working on the Epic 1.5, AFAIK. Mostly, the guild seems to be working on other epics, as none of the SKs are really on all the time like some people.<br />
<br />
Anyway, grats Yaz. Great to see an ex-KoTE get an epic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Yaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Long live KoTE.  <br />
<br />
IF the epic seemed too easy that's fine with me, remember they screwed us over on the 1.0 with their Ultra Rare drops and such so they owed us!!!  Not every SK has done 1.0, so some SK aren't even going to take the time to do the pre-requisite or old epic so they can get 1.5.  Some will just live with what they have.  A lot of 2 boxers like to make SK's now so not a lot will take their time on a toon that is not their main.  This was a good quest to upgrade your old one.  <br />
<br />
PoG wasn't so bad, I got my Unicorn hair second kill.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Adus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I never had first epic, that was actually one of, if not my main reason for getting this one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ttuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I never had first epic, that was actually one of, if not my main reason for getting this one.<br />

I thought the same exact thing, and a funny thing happened while camping the piece in hate for 1.5, I got a hide! Which of course, was the last bit I needed...So yeah, I finished 1.0 but I still want my damn 1.5, just need to find people willing to help and I'll be gtg!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Zyraxx Shadowleezard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Breeder owns me =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Croix VorAbaddon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'll say this about Epic 1.0:<br />
<br />
Camped a LOT of Drakes... nothing.<br />
<br />
Finished my epic 1.5 pre-quest since I didn't ahve 1.0. Got the item version of IV so I can finally start.<br />
<br />
