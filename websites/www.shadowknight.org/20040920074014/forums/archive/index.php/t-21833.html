<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>tearsin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">just a couple of technical questions about a few somewhat obscure things that i was hoping someone might know, and have a data-justified reason for knowing (not speculation)<br />
<br />
1.  do skill mods stack? (case in point: dodge mod +5% on secret of planes... if i put the ldon dodge mod on another piece of armor, would the mods stack, or is it like haste items?)<br />
<br />
2. what is the current musing on the 'goal' for ac? obviously the golden rule of 'higher the better' still applies, but the last time i heard a 'what you should shoot for' number was when PoP came out. is there a current range that is considered the 'bare minimum' to stay alive in GoD and such?<br />
<br />
you know, i thought i'd be able to come up with more stuff to justify this post then just those two questions, but i suppose that's abot it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">just a couple of technical questions about a few somewhat obscure things that i was hoping someone might know, and have a data-justified reason for knowing (not speculation) err...accidentally didn't get rest of it in quote... <br />
<br />
Skill mods do not stack.<br />
<br />
For sewers1+ you'll need at least 1500, bare minimum. (and more when you start moving on from sewers1 difficulty events)<br />
<br />
For the first question about ac, if your talking about the ac soft-caps...there isn't one anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Askeer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">1) some mods dont stack, some do.<br />
<br />
2) good AC for GoD is 2K+</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Blackeagle Dwimmerlaik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">a dev recently stated that besides adding simple AC and stats, shields actually raise your AC cap<br />
<br />
I had though the AC soft cap was a simple myth, but if I weren't so lazy and leaving the country for a few months in 3 weeks, I'd investigate more :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">More than 2k for GoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>tearsin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">huh. how it is that i'm tanking vxed and tipt with 1500 ac is beyond me then. smirk. guess i'm just lucky</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">your not tanking tipt without a pet. if so ya you are lucky or your healer doesnt want to hurt your feelings</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">or he has multiple healers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
3. Do Cleave mods stack?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>tearsin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">or he has multiple healers.<br />
nope. just one healer.<br />
it's a group of friends though, we work very well together, and we've been farming vxed/tipt for the last month. shrug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Androsulach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If you add an augment with a skill mod to a piece that has a skill mod, then it will add the mods together.  Putting them on separate pieces will give you the higher of the two.</div></div><hr />
