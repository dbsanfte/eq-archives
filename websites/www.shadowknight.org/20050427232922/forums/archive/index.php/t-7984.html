<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Burzum Durbatuluuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Basically I'm torn between Ogre vs. Iksar... with the basic question is natural regen more valueable than no frontal stun.  How much are those natural 10+ standing hps regen worth? Vs. Frontal Stun Immunity?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>BobTheIksar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well I would look at the Racial Exp Penalties if  I were you.  Obviously, Verant thinks Iksar have better abilities than Ogres, seeing that IKS get a 20% exp penalty and Ogres 15%<br />
<br />
But here is what I think:<br />
Ogres have all good stats (that matter to a SK) except for INT and AGI.<br />
They can slam, which is great<br />
And they are immune to frontal stunning<br />
<br />
But:  usually SKs aren't MT, and you should rarely be taking hits while soloing post-15.  Also, they have to shrink, which I heard is annoying (but I don't play an Ogre).<br />
<br />
And then:<br />
No stats that SKs need under 75.<br />
Iksar have regen<br />
Natural AC<br />
Swimming (100)<br />
Forage (50)<br />
<br />
But: As I said for the Ogre, SKs aren't usually MT, and so that regening and Natural AC won't often take effect.  The high natural swimming is a very good advantage, IMHO, because raising skills like that becomes very boring.  For example, (call this bad luck if you want though) I had a Half Elf Bard once that I had staying in Halas from lvl 7 through 20 or so, and my swimming skill only ever got up to 40 or so.  I didn't use the boat thingy of course (no one does hehe).<br />
<br />
But that Natural AC does go a long way the higher the level you get.  Dependant on whether or not you believe in the AC Soft-cap, you can start getting equip for stats/resists earlier than before.<br />
<br />
And also Iksar can't wear plate.  I don't view that as a disadvantage, just another incentive to find cool-looking armor to me.<br />
<br />
But then there are a few times when you will be the MT.<br />
<br />
You pick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Akeikyl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I chose a Iksar after having a Ogre and Gnome SK I like the innate abilities and skills. The &quot;plate&quot; penalty only really applies to Kunark and prior era armor 99.9% of Velious and onward armor is Iksar useable. Once you get your SK at or above Velious quest armor you don't run into the &quot;plate&quot; penalty unless you count Umbral Plains junk. If you can weather the exp penalty Iksar is a great race. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aaoogaa Soulhunter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Solo - Iksar<br />
Group - Orge<br />
<br />
I tank alot in exp groups (ALOT) and the no stun/extra hp from stamina/and extra attack ability form str are great.  I do not have a problem with healing or mana in a group.  So alot depends on what you like and play style.  I knew I would be MT for most exp groups.  Here is a nice trick when pulling...rotate to face the enemy when FDing and no chance of being stunned to interrupt your FD.  The only thing I do not like is having to shrink to get access to some places.  This is not really a problem once you get out of the old world.  Anyway good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Darkenesis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ogre = 5%....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Fear kiting also isn't an option in some zones... specifically where there are a ton of wandering mobs or things that will add... or in zones where there are topographical dificulties like nasty jagged mountains that make kiting difficult at best.  So I would say that natural regen is definitely a help.  Trolls also have regen though, and even though they don't get the natural AC benefit, their starting stats in STR and STA are nothing to snuff at, their AGI and DEX are ok, their INT isn't quite as weak as an Ogre.  Not to mention they don't have the armor penalties that Iksar do.<br />
<br />
As far as swimming skill is concerned, just fall off the boat in TD a couple of times and your swiming skill will skyrocket.  Had a bugged installation once where the boat didn't wait for me to zone, had to swim to the island, then during the time when the boats were bugged and the Translocators were bugged so that they ported you to some wierd island accross the zone I had to swim again a couple of times.  Other than that, I've only been through a couple of zones where I had to get into the water (Lake Rathetear running between the swamp and NK Nexus portal, inside the swamp going from one end to the other, swimming up and down the river to the Tae Ew island in Feerrott while doing DF quests) and my skill is up around 160...<br />
<br />
But once again, as in all the discussions that have been posted about whether Ogre or Iksar make the best SKs, it all falls down to personal preference.  Stats and racial skills make very little difference once you get up a bit in level.  If Ogres were unstunnable from the back too, that might make a diff, but I rarely get stunned from the front anymore anyway.  If you play in a group, Iksar regen isn't that big of a deal.  Iksar AC bonus helps to offset them not being able to wear most pre-luclin plate...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sepcieulus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well as many have said I think it all comes down to personal preference and what fits your playing style.<br />
<br />
On the Stats Side: <br />
<br />
I chose an Ogre … The Str and Sta were just to great.  I added the 20 extra points to my Int bringing it to 90… and have good hitpoints, good damage, and never run out of mana (and I am constantly casting spells). <br />
<br />
I looked at the Iskar … yes they Trounce the Ogre in Int, Agi, and Dex …<br />
<br />
The Ogre just seemed to fit my playing style.<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW (on the Troll vs Oger INT comment)<br />
<br />
their INT isn't quite as weak as an Ogre. <br />
Troll SKs int starts at 62  … Ogre SKs start at 70.  Not trying to be a smart A** but it seems to me that you ment to say “their INT isn’t quite as strong as an Ogre”<br />
<br />
On the Ability side:<br />
<br />
Iskar: <br />
<br />
Swimming --- lol --- swimming is easy to raise I wouldn’t base my decision on this.<br />
<br />
Forage --- at 50 --- yes its cool to have --- but won’t work a lot at that skill lvl I would consider this negligible.<br />
<br />
Regen --- Great if you plan on going it solo most of the time … But if in a group? I not sure how useful it would be. (ok forgive me here … I’ve never played a Char with natural Regen … I’m just mentally comparing it to a druids regen line of spells … which is cool … but not something that I couldn’t live without)<br />
<br />
Ogre:<br />
<br />
Slam: Handy if you plan on using 2 handed weapons.<br />
No frontal stun:  Ok … I like this … your not just standing there while the mob whales on you … your dishing it back to them. And as mentioned above … if pulling and splitting mobs … face them … FD … and you don’t have to worry about being stuned when Fding.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now as many have said many many times … starting stats and abilities don’t matter a lot as you get into higher levels (lol … I’m just taking their word for it … my highest Char is a 47 druid so I honestly can’t confirm if that is so or not) <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And as many have said its all up to your personal preference and playing style (This I can confirm).<br />
<br />
I pull a lot … I MT a lot … I usually partner with a druid … or am part of a group of guild mates.  I solo on rare occasions  … and have never had a problem. <br />
<br />
The size thing isn’t really that big of a deal … Have to Duck in a few places … but I have yet to find a place where it was a huge problem.<br />
<br />
Some might think this is silly but you might also want to consider Looks. Ogres are the coolest looking SK’s in the game … hands down … LOL … JK <br />
<br />
<br />
I wish you luck and hope you enjoy what ever race you pick</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>BobTheIksar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well, I chose Iksar soley for looks.  Same with the Black Acrylia Halberd.<br />

<br />
:o <br />
<br />
im tired... and its only 7...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>nnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">seems to be pretty even, but depends on what you do. Soloer, go for Iksar. the regen has saved me a ton of sit time.<br />
<br />
the frontal stun can however make grouping and soloing easier. many a time a stun got me killed. <br />
<br />
so overall i feel like its 6 of one, half dozen of another. <br />
<br />
personally, the iksar look and &quot;evil race hated by ALL&quot; appealed to me. i liked the challenge (hence my not having a druid). after i got into the race i realized there was a sweetass story behind them, not just &quot;there are some humans over there in qeynos... and.. yeah&quot;. the iksar storyline has been compelling from day one, up till finally getting Greenmist. feel free to read my rendition of my quest here:<br />
<br />
www.geocities.com/burntham77/greenmist.html<br />
<br />
anyway, here is what you have to look forward to:<br />
<br />
Raids: You are a damage dealer, get a STR and DEX buff and wack away. you can be the best taunter, but when a mob hits for 500+, do you really WANT to be?<br />
<br />
Solo: You'll need INT for this. regen helps with downtime. <br />
<br />
Group: You can tank just fine, and with your spells, you are THE master taunter. my guild's wizards have claimed they'd rather have me be main taunter, as I keep mobs off them like no warrior can.  <br />
<br />
Standing Around: Just depends on what you are into, but both races can look cool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Rhone Darkarrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">People here will probabaly disagree with me, but I've played several sk races up to respectable levels (done an inkie, troll, and now ogre up to 50ish), and for my money, ogre wins hands down.  Troll regen = bullsheet, just isnt enough to justify the horrid weakness against fire ( dont flame with &quot;oh you can get resist items for that&quot;  I just dont wanna hear it, waste of an equipment slot if I could have sta, hp or int instead), nor is it anywhere near enough to pay an xp penalty of 20%.  If you want a regen race, only iksar are worth the xp hit.  In any case, ogre has just been the best for me, most might say that unstunnable from the front really isnt worth anything, and even I admit I used to say that as well when I p[layed my troll.  But, from actual EXPERIENCE, I can say with 100% certainty than being unstunaable from the front owns hardcore.  Flame on all you like, but if you want a real tank sk, ogre is best.<br />
<br />
Swimming is negligable, get an eb item, swim towards a wall, hit numlock, go to work and come back with a maxed skill.<br />
<br />
Foraging is also negligable, at 50 its worthless, and you wont be eating foraged shit anyway, you'll be going after things like halas meat pies and grobb liquid meat</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>asguth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Ive played many sks to a good level and id have to say that they are very close but when you are trying to use one of your mana buffs like deadly temptation which may not be a burden on your hps what about the one that does 30 health 15 mana that is very valuable if you  are a troll iks but if you are any other non regen race w/o fungi its quite a burden. The Ac bonus is very respectable as well i have looked into the races  as extensively as i possibly can and they are very similar but a wise sk once told me AC is king and he is completely right. Besides that Str is very easily buffed with items or even our own spells. Hell if your too low level buy a dr for god sakes and switch once the proc goes off. If you have created your sk correctly you will have a deceant ammt of dex to get the proc off fast the tuck it away. As for sta the difference between my level 38 human with 90 sta and my ogre with 140 sta isnt very significant and at higher levels that will equal like 1 hit. Not being able to be stunned from front will be very valuable however once you learn how to moonwalk pulls I do when i play my ogre and its awsome. Also good for when you fd too but i think you can  be interrupted tho still its a spell after all. Learning abilities is a biatch with my ogre however dex helps with the melee portion of this delima but our casting abilities are another matter entirely spells will be hard to raise very hard, unless you put most of your points into int at creation. Making an ogre so that they dont give ya grief later is a pain but is totally worth it when you are hitting for 80s 90s and your humie counterpart with same armour is hitting 40- occasional 80s  my humie hehe. Troll is right inbetween there almost like the ogre. Like one other said however Fire reisst is a big deal tho just fight cynthia and you will see why. try with a troll then try with a iksar. Fire resist really matters cold you can make up with your buffs. Me im torn between my iks and my ogre but the ac bonus is very noticable and its im portance seems to be ignored or lessened. The only question should be is the exp penalty worth it?<br />
If you are a casual gamer then hell no but if you are can spend the time ive talked to many high level sks iksar and others and they all agree that iksar stat wise end game own. I only got mine to 20 but with pok the racial stuff really dont mattter as much any more. Hell if you have to bank click a couple books and your set. I have been so tempted to play my iksar again hehe but after all my sks i think im sticking to my ogre hes awsome and i dont want to take another race to 38 just to compare em all hehe its a very ugly disease. well good luck and have fun and dont listen to that play any class you like they are all the same crap hehe biggest cop out by people who dont spend the time to understand teh chars. Unless your goal is role play value then yeah play whoever. I dunno i just like soloing and grouping i want to do both well as im sure most people do as well. Just my 2cp .<br />
Btw im sorry for the bad grammer run ons etc im at work hehe and doing this between jobs !:p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>asguth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">doh i think i missed the point racial ability! well honestly if we are going solely on racial ability then id say tinkering hehe. I hate gnomes tho get stunned too much. God if its true tho about what some of these gnomes are saying on this board about the 74 percent haste because of reg haste item and spell haste!? There is no way to ignore that. that is very impressive very self sufficient only thing is tinkering is one of the hardest tradeskills out hehe oh well im glad i dont have a gnome sk. If ya got the tens of thousands of plat to spend then more power to you but as for me bleh ill stick to eating gnomes on a stick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>nnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">the choice is simple: Iksar.<br />
<br />
Why? 1 reason: The Tail.<br />
<br />
have fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>asguth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">what i dont understand is that people say regen does not matter as much as sta but if you take into account how many ticks last in a fight and multiply that by  the regened ammount and compare that to the extra hps gained by ogres i think its very significant and almost equal granted i understand that ogres have some basic regeneration as well but in those instances when you have to fd without buds to help that regen helps a lil more than the 50 extra or so sta. Id take regen over almost all imho for sk i think iksar are great just a very hard road not so much now that there is pok but still kinda tough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>kbern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I love Iksars but the exp penalty gets you down after a bit...it can be felt.<br />
<br />
Another reason why I made a Gnome SK and not an Iksar is the ability to wear plate.<br />
<br />
Yes the actual ac of it all is comparable but the lack of the choice to wear any right click stuff is a hinderance.<br />
<br />
I do not rely on them but I do use my BE gaunts and boots when soloing, or grouping and oom for emergency situations....and I just got the BE legs and they will be a lifesaver.<br />
<br />
I didnt want another class limiting my gear choices.<br />
<br />
But in the end, whatever you enjoy is what you should pick.<br />
<br />
I gnome do gnome not gnome have gnome any gnome preference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Skurrge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Well, I can't say that the inability to wear BE armor has hindered me much.  I have to approach situations differently (like how to deal with emergencies), but dealing with them differently doesn't necessarily mean that it is worse than someone that can wear BE and plate.<br />
<br />
If worse comes to worse and you are oom, turn tail and run! heh.. either that or wait for the cleanup and get a rezz.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Lizarde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Originally posted by Sepcieulus <br />
Some might think this is silly but you might also want to consider Looks. <br />
That is not silly at all.  I chose Iksar for my SK based entirely on his looks.  Since then, my feelings based on playing him to 52 and playing several other SKs/races to 20-30 are as follows.  Keep in mind that I played a druid to 25 before I started on my SK, and my SK is my main (the druid is level 30 now!).  My perceptions are affected by his relatively low level, no doubt, but also by his being my only 30+ character.<br />
<br />
- Regen is noticeable at a far greater level range than I had anticipated.  Playing non-troll/Iksar melee characters (2 SKs and 2 paladins), I was amazed at how much downtime I have, even at low levels.  At level 20 my human paladin regens 1/3 per tick standing/sitting.  At level 1 my Iksar SK was regenning 2/4.  Even now, my 52 Iksar SK seems to spend much less time regenning his HP than my 23 paladin does.  Of course, at 52 my SK is regenning 6/12 HP. :)<br />
<br />
- Being 'unstunnable' from the front still seems vastly over-rated to me.  It is a convenient thing to have if you have it, but I don't miss not having it, and I wouldn't trade it for my edge in regen.  I rarely get stunned at all.  I am either fear-kiting, in which case I am not being hit.  Or I am not tanking in a group, in which case I am not being hit.  Or I am tanking, in which case my main goal is to absorb damage and keep aggro.  I might get stunned 2-3 times in a fight, but often I won't get stunned more than once, which means I hardly even notice it.  It doesn't affect my DPS much, nor does it affect my ability to keep aggro.<br />
<br />
- Having balanced stats appealed to me at first, but in the long run isn't an advantage.  The better melee stats of an OGR or TRL are preferable, IMO.  Once AGI is at 75 there's no real use to raising it further, and the high STA for them means you can look for more +STR items, which are plentiful.  Having low INT isn't so bad if you get +mana items, like the player-crafted jewelry that adds HP and mana.<br />
<br />
In the end, as is often said, find a race that you would prefer to play, either due to looks, or due to playstyle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>asguth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">do you find the ac bonus to help out alot at later levels or do you find it is very comparable to the other classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Soulstar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">WHy's everyone ragging on forage...

Still a pipe dream for me at the moment but its a fantatsic attribute for lowering downtime. Also when not MT on a raid with AE mobs I rarely need healed when using lifetaps as well.<br />
With the new lifetaps and Bond Of Death, Shroud Of Chaos and a Lifetap proccing weapon - well you only worry about mana regen.<br />
If you are MT its not much of an issue because you are being healed, but its still a nice reduction in mana used by the healers.<br />
<br />
That aside - well I just love the way my character looks. After getting through the hellish levels where I couldn't wear plate, now I have my HoT armour I really enjoy logging on and playing - I F9 a lot. Sounds a bit narccisistic but it makes the game more fun for me. At the end of the day, don't pick a race for the abilities they have. I picked mine cause i loved the story/history of the race - the new luclin models make me more enthuisastic.<br />
<br />
Pick the race YOU like the idea of most, all of them have some beneficial factor really.</div></div><hr />
