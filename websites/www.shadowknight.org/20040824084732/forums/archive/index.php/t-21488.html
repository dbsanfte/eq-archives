<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>morbbidd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Newtank in RL (http://www.kypost.com/2004/05/18/sword051804.html)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Daywalka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nah, if it were Newtank, then they would have an interview with him on the site, claiming that the sword he stabbed his mom with did more relative damage with him using it, than if someone who was an expert stabbed her.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Oagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">No, if it was Newtank, he'd be camping the castle at Disney Land, telling the security/cops that he is &quot;relatively&quot; more powerful than they are with his sword vs. their guns, because with his fungi tunic, he will regen more blood than he loses from the bullet wounds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You have it all wrong<br />
<br />
Newtank would argue that by stabbing his mom and being sent to prison, he found the societal sweet spot and that he would be able to build social skills faster there and would not only eventually catch up with us but surpass our ability to grow as people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Francosis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Wrong again.  If it were Newtank, they'd have found him with a thumb jammed so far up his ass that it would be coming out of his mouth whilst a poodle licked peanut butter off of his semi-flacid wanker.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">&quot;Dragons, fantasy figurines -- swords, knives. -- He had two (swords) there and numerous others put away in storage. Anywhere from 40 to 50,&quot; Wittrock said. &quot;But I can't say the incident itself goes with the Goth lifestyle. It was just a domestic.&quot;  <br />
<br />
I'm a bit supprized by this. You don't see resonable police often enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Translation of that policeman's response.<br />
<br />
&quot;My daughter's a goth and I'm pretty sure she'd think that this guy is an idiot.  Hell, if she ever met him she'd probably fuck him up the ass with her bladed dildo.  I mean at least those metal covered kids who come to my house dressed in black gauze aren't fucking morons like this little shit&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>vilesoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Not Newbtank<br />
<br />
If it was Newtrank, he would have put on a suit made entirely of sewn together mushrooms, and weilded a trash can lid and sword while running aorund killing until the police show up.<br />
<br />
Then he would start polishing his nuts over his 2000000000000000000000000 hp/tic regen and how he can't possibly be killed by anyhting not a god or dragon...then the police will all proc their glock 9mm effect: bullet of retard shredding.  <br />
<br />
Flesh will fall, mushrooms will crumble, and NuutSack will fall to the ground dead, as 70 bullets bust through his ubar &quot;fungi-armor&quot; and render his lvl1 jackass self DOA at the local morgue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Arikash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Wow, I'm sensing a little hostility towards Newbtank here =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>vilesoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Who?  Me?  <br />
<br />
Nah, I'm always this hostile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grulknar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">-- When (she) was trying to get out of the room he stabbed her in the back,&quot; <br />
<br />
Definately an SK though. Nothing like fear kiting your Mom.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Originally posted by Grulknar <br />
He got enraged... he stabbed her...<br />
<br />
the mom forgot to turn auto attack off</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Androsulach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">First rule if you're not RT'ing.  Turn attack off.</div></div><hr />
