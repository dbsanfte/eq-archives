This is a useless thread.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Odiumar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes, some of us do still enjoy the game.  That's why I'm in no rush to get to 65 or the end game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>signa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i like sitting in the arena killing rangers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chayde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I play to talk to people. <br />
<br />
I am all about being social, I play to log on, see how many people are online, then run around and help who I can, talk about what I can, and then log off. I don't think I think I have gotten 3 levels in about 3 months...<br />
<br />
lovely huh?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Derraj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I don't get any enjoyment out of EQ anymore. I log in about every 2-3 months on my shaman to buff newbs, give things away, etc then log out. I think I'd still be having fun and playing if they didn't make any expansion packs after Velious...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i liked it till my guild went to dkp</div></div><hr />

<br />
If your not enjoying it why would you keep playing?<br />
<br />
Unless you are just a masochist I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Meriboh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I used to have fun until all the changes to the game. I loved the game all the way to SoL. After that, there were too many changes and expansions stringed together to try to keep up to.<br />
Being a casual player, I found that if I didn’t commit a large portion of my time, I would fall behind my contemporaries. I eventually ended up soloing a lot.<br />
I still enjoy Pking, but even that has become difficult due to ignorant changes…It’s become EverChange.<br />
I guess the twinkle I had in my eye for EQ is staring to fade.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Funny I started enjoying the game more when I joined a dkp guild. :)<br />
<br />
I enjoy the game; there is still so much of the game I never have seen, and I do a lot of exploring while not raiding. The mystery and unknowing is something I had missed, like walking across the bridge in nektulos for the first time 4years ago. In a way GoD is still like that because it is new, and not many have done it so there can be unpleasant and pleasant suprises.<br />
<br />
There is a lot of things to do and see in the game that I still have left.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Askeer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I still enjoy EQ very much after 5 full years, kkthxla~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Nambkab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Still enjoying the game here, though I had to make a new character to continue the fun when Namb became a drag.<br />
<br />
Oh and dkp is teh win in my book.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Daywalka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I still enjoy the game. Not just playing my SK either, I like sitting in the Bazaar, watching 10 year olds argue about if Pikachu could beat Yugioh in a duel in the Arena. I like getting random tells from female characters saying they lost all their stuff and need money so they can go to chanter school. I like it when people I kicked out of my old guild 2 years ago come back and call me a cum-guzzling whore. I like going into Windowed mode and having the screen turn black for 5 minutes and coming back to see yourself naked at your bind point.<br />
<br />
Seriously though. I'm not fucking cattle. If it wasn't fun for me, I wouldn't still be playing EQ or going to sites about EQ. Why anyone still pays to play a game they hate is beyond me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I play to hang out with a few friends on line, smash some stuff for an hour then head on out.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Azudno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Finally after 5+ yrs I'm starting to burn out slightly on eq. I still like it atm, but there's no new content which I'm interested in exploring atm. I've seen everything before GoD and GoD just doesn't peek my interest. <br />
<br />
I'll keep posting here to retain my fuckness though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Having as much fun as ever, maybe more. Encounters in later Gates are creative and challenging.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Funny I started enjoying the game more when I joined a dkp guild. :)<br />
i dont mind it, but i hate that its the only reason people want to raid.  and will leave a raid that isnt worth dkp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>brian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">after 3+ years of the nameless (aka eqtaiwan), i had to go pvp.  killing people never gets old.  I cannot believe that more people don't play pvp when they get tired of raiding and camping and all that lame shit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Nambkab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I'm still on the Nameless, tried the PvP thing and it just isn't my style.  I have almost 100% attendance on raids no matter how many points they are(of course I am one of the raid leaders), and in general overall attendance of members online when a raid starts is good.  We like it because it takes questions of favoritism out of the picture, but to each their own  ;) .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I still enjoy EQ alot. It's even more fun than before cuz I have more and more friends to share stories with and adventure with.. Nothing beats having long-time comrades in EQ. :) That's why any nerfs or any changes to SK class won't really bother me that much cuz I still hang with friends regardless to my class..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Skars</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Now more than ever, took me 3 years to do it but i finally let my friends talk me into joining a raiding guild. The thought of serious raiding used to turn me away. It is now all i want to do. We are fresh into the EP's and  having a blast trying to learn these encounters. So ya having a shitlload fun atm.<br />
<br />
 Oh we a DKP guild as well. I like it personally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Gobgob frum Grobb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Had a frikkin gutz full.<br />
<br />
Seen alot of the long term friends (esp the knights) disappearing from the games after the cockmongers known as sony squeezed out that lumbering abortion they named &quot;Gates of Discord&quot;.<br />
<br />
Tired of getting punished for playing a game which is exactly what it feels like sony are doing to customers atm esp' in the high-end/new-content area of the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Ghismonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">About 50/50.  Sometimes I enjoy myself, sometimes I don't.<br />
<br />
I quit after GOD and just recently returned last month after the promises of knight tanking fixes and the allure of the SOE summit (and the fact that it's cheaper than other my other hobbies.)<br />
<br />
Things would need to improve drastically for me to actually enjoy myself again, but I will probably continue to pay until a substitute comes along.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Vixeena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Other than the fact that it can be insanely  hard  to get groups or form groups on stormhammer ....I enjoy the hell out of this game.   Sony, consolidate some servers please.  Then ill be happy 99% of the time.  =)<br />
<br />
Oh and i like dkp even though it has its problems.  Sort of like democracy, its the worst system in the world, except for every other system.   :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Consolidate servers?  Are you fucking insane?  If anything, we need more split servers.  The overcrowding is getting rediculous enough already - consolidating servers... /shudder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Novellus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Luclin and Velious gives more fun..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Askeer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">shrink that sig please novellus</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Im enjoying EQ for the first time in awhile cause alot of the changes have me optimistic.  The content i am doing i enjoy, and the guild im with has alot of potential in my eyes. Im also enjoying 2boxing a vital cleric and learning how to play him better (chchain, spot healing, group healing, pvp healing, pvp suriving) at the same time i play my sk. To all the bored people out there i really would suggest picking up another account and 2boxing a shaman or cleric and seeing if it offers some more fullfillment.<br />
<br />
The only things that have me down atm is the fact that i wont have a 2nd computer to 3box my bst with till the end of summer (free comp woot!). And the upcoming pvp doomsday changes which as is will probably effect my guild and my characters severly in a negative way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Ajrarn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Having as much fun as ever, maybe more. Encounters in later Gates are creative and challenging.<br />
/agree, I love GoD to and I prefere violent short fight there against very hard hitting mobs than neverending boring fight like in luclin or PoP against mobs having millions of hps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Daywalka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">shrink that sig please novellus<br />
<br />
But they are Friends For Life! That means they can have a sig that's 380x430, instead of 500x200 like it says in the forum rules. :)</div></div><hr />
