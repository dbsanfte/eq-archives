<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>neferaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A lot of people probably feel that after picking a cool race and of course the most fun class (SK) that after several levels they picked the wrong stats. A lot of people picked STA or INT after reading this board, which are good choises. But some picked AGI, DEX, STR... or maybe even WIS or CHA when they created their char long ago and regretted it ever since. The effects of most stats often became apparrent much later, often much too late to start all over again. For some a simple primal proc capped most of their stats, for others equipment they had no clue existed when they started did the same for them.<br />
<br />
There is already a service where Verant will change your characters name or even your server if you pay them. Why not your stats? I am sure there would be a great interest in this even if it costs a little. I am also sure that this is probably less invasive then changing someones characters name.<br />
<br />
p.s. After looking around a bit I think this post belongs in this section best, if I should have put it elsewhere I am sorry for the inconvenience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grundarz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">you can always just use aa's once u get high enough... my sk was givin to me at like lvl 10 so i never knew what all that stuff was. But now i think the original owner put all the stats into str. But my char looks great atm i think =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>neferaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">For myself I really regret putting 20 points in agi. Since that boosted avoidance AC I thought it was a good idea to do at the time as mobs hit hard and procced nasty things. Also someone told me agi was the hardest stat to max... but when you get primal that point is moot since you hit the melee stats hardcap easy with avatar. Sadly I did not know yet how small the impact of agi on AC was back then. I would rather have put it all in int for burst DPS and PvP (even with wishlist items I don't think I can get that stat to the soft cap). Or maybe sta (though shaman buffs help there). For int only VoQ adds to it. Pouring tons of AA's into stats sucks since I think there are many more useful AA skills I would like to get before it and xp time is only limited as most of my time is spent raiding or helping other people.<br />
<br />
I would gladly pay a little (much like people pay for name changes) to have the starting stats changed, so I hope they add that option sometime.</div></div><hr />

Easy way to check that...<br />
<br />
when you die, just compare your stats to the starting stats and see where the difference(s) are.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gollgoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Changing stats would be an awesome service.  I know almost all of my chars were made when I first started game, trying to find a class I truly loved.  As a result, most of them had points put in to STR :eek: <br />
<br />
The only website I knew about at the time made STR sound like the best stat, gah.<br />
<br />
Anyway, good idea Nef.  Not sure if I would pay for the service, but would be sorely tempted.<br />
