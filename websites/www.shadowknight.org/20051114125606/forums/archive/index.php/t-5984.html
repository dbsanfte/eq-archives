<br />
I have narrowed it down to troll or iksar since I really want the regen.<br />
<br />
Thing is the following: Is there any accessible armor for iksars that compare to troll/ogre imbued cultural? I will have no hard time reaching level 45, nor will I have a hard time to reach thurg class armor - but a step above that, what is there for iksars?<br />
<br />
Any other comment on iksar vs troll appreciated :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">be3</div><div class="date">09-26-2002, 08:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd like to take a second to say I'm new to the fourms, and the ways of the shadow knight.<br />
<br />
Back to subject though, I myself once, played a Troll and Iksar both as shadow knights, and I must say that I liked the Iksar better.<br />
<br />
I'm not really sure I understand your question but if your asking what comes out better in the end game, it depends on what you mean in the end game. If you want a shadowknight that can take some hits, troll obviously would be the better pick, but if you want more of a rounded race, iksar is a chosen one.<br />
<br />
Iksars cant wear plate armors, yes, but the armors they CAN wear do get fairly decent at the end game, and the armor class bonus they get naturally also comes in handy.<br />
<br />
Anymore from what people tell me and from what I experience the races are pretty much rounded off, anymore you cant really even assign yourself the wrong stats because of all the nice gear out there that boosts quickly.<br />
<br />
I played a troll shadowknight not to far, I didnt really like the way they worked, they are more of a tank, like more of a warrior type rather a necromancer, if I had to give my own percentages I would have to say a Troll Shadowknight is 70% warrior 30% caster (depending on gear) and Iksar Shadowknight 55% caster 45% warrior.<br />
<br />
Another person is probably gonna reply to this and tell me I'm all wrong, but like I said, Im new to the SK class and these fourms, I'm just posting my opinions that Ive talked with people about in-game and from what I have experienced.<br />
<br />
If I had to choose between Troll or Iksar I would have to go Iksar just because I think they make a better shadow knight versus a troll.</div></div><hr />

It does not come even close to the new Ogre/Troll cultural.  Once you get the velious armors it all evens out some but before that the Troll will have an edge in armor selection.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Skek</div><div class="date">10-04-2002, 01:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Of course... there's the one missed so far<br />
<br />
Size!!<br />
<br />
Iksars have no problem in tight twisty places like solb.  Trolls need a shrink or it's very easy to get blocked.<br />
<br />
I also hated the troll's penalties to fire resists.  <br />
<br />
I originally started out as a troll, but changed to an ikky at level 22 for the following reasons.<br />
<br />
Armor Bonus<br />
No real penalty on what you can wear at end game.<br />
Faction was no issue velious upwards.<br />
Cabalis is a great start town, giving you a base in kunark, without having to pay shoddy prices that you get at outposts.<br />
Tradeskills are ridiculously easy to learn in cab due to proximity of vendors.<br />
No crappy fire resist<br />
xp penalties same as troll<br />
No large size<br />
very balanced statwise accross the board.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm glad i did change... I hate what luclin did to the troll models.</div></div><hr />

The new Iksar cultural armor is pure crapple.<br />
Agree.<br />
<br />
If you're basing your pick on available cultural armor at level 45, then your choice is a troll, hands down.  Iksar cultural doesn't come close in terms of either AC or stats (and most of it has +WIS instead of +INT, if I am not mistaken).<br />
<br />
I do not regret my choice of Iksar, because my primary factor was looks, and I love the way Iksar look.  But we got shafted pretty badly on cultural armor.</div></div><hr />

Do us all a favor: make a halfling paladin and leave us the fuck alone.  How many times do we have to beat it over people's heads in that you should make whatever you will have fun with and leave it at that?<br />
<br />
If you think regen is going to make a difference, go look at the magelo profiles of ogre Shadowknights, human Shadowknights, and Erudite Shadowknights.  They don't have regen yet somehow they manage to do just fine.<br />
<br />
And for anyone that thinks that the homoerotic new troll model is worth a flip, I am betting you started playing a troll well after the new models came out and have no clue as to how ridiculously stupid and so-not-scary the new troll model is.  They stand there with their chin on their left shoulder and look at me like they want to rub someone's crotch or something.  It's nothing like the horned hulking mass of destruction they once were.  Same stats, I suppose, but look about as scary and intimidating as Chuck E. Cheese.</div></div><hr />

Magelo does not recognize the regen modifier for troll and iksar races.  When you read &quot;health regen of ##&quot; you have to tack on more hp if its an iksar or troll.  For instance: say an iksar/troll and a human have equivalent gear on that gives 5 more hp per tick regen;  Magelo will state that each race (iksar/troll and human) get &quot;health regeneration of 5hp per tick&quot;.  This is not entirely true.  Its the amount of health regeneration they get for their gear (and now for aa abilities as well, since its included in magelo).  A level 60 troll/iksar regens for between 16 and 18 pts of hp per tick MORE than any other race.  So in actuality when magelo says &quot;5 pts of regen&quot; for a troll/iksar what it really means is &quot;21-23pts of regen&quot;.  If you don't want to believe this recognize that I am a 60 troll SK and i have tested my hp regen per tick many times.  Based on level it is:<br />
<br />
1-19: 4hp per tick (for sure and confirmed)<br />
20-39: 6hp per tick (for sure and confirmed)<br />
40-49: 8 or 10 hp per tick (i cant remember any more)<br />
50-59: 12hp per tick (i cant remember any more)<br />
60: 16hp per tick (for sure and confirmed)</div></div><hr />

<br />
LOL who pissed on your corn flakes this morning? :P<br />
<br />
Anyways, the question was quite specific and was regarding armor choices and availability of cultural armors to lizzards. If you don't like the topic just don't read it.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the replies guys.</div></div><hr />

You can easily afford to buy decent ikky wearable armour that will see you through to thurg/kael/ss armour.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Numzaz</div><div class="date">10-08-2002, 07:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you WANT to wear crafted armour or could even make it yourself you should pick Troll (or Ogre). The Ogre made stuff is really nice and is definately special, you don't see it often.<br />
The crafted armour for Lizards is just poor in comparison to the Ogre gear.<br />
(There is a nice stat summary on eqtraders)<br />
<br />
If it's just about funds and straight twinking though, you could probably get a funghi for the price of an Ogre suit and then pay for ToV MQs on top of it :D <br />
In that case the race question does not matter, play whatever graphics you like better (I personally prefer &quot;old&quot; Trolls /shrugg)</div></div><hr />
