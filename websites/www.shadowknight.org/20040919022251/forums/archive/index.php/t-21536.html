<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shainaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone know of this bug?  One of the druids in my guild posted it saying someone he was grouped with in BoT was doing this:<br />
<br />
<br />
1. Preform a harm touch<br />
2. Head over the the zone line and use one of your /disc the second before you zone.<br />
3. When you zone over, harm touch will pop back up and be usuable.<br />
<br />
Since you have four /disc 's you can do this four times an hour.<br />
<br />
Done a couple searches and found nothing on this imparticular so thought i would ask.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>The Zenogias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Regular HT or.....?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shainaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i would assume it is the non-aa version of the HT.  But i don't know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>ghoule</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Actually that zoning bug works with a lot of similar hot key abilities, my main can Cann 5 and zone and has an immediate refresh of Cann 5.  Its not new, been around since LDON started (around when my shaman got Cann 5) but happens a lot more now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>StPatrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hmm, all I could achieve is to zone out and see that HT (and discs) buttons are back, but clicking on any of them just telling me that you have so and so time before you can use your ability, etc. :confused: <br />
<br />
Will try to experiment more, who knows...</div></div><hr />

I would seriously hope people are exploiting that bug for AA harm touch, if it's even a valid exploit at all.  <br />
<br />
You'd have to be completely retarded to run to the zone(leaving your group without a puller or tank, whatever role you happened to be filling), zone over, zone back, and rejoin the group, just for 1000-1500(I forget how much non-AA HT does at 65) damage.  You could do more than that by staying put and hitting auto-attack, let alone casting spears/taps.  And think how much damage the actual dps people in the group can do in that 90 seconds instead of waiting for their tank to run away, zone twice, and run back.  It's a lot more than 1500, I'll garauntee that.<br />
<br />
AA HT being affected is the only thing that might make something like that worthwile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ganaith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Lhranc is soloable then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Paynreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Originally posted by Ganaith <br />
Lhranc is soloable then.  <br />
<br />
Assuming you make it to the zone line. Being able to HT four times doesn't change the fact that he hits like a motherfucker.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Amphitryon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I can think of some solo spots near a ZI where this could be useful (though a previous poster is right, youd have to be a total numbnuts to leave your grp to get HT to refresh like this)<br />
<br />
Could be an intersting exploit on PvP serves though</div></div><hr />
