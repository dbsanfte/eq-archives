<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Corurum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello, I'm a level 51 sk (re: can't use fear for agro), who is having trouble keeping agro.  I have 21 percent haste, Frostreaver, and only 1400 mana.  No FT at all.  I use CD, and Terror but agro will still ping pong if i have a rogue or ranger with epic in my group.  I'm afraid if i get a wizard in my group.  If you guys know any other tricks i can use please help me out.  I've stopped mashing taunt and just use it when they turn away but even with the skill maxed i get ~25 percent sucess rate.  <br />

<br />
Thats my magelo for hps and ac numbers.  No aa's just yet.  I really only have like 800p so i can't really afford any uber upgrades yet.  Thanks for the help.  <br />
<br />
I did search for any help but all said to use CD and fear but there in lies my problem.  I use CD and its not working so well and all hte mobs are too low level for fear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Maicom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">cast cd again?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>yadaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">pull with cd, taunt, bash, beg, taunt, cast cd, sit, stand, bash beg, taunt, attack etc etc thats what i do but not the sitting part</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ashrai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">In the 50s I used Heart Flutter, used it all the way up to the point where I could safely use Fear. Really though CD should be all you need. If you're doing everything right then ask the rogue if he's evading and ask the ranger to:<br />
<br />
-stop snaring over you<br />
-stop ganking agro<br />
-go away<br />
<br />
You're at the level when you're with people who don't know how to control agro at all, so you're going through exactly what happens in the low 50's.<br />
<br />
<br />
I remember at level 51 doing my very first PoP group in PoD. There was a ranger in the group, and it was my first introduction to &quot;let's play who has the bigger agro&quot;. <br />
<br />
That was the day I learnedthat it's perfectly OK to give it to them if they want it that badly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Corurum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for the advice so far.  Right now i'm stuck in PoFear with no way to get out so i can't really try those out untill later on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Culdahl1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ashrai is right, it's probably not your fault, but if you can't get the others to watch their aggro you can try meming your 2 0.5 second cast terrors and chain them, after snaring mob on incoming....The only real problem with this is that you have to use 3 gems, for snare + the two terrrors, that could be better used on something else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It may be a myth but it works for me.<br />
I used to only cast terrors when in melee range.  Also only after I did damage to the mob.  a couple of CD's on incoming (even if they don't hold) give a tone of agro and are mana efficient.  Also save up for a Earring of Solstice kit.<br />
<br />
That and your magelo is one of a 56 warrior...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Arikash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">THE INTERLOPER SHALL DESTROY YOU FOR THE HERETIC MAGELO!!!!<br />
<br />
No, but seriously, it's probably not your fault.  Cast CD a few times on inc, and then do some terrors maybe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Corurum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">ok fixed magelo.. should be right number.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My advice would be:<br />
1. Pull if you can and do initial melee damage.<br />
2. Chain your cd/fast cast aggro spells<br />
3. stand right on the mob's toes<br />
4. Hold taunt until mobs turns (which you're doing now).<br />
5. If you are not doing the pulling, make sure that the puller actually brings the mob to you, and not to some random location in the camp where the ranger gets two rounds of melee in before you can run across the room to engage mob. Make sure the group knows that where you are standing is where the fight will happen--no rushing the incoming mob.<br />
<br />
Secondarily, if you're doing all that, don't worry overly much about letting the rogue tank for a bit at level 51. If the rogue and ranger are well geared, then they probably aren't dying before you get aggro back. If the cleric can stand the inefficient use of his healing mana, then if you're exp vs. blue mobs the group might be most efficient if all melee pull out the dps stops and get the mob dead asap.<br />
They'll stop ganking your aggro when it gets 'em killed or when the cleric tells 'em to cut it out. Good players will stop earlier than bad players (rogues in particular are actually hurting their dps the longer the mob's on them), unless the good players are extremely well geared.<br />
If you're doing your job, then dps classes like rogues and wizards have to do theirs: max dps until their aggro is just below the tank's. If they repeatedly fail to stay under your aggro, they're simply not doing their job.<br />
I guess you could get an yak aug for your weapon, but it shouldn't be necessary, I wouldn't think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Fedarov</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Pull if you can, If not have assist up and snare on incoming (should get the mob straight to you). In the early fight as soon as you see a succesfull taunt smack a darkness on it (this ensures you are well ahead on taunt) after that as said above save taunt for when it turns and have a spear spells and or terror spells up for fast dps / aggro if it turns.<br />
<br />
If you are doing all this and losing aggro its prolly some kid behind the toon shouting look look momy i am stealing aggro from an sk. If this is the case my favorite is a quiet tell to the cleric saying next time dont heal him :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>DConquest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Look at Aggro like a Horse race.  You got you and 5 other &quot; horses &quot; at the start.   Once the pull is made and brought to camp, you and your groupmates are &quot; racing &quot; for aggro.  An aggro spell like clinging darkness is a Speed Boost.  So is taunt if it lands, it brings to the head of the pack.  Let's say Mr. Rogue just passed you, try hiting taunt to get ahead of the pack and THEN use clinging darkness.  Get in the habit of doing this, and you'll always wear the blue ribbon  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Oagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Let the ranger die.  People that play virtual penis contests when a MA/Tank is assigned deserve to die.  At your level, it will get worse before it gets better.  You'll progress and level, and then someday, you'll be in a group with a ranger, warrior or pally that is 2-3 levels below you.  They'll either hit taunt, or stun, etc.  trying to show how badass they are.  If you know your cleric, tell them not to heal if they steal aggro (presuming you're the designated MA).<br />
<br />
The only way to teach punks to play their toon right is to let the fekkers die.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Eggborn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">cast aggro spells on incoming and try to keep healers and other melee from being on the mobs path in front of you<br />
<br />
<br />
I only let the enchanter and the puller there.  If you happen to encounter a mob that rampages, then maybe it's ok then to have the melee right there next to get aggro.<br />
<br />
Incoming casts make a big difference in aggro. If those rangers are hitting the mobs with arrows as they run in, that is probably what is doing it.  Also, takes me at least two casts to be sure I have it before anyone else touches it, and I chain cast in the fight.  I don't normally tell people that though, as they need to tash etc, slow and should be able to judge what they can do on their own.  Anyone other than the tank though, needs to get  feel on what the tank can keep aggrowise and adjust.  After two to three mobs people should figure it out.  Get spell haste if you can too.  The times to watch are the beginning and especially the end when they all open up.  Heart flutter is a good middle to end of a fight spell to cast if you do choose to use it.  I suspect sometimes I cast more than bards.  In some situations if I even stop to answer a tell or say something in group, boom the mob in on someone else.<br />
<br />
If all else fails, sit down, or.. go solo in The Burning Woods</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>ssakaschaigidel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">You bumped a month old thread to tell him to cast heart flutter near the end of the fight?<br />
<br />
Ok.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Eggborn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">oo SORRY!!  like I have nothing better to do than read the threads everyday like you<br />
<br />
I guess a month is a REAL long time for you.  Go do something more useful than flame me when I try to help someone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Croix VorAbaddon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Since it's already been bumped ::Shrugs::<br />
<br />
<br />
Since the others have offered good advice so far, here's something to keep in mind for the near future. You'll soon be getting your &quot;Voice&quot; line of spells. While tanking, keep these up as much as possible, as it will make your job MUCH easier.<br />
<br />
Something else to consider for now isn't ranger snare ((Never had a problem with that myself)) but necro's who insist on snaring. Now, I can't blame them on the overall, they are likely used to it. But if you note a necro snaring over you, put a stop to that immediately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>shadowblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Voice spells are a waste of time mana and spell slot in group situations. and fairly useless in raids too. Completely unnessesary. They are an outdated spell line which was never particulary good too begin with. (apart from perhaps a short time when warriors needed all the agro boost they could get)<br />
<br />
Simple as that. Dont bother with them.<br />
<br />
Also now with terror of discord. I dont even memorize snare most of the time. (unless no one else to do it)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>ssakaschaigidel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Wow, people actually use Voice?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>LocostrangeTF</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">but necro's who insist on snaring. Now, I can't blame them on the overall, they are likely used to it. But if you note a necro snaring over you, put a stop to that immediately.<br />
<br />
<br />
If I'm not mistaken, you still generate same agro if your spell did not take hold and a bonus is if your snare isn't taking hold then due to how they code it, spells not taken hold do not cost mana(I will double check this when I have time to go on).<br />
<br />
So I don't really see a big deal of having another class snare over you in terms of agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>kilst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Best bet is to just chain cast Clinging Darkness the whole fight. Screw DPS if u ask me, thats not what ur there for. The rest of the group is useless if there dead. When I'm tanking nameds I just go all out aggro, i dont bother with attacking (saves being hit from riposte), the rest dont get aggro at all chaining cd and by the end the necro's going &quot;wtf?! i had 1K damage a tick going and i didnt get aggro!!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Kilkulan Darkwarrior</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Wow, people actually use Voice? the new voice is uber! I slap a Festering and then 2 ToD at the start of the fight and then once more at 50% and never lose aggro</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Daywalka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Tip #1 - Don't use Voice on yourself, ever. It's a waste of a buff and a waste of a spell slot.<br />
<br />
Tip #2 - Don't mash Taunt everytime it comes up. It gives you +1 Hate on top of what the person highest on the list has, which should be you. Save it for when you need it.<br />
<br />
Tip #3 - It doesn't matter if someone snares over you. A Ranger, Druid, Necro can put their highest level snare on the mob if they want, your casting of CD for aggro won't be affected either way.<br />
<br />
Tip #4 - If someone else in the group keeps taking aggro from you, by all means, let them have it. A death will go a long way in letting them see that stealing aggro is not a good thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Ziglug D</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">A ranger told me the other day in a GE Gates group that I was the best tank he ever grouped with because I actually kept aggro on the mob and he wasnt getting hit like normal. <br />
<br />
He was pulling, upon inc. cast CD on the mob...Will come strait to you, if you just cast CD at every 10-20% HP of the mob depending how bad aggro situation is. I had to do it at every 10 or so because the ranger was freaking going all out, guess thats why he normally got &quot;hit&quot;.<br />
<br />
It's not hard, im lvl 58 and the ranger was 60, and uber twinked.</div></div><hr />
