<br />
Well at this point i'm burnt out on my main's class role and purpose in the game(more lack there of), so i'm retiring him and instead of making a alt, this character will be my new main. I've never played a tank class before so maybe my view is skewed, but as I always understood it SKs and warriors had the same basic role in the game, just a different way of achieving it. They both are normally the main damage-takers in the group, warriors holding aggro through fast quick weapons with procs, taunt, and aggro discs, and SKs rely more on spells and slow heavy hitting weapons with aggro procs as well. Is this not the way it is?<br />
<br />
I intend to take this character at least as far as the EP, maybe time+ depending how long my interest in EQ holds out with all the new games coming out soon. As I said before though I've never played a tank class or even close to one, so I really have no idea of what would help me decide between warr and SK.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">SKs and warriors do have the same basic purpose in the game.  Warriors are more dependent on gear for aggro, but can take the incoming damage a lot better.  If you're not planning on going past Elemental or a little bit of Time, there isn't much to distinguish between the two characters.  Warriors are having a trickle down effect from higher level attitudes at the moment, so they potentially have an easier time getting a group, but both are sufficient tanks for PoP content.  Pick whichever one appeals to you more, while keeping in mind that warriors are better able to soak damage with equivalent gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
roll a warrior.  one thing they will never lack is roll definition.  SKs lack a roll definition on many raids as well.<br />
<br />
but I haven't played in 2 months, so things may have changed (hah)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Powa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">don't ask, make a warrior</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Noctix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">With a warrior you get unquestioned tanking superiority, a well defined role, and the benefit of an entire player base who thinks warriors are better tanks.<br />
<br />
With a SK you get the flexibility to be the 3rd-8th best tank, puller, or dps.  You can solo inefficiently in a pinch and have near agro-lock on trivial low con mobs.  You have to fight against a player base that has no clue what your role is supposed to be and generally isn't interested in finding out.<br />
<br />
It is possible to play a SK well and accomplish a lot of things in EQ.  However, when they say that Shadowknights are a high difficulty class, they aren't kidding.  SKs can be powerful if played creatively but they don't fit the stereotypical EQ group/raid mold well at all.<br />
<br />
So, if you're mainly looking for a well defined role, you should listen to what everyone else said and make a warrior.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As far as being a warrior or sk, if you have a 'friend' base to group with, I'd go with SK.   I think warriors are terribly boring, period.   After playing an sk for a long time, I started a warrior to group with friends.  I got bored fast.<br />
<br />
Yes, warriors are more wanted, but til you get to the high levels you'll do just as well being an sk.  I'd love to go through all the levels again as an sk.  I'd dread every minute as a warrior.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This isn't a stupid answer. The question is what is stupid.<br />
There is enough information here, on steelwarriors and any number of other class forums to get a good idea of both classes and their pros and cons. If you can't be bothered in finding out the basic details of a class that you say you want to be your new 'main', then what other response do you expect?<br />
<br />
Long time SKs play their characters because they like them and play them well. They complain about class issues because they have put a lot of time and effort into their characters and feel passionate about them. Someone wanting to PL up a twink, gear them out in the bazaar and then call them their new main is more than likely going to end up as someone who can't play their class and worsen the reputation of SKs. So if that's the end result, I'd rather see them play a warrior too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Zakton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Make a bard</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Arikash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">[quote] Make a bard[/quote<br />
<br />
If he can play a bard, and be good at it, then yes, make one.  I've boxed my friends bard a few times, and it's pretty fun, except for the endless twisting of buttons.  If played well, bards are probably the most useful class in the game, but very few people can play them at all, I've met 3 bards that can twist, and only 1 of them twisted good songs, others were played shitty songs, and only 1 bard that can keep something mezzed, and still keep his twist up.<br />
<br />
All in all, make a bard, it will solve your problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Nephtu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I guess I'm always a bit mystified by these posts.  It's be look someone at the office saying &quot;I have $100 to spend on going out for dinner with my wife/GF/SO/whatever - where should I go?&quot;  Or  &quot;I'm going to get an ice cream - what flavour will I like?&quot;  <br />
<br />
My immediate response is to wonder how someone who doesn't know what they want can imagine I have a clue what they ought to so, and respond with some snappy sarcastic response, like &quot;Make a warrior&quot;.  <br />
<br />
But, on more sober consideration, I think I have to boil it down to - go do your homework, we just can't help you at this juncture.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agreed Menon.  My first and only char = shadowknight.<br />
<br />
Basically if you are going to be a shadowknight and be good at it, it's because it's in your soul.  Shadowknight is WHAT YOU WANT TO BE and nothing else.  You've known this for what seems like forever.  <br />
<br />
So if you ask &quot;should I be a shadowknight or a warrior&quot; then you've answered your own question -- it's not in your soul to be a shadowknight.  You don't have the dedication, the force of will, to do so.  Be a warrior.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Korff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">If you feel you can really play with a lot of skill, make a bard or necro, or even a chanter.  Those 3 classes (I am biased), in that order, imo bring an amount of quality to a group that varies the most depending on player skill.<br />
<br />
Tank?  If you consider yourself adaptable make an sk.  If you wanna keep things simple and be a great tank without requiring quite as much skill, roll a warrior.  <br />
<br />
As a warrior, you are accepted as the best tank in most situations, especially with 200k of gear on.  As an sk, you won't be many groups' first choice tank, but you can do the job well regardless.  Know your spells and abilities and use them well, and you'll be extremely useful to a group.<br />
<br />
It all boils down to personal preference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Ashraam-SK_TT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">For those of you who said make a sk i agree. It is the first class i have played and i like my sk alot, its fun to play and more interesting then a meatshield(warrior).<br />
<br />
But choose what you want to play , you are the one paying to play the game and use your characters not us</div></div><hr />
