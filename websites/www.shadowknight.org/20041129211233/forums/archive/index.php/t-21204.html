<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>tyrrax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This is a repost from some ideas I posted on another thread here. I got no feedback so I thought to try it here ( I guess I should post in the right forum huh?). Some of my ideas are a little different but maybe different is the solution we need. <br />
<br />
Here are some ideas I've had. Some good some maybe not. <br />
<br />
-A single target mez. I know, were not chanters. But make it with a high recycle time so the SK isn't mezzing trains and zero memblur so that the SK will have aggro when it expires. <br />
<br />
-Slow. Yet again were not chanters or shaman. A slow that is not as effective as shaman or chanter but make one that stacks with theirs. Maybe make it a tap to let us add to our DPS like our AC/ATK/Sta taps <br />
<br />
-Drain HT. An AA that on command will add half the HT's damage to your HP kinda like a heal. <br />
<br />
-Fix spell aggro. I know this sounds nuts but this would get a big warrior bitch off our backs. However improve our terror line of spells so that we use that to get aggro. After all why were they put into the game in the first place? <br />
<br />
-Damage aura. Instead of giving SK's defensive. Give SK's an ability to reflect melee damage or a portion of it back to the attacker. Sort of like an ultra high powered damage shield. The SK would still take the damage and need healing but would be doing more damage to the mob. This might be ideal in the case of SK ramp tanks taking over in case the MT falls, the extra damage would create the needed short term aggro to keep healers and high end DPS from getting summoned and eaten. <br />
<br />
-Animate shadow. A triggered AA ability similar to the pet swarm AA's that are out there. This would create a shadow duplicate of the SK that can fight for a brief period of time. The emote would be &quot;Soandso's shadow comes to life&quot;. It would have similar raw stats to the summoner. If the SK has a pet already it is destroyed. Duration would be 30secs to one minute tops. Think of Grom Hellscream's power in Warcraft 3. <br />
<br />
I admit some if these ideas may not be the best but maybe something different is in order. We're not getting defensive. We're not going to get new spells until the next expansion (if there is one). We do not have the numbers to even some close to causing the uproar that warriors did. Hopefully warriors won't be fighting tooth an nail against us like they have been in getting these changes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Can I just have the convert SK's to Warriors option?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>tyrrax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sorry bro.  You don't have an adequate skill in Whining, you need at least a 300.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Androsulach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Tyraxx, the HT lifetap idea is already in place.  Leech Touch has been a Class AA for some time.  Brael, correct me if I'm wrong, but Leech Touch scales in it's ability to tap with the Improved HT AAs, doesn't it?<br />
<br />
The combat speed tap idea sounds like a nice addition to our a debuff tap lines.<br />
<br />
The mez idea, well, we do get one, Rest The Dead, at 52.  It's an undead lull.  Don't know if it's effective against undead as Pacify is against all mobs, but it may be.  Do Paladins get more than one of the Pacify line, I know that Clerics get a couple of them.  Necros get more than one undead lull, don't they also get an undead charm?  Any way, maybe they should give us the other Necro undead lull, since they get it in the mid 50s, at say 64 or 65.<br />
<br />
The damage aura.  Now that one sounds like an improved damageshield.  Where does our self-only DS top out, dmg wise?  Could there be one that we'd get at 65 or be added in the 66-70 range, provided they do raise the lvl cap to 70?  Something that would be similar to a riposte as far as it's dmg to the mob goes.<br />
<br />
But I have to say, I really do kinda like the Animate Shadow idea.  Be almost like being two places at once beating on a mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well we could try our hand at pulling but oh wait we the bards and monks willl probably complain.<br />
<br />
And as we know we cannot progress at the expense of another class.<br />
<br />
Well lets get some more dps and be a dps class.<br />
<br />
Oh wait the monks rangers beastlords beserkers and rogues might complain so we cant have that.<br />
<br />
Well lets try to be cannon fodder.  We can be the best cannon fodder in the game.  Kind of like a speed bump.  We every knight in front of the mob so they can get mowed down in droves until a might warrior is ready to take them on.<br />
<br />
And you all said we had no raid role?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Originally posted by Brael <br />
Can I just have the convert SK's to Warriors option?  <br />
<br />
During the conversion to warrior you lose HT but keep your &quot;uber&quot; DoT's<br />
<br />
Besides...sounds like we've been converted to level 50 rangers anyway</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>cmdrbean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I do like the idea of a slow / haste tap. It's interesting, and coule be useful. Maybe even make it a group tap that stacks with other haste, but only like 10 or 20%? I dunno, but whatever form it could take, the idea strikes me.<br />
<br />
Of course, that wouldn't fix our issues, it's just something I might enjoy having.</div></div><hr />
