<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>signa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It sounds nice, except id do something about the graphics card. The mx is very cheap, but you get what you pay for. Personally, I upgraded from the MX440 when the prices on the ATI 9800 came down, and I've been very very pleased with the jump in performance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Skvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What speed is the processor ?<br />
<br />
XP Home ... hmmm yeah ok it works but I personally think Pro is worth the extra $ <br />
<br />
Gfx card - iffy card at best . But its easily upgradeable at a later date if money is tightish<br />
<br />
80 gig hard drive - kinda small but again its easy to add another one at a later date <br />
<br />
<br />
Sounds a decent enough basic system though :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">ddr ram or sd ram? and 80gb is fine, even a little overboard unless your one of those people that has kazaa up 24/7 on a t1 line and have 5000~ music videos. Pro and home edition XP not that big of a deal, but I would take pro for the extra cash. Video card is a must. If your going to put out cash for the rest of your system, might as well drop the same to your vid card. My suggestion is a 9800.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shainaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">ANY MX video card = useless / worthless when it comes to gaming and Win XP Home is a bad idea.  Go Win XP Pro or Win 2k.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Howlitoezis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">gf4mx = gf2 with faster core speed.<br />
like others ahve said, ditch the gf4mx. get a 9600pro/xt or 5700u or higher.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Daeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">arrg not the Geforce MX!<br />

and he says it runs quite well only thing changed in those specs were he changed the video card to the Radoen 9800</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Space</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yeh graphics card sucks more balls than a tennis autoserve machine ati 9800 or fx5900 are best bet, pretty sure that MX isn't gonna be fully dx9 compliant  for new engine coming soon as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Eigen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Since this looks like a budget rig, then I'd suggest an ATI 9600XT.  Retail, you'll be paying about $180.  You should be able to find a deal online at around $160.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Korff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">There is extremely little difference between XP Pro and XP home. Unless you run a network with over 6 computers, home will do fine.<br />
<br />
Also, the MX440 might be a Geforce4, but it performs no better than a Geforce2</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Howlitoezis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">gf4mx is, in fact, a gf2. same architecture on smaller process with higher speeds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>nezzka is bad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">korff i like your sig.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>vilesoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Sounds good, but the GF$MX won't cut it for EQ.<br />
<br />
The GF4MX is a GeForce 2TI.  I reccomend gettnig either a GeForceFX or  Radeon 9800 pro 128.  I can't say which GeForce since I havent playeed with their stuff since my  GF4TI4400.<br />
<br />
My 9800pro 128 does very well.  Just make sure it has teh 256 bit processing...some recent makers have gimped it using 128 bit processing...those cards are to be avoided at all costs...actually avoid the brands who make those altogether, since the 128bit processing is not meeting ATI reference spec....and god knows what other specs they cut short on as well?<br />
<br />
I just buy the genuine &quot;made by  ATI&quot; product just to be sure of what i buy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Howlitoezis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">they gimp it to 128 bit memory bus, not processing.<br />
But yes, make sure it is the 256 bit memroy bus. i.e do not buy an SE model.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>vilesoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">my badd, got my crap mixed up.<br />
<br />
Either way..you know there are gimped radeon 9800s on the market...that's enough info to be a better shopper, so either way...it's all good :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Mehatesu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">bleh, just get yourself a 9600 pro 256..It will handle what ever EQ throws at it nicely..I have one on my system and I have everything maxed out..And I have very very very little lag..And my processer isnt that great either, just a P4 2.8.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Zero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">If you have a good sense of computer knowledge (mechanical also) you can make up for a crap video card by diverting more stress to the ram. Make sure your ram has a heat sink though, at the least. <br />
<br />
You will also need a sauldering iron.<br />
<br />
P.s.- (I'm not completely sure how to spell &quot;sawtering&quot; so I went with sauldering, because i'm too  lazy to check the real spelling)<br />
<br />
err, point to that = if your up to it, post back and ill make a little write-up on how to do it.</div></div><hr />
