plus he drops a note sometimes which you can then take to sir lucan to get the traitor quest<br />
(the traitor is guard alayle out back of the militia house, he's a pally spy so you can kill him with impunity, hand sir lucan his bloody tunic for militia faction)<br />
don't kill the guy fishing next to mojax though<br />
killing mojax is also a good way to get in with the freeport militia<br />
xelha nevagon's quests are the way to go otherwise for dismal rage, she especially likes bonechips i seem to recall</div></div><hr />

 <br />
(Oddly enough,since I buy 4 chips from a vendor for a bit under 9 silver,it's even a profit. :P)<br />
 <br />
But any Erudite fresh from his newbie area should have enough chips to get in easily with the Rage-and they aren't KOS to any SK's except maybe Iksar.</div></div><hr />

<br />
where do you do this at?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rabdos</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 02:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You buy bone chips from any vendor that newbies have sold them to. I don't know anybody that regularly sells chips to vendors though. Most people that know anything stockpile them to sell to necros, or high level people doing the various bone chip quests.<br />
<br />
I've managed to get to amiable faction with both Dismal Rage and Freeport Militia. I've even got the Militia Reserve Tunic.</div></div><hr />
