Upcoming July 2004<br />
We have an update tentatively scheduled for July 8th.  Some of the highlights include;<br />
<br />
The ability to remove augments from items and retain them.<br />
<br />
The new Veeshan's Peak! <br />
<br />
Brenlo the Updated<br />
--------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
While I am pleased about being able to remove augments from my weapons and armor, I am starting to find it &quot;interesting&quot; that still very little about &quot;class balance&quot; is on the radar scope.<br />
<br />
Keep up with the nice game changes SOE, but how about letting us know about the class issues and those great &quot;lists&quot; you compiled.</div></div><hr />

Exactly what level of content is the new VP supposed to be?  <br />
<br />
New VP is elemental level.<br />
<br />
People with the old key will have to complete one raid event to upgrade to the new key.</div></div><hr />

I'm fine with them taking their time to work out class blance. Its not a simple or straight forward objective, and if it takes a little longer for them to get it right, then let them have it. Sks will just have to take it for awhile longer and hope for the light at the end of the tunnel.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>uinilie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Id rather see them take there time with class balance than blindly passing on to us the wrong stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>scpio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">now if only you could turn in those type 7 40hp augs for a type 8 version =P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Assuming they don't remove it, you can already turn in AP purchased augments for a full refund and purchase type 8 augs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yah, you can already get the points back.  Depending on the price of removal, trading in my old type 7s could be a real boon for someone like me who doesnt have much free time pile up ldon points for every gear upgrade.</div></div><hr />
