<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Susk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay, <br />
<br />
Im gonna keep this short and sweet.  We should have a necro rez!  Reason?  I look at Pally spells and their usefulness on raids, and see how closely they reflect off their cleric counterparts in usefulness.   Clerics have rez, and so do their hybrids, paladins (to a leser extent).   Necros also have rez, using an Essence Emerald, and therefore I strongly feel that shadowknights should also have a rez, that also requires the use of an Essence Emerald, and should also be of lesser quality...say a 75- 80% rez. Even if they made it a quest, for us to acquire it, that would really be the right and FAIR thing to do.   <br />
<br />
Just my 2 coppers worth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hrafndarke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">give me twitch too so i can be some two bit retro raids man-whore... or wait how about i just do cool shit while you fluff the clerics and res. them... on second thought ill get to slap a 80% res ona a whiney two bit overly inflated cleric for teh win. I second this</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Susk: Shut the fuck up, fuckoff, and just go kill yourself. Maybe do your own test of face vs. car, it might be fun.<br />
<br />
SKs will never get a rez, never should get a rez, and the devs will never even think about us getting a rez. Why the fuck does someone have to drudge up this idea once every few months? It's a fucking stupid idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">We need the necro rez!<br />
<br />
In a word: No.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Moardok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">A rez of somekind would be cool..it would be usefull no matter what you think it would come in handy.<br />
<br />
Even a 0% xp return rez like what they give Druid and Shammy now since OoW,would be cool if we could have something like that.<br />
<br />
EXAMPLE:<br />
<br />
Get in a group, Warrior is tank he looses aggro to cleric, the cleric gets one rounded. no other healers in group no necro. its fucking 3 a.m and noone is in RS but your group. <br />
<br />
Sk and warrior and the rest of the group try and kill the mob but its not looking good warrior dies and  few others go down Oo Sk has a rez! F/D  and let your group die misserably when aggro is clear get consent drag cleric over and rez them.<br />
<br />
It would be useful in that sittuation and few others!<br />
<br />
I'm not bitching about not haveing it. I just think no matter what anyone says , IF  we had a rez it would be used and you would love it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">A rez of somekind would be cool..it would be usefull no matter what you think it would come in handy.<br />
Could SK’s find a use for a rez? <br />
Yes<br />
<br />
In the current climate of class balancing, are SK's willing to risk not getting improvements in tanking and/or pulling while all the other appropriate classes get tweaks and improvements?<br />
No<br />
<br />
Would this restart the idea that SK's have all sorts of utility so SK's don't need improvement while the actual usefulness of an SK goes down to the point where we are not desirable for groups again? <br />
Yes<br />
<br />
Do SK's want to go through that again? <br />
No<br />
<br />
Should SK's have learned their lesson, as a class, about nice fun things and the backlash SK's get when other classes think SK toys are more powerful than they truly are (see HT)? <br />
Yes<br />
<br />
Have SK's learned the appropriate lesson from their own history?  <br />
Apparently not</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Croix VorAbaddon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">/applaud Keevel</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>armengarkai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">good reply Keevel /salute<br />
That sums up my current thinking</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Culdahl1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Isn't there another active thread on this exact same topic?  Bad enough the post sux, even worse that the person didn't use search first....you loose x2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Eggborn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ok yes, a rez is a handy thing to have , but isn't that what the cleric class is for?  As far as I am concerned Paladins shouldn't have one either.<br />
<br />
Maybe necros can, since the component cost.<br />
<br />
I get concerned when I see SOE giving clearly defined abilities to many classes.  If they continue to do so, why even have the different classes?  I like the challenge of limitations in ghetto groups, and the challenge of working together so much more than being able to do it all myself.<br />
<br />
If I wanted to rez I would have made up a cleric.  I want to do SK things.  We are versitile enough.  <br />
<br />
Plus, it's bad enough having summon corpse, to have to heed the calls of the silly to go rez them for doing something stupid.. I don't want to, but I would feel obligated.  I guess I would have to make a warrior or monk or something so I could go back to tanking or pulling like my class does now in the game.<br />
<br />
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE dont give me a rez!<br />
In fact, get rid of that stupid call ability while you are at it for the shammys and druids.  Yes, it's handy, but why not just learn how to travel instead? or better yet, stop with the server crashes, lag spikes and ld's that have been the main reason my groups have ever used it.<br />
<br />
Give the clerics and enchanters back their power and keep mine defined.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Susk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well appearantly many of you have missed the oh-so-simple point.   Let me make it more clear so that there isnt any future spam-posts of unintelligable bleeting.<br />
<br />
     Cleric gets Rez and its hybrid, the Paladin, also gets rez.<br />
<br />
     Necromancer gets Rez, and its hybrid, the Shadowknight does not.<br />
<br />
<br />
     Now, my point is, paladins are currently the same in tanking ability as a shadowknight.  Therefore, why should the paladin gain the the edge of having a useful rez off the cleric, and we dont gain the same useful benefit off the necros?   <br />
<br />
     I see this as clearly being unbalanced.<br />
<br />
     Now, after reading some of your most amusing posts, I must say I am  disappointed. What I have gathered is that you who feel that Sk's gaining a rez would then allow our hybrid pallies to gain an advantage as tanks down the road.  <br />
     So, basically what your telling me is that you all wish to lay motionless as Sony continues to rape your unresistant arse with its continued injustice! Rather than showing some balls, and taking a stand against an obvious and clear flaw, in the feeble hopes of not losing the edge of tanking we have now.<br />
<br />
     Regardless, I feel that those of you who take this unpretentious stance are nothing more than cowards...plain and simple.  I think its past time that thos of us who do actually have a spine, rally forth and petition Sony on this particular subject. And for those of you worms who feel its better not to 'rock the boat'  I have this well known quote for you.....<br />
<br />
      &quot;To sin by silence, when one should protest, makes cowards out of men.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>nytemyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Any of you that want necro rez. Would you give up Pulling,Surviability,FD,Crazy aggro,Lifetaps,Pet for rez?.If the answer is no then Shut the fuck up. We are farther apart from a necro then a pally and a cleric is and thats a GOOD thing.Pallies can be a back healer do you see people ask a necro to be a back up tank? What we need is a Worldwide HT that kills any SK that asks for necro rez. I'll buy an expansion for that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Croix VorAbaddon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well appearantly many of you have missed the oh-so-simple point.   Let me make it more clear so that there isnt any future spam-posts of unintelligable bleeting.<br />

<br />
Cleric's get HoT's, Paladins are about half the power. Clerics can imbue, paladins can't. Cleric's can DI as well as rez, pally's get a lesser rez. Clerics get the summoned hammers, paladins do not. Clerics get the Vie line, paladins do not. Clerics get the mark line ((the reverse DS's)) paladins do not. Clerics get spell haste, paladins do not.<br />
<br />
.... Any of this starting to sink in? We are NOT supposed to be carbon copies of our parent classes. We're supposed to get some abilities that suit our purpose. Paladins are a defensive/healing tank. We're an offensive/leech tank.<br />
<br />
Let's look at what we DO get, shall we? Snare, which is damn useful and got me groups in MPG when I couldn't tank it. Why? A) They needed a snarer, B) They also needed a puller, which we can do DAMN well combined with! Ta Da! Feign Death. One of THE most useful abilities in the game. <br />
Only four classes get it, necros, monks, Shadowknigts, and Shamans, and shamans need to complete a quest to get an FD ITEM, with charges. <br />
We get a pet, which up until recently hasn't been very useful, but now is. Hell, the other day in MPG, my pet with virtue and shammy buffs was shielding me now and again when my health dropped. Would it have saved me ass had I been in REAL danger? I dunno, but it might have. Same pet, unbuffed, was being used against Thought Horro Overfiend when we did him with 4 people, and barely needed a heal, maybe one every.. 15 minutes?<br />
We get lifetaps, not only direct ones, but bonds, proc taps, ToTC. ANd that adds up, quickly.<br />
We also get some decent DoT's. We're not pumping out necro damage, but it helps.<br />
<br />
And just as paladins get some things clerics don't have: We get Theft of Pain, which I believe is CRITICAL in the paladin/shadowknight balance. We get a zeefer's line without a recourse buff. A self HP/AC/DS buff with an extremely long duration given the mana cost. We get other power taps, like attack and resists and Stamina. We get Hate spells that make us Snap aggro kings. I've kited in Air for a ring event and tried to have a pally tear the mob off me. I had barely cast on it and the paladin was chaining stun and getting nothing.<br />
<br />
We.... are... getting... what... we... NEED. Let's not FUCK that up by whining about shit we &quot;want&quot;.</div></div><hr />

1)  We didn't miss any point, we disagreed with the point.  There is a difference.<br />
<br />
2) We don't believe that giving our class a rez is the appropriate way to address balancing, nor do we believe in the fallacy of the parent class any longer.<br />
<br />
3) &quot;Therefore, why should the paladin gain the the edge of having a useful rez off the cleric, and we dont gain the same useful benefit off the necros?&quot;<br />
This was answered in 4 different ways between your first 2 posts.  <br />
<br />
4) You should spend more time reading and less time &quot;bleeting&quot; [sic]<br />
<br />
5) You should spend more time bleeding and less time &quot;bleeting&quot; [sic]<br />

6) It is spelled B-L-E-A-T-I-N-G (http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=bleat)</div></div><hr />
