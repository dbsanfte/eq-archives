<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kaynin Shadowwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm camping that dworf infornt of the rygor fort and i cant find anything on if theres a spown time on him or the orc emmisary thats supposed to walk by and spown him. also small qustion can the broodmaster drop the hide form hate?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Emissary stops spawning a short time after server up ... not sure of the exact time.  Maybe a day or two?  Camp out there before a patch and get him when servers come up.<br />
<br />
Hide has never been reported to drop from the broodmaster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tsaryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The spawn definately breaks after the servers been up.  Like 2 server patches ago I quickly ran to the orc fort and what did I see?  Like 10 other people waiting for that spawn.  We all made a chat channel and bitched about it, while waiting for him to pop.<br />
<br />
Good news is he pops about every 10-15 min from what I remember so its not that long even if there is a line.<br />
<br />
Its definately screwed up - and bad.  And the only solution?  Wait for a server reset.</div></div><hr />
