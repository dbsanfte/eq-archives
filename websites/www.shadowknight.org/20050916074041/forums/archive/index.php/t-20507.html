<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nocifer Deathblade</div><div class="date">03-10-2004, 08:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey all.<br />
<br />
Read this if you wanna to ensure a guaranteed single pull of a mob out of a mob group to solo it out.. <br />
<br />
We know that we can have 100% mem wipe from FD if we wait for 2 minutes. We know that our festering darkness last just 2 minutes as well. Everytime if you wanna snare pull a named out of a room with many mobs and FD.  Rest will go back but snared one would stay for 2 minutes but snare usually goes off before mem wipe occurs. Usually, mob goes back fast after snare goes off and you would probably redo it over again.<br />
<br />
A trick to fix that.. Get Extended Torment IV. It adds nice 12 seconds to your darkness. Voila! A easy guaranteed single pull everytime after 2 minutes as long as darkness sticks on mob you are pulling. ;)<br />
<br />
Old method is to snare pull then FD several times trying to shake off aggro on adds. It worked well so far but sometimes takes a while to accomplish it. Extended torment IV is lazy way and ensures 100% success on single pull if you just wait 2 minutes which can be very handy in some situations. :)<br />
<br />
I just realized about it when I struggled to split the camp full of so many mobs in very close space of othe room that I pulled into and snare kept going off before full mem wipe occurs that sucked. That made me wished for longer darkness duration to make it work alot easier. Then it was how I realized about usefulness of extended torment IV. Hehe.<br />
<br />
<br />
Just thought to share some new tips. ;)</div></div><hr />

Are there focus items that make our dots last longer?  I never played a caster before so I am not familiar with Caster focus items yet.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kuvak</div><div class="date">03-10-2004, 09:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nice tip. However, in 99% of the times I would use FD pulling to split mobs, I'd rather just have someone else tag the snared mob and bring it back to the group rather than wait the full 2 minutes for FD to clear agro on the adds... but maybe that's just me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Groff Gorespiller</div><div class="date">03-10-2004, 09:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Was thinking the exact same thing, Kuvak.<br />
<br />
If you're fighting in an area that is high enough level to make a difference pulling nameds single, then you're going to have a group behind you to tag.<br />
<br />
Of course, if your group is pickup, you may have some morons who can't grasp the concept of clean tags in there, but that's a people problem, not a game mechanics problem.<br />

For group, sure.. Peel is most efficient way and saves lot of times. But if you solo, who can peel for you? No one. So this tactic with ET4 is doable. I changed my topic &quot;Nice tip for you&quot; to  &quot;Nice tip for soloists&quot; for clarity's sake heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Klotar AngedeMorts</div><div class="date">03-10-2004, 12:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Great tip, Noc.  I rarely use dot's for dps per se but do use festering to split pull.  I have generally written off focus items for dot's but am certainly going to look at it again now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keevel</div><div class="date">03-11-2004, 10:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There used to be a focus effect that extended dots...think it was Extended Affliction...many of the items with it were changed to Burning Affliction when they that got added.  Might be interesting to see f there are still of of the items with the old effect out there..make a nice tool to swap in for soloing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Razoren</div><div class="date">03-12-2004, 03:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">whats the easiest et4 item to attain?</div></div><hr />

<br />
only item that comes up in search.  interesting discussion about ET there too. not a set extended duration, works on a range like ID etc.<br />
<br />
still thats a lot of ap for the odd soloing excursion for sk's...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Babaste</div><div class="date">03-12-2004, 06:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i prefer pet pull for groups and btw you dont need to wait 2mins to stand up and have a single pull with dark/FD, mobs usually come back to there spot before 2mins unless you train them far away from it or get a roamer in pull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cames</div><div class="date">03-12-2004, 08:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Easiest ET4 item is tribute.  Many of the Focus Tributes really help with soloing (Clarity, MP4, ET4, BA4, etc).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lorddaeth</div><div class="date">03-12-2004, 12:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">they removed Extended from all items and replaced it with Burning.  instead of a longer duration, each tick now does more damage then normal. They did this about a year or so ago, if not longer.<br />
<br />
if they put extended back as a tribute buff, that would be interesting.</div></div><hr />
