<br />
  I don't feel like I'm too short on mana, even though I have only 84 INT.  I love being able to slam, and I'm sure I would miss the troll regen if I were to change race.  Ooh, I also love the night vision, big strength, and great STA.  In short, I love the big guy!<br />
<br />
 I have read a few times now about the XP penalty really starting to suck at level 50something, and am wondering how bad this really is.   Does it actually make trolls advance noticeably slower than some other races?  Don't all races got through the same thing?<br />
<br />
  Would that XP penalty really justify tossing out the first 34 levels to alleviate it?<br />
<br />
  I'm not planning on switching, just wondering why I hear this complaint so much.   I suppose I COULD switch.  I should be 34 again pretty fast with my current gear...</div></div><hr />

Then don't sweat it. <br />
<br />
20% is worth it to be one of the few, the proud...the dead sexy. <br />
<br />
You basically need to get 6 bubs for every level compared to the 5 bubs other races need. <br />
<br />
It's doable, but there are still only about half a dozen troll GLs on the Trib. I was #4.<br />
<br />
54 and 59 suck, no matter what race you play.<br />
<br />
The class xp penalty was worth it too, if only to keep the twinks and wusses away, but that's another subject.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then my DE friend who I duo with off an on hit 51, now 52 and his XP is almost just as slow... the 20% Does slow you down a bit more, but at these levels its so slow for everyone, might as well not worry about it, just kill one more MOB and hour than the other races :)<br />

I loved being a troll, just like you, so the penalty didn't make me hate the race or anything.  However, having played 2 toons to the mid 50's I can tell you it is very noticable.  When you get into the millions of experience, 20% means A LOT of extra kills.<br />
<br />
I think people who choose a race by min/maxing are in for a nasty suprise at 51+.  However, if you chose a troll because you like bein' green, it's bearable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The xp isn't *that* bad and it's worth it. Trolls have a huge edge in the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Skurrge</div><div class="date">06-26-2002, 05:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Iksars have the same penalty, so I will tell you that I know how hard it gets.  It took me a long time to get through 54, but then again, I can also regen like nobody's business, so my downtime is minimized.  I will tell you that there will be days that you will roll up another SK without an xp penalty, but just stick with it and you will be fine.  Try and have some fun and not worry about xp grinding so much and it will come before you know it.  Work on your armor, work on meeting people, and the grind will be better that way.</div></div><hr />

   When I came back to EQ this time I vowed to make a char and stick to it.  I had played before getting a 25 war(halfelf), another 25 war(Ogre), 28 bard (highest), and a bunch of others up to 14-16 and whatever.   This time I knew what I wanted and went for it.  A chanter.  A gnome friggin chanter!   I was soloing a lot more than I expected because of my RL schedule, and the runt was just not very hardy.<br />
  <br />
  After some thought, made Hekk and have not looked back for 34 levels.  I'm pretty well commited to sticking with my char, and as I said already, I love that guy.  He friggin RAWKS!  I deleted my level 12 chanter about two weeks ago, hehe.   <br />
  <br />
 I'm in a small but great guild Legends of Westwood, and have been grouping almost all the time.  I also have no shortage of friends in and out of the guild, and basically have not much chance to solo if I want to.  Always someone asking to go hunt with them or asking to come hunt with me.   Even with the group action I have now, I'm very, happy  with my choice. <br />
<br />
<br />
  My advise to those who play evil races and hunt to get faction with &quot;good&quot; races is STOP THAT.   I did it with my Ogre warrior and it wasn't fun.  Last week I hunted INSIDE totally KoS Freeport killing guards for damaged milita helms for the darkforge helm quest and it was FUN.  Killing bards in the swamp and in the Feerrott because they hunt our newbies is FUN.  Zoning into North Karana from South Karana and whacking a couple of those now blue guards that hate you so much-you guessed it, FUN.  The Karana bridge guards also drop the Qeynos kite shield you will need for darkforge questing.    Play an evil race and BE evil, it's 100 times more fun than being one of the &quot;friendly trolls&quot; that can bank in Freeport,Qeynos, Highpass, Kelethin or whatever. <br />
<br />
<br />
 Um, ok thanks.  Got that all out.</div></div><hr />

LOL.... Playing Iksars can be real fun, especially where faction is concerned.  We are KOS in all cities of Norrath except Cabilis and Thurgadin, though the merchants are Indifferent to us in Neriak or Grobb (did not check Oggok).  We are also at least Dubious in Shadow Haven and Shar Vahl when you add Luclin into the mix.  I just recently got my faction up in both Neriak (though I still need to stay away from the class guilds, especially the church) and Paineel, but good faction in the other cities are not needed (except maybe Kael or Skyshrine depending on your path), and their guards are so much fun to toy with. :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
I didn't realize it until my later levels, but being ally to Ring of Scale was a side benefit.</div></div><hr />

Now I kill him every chance I get ;)<br />

so yeah the XP penalty really is a pain after 50, but the rgen is REALLY worth it ! i can tell ! i don t care about fallin dmg in FM when i m there (even overweighted) 10 min regen and i m as good as new !<br />
stats r very good, (less STR, STA and INT than other races but the regen makes up for it !), i get almost 2 HP bubs while meddin to full, how long would it take to a non regening SK to med to full, then lifetap and med again ?? far too long in my opinion !! sure u gain less xp, but u spend less time sitting on your itching green ass of yours !!<br />
Loosing time hunting is of no consequence if u know u ll end up being one of the most powerfull race/Class in game !!<br />
Faction  isn't too bad too, get it up with Cab (for greenmist) wich is the major town in Kunark, and go to echo cavern for kindly faction (never went to velious more than 5 hours in a row ...)<br />
Kill all the bards they're good as dead !<br />
<br />
Let Innorruk's Hate consume your Soul...</div></div><hr />
