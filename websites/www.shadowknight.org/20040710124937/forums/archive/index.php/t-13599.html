<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Caktis1981</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">When I start up my computer I have so much CRAP that is running at all times. I gotta use control/alt/delete to get into task manager to shut all this crud that I have no use for running. Most of it I have no clue what it does but I know it has nothing to do with my system. From what I remember from a buddy there is a way you can use the &quot;run&quot; command to get into a window to alter what programs naturally function when you start up. I thought it was &quot;registry&quot; is what I needed to run but thats not it. If anyone knows what I need to type into the &quot;run command&quot;, or if any other suggestions on how to get this crap from running when I start up please let me know. Thankx in advance.</div></div><hr />

This should give you a list of programs (in the last tab on the right) that start up automatically which you can uncheck as desired.</div></div><hr />
