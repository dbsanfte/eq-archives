After much work with faction, I'm now non-kos with the Crusaders and the Mystics, but still kos to the Kotiz (necros). I decided to start the pennance quest (and 3 deaths in cabilist later, do you know how hard to get a res in cabilis is??) I have my Hammer of Exoneration, my pestle and mortar and my bag. So of I got to kill some Iksar bandits for faction and bone fragments, get 2 things done at the same time. So I have this UBER hammer ( 4 60 2H Bashing, weights 25), all ready to go and to my shock horror, DE can not equip it. Vahl - Shir and Humans among other races can, but not DE. So now I have to wait for VI ti fix this, or be forced to cheat and MQ the second Khuri. If any DE intend to do this quest the right way, please send you bug reports and comments to the Developer's Boards.<br />

Please use this thread to post questions about the quest and problems you run into,.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nasiir</div><div class="date">04-18-2002, 12:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As an iksar who has done the line of quests no less than three times due to screwups and experimentation at the beginnings of the quest, I would highly recommend mqing for the 2nd khukri. At first, I got the pestle, hammer, and started up the quest by heading out to fob to smack things. Well, at first I thought it was just going to be quite tedious, but after getting enough chips to grind into powder, and then realizing how much powder I'd need, I junked the stuff and had someone create a level 1 iksar sk to mq the 2nd khukri for me. The test of pennance is a total waste of time.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mordeth</div><div class="date">04-18-2002, 09:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, you could also just kill bandits... There is the badit camp in SoNH and close to there all the froggies that drop the pages you need for one of the khukris (can't remember 3rd or 4th one) are there too... Then once you have all the pages, head back to FoB... I hear there is a cave with 10 bandits in it... seems like a good place to start...I personally am gonna just do Kurn's tower til i see black specs in my line of vison and then go do iksars... course i guess i could kill iksars and then just hunt skellies in FoB too... sigh... you know the only thing that keeps me goin is the fact that it will be so damn cool when i hold this sucker.... I ain't gonna put it down ever, I don't care if I get a blackrock maul... 8000 bone chips say that I am going to wield greenmist forever.... HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA<br />

<br />
<br />
one thing though, the guard at the entracce, does he only accepts the chips when dubious or need higher faction?<br />
<br />
what is the quickest way to get to dubious? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mordeth</div><div class="date">04-18-2002, 11:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure if its dubious... but it should be... Quickest way is LOIO not far from the Windmill... or at the sarnak fort... or the gobo ruins not far from Fort.. KILL everything that even twitches...Gobo's sarnaks and iksar will all give you faction... I hunted LOIO from 17-31 so... by the time I got to doing bone chips I was already amiable to guards and I am now kindly... hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ueuelr</div><div class="date">04-18-2002, 09:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To get faction with the Troopers, kill goblins and sarnaks in Lake of Ill Omen, camp Grachnist in Warsilkwoods for the Shrunken Goblin Head earring, or do exp grind in Old Sebilis. I've head my faction maxed a long time ago, the earring is a damn rare drop, I think I killed over 50 Grachnists before one dropped. <br />
<br />
I am now working on Brood of Kotiz faction (necros). I have killed over 100 bandits in the last few days (not counting the ones before when camping the bracer of scaveging) and I'm still at &quot;scowl&quot;. The best place I found to do faction is in the caves that lead from Warsilk Woods to Lake of Ill Omen, there are about 15 Iksar bandit spawns there, and by the time I kill em all I have a couple of minutes before they respawn. As soon as I have non-kos faction I will start the khuri quests and go to Swamp of No Hope to camp the raiders, and kill more bandits while at it.<br />
<br />
I just hope that my some mirracle they fix the hammer in the next patch so I don't have to MQ the second khuri, I should have enough necro faction next week to do that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kastizi</div><div class="date">04-18-2002, 10:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Honestly, I am quite upset that Greenmist went to all classes of SKs, concidering its a cultural weapon.  Ah well, that is just me though. <br />
<br />
The sad thing with Varent is the fact that in order for another class of SK to do the greenmist quest is that they must spend countless hours of factioning. (heh, like a true iksar).<br />
<br />
Greenmist, IMO, is an awsome weapon. Great for Ssra temple for the bane dmg of shissar +6.  But honestly, if you want to get a good weapon and not get faction, find out when your local huge guild is going to kill Lord Yelinak and see if you can snag the rotting Soul Defiler.<br />
<br />
I dont know about other servers, but on mine, within my guild, the next Soul Defiler that drops, will rott.  There are only 2 active SKs in my guild atm, me and a DE.  I hate to see things rott, so if certain friends are on, perhaps I will be sending them a tell.  <br />
Just my 2 cents. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Masamura</div><div class="date">04-19-2002, 01:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Only way to raise faction with the necros is to kill some iksars in TT or EJ I cant remember unless its been changed recently (or im wrong)...and the penance quest only raises merchant faction as far as I know (I may be wrong)...the prob arises in that Librarian Zimor up in crusader castle is a Necro and the final NPC used to get Greenmist...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Muggly</div><div class="date">04-19-2002, 02:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i guess there goes the whole theory of iksar's being mad that &quot;softskins&quot; were getting it just by handing bone chips to that guy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LoagnGriffonslayer</div><div class="date">04-19-2002, 04:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">While I can understand the concerns about this being unfair to Iksar's due to it being a &quot;cultural&quot; weapon, I don't remember myself or anyone else raising a stink when people who are incapable of worshipping Innoruuk being able to Quest IC, to me that is the same thing, why should you a worshipper of Cazic be allowed to weild the weapon of My God ?.<br />
<br />
 As far as the pennance Quest, for my own personal wish to be able to say I EARNED my Greenmist, I'll wait for the pennance quest to be fixed rather than MQ the n00bie piece. Seems to me only fair since we are questing an Iksar &quot;cultural&quot; weapon to follow the quest from start to finish without doing an MQ... /shrug but hey thats just my 2 coppers.<br />

<br />
kastizi, give me a tell if soul defiler is rotting, one of the toys i have yet to pick up</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xilith</div><div class="date">04-19-2002, 11:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been thinking about summoning the 58 pet and going afk in a camp  of iksar for a few hours (the one between swamp and trak teeth) They low enough for the pet to lay waste to but high enough for them to attack him?  Sounded like the easiest way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dalmoth</div><div class="date">04-19-2002, 11:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Xil, go to the camp where the bandit lord is, 58 pet holds it easily against the 3 6 min spawns and the 1 or 2 other mobs that wander close enough to aggro.<br />
<br />
Only thing to be aware of is positioning, if your gone for long perioids, the mobs will push you out of agro range so your getting less faction than you otherwise could.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vecktor</div><div class="date">04-19-2002, 04:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i like that one guy's way, going to fob, and going to the maurader's pit, and then going to kurn's back and forth. very nice =) new thing to remember tho, there's 2 new shaman npc's in fob, one near the shore, and one near kaesora</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kastizi</div><div class="date">04-20-2002, 04:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh, Ardrick, you wont believe how many tells I got in game from posting that the next Soul Defiler will rott with our next Lord Yelinak slaughter!<br />
<br />
CiH got Yeli this round so we have to wait for next week or something when he pops again. :p  bleh<br />
<br />
Just do a /who crimson every now and then, if you see us in SS, its not because we getting SS quest armor.  o_O<br />
Send a random tell to me and I will get you in touch with an officer or something.  I know that Mordosskul has already asked me a couple times along with Chitos.  <br />
<br />
Ahh well.. nice weapon, the proc is annoying.  Proc regens 2 more mana per tick than Deathly Temptation spell.<br />
Id rather use my Deathly Temptation spell than have that thing proc on me in a fight. /shrug  That is just me though.<br />

It is usually rather underpopulated there, and the decaying skeletons are one hit kills that respawn extremely fast =) <br />
<br />
Also was wondering if any other Softie Shadow Knights on Terris Thule were working on this quest... I haven't seen too many Greenmists at all on my server.<br />
<br />
Good luck everyone!<br />
