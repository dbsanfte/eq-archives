<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dange Rous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My guild is getting ready to take on the Emp. I know the Corrupted Shissar Weapons are needed for the bane damage. However, at one point wasn't our greenmist the best viable answer for sk's regarding the encounter. Im just arguing with a friend and need some clarification. Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

Get the 2 hander, it has better stats and better DPS. Not to mention Knights don't need Shissar Bane that much anyway, you will most likely be entertaining some scaley friends throughout the fight, and if you aren't offtanking the snakes, you have to many knights. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Saelaru Valsharen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">&lt;--- have never offtanked the snakes ... besides, much easier to beat the big snake, since you can press autoattack, load up SoC and lay back ...<br />
<br />
Funniest part of the Emperor encounter is charging Blood + snakes with HS up ... I love that part ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If any knight makes their guild sit through even one more piece of green ore farming, they should be shot.  Its a pain in the ass as it is to bane the rangers/rogues/monks/beasts.  You will not be fighting him (anyone who says they werent an offtank is a very rare occurance).<br />
<br />
I think the issue with greenmist was this.  Ore farming is so unbelievably boring, and takes the resources of more people.  The people who said greenmist was 'the best viable answer' were probably working on the quest, figured its a far more enjoyable way to spend time, or were already done.  To take the time to get a corrupted would be a marginal upgrade to a low dps class.  Just not worth doing.</div></div><hr />

If SoC = Shroud of Chaos I am really wondering if you are really an asset to a raid...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Darkenesis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Agreed.  Unless you happen to fall into the ore, don't bother with it.  Don't bother with the Greenmist either.  Only thing the Greenmist is good for is novelty.  You can get better 1h drops in NToV.  As for bane weapons... Why care?  Seriously.  You want to spend all that time farming shit for a bane weapon you use on one fight?  Only do it if you just so happen to fall into the ore.  Leave banes for classes that make the most damage out of it.  Like rogues and monks and such.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sithanator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Being in a guild working towards the emp encounter, I managed to get the ore in group hunting the mines for lucid shards and was only melee present. For some reason we seem to be getting ore more commonly then we are getting that shard. Getting a bane wep wasn't something I was worried about.  No need to add an extra unneed timesink to yourself or your guild.<br />

I was gonna say something about that too, but figured I would let it slide.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>neferaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Even if you aren't offtanking just don't bother with a bane weapon. Sit on your bum and start medding to cast more nukes and a Asystole! I am usually OOM near the end of the fight and I do quite a bit of damage that way (crits 3 for spears, dot focuses for Asystole, FT8 and imp damage 4, dot focus items), it is probably pretty close or maybe even higher then what I would with melee (I have no bane weapon so sadly I can not test this) and the metal camp really sucks, better give it to rangers, rogues, monks, beasts, warrs. Luclin mobs suck with their high AC (although bane weapons are said to negate part of the mitigation AC, I am not sure how that works). Someone parsed me for about 40 dps spell damage alone on Emp once (it could go higher easily now - remember he is magic immune so use disease spells) which I could not have kept up without medding. In VT my melee damage with greatsword of slaughter (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=28941) and 1700ish ATK was only like 60 to 70 on one of the nameds (hits 456ish max non-crit pretty fast (70 damage, delay 40, bane)... if you do not miss), so assuming similar AC on Emp, melee DPS with a weapon that has worse stats (45/44) would be 35 to 40 (of course I would like to see a parse since this is extrapolated data with a few assumptions - so may be a bit unreliable). You can cast and melee of course but when chaincasting, mana won't last well on a fight that long without medding (although with the mana tap proc you can keep it up longer maybe - it is disease based so it won't be resisted like SoC would).<br />
<br />
But if you really want a bane weapon get the corrupted shissar 2 hander, not the Greenmist.</div></div><hr />

What other cruel and unusual punishments have you had to endure since you left Xegony?  O_o</div></div><hr />

Nah that's a bit extreme.   I certainly wasn't going to farm ore or take it from a high-DPS class, so if I'm on Emp-whomping duty I use GM and hit for up to about 150 - not often that high, but hey it happens.  I likely do more spell damage than melee, but everything helps....<br />
<br />
But OK, Emp is about the only time I ever equip GM now.</div></div><hr />
