<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bricks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all I'm troll sk on the cazic thule server  and I was wondering if you all might give me some advise where to put aa's  thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Noctix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">What level are you?  Do you have any AAs yet?  If so, which ones?<br />
<br />
If you have none, the answer is runspeed 1-3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Innate wisdom.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tumy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Dont listen to Catharsis, he's just being an ass.  =P<br />
<br />
Seriously, you need to get Innate Lung Capasity ASAP .. this AA rewlz!~1</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Noguut</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I hope some serious replies come to this thread.  I started down a path and think I made bad choices.  I got my R3 right when I could start my aaxp, then went full regular xp until 65.<br />
<br />
I did what I thought was a logical progression<br />
Do Basics, then archetypes, etc. etc.<br />
<br />
So I maxed my natural regen, sta, dex, agi in basic, then went to natural healing and mental clarity and will do melee stuff next.<br />
<br />
I am still new at the points with only 28 so do not follow my path.  I hope some experienced AAXP er's reply with great advice for us to follow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Noctix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There are a ton of threads about this, try using search.  Really, getting sarcastic answers or flames should be expected on this board when you ask a question that has already been discussed many times.<br />
<br />
In an effort to be helpful though, generally, people suggest the following order:<br />
Run3<br />
Level to 65<br />
Metabolism 3 OR Regen 3<br />
CA3/ND3/CS3 (get all of them in any order)<br />
PE</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Noguut</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">To Noctix's point, here is a nice discussion:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Duke Xerro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well, assuming you have baron title, I would go for ......<br />
Natural Durability 3 <br />
<br />
From there, depending on what you want, you can do several things. If your aiming to get class title fast, you can go...<br />
<br />
Unholy Steed<br />
Physical Enhancement <br />
Improved Harm Touch<br />
Soul Abrasion 2  <br />
<br />
If you don't really care, you can go...<br />
<br />
Combat Agility 3<br />
Combat Stability 3<br />
Mental Clarity 3 <br />
Casting Fury 3 <br />
<br />
Those are some basic ones you would want...<br />
<br />
If you want all your tanking AA's ... IE, hp / defense...<br />
Run 3, Regen 3, ND 3, CA 3, CS 3, PE, PD 3, PP 3, ID 5, LR 5 .... <br />
:rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>NorrynNoir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">given the recent melee changes i've decided my first AA's after baron title are going to be maxing CA. After that I will go natural durability.<br />
<br />
i figure given that we're another notch below warriors in the taking dmg department that i've got to focus everything on making that up a bit before looking at DPS.<br />
<br />
i guess the other way to look at that would be to say i can't tank like a warrior but i bring better dps to the table so i'll focus on that. personal preference is certainly important. go with what is fun first of course.</div></div><hr />
