<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kastizi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Been searching for this guy in the catacombs now for about 3 days.  He is a no show.  I have my epic, but a friend of mine is getting fustrated that he cannot complete this part of epic without this NPC.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know if he was moved to a new location?  Or does he despawn after someone hands in the items? (I cant remember, did my epic like 3 years ago).<br />
<br />
Thanks for any info any of you might have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I really dont remember if he depops, but all Truespirit NPCs are 3 days after server up (or 7 days if they depop).  So, Saturday morning/afternoon check again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>XebarisTP</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">His location is still in the temple, with all the other npc's. And I would think he is a 3 day repop, like all the other bishes I had to camp. Marl Kastane was incredibly annoying. I camp him for days, hand in items, kill stuff in the Hole, and then I get to camp him for days again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>SuDanger68</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">3 day would be abit much imo. patch was wednesday, server were up at 7pm? then got rebooted another time and finally up at 8PM...today friday at around 2pm i did trade in.</div></div><hr />

I found him this morning, right where he was supposed to be. So not 3 days... only 2 /boggle.<br />
<br />
So, now what's the story on Marl Kastane in Kerra? I finished the Caradon/Kyrenna part tonight and went to Kerra and Marl's gone. Talked to him this morning and didn't think he despawned after the turn in. Any clue?<br />
<br />
And do I get to look forward to waiting for him yet again after Glohnor?<br />
<br />
The sad thing is, I have several much better weapons. I wasn't even going to do this epic, but then talked myself into it.  What a pain in the butt<br />
