<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Noctix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm currently building a new computer solely for EQ.  I will be running two instances (my SK and my rogue) on this computer at all times, so I am concerned with the performance.  At the same time, I don't want to spend a fortune, so I'm also looking for the best bang-for-my-buck.<br />
<br />
I'm trying to decide what type of hard drive to buy.  I'm hoping someone can give me some pointers.  One thing to consider up front is that this is only an EQ machine so hard drive space isn't really a concern, anything over 10gb will probably suit my needs.  I'm worried more about speed.<br />
<br />
My understanding is that there are three major types of hard drives (or at least three that my motherboard can support): IDE, SATA, and SCSI.  Also, SCSI requires an additional controller card of some sort.<br />
<br />
So here are my questions:<br />
1) What does SATA buy me over IDE?  Will SATA allow better EQ performance?<br />
<br />
2) Will SCSI increase EQ performance enough to rationalize the extra cost?  Keep in mind that I'm on a budget and if I buy a SCSI setup, I'll likely have to buy less ram or something.<br />
<br />
3) I see stats like drive speed (e.g. 7200rpm) and average seek time (e.g. 8.5ms).  Are there any other stats I should look for?<br />
<br />
Also, if anyone can suggest a specific bang-for-my-buck hard drive (or SCSI setup), I'm open to suggestions.</div></div><hr />

Buying two of those 7200rpm IDE drives costs about the same as buying one of these (http://www.newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=22-144-200&amp;depa=1) 10000rpm SATA drives.<br />
<br />
Which setup would give me better 2box performance?<br />
<br />
/edit<br />
<br />
In case it matters, here are the details for the other parts I've purchased for my new system:<br />
Motherboard (http://www.newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=13-135-152&amp;depa=1): 4xDDR, Socket 478 for Intel P4 up to 3.2ghz, 2xIDE, 2xSATA<br />
Memory (http://www.newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=20-141-424&amp;depa=1): 512mb PC3200 (I'm hoping to pick up another 512mb this week and then add more down the line when I have more cash).<br />
Video Card: GeForce4 TI 4800 128mb 8x AGP (salvaged from an old computer)<br />
<br />
I haven't purchased a CPU yet but I'm leaning toward the 2.8ghz 800mhz FSB Prescott P4.  I know the 3.2ghz would be better but again, the budget thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Howlitoezis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The old 37gb raptors were not really very fast.<br />
The 40gb SE WD's are pretty much on par, and having two, with one instance of EQ running off each will give you greatly increased 2 boxing performance. Your biggest issue is gonna be ram.<br />
By the way, that 2.8 prescott is pretty much guarenteed to run at 3.5GHz or more.<br />
My old northwood 2.8 runs at this all day long.<br />

I don't entirely understand how a single CPU system performs with multiple caches but I will take your word for it.  After all, that's why I asked for advice  :D <br />
<br />
Your biggest issue is gonna be ram.<br />
/cry I know.  My current 2box setup (which runs but not very fast) only has 640mb of *gasp* SDRAM.  I think 1gb of pc3200 will be a nice upgrade.  One of the main criteria I had in picking a motherboard was ram slots though.  I figure that with 4 ram slots, I can add more memory on the cheap without springing for 1gb or 2gb sticks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Howlitoezis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The caches are built into the harddrives, that store data for quick retreival.<br />

Yes, that part I understand.  I just wasn't sure if the CPU having to access data off multiple drives would slow it down.  I don't know if there's any latency in switching from one drive to the other.  Or can a single CPU keep both channels open in parallel?  I'm a software person, my knowledge of hardware is fairly limited.<br />

Yeah, that's why I chose it.  It's a lot easier to research CPUs than it is hard drives for some reason.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Rueeliar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Biggest bottleneck for running two instances of EQ on the same HDD is that the cache on the drive has twice as much data to manage, so it will cut corners and repeatedly drop info from one instances in favor of the other, then drop that in favor of the first, back and forth ad infinitum.  That, and constantly being told to access two different locations on the drive at the same time.</div></div><hr />

Which is why running them on separate drives will increase performance very nicely. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Noctix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Okay, time to reveal how ghetto and budget limited I am  :) <br />
<br />
Please rank the following in importance to a 2box system:<br />
<br />
1) Getting 2 fast HDs (instead of just 1)<br />
2) Going from 512mb ram to 1gb<br />
3) Upgrading from Windows ME (I know I suck) to Windows XP<br />
<br />
I can probably only afford to do one or two of these things right now, the others will have to wait.  I will of course do all of them when I get the cash but I want to make sure I can play EQ in the meantime.</div></div><hr />

I'm already running two seperate boxes, one for my SK/rogue and one for my wizard.  I don't have space for a third keyboard and besides, I really like having the two melee toons on the same machine.  Also, some of my old hardware is starting to act up so keeping my old box isn't really an option.</div></div><hr />

10kRPM WD Raptors, preferably the non sata-one, and run them in an ide raid 1 (striping)....it will be far faster than you will ever need.</div></div><hr />

Actually made an error in my first post - no need for 3rd kb &amp; mouse; the $25 kvm I have does that as well ( not just video ). Understood on the old hardware dying though. ;)</div></div><hr />

There are non-SATA Raptors?  I thought the defining characteristic of the Raptor line was the SATA interface?</div></div><hr />

2 HDs on seperate channels will still be faster for dual boxing, in any case.</div></div><hr />

I build and repair thousands of computers a year. WDs fail around 1/4 of the time of the closest competitor. 2nd to worst is maxtor, IBM is the worst :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Saruton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I would not use a raid 1 system. The failure probability is quite high and if one HDD breaks it takes the data of both HDDs with it.<br />
<br />
For your ranking i would go with 2 aka 1GB ram &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 512 MB, then upgrade to Win XP ( ME is a shit OS). Imho the HDD impact on EQ isnt that high. Tried SCSI, SCSI Raid 1, IDE Raid 1, 2 IDE on seperate channels, 1 IDE and the speed difference between the setups was marginal. Just get a fast 7200 rpm+ with a big cache( 8MB+) and that should be fine for 2 boxing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Howlitoezis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Raid 1 is mirrored. It is the slowest of raid setups. It is not for speed but for redundancy, so in case 1 harddrive fails, you have the complete image on the other drive.<br />
You are thinking of raid 0.<br />
<br />
The separate harddrives will show minimal performace gain in normal operations, but for two boxing, it should show a reasonable increase in performance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Saruton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">args ... sigh allways mixing up raid 0 and 1 :( But still best performance gain with one of those 3 options would be Ram. EQ is a ram hogg.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Noctix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I will definately get 2 HDs, Win XP, and more RAM eventually, it will just take a month or two for me to get all of it.  Pay day is tomorrow and I'm trying to figure out which of the above to buy first.<br />
<br />
Right now, I'm leaning toward buying 1 HD and Win XP first so that I can start with a clean OS build and not worry about upgrading from ME to XP later.  Obviously I need at least 1 HD too, hehehe.<br />
<br />
Hopefully I can add more RAM and a 2nd HD within a few weeks.<br />
<br />
One other question...if I start out with just one new HD (say the 7200/8mb cache one from WD), would I be better off running both EQ instances off that drive for now, or running one instance off my OLD drive (don't know the specs but I'm guessing something like 4500rpm and 512kb cache)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>TelimTor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Yup, I've had the exact opposite experience.  2 Maxtors have failed me in the last 4-5 years, while the WD's running along side them have never had an issue.  <br />
