<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sithanator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have recently started exploring ssra with some friend in efford to get started early on are emp keys. Guild is currently farming NToV. I have found getting detailed about this to very hard. Short of which floors X key dropping mobs are on. <br />
<br />
I was wondering, what forces are needed for which camps. Which is the best place on the different levels to camp the commanders(often don't have rogue with us). Also I have noticed well pulling that festering darkness has bad habit of knocking the casters down to 96% before they split from others.<br />
<br />
I would be greatful for advise I could get about this zone. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Pouch is off named taskmasters + warden.  Spawn every 2 hours in the basement.  Four to the south, two to the north, two wandering.  The only one that I'd consider 'hard' is the south static to the far east.  He flurries and is unslowable.  Take one  group for this.<br />
<br />
Comm 1 and 2 spawn on the first and second floors respectively.  When I say that, I mean that.  They can spawn almost anywhere on that level.  Only one of each can be up at a time, so check with a tracker before starting to kill PH's.  While this is doable with just a couple people, the more you kill, the more chances you have at getting a Comm.  Bring several groups and keep the entire first and second floors clear if you want to get this done.<br />
<br />
Imperial guards are on the thrid floor, rogue required.  I cant remember the nameds names, but you'll know them when you see them.  Take a couple groups, the mobs will be pretty hard for a NToV guild.  The insignias drops often.  The Advisor AE gfluxes *the direction he is facing*.  So, unless you want to agro the rest of the room, keep him facing a wall or corner.<br />
<br />
Your guild will probably whine and bitch and cry and stop logging in over this.  Best way to get it done fast is to take the entire guild for a week or so and keep the first and second floors clear (comms are the bottleneck).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wyrdlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Reasonable equipt 65 SK with harm touch up can kill the commander on the first floor solo by the way.   Hurts like hell though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vezax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Insignias on the 3rd floor need a raid force.  Not becuase the mobs are particularly hard, but they have a ton of hp.  Named are like 10 mins fight w/ 24 people.  <br />
<br />
Pouches in basement arent that bad.  They respawn every 2 hours, and we seemed to get 2 pouches per respawn.<br />
<br />
1st and 2nd floor parts suck ass.  Random spawn on any basic (things like shissar lich near the rhags are not commander PH)  mob on either the 1st or 2nd floor.  Elites on both floors flurry, elites on 2nd floor cant be slowed.  Commander in my experience would spawn in runs, IE no spawns in 2 hours, then 5 spawns in 25 mins.<br />
<br />
Basically unless you have a strong guild wide effort, dont do this.  Between the emp key and the VT key id rather cut my big toe off with a butter knife then do this again =P.<br />
<br />
Edit: all but the 3rd floor need but a single group.  For commander you actually want more cause you want to clear as many PH mobs as possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ganaith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I did everything bar insignia solo. That is, with my shaman slave of course with me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thoruk Mudslinger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">all the key camps are easy, meaning the mobs that is how ever spawning them is the hard part. At com 2 it can be between 20 min and 7 hours for a com to spawn. This is most annoying camp in ssra minus the ore camp for emp bane wepons. <br />
<br />
I will say one thing if your guild is getting ready for emp and people are going to camp ore for wepons, give the ore to warriors rogs rangers and bards first. Shadow knights and pallies will be offtanking so you don;t need the bane wepons. In my guild all of the offtank crew had bane wepons and never got to use them. A fair number of the rest of the guild didn;t have bane wepons. You don;t need bane wepons but it helps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Paynreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Be prepared for a LONG camp for all the key peices, except the bag (got mine in 15 minutes). Its a real bitch to get the comms to spawn, just kill everything around the teleport tubes on floor one (i forget where to go for floor 2).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sithanator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thank for all the advise. Been noticing that about comm1. 10+ hours and no pops yet. As far as the bag goes, kill 4 named taskmaster and the warden and still no bag drop.<br />
Thank<br />
Sith</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Wyrdlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">At least with the taskmasters you may get a bad run of them, but you don't have to try and get them to spawn.  If you have a bad run, just come back the next day.<br />
<br />
We got three in one clearing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Araden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">rings and idols off the 1st/2nd floor comms is by far the biggest bottleneck of the emp key quest.  I recall when my guild was keying up, near the end.. we had about a half dozen peeps needing pouch, a half dozen needing insignia, about a dozen needing idol, and about two dozen needing rings.<br />
<br />
Pouches are easy to get, so are insignias.  After a patch  when you see two or 3 insignia named up, take up a couple or three groups and whack em,  then go kill TM's and then settle into idol / ring camps,  shit will come eventually.  Think my guild only actually had to camp insignia's twice and that was early on when had 60 people to get keyed.  Rest of the time we just got it when we would see 2-3 named up and we'd go whack, hence not having to camp it.  Time efficiency =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ashrai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yea com3 is the easy one relatively speaking- since it takes a decent sized force, people tend to stick around until you have a good number of drops. Some nights you get real lucky and have a lot of named pop and you get quite a few keys finished off that way.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Pouch is cake, com1 and com2 are mindnumbingly boring. Best way to get them is to drag a group of friends down when only a couple of people need a drop. If you go on &quot;farming&quot; nights you end up with 6 people needing the drop, people get tired and leave without a drop still, new people rotate in, or the group grows to two and you get one pop that night and 11 people end up wanting to kill themselves.  That's not to say don't take advantage of farming nights- but take initiative on your own to get your piece as well. Because the more people get that piece, the less they will want to go back to that stinking snakefilled zone and camp coms. The only hard part about either camp is the wait itself. <br />
<br />
Ore is another timesink- sometimes upwards of 8 hours without an ore drop. If you don't absolutely need the bane weapon then don't subject yourself to it.</div></div><hr />
