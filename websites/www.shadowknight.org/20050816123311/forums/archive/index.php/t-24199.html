<br />
Looking for a nice quite spot to grind out some xp, doesn't have to be the best I can possibly get as I'm not that great at 2 boxing yet and am willing to sacrifice a bit of xp to make it a little easier. Sk is only in gear that's bd cultural or equal, and cleric is in ornate or equal. Have all xps now, so that's not a factor, and while loot is nice it's not going to be a deciding factor.<br />
<br />
Any advice you can give is appreciated and if I haven't given enough info please let me know. Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aphyon D'Veldrin</div><div class="date">02-07-2005, 01:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would go check out Griegs End: Mobs hit like girls in ther and the exp at your lvl would be exceptional Reg/AA<br />
<br />
Veksar: Could take advantage of your Clerics Spells line, Undead,Stun etc,you could lvl up to 60 alone on the entrance goblins when you come down the stair way,experience should still be good there, if it gets slow when you hit 58, you should just move on to the next area up the ramp, i would bring a few invis potions for cleric unless you just want to fight past the goblins,after that everything except the Iksar Golems is IvU<br />
<br />
Old stuff but i believe still ok experience (with a slower or if youre good at stunning with cleric)<br />
Check out Western Wastes,Siren's Grotto<br />
<br />
Another spot with mobs that don't hit hard,but need 100+ disease resistance so you dont have to worry about their debuffs,and poisons is in Fungus Grove,The Mushroom, The Mutants,and if you think your cleric can Pacify the Shadel Bandits all good exp, not much loot, maybe if your lucky a shadel bandit ring, which sucks now because it used to be a Bobbing Corpse ring, they changed it to a resist ring now, to my knowledge unless im wrong<br />
<br />
Could move to Katta Castellum along the right pathway where the guards are can fear kite in there, could move a little further in towards the bank area (have to be careful in there though have to make sure you kill each guard before the timer restarts each spawn in there, do it clockwise so you dont have to worry about anything popping on you (spawn time from last i remember is 10-12mins for each guard from catwalk to bank area)<br />
<br />
Could Hit GoD, i think Natimbi and kill those spiked back tortoises not sure on the name they are fricking huge so you can't miss em<br />
<br />
Oow in Bloodfields ( i would get a slower if possible and get some invis potions for when youre running thru the castle down to the fields) can get soem runes good exp from 58-62,that's all i can think of now<br />
<br />
All these spots can be grinded out if you have patience and dont get stir crazy easily</div></div><hr />

<br />
Made half an aa there soloing on and off while doing laundry yesterday.  Weapons sell for 4-6 plat while the uncommon armor drops sell for 10-20, which makes loot not THAT bad at the end of the day (would up making about 400pp yesterday). Mobs also drop up to 6 plat (rare) but around 2-3 average.<br />
<br />
Low risk, fast exp.  If you can get a port it's easy to get too.  Guards by Graveyard or bank would work well for you.  Oh and it's a hot zone so it has a PC like exp modifier for a time.<br />
<br />
EDIT ADD: Teraterpa's (the turtles in natimbi) I tried also last night.  Not hard to fear kite, less exp per kill than in Katta and kills took longer.  Much better loot though (Got a blue diamond and a diamond in less than 10 kills - though I got lucky)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Laronx</div><div class="date">02-07-2005, 03:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the ideas guys, gonna pass on Katta as I don't want the bad faction for my cleric, but Griegs and Veksar both sound pretty good.<br />
<br />
Edit to add: I have tried Natimbi, but for some reason on my main comp there are huge chunks of graphics missing, it's like you can see underwater but it's on the ground, 2 reinstalls and all the new drivers I could find and I had to say screw that place...</div></div><hr />
