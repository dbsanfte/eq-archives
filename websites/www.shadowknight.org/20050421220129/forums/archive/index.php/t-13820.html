<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>brokenlimit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">hi hi,<br />
been doing a lot of reading on the boards, and awhile ago (after doing my skyiron cudgel of the ancients on my main) decided i wanted to do the greenmist.  my de sk is maxed with all of cab but necros (working on it ugh), but i'm curious as to what pieces of this quest (greenmist and all the series of khukri's) that are NOT no drop?  i have access to a friends 65 iksar monk, or a friends 65 ranger both pretty well equipped, so i was thinking i could try to farm the droppable pieces w/ the ranger maybe (sounds like track will be useful).  was wondering if there's any kind of list on what's droppable/what isn't, and i'm aware about greenish metal shard and history, but also wondering for the series of khukri's, like what circumstances would having a 65 ranger or monk instead of shaman main or sk alt that i'm dong the quest on be beneficial?  thanks for any info/experiences<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jobrill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The Hero's Khukri is currently droppable. <br />
<br />
In Theory, you could quest the Hero's Khukri, give it to your Twink, Quest the Stupendous Tome, MQ it with your Twink so your Twink gets the LoP Khukri. But from then you would have to have him get all the stuff for Greenmist since it's a combine. The Hammer and the Rock from the Golem are no drop if nothing else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ghismonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">How to most easily get your twink Greenmist, with MQ's and buying droppable crap:<br />
<br />
Buy Hero's Khukri from some sadistic ass who's selling it.  Expect to pay about 20k.  It'll be worth it in time saved.  (About 60hrs questing, give or take)<br />
<br />
Have someone with non-KoS cabilis resident faction/kindly iksar shadowknight faction get the scrolls from CoM, MM, and Kaesora.  They are nodrop.  Have same person get bone key, bone necklace (both nodrop) and stone key (tradable) from Droga.  Do turn in, get stupidest tome.<br />
<br />
UberFriend turns in tome, twink turns in khukri.  Grats, you now have Lord of Pain Khukri (nodrop)!<br />
<br />
Buy Greenish Metal Shard and History of Greenmist.  Have twink turn in history, get notes (nodrop).  Have twink get crap to spawn golem, have twink loot golem's tynonium (nodrop).<br />
<br />
Have twink loot Hammer of 1406 in Sarnak Fort (nodrop).<br />
<br />
Have twink pick up the ground spawn in KC (nodrop).<br />
<br />
You and your friends kill Drusella Sathir, and loot the mirror.  Take your twink and the person with the mirror to Dalnir, spawn mister hagglerty. Do turn in, get crap.  Do combine of crap in Dalnir.<br />
<br />
Yay, you just got Greenmist with half the work!  Hope you feel accomplishified!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jabbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Bahahaha...  wish it WERE that easy.  Personally I don't agree with buying components for quests, but on Greeny I cut a couple corners.<br />
<br />
I did buy a History and I am going to MQ the mirror, the rest I did all on my own.<br />
<br />
As to buying a Shard or a Khukri...  the shard is never around (on my server anyway) as no one goes there for XP these days.  And the Khukri... I can't even IMAGINE who'd go through all that camping and crap for a lousy 20k.  /shudder</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>brokenlimit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">lol jesus, i'm not saying i want to skip all the quests, i did them all on my shaman for the cudgel, and i plan on doing them for the sk, i'm just curious in what places should i be say using the 65 ranger to hunt for things, or the 65 monk, instead of my sk.  like what parts are droppable that'd be beneficial to use the ranger (pages?), etc.  i didn't know people were so bitter about twinks, jeez lol.  <br />
