<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jackkal Darknite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, screwing around a couple days ago I managed to get the reet crown. Figuring that would be one of my &quot;blocks&quot; I'm now working on my Crown of Deceit.<br />
<br />
However does any know how much the hits are from the Seb Frogs?<br />
<br />
I've spent a few hours running around killing stuff and tonite did the AE thing with a cleric guildy who is also factioning for the crown.<br />
<br />
Just wondering if it would be better to kill in Seb and actually get a bit of exp or slay mass greenies in LGuk (get some exp from the named and the frogs near them tho) and go braindead.<br />
<br />
Figure I still got a ways to go to &quot;repair&quot; the hits I've taken as a young Troll, but would like to finish this quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Oombak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">search is ur true fr1end<br />
<br />
anyhow, factioning in Lguk is probly more efficient than seb.<br />
<br />
You could argue that you can make str8 platinum gems from seb, but less faction in the long run<br />
<br />
each frog in seb probly has 3x the hp as the frogs in Lguk<br />
<br />
plus you have to deal with chanters/wizards with ice comet..<br />
<br />
i personally did all of mine in LGuk...took me about 4 hard/long days of factioning to get mine all fixed up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Liabach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">been working on this too.  does the 65 enchanter frog illusion alter faction with the old frog significantly?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kazug Thooll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If I remember right, as a troll, my faction capped at amiable which isnt enough to run the quest, so I had to have a friend come turn me into a frog which raised my faction to warmly.<br />
Also just incase ya care, but I did some logs, and going from max kos to maxed faction was about 3900 faction hits.  Have fun lol =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jackkal Darknite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Still running around in LGuk mass murdering dead frogs.<br />
Got my Scalp at least but I'm still at scowling.<br />
<br />
Looking up some faction lists, yea I guess around 4K's worth of hits.<br />
Only good note is that occasionaly we go and mass murder in Seb so that doesnt really seem too much like mindless factioning as some exp is gained too.<br />
<br />
Guess I got a ton of work to do still,....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zarvex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I parsed about 3900 faction hits as well from max kos to indifferent (was maxed).  Need an illusion and the scalp from the ghoul lord to get my faction high enough.<br />
<br />
The crown was the easy part only took like 2 hours in Juggs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>AoladariSK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think I maxed my faction on the frogs inadvertently. I might just need to do this for giggles.<br />
<br />
That scalp droppable Jackk? Can I borrow it?<br />
*cackle*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i wasnt bottomed out on frog faction but it was still real bad, i did guk for it since i could do it solo, think seb frogs are worth 3 points each, dont have the time/desire to test, but anyways guk is a faster way to get faction took me appox 30 hours of ae'ing the entire undead side to get faction up</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Thacker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">There is one thing no one has answered yet.  If no one does, I'll try it soon and find out.  I've been working on faction for a while and am still KoS after tons of frog kills and even with the scalp I'm KoS.<br />
<br />
It dawned on me that froggie illusion alone might be able to get faction up enough to not need to kill stuff.  Everyone that has posted about frog illusion so far has done all the tedious factioning first.  Has anyone tried the illusion first to see where that got them and *then* done the factioning?  If we could skip a majority of the tedious faction part with a frog illusion I think it would be well worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thacker, it depends on your race I think (of the race/religion/class combo).  Humans/Erudites/Gnomes may need less factioning, I'd guess.<br />
<br />
Generally, illusion will boost you one level, and the scalp will boost you one level.  As a DE (evil race) SK (evil class) worshipping Innoruuk (evil diety), I maxed at Amiable.  With scalp, Kindly.  With illusion, Warmly.  Warmly is needed for the quest.<br />
<br />
To be a bit more clear on the 'one level', I'm told that it's a set number of faction points rather than purely faction level.  That is, max kos without scalp may still be max kos with scalp, rather than going from Scowling to Threatening; this is due to the high number of points in the Scowling range.<br />
<br />
So, your goal is Warmly.  How you get there via combination of faction work, scalp and illusion doesn't matter as long as you achieve Warmly.  I'd guess that unless you are Human/Erudite/Gnome, you will still have to do a lot of faction work in order to complete this quest.  You can, of course, try an illusion with the scalp on to see what your faction is without doing the faction work -- but the bottom line is Warmly or no woodie for j00!  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kabantiz Shadowstealer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well, I am 61 Iksar SK on Bertoxx, Maxxed my faction, Was indiff, Amiably with scalp but didnt go up with frog illusion? Anyone got any idea's? 250 tailor with a ton of AA in skills failed twice before suceeding on cloak... Would really like to get quest done sense I spent so much on it so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Krazaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">As a Troll Shadow Knight of Cazic Thule, using illusion (any good) and the Scalp of the Ghoul Lord, I wasn't able to complete the quest until I maxed faction.  In fact, I went out and checked faction and was still amiable (need warmly), went back to work again and maxed on the next kill.<br />
<br />
I had roughly 3500 faction hits, almost all from L Guk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Liabach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">killing in upper guk over the duration of my career of evil= unknown number of bad hits.<br />
<br />
never really killed in lguk= not many good hits<br />
<br />
never camped seb like crazy, but have killed there since the faction changes and done trak raids etc (bonus hits for getting there) = some good hits<br />
<br />
no clue where i was.<br />
<br />
started killing lguk for faction, mournings for an hour, here and there an hour, home sick with flu one day, for 8 hours strait.  not ae'ing (not once), and actually solo the entire time, just me and pet, walking from the entrance to guk, down to the bottom, to the hall leading to the AM and GL, then back to the top about the time repop would start.  about 66 faction hits, per walk from top to the bottom.  Est. 1500-2000 kills, suddenly a slave only conned scowling, 66 hits, and dubious, then left for a raid.  couple days later, 2 down only 40-50 hits each max, zone was camped.  con apprehensive.  kill 100 more counting, just to get a buffer before trying... hit max to frogs.<br />
<br />
went to bank got my stuff: 1) ghoul lord scalp (camping it was some of the early faction hits i got, do this early and get it out of the way.  then i'd advise killing closer to the entrace, mobs have less hps, so die faster, == more faction hits per hour if solo.  gargolyes have faction hits, but not spiders or icebones).  2) 5 dose illusion hobbit (there is no illusion frog potion, and illusion frog is a 65 chanter rune spell, so fairly rare).<br />
<br />
nothing on, conned indiff<br />
put scalp on, conned kindly<br />
illusion hobbit, conned warm<br />
took scalp off, still conned amiable.<br />
<br />
very annoying, i dont think i ever want to faction whore again, like ever.  but now clicky illusion elf, i've been wearring a bow and pretending to be a ranger, and trying to get other elves on raids to tell me elven military secrets etc.<br />
<br />
but its done.  i wonder if the scalp affects any other factions, ie does it offset my race penalty, or is it +200 faction to frogs?  /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Krazaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">If you identify a faction modifying item, it gives more detail.<br />
<br />
The scalp increases faction with the Frogloks of Guk only.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Liabach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">bah oh well, might as well destoy the scalp now then i guess lol.  thx, i didnt identify it</div></div><hr />
