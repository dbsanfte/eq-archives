<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Stumplin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all.  Just returning to EQ after a long vacation.  Only played a few months the first time but vowed someday to return and try again.<br />
<br />
I decided to make a gnome sk for rp reasons but may switch to some other race if it doesn't work out.<br />
<br />
My question is this.. Starting from scratch with no money or items or friends is it going to be possible for me to play in a game that has been around for such a long time?  I have nothing but some cloth and leather armor and a rusty 2 handed sword.  When I get to the point of grouping I'm afraid I won't be able to do well.  I've seen people my level laughing at me saying I will never be able to survive.  Being the pivotal point in a group as MT I am hoping that using tactics that I have read on this board will make up for any equipment I may be lacking.  Is this a possibility or am  I just wasting my time?  Last time I played there was no bazaar and velious was just about to be released.  Seems like alot has changed.  <br />
<br />
Thanks for any insights.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Do the newbie armor quests.  Save your silks and sell them for money for gear.<br />
<br />
Its a lot easier for new players to get geared up these days then it was when I started.<br />
<br />
The one bad thing is that their is very few real newbies around to group with.  Really there is not a lot of low levels in the game now so it is harder to find groups.  Lucky that sk's can solo a lot during lower levels.<br />
<br />
Go for it.<br />
<br />
At the same time you might want to consider a class that has less gear dependence.  Any class that tanks is highly dependent on gear but many casters can function very well with basic gear.<br />
<br />
Dunno about the gnomes though, they don't look like SK's to me but play what you like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Race is fine - all races can be fun just play<br />
<br />
Save silks AND pelts for selling in bazaar.  The low Quality pelts sell quick for padding and HQ pelts still sell nice to tailors too.<br />
<br />
There is alot better gear out there than what you were used to, yes alot of the uber stuff will be well out of your price range for a long time, but alot of very serviceable stuff is quite cheap.<br />
<br />
Save some money and some player made armor (gothic, sandblasted, frosted, etc.) will service you well into your 40's and generally go for just a couple hundred per piece.  Yes that sounds like alot now, but you'll get it quicker than you think.  Until then newbie quest armor will serve you nicely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chayde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I recently changed servers. (Well not really, just started some newbies on another server) It was weird starting out with nothing, again. But like Keevel said, pelts and silks, they are a newbies best friend. In one day I got enough pelts and silks to make about 600 plat, to gear my new character. On most servers silks go between 5 and 15 plat.  That is about 100 a stack if you go for the quick sell. <br />
<br />
low medium and high quality pelts go for about 10pp each. Also bone chips sell very quickly (not for much, but a stack can get you about 10pp)  Zombie skins go for 3-5 plat each. Just level like any newbie, and save the stuff you collected, by the end of the night you can have a few hundered plat. (If you are willing to sit and sell in the bazzar for a few hours that is.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Once you get to the secondary newbie grounds (Warrens, Blackburrow, etc.) you'll see bronze armor and weapons dropping ocassionally.  There was a time when Keevel wore the dusty burlap out of the Warrens.<br />
<br />
Also if you are passing through an area and see any rotting corpses loot them sometimes you'll find a bronze or fs on them.</div></div><hr />

Very true, and good advice.<br />
<br />
Also, and I may get flamed for this, forget about choosing your character on EQ for roleplaying reasons unless it's for comedy value.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well to be honest gnome is probably a good choice for starting out again if you're going to solo... that clock work armour is pretty nice.</div></div><hr />

1. The only people you managed to nuke are yourselves.<br />

That's cause they're just the right heigth.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because the only ppl that are a possible danger to us our ourselves? Rest of Norrath is kind of an irrelevance.</div></div><hr />
