<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Khaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">is it just me or does it seem like the shadokniights get hosed when it comes to the gate spell? I mean seriously howw much more powerful  would that make us if we actually gota beneficial apell like gate?<br />
 i for one would like ot know thathwen the shit hits the fan thati can leave in a hurry (like some casterclasses that i will not name, coughclericcough).<br />
it seems unfair thtthe only caster classes that dont get gate are sk pally (screwthem) and beastlords(whiich arent really a class if you ask me, they are justa bunch of monks who wanted ot be druids[and as far s im concerned sony really dropped the ball on that one]).<br />
<br />
but any way thats my rant for hte day pplease feel free to post here whether you agree with me or not</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kormus the Dark Angel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Look up your class description. Last I checked SKs were hyprids and not casters.<br />
But basically you are right, we deserve the Necro 63 rogue pet, their ability to res, their 60+ dots and nukes.<br />
Ah yes, Pallies need CH too and Beasts need 74% slow, Focus of the Seventh and 40% disease slow.<br />
<br />
What next? Group tap with SuccorGroupRecourse!?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>synnoira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">When the shit hits the fan i FD. Perhaps you should try to mem it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Trysbrina67</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Just buy the potions and be happy.  An instant cast gate potion is superior to the gate spell anyday.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Instacast gate potion ~ 1k for one dose.<br />
<br />
Gate can still collapse, and you spent 1k on nothing.  And then there is the CR to consider too.<br />
<br />
10 dose Gate potion shaman made has 10 sec cast time.  Cost to make with no failures at best faction/cha is 2520.  Sell back to vendor with one charge left ~ 1900pp.<br />
<br />
You figure out what works best for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Darkenesis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">OT Hammer works just fine for me.  Plus 10 dose gate to field of bone... No complaints here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think one of the only times that the gate hammer wasnt a good option was the time my internet went out right after we ported into Hate.  A potion came in handy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zaylin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I talke to one of the developers about this at Vegs Fan Fair (uh, whatshisname in charge of customer realtions). He said its not a blance issue, but a thematic one. They just dont think hybreads should have it cause there not pure casters. Now if there was a big enuff demand for it (like e-mails to the developer or /feedback).....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Darkenesis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">To be honest, I don't want the spell Gate...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Makkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Quit being a tard. What other fucking hybrid/mleee gets the gate spell? Let me think:<br />
<br />
1) beastlords<br />
no<br />
2) pallies<br />
no<br />
3) sk<br />
no<br />
4) warrior<br />
no<br />
5) bard<br />
no<br />
6) monk<br />
no<br />
7) rogue<br />
no<br />
<br />
Most SK can get the OT port hammer if you don't screw over your VS faction, various gate potions, gate tailsman. I don't see what the problem is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Lejina Bloodbath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">OT Hammer/Elder Beads + Innothule 10 charges potion + Lizard Blood Potion + Thurgadin gate potion = teh win.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Malice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Originally posted by Lejina Bloodbath <br />
Elder Beads  <br />
<br />
Holgresh Elder Beads are not gate potions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Lejina Bloodbath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Elder Beads + OT hammer = gate<br />
<br />
Proc on those eyes baby.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Makkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Bah @ SK who have the beads, been wanting them for my necro forever:P<br />
<br />
There are also tinkered items with eye of zomm, but they'd get expensive just trying to proc the hammer I guess. I usually just /duel a pet class and proc off their pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Calamity_Daemon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I guess it could be useful I mean you traveled hours to get to say Some Plane right and your encumbered and of course you can have a potion and likely you do but say you forgot. O shi* now backtracking not too bad right? Well I mean it would be easier. The only time I ever wanted gate was when I was level 23 and I was in High Pass because I thought I could fix my faction super fast. and I kept thinkng that but I got stuck inbetween the High Pass and High Keep zones and was stuck because guards conned red and yellow...had to wait for a stupid druid to port me...that was embarassing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Jabbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Bah... we're fortunate to have access to the gate hammer- any lvl 30ish Shadowknight can get the 'gate spell' if they want.  Not many other hybrid/melee can say that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Slagnath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">*hugs his OT mallet*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Spylmann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">But the hammer procs at level 50. Made me really mad considering I soloed the whole thing at 35ish and couldn't use it for 15 levels..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>synnoira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Hehe me too. Then i lost my hammer when i server transferred.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Kelv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Do the PoK gate necklace quest, took me about 6 hours total to get the first one done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Uwildi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I'd be happy if they made the soulstones(?) -the ones that shamans and clerics can get that have a 25sec cast gate to their home town made via pottery- available by race rather than class.<br />
<br />
With a 25 second cast time, it will be useless as an escape method, but would be ideal when hunting in an out of the way place and you want to get back without harassing a porter. <br />
If they want to be really sure, make it so that it will not work if you are currently on any mobs active hatelist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Romuluas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I really dont need/want/care about ever having gate, i would by far much rather have my fear back. Fear kiting was always a great way to pass the time til i found a group. Now i sit around doing shit til i get a group or raid, and agro kiting fucking sucks. I personally just dont have the mana to sit there and dot PoP mobs to death, and dots + pet just takes too fucking long and IMHO just isnt worth the time.<br />
<br />
And even if they did give us a gate spell i would never have it loaded cuz like it has been said, in a jam i FD, i dont even use gate on my necro cept for when im done xp'ing and need to hit the bank.<br />
