<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grogersk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Generally killing in GoD zone I've got 8khp and 1600ac, I've never tanked a named outside Riwwi.  Are there suggestions on ways to kill, duo or solo efficiently?  I'm capable of doing most of what an SK can do, I'd really like to obtain GoD gear from these somewhat lesser zones..  I saw the post about soloing in Vxed and will head there tomorrow.<br />
<br />
     Is there any suggestions on how to trio named in Vxed with enchanter ranger and cleric, or enc shm and clr.  <br />
<br />
   Are there any non flag zones where a guild group or a group of 20 could go farm no drop gear? sewers didn't seem to drop much, and I'm not really aware of how the whole process works yet.. a later date maybe. <br />

Ferubi is the perfect zone for  20 or so people at your level 8k/1600ac. There will be lots of great upgrades there for you. And a ton of named can spawn all over that zone.<br />
<br />
Just stay away from the raid mobs. Votal, Packmaster, Rondo.</div></div><hr />

Many threads about envy of this ability, but enc ranger cleric can do almost all the nameds in this zone.  You can do weaponshield to tank the named while chain snaring, or you can just let pet do it.  Pet attacking from behind has a 3k dps so if the ranger turns so pet is hitting from behind, you may have to heal ranger a little at end while pet finishes it, but not much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grogersk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've been soloing alot in Vxed, duoing too with my uncles Ranger .. I log my enc in for the named, his weapon shield will hold up just long enough to take down any name in Vxed with charm pet + Cripple .. Guild raid / loot farm on Ferubi this week we'll see how that goes.  Would there be any suggestions on how or where I should go once I'm in ferubi ? I've been scouting it around quite a bit and not sure where to camp.  I'm thinking about just making a loop about the whole place and see what name we can get to spawn.   pally and sk tank, 2 enc pets and alot of DPS is what we have, no  war and no bard in guild :(    anyway, if you have any suggestion please :)  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Maicom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">wouldnt use 2 pets, 1 pet is enough dps. it can get ugly fast in there w/the wanderers/respawns/whatever, a 2nd enchanter to help w/breaks/mezzingi duties is a good idea. You crawl through the zone, unless your duoing or something in which case just sitting at a zone in and pulling is fine.</div></div><hr />
