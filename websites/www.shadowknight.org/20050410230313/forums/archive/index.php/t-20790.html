<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kelefane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">How do you control push at Raids? (Being a MT push is THE SUCK!) And is there something written in stone on what classes cause the most push?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kelefane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Like how would you control push on a Mob thats out in the open and cannot be corner tanked? Has to be some strat on this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ghismonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Check procs on weapons and procs cast on players and their pets.<br />
<br />
Make sure everyone and that be shrunk is shrunk.<br />
<br />
There's really no way to prevent it besides cornering mobs, just make sure everyone on the raid is aware of what push they or their pet is making.  Have beastlords try to be on opposite side of their warders, make sure everyone has pet hold in case you need to adjust, have everyone paying attention etc</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">This is a personal pet peeve of mine at the moment.  I'm MTing quite a few of my guild's fights, we have a ton of BL's, and every fucking raid I'm fighting to maintian position while the BL pets are pushing the mob (and consequently me) out of range of our casters.  I've asked them nicely to watch their pet push, I've asked them to ring the mob, I've screamed and yelled about it and I've posted numerous threads on the guild message board regarding push and how to avoid it.  Still, every time, I'm trying to pull summoning mobs back into position.  At this point, I've found that if a mob gets pushed out of position, I simply have to back off, cast my aggro spells to try and pull him back, and let the idiots take deaths when they out aggro me (due to me being out of melee range).<br />
<br />
I don't know what else to do, idiots are idiots and probably will always be idiots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>nimic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">This is a pet peeve of mine too.  I find pets and rogues are the main culprits, though all melee push to some extent.  The SK pet generates an incredible amount of push, and you might be able to help offset the push a little with him in front of the mob.  Though he'll likely die in short order on most raids.<br />
<br />
To mitigate some of the push issues only let pet classes use pets.  SK's and Shamans should bag their pets.  If the raid can be done without pets, don't use them.  No one should be kicking or bashing the mob or casting spells that have any knockback.  Monks should not use their special attacks (flying kick etc). Everyone should be fighting at max melee range.  Encourage your casters to buy IR4 items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aelali</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The real problem behind this is people just don't know how to control their pets. For some reason, no one ever figures out what that &quot;/pet back off&quot; button does. This is also a peeve of mine as well, and in xp groups I've been know to kill other people's pets, I ussually give them one warning about controling it and if it's an issue again I use my clicky IvU item to kill the pet. Now, on a raid,  the best thing to do is just build as much agro as you can and drag the mob where you want it. Of course the ideal situation is people know how to control their pets but you have to play the hand delt to you...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Stattic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think we all have seen this and had this happen to us all at one point. I also run a BST and what I do when Im playing my BST is park my pet in a postion so that when the Tank comes in with the mob it will be on the same side as the tank. Kinda keeps the mob standing still when you have a few BST or mage pets on the tank side.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">1. Pet armies.  If positiong matters at all, dont allow them.<br />
<br />
2. Tell your raid to not suck and pay some attention.  Only rogues in the back, rest balanced on the sides.  Tell them to watch, if it moves one direction some need to move over to counter it.  Meleeing a boss mob isnt /attack on, /afk.  They need to be constantly strafing.  If they dont pay attention, call out names.  If all the pets end up on the same side tell them to reposition them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">the problem with push is it only takes a few ass clowns to mess it all up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>TaurusL</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Just FD a few times when they push too much. They will learn, and in turn you are entertained.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">the simplest way is shrink and corner the mob<br />
<br />
the second simplest way is MT and mob are lined up parallel to wall, everyone else is perpendicular to the mob from the MTs perspective, pushing it into the wall. no one is behind, no one but MT is in front.<br />
<br />
the hardest way is having everyone equally surround the mob, which generally means half the people are on each side... especially pets. pets seem to generate about 5x the push of a regular player. if your pet users cannot control their pet's push, and its important, the raid leader should have the user kill their pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Cornering is too often used, IMO.  Its a crutch for melees that dont pay attention.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Not to mention it only works in specific locations.  Cornering the Thunderclap mini in Towers won't work because there isn't a corner and you can't get him too close to the ledges or you'll pull adds.<br />
<br />
Besides which, I'm not too terribly sympathetic to those morons who can't control their pets.  Fuck, it's a fucking game, a monkey could play.  If you can't pay attention long enough to know that you're doing something wrong and you need to correct it, you don't belong in the kind of situation in which it makes a difference.<br />
<br />
And the next fucking time I have to shout at some jack ass beastlord more than once in an LDoN Adventure because his pet is pushing mobs through a wall, I'm going to fucking rampage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Nambkab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">A lot of times when we don't have a corner, or like last night since the new engine means walls and mobs don't mix, we will have the MT pull the mob in a really really tight circle.  Makes it hard to stay on the mob's back, but actually helps the push, as the mob is pushed non-stop, but generally around the MT, so all he has to do is turn.  This worked quite well last night in Storms on the Lord...although a few of the rogues probably didn't like it much :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Yeah, I've thought about trying that, kind of like what you would do with VS to keep him from proc'ing on a riposte.<br />
<br />
I'd really like to just see the smackdown laid on some of our more idiotic people, but... happy-feely family shit gets in the way of that sometimes. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>lorddaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">i've seen and used the &quot;circle the MT&quot; method too...<br />
<br />
MT holds aggro, the pets all end up on one side eventually, and they push, mob turns to face MT, MT rotates to reface mob. effectivly forcing the mob to &quot;strafe&quot; around the MT.<br />
<br />
but i like the idea of telling someone in the offenders group to invis the asshole who isnt listening to kill the pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>bainin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">This is one we go over and over and over at raids.<br />
<br />
But, each new mob we try-there seems to be some sort of<br />
mem-wipe that happens and ya gotta say it all again.<br />
