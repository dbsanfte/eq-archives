Hail, Misconception.<br />
Plate armor was custom fit to each wearer they could move surprisingly well. I'm not talking no Romanian gymnist well but they most certainly could have gotten up if they fell off their horse. The weigh,t around 65lbs for the typical suit IIRC, was distributed evenly around their body. <br />
Compared to US troops currently have a 45lb feild pack I believe, that is strapped to their back. Would you rather try to get up with 45lbs on your back or 65lbs distributed evenly? <br />
<br />
Wow look at all the useless shit I learned in college!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">According to &quot;Mail Call&quot;, a series produced by the Discovery channel (or the History channel or TLC or some such other informational cable tv networ), the average weight of a suit of plate mail armor, including padding and chain mail underneath the bendy parts was around 75-85 pounds.  While the armor was balanced as best they could, it was by no means a perfect system, and obviously the larger pieces weighed more than the smaller ones.  This is why generally there were no covering over the backs of the thighs, calves and upper arms.  He helms in and of themselves are supposedly about 10 pounds and limit visibility considerably.  The curiass was the heaviest piece and having seen R.Lee Emry fall on his ass with one of them on, I'd say that you'd have a considerable difficulty getting back up while being beaten upon by an opponent.  <br />
<br />
However, the biggest danger when falling off of a horse in the midst of combat is not from your opponents, nor from dehydration, malnutrition or delerium.  It's the damn horse. Heavy cavalry horses were often shoed with extremely nasty shoes which could crush, crease or cut through varying qualities of plate and chain mail,  the horse itself weighed much more than the rider, not including the saddle and all the other crap they strapped to them, the battlefield was a chaotic place which often frightened horses into near blind terror especially when they were without rider to control them, and most importantly, if you got hit hard enough to knock you from your horse, you probably damn near pulled the beast down on top of you.<br />
<br />
Oh, and contrary to popular imagination, most mounted soldiers did not wear full platemail, nor were they &quot;knights&quot;.  The light cavalry was used much more often than heavy cavalry, was less armored, quicker and more effective against ground troops.  Heavy cavalry were most often used against pikemen, in situations where their army was seriously outnumbered, or in the event of the other army pulling out it's heavy cavalry for a charge.</div></div><hr />

lol, it's funny how one sentence can be just as good as these long paragraphs about armor.<br />
<br />
Besides, is SF even really an acrobatic move? I mean, you're simply falling a great distance and landing without snapping your legs in half. But considering most SKs walk around with 100+lbs. of loot/armor/weapons, the leg breaking would a definite thing.<br />
<br />
And as Keuven said, we have Bobbing Corpse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Mutton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Mail Call kicks ass...man I watched the history channel so much this past weekend.  <br />
<br />
*is a winner*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Renmazuo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">What's even cuter than that is the fact that I normally weight around 95+ stones in EQ, fully equipped...  Not just that, but think of the fact that I am carrying 8 BAGS filled to the brim with loots and gems and playing dead to a bunch of monsters that are chasing me...  I'm more worried about that than about safe fall.  I used to &quot;practice&quot; safe fall against bards and see who lost the biggest % of HP in tests...usually I either hit the ground for 20k damage or won the HP test, just because I have more HP than most bards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Ganaith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Just to add, the forging of a custom fitted suit of plate could take months. Not only that, it cost an incredible amount of money to craft.<br />
<br />
I have been part of re-enactments, larps etc where people actually had pieces of armor. <br />
<br />
Believe me, it is heavy. Fuck, the chainmail shirt is already encumbering you so much, its not even funny. You have the feeling as though your back is being streched all the time due to the weight of the chestplate dragging on you. Every time you try to swing your weapon, it feels as fighting in water.<br />
<br />
It is heavy. Be glad it isnt RL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Pheargore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Once again, have any of you ever worn Weight 0.0 Magical Armor?<br />
<br />
- Peace</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Lejina Bloodbath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Pheargore, look at your equipment, that stuff, even if magical, hardly weight only 0.0.<br />
<br />
It may not be that heavy, but this kind of armor is clumbsy enough to make the idea of plated knights doing acrobatic movements sound rather silly.<br />
<br />
Yes, i know, thats a game where you can kill dragons, where your bottle of milks never turn sour and its even possible to loot your own corpse. Still, use some common sense and think classes balance, knights have no reason to get the Safe Fall skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Pheargore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I never said they did. I said twice in this thread Unholy Steed - 5AA. We get safefall already per our horse.<br />
<br />
I am just saying you can't talk about ghetto armor for the medieval faires being comparable to magic armor with weights that defy physics. I thought that was obvious, sorry.<br />
<br />
* - (also note, I looked at my equipment and everything weights from 0.0 to 3.0 stones. Considering he his a Troll with lots of STR and STA, that is pretty lite. However that is not even related to any of my points)<br />
<br />
 - Peace</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Jobrill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Hey, Renmauzo, if you plan to post on this board much more, I might suggest, you like, change your sig. <br />
<br />
I mean, Cloud and Sephiroth are complete and total wuss-ass gimps, That's NOT the kind of stuff you want in an SK Sig.</div></div><hr />
