<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ulthimar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Where should I put my starting points when making a SK, of any race.  Most ppl say and or write put all 20 into stamina, is the HP difference at level 65 of 20 stamina really the best choice over str or agi or dex?  What im looking for is what stat ppl have put there's into and why.  Thanks for the input</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>yerr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">STA -&gt; HP<br />
STR -&gt; ATK<br />
DEX -&gt; Procs<br />
AGI -&gt; AC<br />
INT -&gt; Mana<br />
<br />
The reason almost everyone suggests putting all points into STA is that our class is a tank class first and foremost.  More HPs gives you more time for a heal to land while whomping on a mob.  <br />
<br />
STR, DEX, and INT I also consider viable choices for starting points in case you're deficient in that stat and don't want to drop all points into STA.  I wouldn't drop any points into AGI, unless you're below 75 - large AC boost then, diminishing returns for anything higher.<br />
<br />
If you've got good enough gear all stats can be capped, but I'm certainly not at that point.  Were I given the choice again I'd still put all of my points into STA.</div></div><hr />

depending on your race this may or may not be an issue....but make sure that your toon has at least 75 AGI.  There is a big AC difference between &lt;75 AGI and &gt;75 AGI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gaklaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">For iksar, DE, gnome, erudite, or human id say go all in stamina. As a troll or ogre, go for int. I have capped stamina at lvl 55 and even if I didnt the hp difference isnt that big, but trolls and ogres have low int so the extra 20 will help your mana pool, probably a lot more than the stamina would on an ogre or troll. on ogre get agi to 75 tho. I put all 20 into int, and havent regretted it. with the kind of gear i can get the stamina would make not as much of an impact as the int does for my mana pool. Sure it is about mana regen but once you get dots that cost upwards of 200 or 300 mana, and you use spears and aggro spells a lot, it helps to have a large mana pool. Int is also harder to cap and buff.  If you plan to solo and be a troll or ogre, the mana comes in handy.<br />
hope this helps and have fun</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sabazios</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">well if you eventually plan to join an elemental/time guild...i say all to CHA!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Owndar Ld</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">20sta At 65with ND3,PD3 and PE is somewhere between 7 and 8 HP per sta. Sorry not 100% sure. 150hp &lt;5% of my hp at 65 i cant rember the last time i went below 5% hp and lived. As a DE  my sta&gt;int,dex,agi,str Unbuffed(I was a newb when i made my sk put all points into str). If i could do it over again all points would go Into INT. But thats just me. In the end Int/sta are gonna be the best 2. Pick one of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Cabot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">STA this gives you a boost in permanant HPs every level. Good stamina items are hard to get enough of. There is no substitute.<br />
<br />
STR strength items and buffs are easy to get, not to play down the SK's need for higher ATK, we suffer in this area. Rainjars and Beast Lords will usually cough up enough buffs to get 1300atk.<br />
<br />
DEX Even players of limited means can afford a 25/25 Staff of Lightning. Procs are much less important now. I would not put points here.<br />
<br />
AGI In higher levels you gear will supply a meaningful amount of agility, to be really noticeable it would have to be over 200 anyways. Let the AC and Hitpoints your class gets do their job.<br />
<br />
INT Playing anything but a large race will give you acceptable intelligence. This is important, but by lvl 65 the difference in mana pools won't be meaningful.<br />
<br />
I believe the STA camp is right, I'm not sure exactly how many more permenant hitpoints the 20 STA gives, maybe 200-300hp. I put my points there and have been thankful of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gaklaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">sta for smaller int for larger...and agi to 75.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sabazios</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">CHA: buy things at a cheaper price, sell things at a higher price, also helps w. DI!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>neferaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Sta or int, depending on what your aims are (elemental/VT or lower) and what your race is. Sta is the most important but it is also pretty easy to max with (shaman) buffs and most high end equipment supplying it in plenty amounts. Actually most melee stats get a huge boost with the proc of a primal weapon (avatar). If you are not an erudite or dark elf I would definately recommend Int as it also allows you to solo at high levels (where you are basically a little necromancer when you solo). A larger mana pool is pretty nice, and the only buff line that adds to it are the enchanters mind buffs (28 max for VoQ, does not stack with lower versions). I really regret putting all my points in agi instead of int (or sta).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Darcloakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I agree with Gaklaz, i put all mine into int.  You can find a ton of stuff later on with str and sta, but to me at least it seems like int is harder to come by.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Zauriel Moonshadow TP</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">SK cha is not very important; it's easy enough to go buy a couple items and raise it by 50 points, and you only need around 115 or something.<br />
<br />
Make sure nothing is below 75, and stick it in stamina (or maybe intelligence if you're a dumb race).<br />
<br />
As a DE I did stamina.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>appren hightowerr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">What the ones suggesting CHA means is that if you are in an elemental/time guild all your other stats will be max at 305 unbuffed soon enough anyway :D</div></div><hr />
