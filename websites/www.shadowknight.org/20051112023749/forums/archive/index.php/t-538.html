<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yisaar</div><div class="date">04-08-2002, 11:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Guardian, Sentient, Darkforge, Incarnadine and Umbral are all plate (No Iksars), this still leaves mid-high level Iksar SKs with planty of choices for upgrading after Dreadscale .....<br />
<br />
Jarsath, Ry'Gorr, Darkened Knights, Sentry, Greenmist, Barbed Ringmail, Kylong, Sebilis, Royal Frosted and finally the Vellious armors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarkWyld</div><div class="date">04-08-2002, 11:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dreadscale is the Iksar equivalent to Dark Forged.<br />
<br />
Intelligence is not as much an issue for Iksar as it is for Trolls and Ogres.  Therefore, we are not as needy in regard to Sentient.<br />
<br />
I am not aware of the armors available in Umbral Plains, so cannot make a value judgment.<br />
<br />
The one that has me upset is Blood Ember - those nice Kunark Armor pieces with the right-clickable effects.  Pretty frustrating to be the only SK in KC or Seb and not be able to use them when they drop.  This is my biggest problem with the Greenmist issue.  Other races can use a weapon that has a legitimate reason within the storyline for being Iksar only, but Iksar are still the only SKs that cannot use a set of armor for which there is no equivalent.</div></div><hr />

<br />
(can use the shield though)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tropics</div><div class="date">04-08-2002, 12:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Blood ember and UP armor is the biggest loss I know. Velious armor makes it not a great loss. I am hoping some of the great stuff that will drop in Vex Thal and PoP will not have the plate restriction, that would hurt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Skoriksis</div><div class="date">04-09-2002, 03:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Imbued Granite Spauldors (AC 20, +10 all saves shoulder item) is non-iksar as well.<br />
<br />
However, Ry'gorr, Royal Velium Frosted (I have no idea why, it looks like plate), and Crystal Chitin are all good Iksar wearable items.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have a mix of armor:  Jar crap, Cystal Chitlin, Treeweave, Greenmist, Netted Kelp, Grim Poulderons, Bracer of Scavaging, Bracer of Hammerfall, Velium Spiked helm, sk only helm from TT, Dragonworn, Nasthar, Tormak, Ironblack...  hell, If I can wear it, I'll use it.  I don't care what I look like, as long as it gets the job done depending on the circumstances.</div></div><hr />

Also there's some plate sk only boots that drop in kael arena that aren't iksar useable.<br />
<br />
I thought the UP stuff was iksar wearable? Or did they remove it when they made it so rangers couldn't wear it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
its non-ogre, non-troll, and i think non-gnome as well.  kind of annoying that large races can't wear 1 of the greatest pal/sk back items(massive underbulk shell) and a really nice shoulder item.</div></div><hr />

<br />
been the only sk three times already when the damned things dropped =/</div></div><hr />
