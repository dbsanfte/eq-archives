<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Newbdesk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Looking for some exp zone suggestions for a 49 SK and Enchanter duo (not a 2 box, 2 people).<br />
<br />
We got 46-49 in HHK at the bards/nobles, getting about 1% of a level a kill.<br />
<br />
We handle old world mobs better usually because they hit less hard.  Our only real obvious problem is no healing, so we're looking for camps we can get by with lifetap/bind wounds at.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Newbdesk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Wow, that grim, huh?  I guess we should re-roll...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grarg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd suggest to try get a healer and hit pon or poi.<br />
Trio is easy enough.<br />
<br />
Else you want somewhere you can kite.<br />
<br />
Maidens Eye is good for that round level 50. Tash will enable the SK's snare to stick and you can agro kite the mobs to death.<br />
<br />
You can even do DL at that level. Fear kiting in DL is great fun.<br />
<br />
If you get set up, you can also agro kite in PON or POD.<br />
<br />
Problem is you will cop a couple of deaths without a healer, but the xp rate will be sooooo much higher it would be well worth it.<br />
<br />
Frankly though, you will do much better grouping at that level range and that class combo.<br />
<br />
Hope I helped.<br />
<br />
Rowf! rowf rowf!<br />
(Now with Grargh toooo!)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Slowing is good, so if you have the LoY expansion you could try Dulak as well, it's a good spot with plenty of mobs.</div></div><hr />

Hmm... what this breastplate is? never heard about it... Can you put a link to it (to alakhazam or whatever)</div></div><hr />

<br />
We did 49 &amp; 50 at the HHK Nobles camp (easily split with a 'chanter), and they light blue at 51, so we went to Velks and got a group for a bit, the rest of the time we ***VERY CAREFULLY*** held the left wall camp, all they way through to now, 20% from 53.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Soltisce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">since when do nobles go lblue at 51?? ive camped with my druid and SK and they dont go lbue till 53-54 ( at 53 it was 1 out of every 2 spawns or so was lblue ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Newbdesk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">We dinged and 4 out of the next 7 pops were light blue.  The exp really slowed down there for that last level anyway, and MANY MANY people were waiting on that camp to power-level their alts, or cash farm, or whatever it is level 55+ people do there....<br />
<br />
So we moved on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Newbdesk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Experience is very good in Velks.  It's kind of empty a lot on our server, waxing and waning from 12-14 people to just us and the always present rotating pair of 65's farming frenzy for chitin drops.<br />
<br />
Got 53 and 54 by holding the left wall room and pulling the back wall, and the ramps.  We have been taking any LFG types who zone in and ask, so as a pair, a trio, or up to four of us, usually without a healer, this is still a pretty viable exp camp.<br />
<br />
We've also each gotten a no drop Forgotten Ebony Earring, and I have gotten a no drop Velium Etched Helm, both from the Fierce Blizzard Hunter.<br />
<br />
The helm is pretty good if you're not a twink(and no helmet graphic for the vain melee type), and I've seen more than one level 10 or so melee just sitting in the entrance waiting for these to drop.  Two on a kill, about one spawn an hour is the fierce, and LOTZ of these rot.</div></div><hr />
