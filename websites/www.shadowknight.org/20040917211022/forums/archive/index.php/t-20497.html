<br />
the firstdrake of the day i pulled dropped my hide. within 2 hours after that 2 more dropped, 3 overall.... i was dumbfounded. so dont give up hope, odd things can happen. i think i have killed 50ish drakes so keep on killing guys and gals, it will drop for ya!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Pincer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">wow, I'm going to have to go back up there and try a few soon.  I had given up after 400 drakes, and finally gave in to getting a MQ from a friend.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ghosteater</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">absolutely figures....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kowl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I went home at lunch today and turned and went ahead and let the patch run so I would be ready to jump on EQ tonight when I get off work. I was reading the patch message and about hit the floor when I read that they had increased the drop rate for the decrepit hide. I already got in touch with several from my guild and we are hitting PoH as soon as I log on tonight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Slowly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>morbbidd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">HAHAHAHA funniest thing is my friend is rl just got his hide a couple days ago, After killing about 700+ drakes over a long ass time period, he logged on to see that messaged today...man on man the messaged i got from him. Yes seems the drop rate is crazy now but then again so is hate its like a massive sk hellfest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Babaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">yesterday after reading patch message i went to PoH once VZ server was up and dropped the hide after 7 drakes... thank you SoE!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Laymon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Oh come on!!<br />
Am i the only person here still after a hide since the patch??<br />
did 16 drakes last night - plus 2 broodmasters and I'm still waiting!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kowl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">No Laymon you arnt the only one still looking. After 5 hours and 8 more Drakes last night I still havnt seen a hide. While I was in Hate there was another group also looking for a hide and there never got a drop either. Im going back tonight and trying again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jormunrek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Heh, went there last night hoping to get a hide and vamp essence for one of the enchanters that was in our group.<br />
After about 5hrs of non stop killing STILL no hide or vamp essences. ugh...<br />
<br />
But oddly enough had a metric f#ckton of minor signets drops. <br />
<br />
Will probably be going back tonight for another 5hr session slaughter.  Maybe get a couple groups and just split the zone up.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Calamity_Daemon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Heh, people on Inny think the SK weapon is completely worthless...and yes...it is...but there's like 5 of us SK's actually looking to complete the quest on the whole server and 3 have already completed that I know of...hehe when I get back from Chicago I'm gonna plant myself in the thick of PoH =D</div></div><hr />
