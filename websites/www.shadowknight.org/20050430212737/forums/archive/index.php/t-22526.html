<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kaotix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know we're gimp dot/pet kiters, but if I get bored I like a challenge.  Tactics and HoH were the last places I was kiting stuff solo.<br />
I read about some rangers root/bowing mobs in vxed.<br />
Was wondering if any SKs here have tried kiting there and how it went?<br />
At worst I could bot my wife's druid and use real DoTs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>dagelbauer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Dot/pet kiteing is possible for a skilled Shadowknight in Vexd, i've done it many times myself. <br />
A few things to remember,<br />
 1) Use Lev to take advantage of the ledges for extra running space<br />
 2) The mobs here hit very hard so HP/AC buffs are a big help<br />
 3) Its not a half-assed kite, lag in this tight area with mobs that hit for 1k is bad<br />
 4) Last but not least watch out for the little bugs they can be hard to see and they do SUMMON, if you have a hard time single pulling without getting the bugs exit and start a new one.<br />
<br />
Good Luck and &quot;Don't be a fool, wrap your tool&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kaotix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks for the info.<br />
I've tanked vxed so I am aware of how fast and hard they hit.  I have no dellusions about their dps :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Simu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Of course it is possible and requires few skill. Only patience...<br />
<br />
Mobs in there do have what ? 25khp ? 30khp ? How long will it take for you to pet kite 25Khp with few dots in and there ? Wayyy to long imho =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kaotix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well..to answer my own question - I did solo there over the weekend.  10 percent aa xp :)  Took about 10 min to do the actual kill.  I dont know what the medding downtime was cuz I went afk but I was at about 40% mana when I was done kiting.  No KEI, just lich and Bo9.<br />
The kite probly could have gone faster, but I'm pretty conservative with my mana and always like to keep it above 30 percent.<br />
After the one kill I boxed my wife's druid.  In any case it was a fun challenge.  Only got tagged 2 or 3 times cuz of warping.  Mobs there have hella dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Oberyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">you can avoid the warps.  Run (leved) a squashed figure 8 kinda thing, and use the walls at either end, and make sure the buggers don't get caught on the walls for more than a second or two.  they warp quite quickly there if they do.  Theres just room to pass at either end, and keep them moving in a straight line most of the time.<br />
<br />
Warps there suck, yes.  Particularly when you get stunned:P<br />
<br />
Its a fun place:)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ephyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Kaotix...how were you going with the druid box...been thiniking of tying that combo...borrowing a friends druid...<br />
<br />
did you kite with sk while dotting with druid? or use sk to pull then root with druid and dot down?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kaotix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Pulled with SK and root/dot with druid.<br />
The wife's druid has the improved aa root and aa dot crits, so her dps is way too high for me to try and hold agro with my spells.  I just stand the sk up and keep Festering, BoH, Ignite Blood and Boil Blood on the mob.  With the druid I kept Swarming Death, Vengance of Tunare, Immolation of Ro and epic dot on it.  Her FT is pretty good so it was constant pulls.  Just watch the warping.  <br />
And of course on the occasions where the pull was a bit &quot;messy&quot; it was nice having a quick druid heal to bring me back up to speed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ephyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">KK thanks mate...<br />
<br />
sounds along the lines of what i was thinking....not sure my friends druid has all the aas for dot crits and root...but ill check...<br />
<br />
will try this weked most likely...<br />
