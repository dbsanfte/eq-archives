No you cannot MQ the new key.   The book, blood from turning in the book, and container you combine all the things in are all no-drop.  MQ is not an option as you have to combine for the end result.  The only MQ you can do would be to finish your old key, which would be abotu 2/3 the effort needed to get the new key.</div></div><hr />

That depends; I finished my old key quest in three days, camping things on and off. With a good group of friends, you can easily finish the new key in an afternoon; I've seen it done.</div></div><hr />
