<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>SoulVoid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Please post problems you find here. We are in the middle of a multi-phase upgrade but if you notice something bring it to our attention as we may have just overlooked it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">PM, ICQ, AIM me color problems if you see them, stuff I know of right now, some of the headers are missing their border (headers mainly), message editor, and error screens all being off.  Those should be fixed sometime tomorrow (well today now).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kalendrox Grimblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">user names are obtrusively large~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ghismonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The &quot;do not send me email replies to threads that I have subscribed to&quot; option doesn't seem to be working.  I've gotten a lot of emails today, and have refreshed/resaved that option at least a half dozen times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Khat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ghismonda,<br />
I believe that is only for new ones.<br />
What I did was go into UserCP and choose List Subscriptions (under Subscribed Threads on the left vertical bar).<br />
<br />
This showed all of the subscribed threads.  Then I chose the topmost checkbox on the right of the threads, this toggled a checkmark in all of the boxes next to each thread.<br />
<br />
After that, I chose Delete Subscription from the bottom dropdown box.<br />
Did this for every page and all subscriptions were gone.<br />
<br />
There may be an easier way but this did the job.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Chayde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hey, I found something I actually don't like.. (LOL sorry)<br />
<br />
On the old template, the buddy list was to the left of your user control pannel, you were able to click on PM buddy and you can start your PMing.... Is there a way to do that again, or do I have to type in very confusing hard to remember spellings of names everytime I want to cyb.... umm I mean PM someone?<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: And why the pop up for requesting a read receiet? Isn't that what the message tracking was for? Where does this receit go? I feel all stupid now. thanks =o)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Getting rid of the huge black lines was good, but it'd look better with the same light black lines that are found throughout most of the board separated the two colors of the posts themselves.  <br />
<br />
From a visual standpoint, that's my biggest complaint, along with the homosexual smileys.  It just kinda looks &quot;wierd&quot; the way they meet/wrap around/etc. and seems like there just really needs to be some kinda line in between them.  <br />
<br />
From a functionality standpoint, most of it's pretty easy to adjust to, though the search feature is a little akward at times.  Main complaint in that regard is the subscriptions, and I know you're working on that - I actually liked being able to subscribe to threads to view threds I'm following from user CP without being subjected to email spam.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Oh yeah, and can we PLEASE do away with 60 second and 1000 word PM restrictions?  It's ungodly annoying to try to PM someone, and if it's about something requiring more thought power than possessed by a rock, it's going to be over 1000 characters, having to break it into smaller PM's, but then having the problem of needing to spend 5 minutes trying to send them all.  This must die.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly! This even becomes a problem that you are filling someones PM box to it's limit.</div></div><hr />

Will look into this. With the old version it was a problem wiht the database but I believe we have that fixed now. will be late next week tho before I get to looking into it. Holidays and all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">OK, first a bug I've noticed:  If you read all of the new threads in a forum, then go back to the forum index (I.E. click everquest at the top) without returning to the forum, it'll still say there's a new thread.  If you then visit the forum, you'll see that there are no new threads, and upon returning to the forum index, it'll correctly reflect that.  Not a major problem, but a bit annoying at times - not even sure if you can fix it; might be something to pass on to whatever company is behind the message board format or whatever...<br />
<br />
Also, can we make derailing non-flame forum threads with political BS a bannable offense (whether successful or not)?  I don't know about you, but I have other sources for political stuff - when I come to SKO, that's not what I care to read.  I don't give a shit if there are Flame On threads about it, but when someone trys to derail a thread with something political, it just really gets under my skin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Fally</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'm not sure if the character limit for the signature was just decreased or if it's a bug, but currently it counts the html code and tags as characters, instead of what is really shown. Example:<br />
<br />
My signature has about 450 characters actually shown, without the spaces but with the html code it is close to 600 characters, with spaces and with html code it is more than 600 characters.<br />
<br />
Fally...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">One more thing, not specific to the layout change or anything, but that's extraordanarily annoying... the 1440minute editing window.  Can we just ban EdgeofDetroit and get rid of the lame limit?  I can't edit in update information about my weapon analysis sheets anymore, I can't update my balance threads (hence why I have 4 and will likely soon start a 5th), etc. - it's really quite an annoyance... EoD caused more annoyance with getting that imposed than he would have with editing out all of his posts anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>SoulVoid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Yes, we know the main page is screwed up a little the borders and such are not supposed to be white. will work on it more tomorrow night, I'm going to sleep.</div></div><hr />

Pfew, i was allmost blind :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>kassdax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">No pictures at all except for autosigs and the banner. Search button is a red &quot;x&quot; as is the quicklinks, go back, reload this page, shadowknight.org and everything else.<br />
<br />
Formatting on the main page looks like crap, everything looks way out of whack.<br />

Masturbation?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>kassdax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Anybody have a guess why my formatting is fubar? I've spent close to 2 hours changing IE options around. Making security go from one end of the scale to the other. Cleared cache, history, cookies, defragged, etc.<br />
<br />
Of the 9 forums I visit on a regular basis, this is the only one that's messed up. The pictures and formatting have only recently gone buggy (since the IGE banner has been posted up above recently).<br />
<br />
Once again for those that missed it above. Click here (http://www.geocities.com/tweelis/skorg.html) to view a screenshot of what I see while viewing this forum.<br />

Thanks for any advice.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Any chance of a change to the edit time limit and/or the PM length limit?  The former is not only annoying but inhibitive, and the latter is just ungodly irritating...</div></div><hr />
