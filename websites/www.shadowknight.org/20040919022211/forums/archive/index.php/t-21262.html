<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>XebarisTP</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've tried to do the wine quest invis, invis after opening trade window (with help), hide, de illusion, faction modifier from lguk, faction modifier from GoD, and nothing worked, so I guess I'm restricted to raising Dreadguardouter faction first.<br />
<br />
But I've been killing halfling guards in Misty Thicket for over three months, and the guards outside Neriak are still scowling! How obnoxious is this part supposed to be for an Iksar SK!?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>bastardlunatic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">use invis go inside neriak with a friend.  put 1 k in the smackas trade window get an invis and hit trade.  simple and easy.  at 65 you should be able to solo neriak.<br />
<br />
if you have done the turn in of the note to duriek you should be ok without an invis for the turn in of 1k to smacka.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I had to try again after the hand-in to Duriek, despite all common sense, and thus I wasted another kpp for still being dubious.<br />
<br />
And I'll probably waste yet another kpp later tonight with the invis trick (that didn't help me get faction hits in the red wine quest. just exp)<br />
<br />
I was just reminded that I probably started out indifferent to Dark Bargainers, but dropped down to dubious in my early 40's, a lifetime ago, when I whacked the wrong npc. Cause suddenly I couldn't sell HG loot to the trolls or ogres in Rathe Mountains, anymore.<br />
<br />
Trying to fix it just blows goats.. I haven't even bottomed out all the halfling factions when working on Dreadguard outer, and I've spent soo much time on it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I will try to find it but I thought they removed the faction portion of the wine quest some time ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>XebarisTP</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I tried the wine quest with a dark elf, and got positive faction hits. Probably just have to be indiff w/o invis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Azudno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I did the faction quest as an ogre recently. Started out as dubious to the quest guy and dreadguard, both inner and outer. Couple of stacks o' wine later I was max ally with the quest guy and dreadguard faction was still at dubious, although I did not get any maxed faction msgs for them. Soon as I get some spare time I'm going back to dump the rest of my wine in him to see if I can get a maxed faction msg for the dreadguard faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>XebarisTP</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I finally got Dreadguardouter to threateningly today, but the red wine npc was still dubious. Figured I ought to try the hide trick before doing more factioning, and blow me backwards, it worked.. on successful hides, at least.<br />
<br />
3 months ago, I tried very much the same thing, but got invis cast on me by a group member while having the trade window open, and that didn't get me faction hits, just exp. So.. I dunno... i kind of shut out the thought of trying with hide. Maybe I did try hide, but it failed and I was still dubious..<br />
<br />
Confused, tired, aggravated, yet relieved.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>XebarisTP</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It took me 2 stacks of red wine to get indifferent, and maybe 8 to get to ally. Finally got my cough elixir. Time for some PoH and The Hole for me, then. If I can round up some people, that is..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Azudno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I dumped bout 14 stacks of wine into the guy and got both dreadguard factions up to amiable. It seems the dreadguard faction hits on the wine quest are a lot lower then the dark bargainer hits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Androsulach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">They are.  I have no idea how many stacks of wine I've given Lokar over the years, but I've been max ally to the Dark Bargainers for a long, long time.  I think the Dread Guards both Inner and Outer are warmly to me, but then, I also kill halflings any time I get the itch to kill the buggers when I'm running around in Nek, typically when I stop in to visit home and see the tribute mistress.  Can't call her a master, since she's female. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ravenar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Did you ever try using a Dark Elf illusion potion to turn in the wine?  Use to a 20+ chanter could go charm Tokar and bring him to the zone line for faction work.  That, also, no longer works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Androsulach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'd suggest, for Dread Guard Outer, that you kill halflings at any of the halfling camps in Nek.  Keep doing it until the guards are dubious, at least.  You can also collect all the rat whiskers you can find to turn in to the exterminators.  I believe they give about the same kind of factions as the wine to Lokar.<br />
<br />
For SK and Necro guild, kill the arcanes near the spires in Nek.  The faction you'll be raising is The Dead.  I'm not sure what kind of starting faction you'll have with them, but if you want to use the GMs in Neriak, you'll need to kill plenty of them and remember to invis vs undead to get past the ghouls whenever you go to the guild hall.  It's behind the library where you go to give wine to Lokar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sorill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The evil version of the concordance of research quest also adds positive dark bargainer and dread guard innner/outer faction. <br />
<br />
Iksar necros and sks start with the faction necessary to do this quest even though sks don't have research skills.</div></div><hr />
