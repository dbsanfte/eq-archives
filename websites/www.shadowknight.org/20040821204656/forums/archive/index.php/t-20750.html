<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Malize Mikage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Actually, what you're seeing now is the way the Luclin models were *intended* to look like all along. It's just that until this last patch, the /dopropertinting toggle was defaulted to OFF and you had to manually toggle it on. The patch must have set the toggle to default to ON.<br />
<br />
Do proper tinting does exactly that. Instead of an armor's color or an armor's dye covering an entire body area (for instance, that leather bustier high elf females are known for. Before, with the toggle off, you dye it blue and the entire chest from the collar around the neck to the waist would be blue, including the elf's supposedly bare chest), the armor color or dye only covers the actual material of the armor, leaving the skin its natural tint.<br />
<br />
That means all that chain mail that used to be lime green links over skin also dyed lime green and looked like a solid mass now shows only lime green on the links themselves, letting ogre ass show through.<br />
<br />
This is how I've seen the Luclin models for well over a year because a long time ago I turned the proper tinting to on. So in reality, they didn't mess up the graphics. They *fixed* them.</div></div><hr />

Finally, someone with a clue.  You don't know how frustrating it is trying to explain this over and over to ogres getting all pissy about their &quot;bugged checkerboard armor&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Krazix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I would post pics, but whatever the fuck they did with their new ss's bullshit, they won't open in photoshop anymore. So fuckem.<br />
<br />
But anyway luclin ogre chain has always looked like ass.. no more like poop covered dick that just came out of a 3 week old horse corpse.  At least before dopropertinting was off, and with dark colors you could hide that shit. Now I use old models because it's so bad (play an ogre shaman as my main, all chain armor)</div></div><hr />
