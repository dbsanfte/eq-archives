<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bluebash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Spent 13 hours and he was a no-show. Was in OOT at the time /sigh. I hear that the spawn in SRo is more frequent but I also here that KS'ing is too. I feel ripped off. The same way you feel after you play one of those stupid &quot;Direct the claw to pick up the prize&quot; games. There is no point to this post. I'm just whining</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Morgrist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's a lottery. Don't feel bad if you never see him.<br />
 <br />
If you're high enough to have a levitate or just have clicky levitate,you can sit there pulling seafuries over to the island between spawns. You may never see the Ancient,but the loot is very nice.<br />
 <br />
Translocators now that the boats are screwy again make it a nice fast transit,too. Just pop in at the docks,swim over and start kiting/fighting.</div></div><hr />
