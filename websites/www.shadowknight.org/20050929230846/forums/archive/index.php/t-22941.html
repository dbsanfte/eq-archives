<br />
the rest you can pretty much figure out ;)</div></div><hr />

Take a look around the big room when you get into P5. There's going to be a limited number of places you'll want to be. <br />
<br />
.....AE's i should be aware of...<br />
<br />
CT will make you aware of them, no worries. His PR agent has also made sure he has his very own listing on Alla's.<br />
<br />
Seriously tho, different raid forces do him (and many mobs) differently. Your raid force should go through the learning process like you would with any mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ghismonda</div><div class="date">10-01-2004, 12:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hopefully you have your Fearless AA.  If you don't, there's no real reason to use you over a warrior.  Also, you probably don't want to hear this, but consider using a Fearless paladin to tank him the first time.  Aside from his damage dealing AE, he also has an AE silence which will make getting (and maintaining) aggro a real sonofabitch.  Seems like the many times we killed him, I was always hit with the silence right off on inc.  Paladins have a discipline (Santification, I think) that makes them immune to spells for a few ticks and thus they won't get silenced on inc.<br />
<br />
Tank him in one of the two back corners that you zoned up into P5.  He and Bertox aren't leashed to their little areas like the other gods in Time are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Naubi</div><div class="date">10-01-2004, 07:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We fought him in his corner thing, which works fine.<br />
<br />
But... make sure you tell ppl NOT to zone to pofear as CRing there is a major pain now.</div></div><hr />
