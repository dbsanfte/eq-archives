<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tukka</div><div class="date">08-20-2002, 12:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Verify this for me... am I correct in understanding that in order to complete the Greenmist, you need to complete every single Iksar shadow knight khurki quest there is?  If so... wow, ouch.  I guess that's why I don't see any Greenmist khurkis on the Firiona Vie server. :(  This is really discouraging... I have little hope of ever completing Innoruuk's Curse, but Greenmist seemed within reach with some effort, until now.<br />
<br />
Is there any way around this?  Overall, how rare are the items needed to complete the khurki quests, up the Lord of Pain's Khurki?  I knew I'd need the Lord of Pain's Khurki to complete Greenmist, but I didn't know there were 6 other quests you had to complete to get it.  :\  The first of which begins with an Iksar Shadow Knight's newbie note!  Bah.  I guess it just wasn't meant to be.  Unless something changed when they changed something about the quest when they changed the Greenmist to be usable by non-Iksar..?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mr. Dreadclaw</div><div class="date">08-20-2002, 01:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You have to do all the Khukri quests in order to obtain greenmist. Although you might be able to find someone selling a Hero's Khukri which is the only one that is not NO DROP. It's the Khukri right before the Lord of pain Khukri.<br />
<br />
Although you could do all the greenmist parts upto the last combine if you dont have your LoP. Thats what I did. All i need is the mirror and a few more pieces for the LoP quest and im finished.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tukka</div><div class="date">08-20-2002, 03:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">On Firiona Vie, I'm pretty sure none of the khurki's (including Greenmist itself) are NO DROP.  However, TLC is in effect on this server, serverwide.  The LoP khurki quest items are mostly TLC to me now, the hero's khurki and earlier khurki's are going to be items that drop off NPCs that are WAY green to me, thus I'd have to get a lower level player take pity on me and help me get all those drops.  Which I suppose I can do, but it's a huge pain.  How rare/difficult are the drops needed earlier khurki quests?   I guess I can convince a friend on another server to jump on FV and make an Iksar SK and give me the first khurki, and I could give it a shot.  One thing's for sure, I'd probably be the only erudite shadow knight on the server with a Greenmist khurki for quite a while, heh.<br />
<br />
Right now I've got 3 of the illegible scrolls (the ones dropped in CoM), one of the Droga keys (bone key) for the Lord of Pain Khurki, and the bottle of liquid deklium to trigger the cliff golem fight.  I was REALLY looking forward to completing this quest, it was shaping up to be my main goal. :\  Guess I'm going to have to find a new one, or try to deal with TLC.<br />
<br />
I doubt I'm going to be able to find someone who's willing to part with their khurkis... at least not anyone who realizes their value, not at a price I'm going to be able to afford.  But I guess it can't hurt to keep my eyes open.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
All the Khukri's are no drop except the Hero's Khukri. Also none of the Khukri's drop off NPC's. You have to quest for each Khukri in order and you need to MQ the first Khukri, or do the Pennace quest to get it. There is a nice walkthrough posted in the Dirty Deeds forum that details all of the Khukri quests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jobrill</div><div class="date">08-20-2002, 03:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Firiona Vie has Trivial Loot code. If it's Magic, Lore, or NO DROP, It don't drop off the mob if you kill when it's green.<br />
<br />
Which is why I won't touch FV with a 10-foot pole, personally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tukka</div><div class="date">08-20-2002, 04:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What Jobrill says is true, if an item is magic, lore, or no drop, it will not drop if the person killing the NPC doesn't get experience from the kill (or if anybody in the group that gets credit for the kill doesn't get experience.)  This was originally implemented to cut down on farming, and first introduced on all servers with the introduction of the Warrens and Stonebrunt, and Luclin was supposed to be all TLC as well, but they went back on that decision and decided to take TLC out of the Warrens and Stonebrunt and release Luclin with normal loot rules.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately some quests (basically EVERY Iksar quest) was designed in such a way as to make them ridiculously difficult to complete with TLC in effect.  I wish they'd code in some exceptions to TLC, because in some cases it really is ridiculous.  It's a sledgehammer solution to a problem that requires a scalpel.<br />
<br />
On the flip side however, there are very few NO DROP items on Firiona Vie.  Items that are flagged as NO DROP on other servers aren't NO DROP on Firiona Vie.  Journeyman's Boots, Goranga Spiked Clubs, Coldain Rings, ect. are all tradable/droppable (the practice of passing around your pair of boots for a &quot;hit&quot; of a speed is common on FV, though as you can imagine I've heard some horror stories where unscrupulous individuals run off with the boots, or a player accidentally gives their boots to a pet).  But I digress.  For the most part the only items that aren't NO DROP are the epic weapons and items related to the epics, so I'm pretty sure none of the khurkris or related Greenmist quest items are NO DROP on FV.<br />
<br />
Firiona Vie originally had more to distinguish itself from the other servers (alignment grouping restrictions, which I generally liked, and the lack of a zonewide /shout channel, which I also liked), but now all it really is, is a normal server with a 1 character per account restriction, an easily surmountable language barrier, and TLC.  Of those three special rules, the only one I really like is the 1 character restriction.  Overall I am disappointed with what the server has become, but I'm not going to start over elsewhere after having invested so much on FV.</div></div><hr />

There was a time when I really could not imagine playing on any other server, but this TLC stuff is starting to wear my patience thin.  I started playing on this server because it's the &quot;roleplaying preferred&quot; server, but I really don't see how TLC has anything to do with roleplaying.<br />
<br />
However, it is the only server where you won't ever see a piece of planar loot rot. :)</div></div><hr />

I've run into TLC issues at every turn of the quest so far. If you're truly dedicated, I encourage you to continue working for it, however, the khukri quests are going to be your bane.<br />
<br />
The other problem I've run into is that being a Role Playing preferred enviroment, you're very unlikely to find manky Iksar willing to assist a softskin. Your best bet is going to be buying the quest items for inflated amounts. I'm getting close, but still have a bit of work to do. I've actually taken a month long break from EQ just to get away from the hellish camps. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tukka</div><div class="date">08-21-2002, 05:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks, Oreo.  I seldom see any of the khurki quest items for sale though, most people don't tend to save things with obscure names like an &quot;illegible scroll&quot; or a &quot;tome page&quot;, especially since most people don't even know what the heck they're for.<br />
<br />
I guess I could try to pin down a lower level guild member and have them do my dirty work as a sort of &quot;rite of passage&quot; for some of them, and hang out in zones where the items drop and offer to pay for the rest.   I'm dreading the visceral dagger part of the quest though... god, how am I going to convince a group of lower level characters to brave the depths of Dalnir's and camp imprecators for hours upon hours?  And convince them that I get to keep the +8 INT dagger for myself?  I guess that's what guildmates and friends are for, but I HATE putting them out like that.<br />
<br />
I guess I can farm platinum and just hope to buy it.  Part of the reason Greenmist was attractive to me though was because it was an awesome quest that I thought I could do without paying an arm and a leg.  I'm still using a cougarskin mask and several pieces of Darkforge... I have other things I need to spend my platinum on before dumping it on quest items for a new weapon. :\<br />
<br />
Ah well, thanks for your help. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't know if ANYONE has completed the Greenmist on FV to determine this but... being not actually an epic weapon, is the Greenmist ITSELF no drop on FV....?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">paustin</div><div class="date">08-31-2002, 09:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">heres a perfect example of why TLC sucks and doesnt work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tukka</div><div class="date">09-05-2002, 08:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A bit of an update.  A few days ago I decided it's pointless to feel daunted and made the decision to go for it.<br />
<br />
I paid a newbie from my old server to log onto Firiona Vie and create an Iksar Shadow Knight to give me his Pawn's Khukri.  Ran around the newbie area of LOIO and was found that none of the sarnak hatchlings' heads were magic or lore, so I was able to do that portion of the quest alone.  Had a friend in the guild run in and do the exchanges for me, so now I have a Knave's Khukri, one of the pages for the froglok raider book, and the coin used to spawn the Goxnok/drachnid spy battle.<br />
<br />
I braved the depths of Dalnir's last night with a few lower level guildmates, and would you believe it, I picked up all four parts needed to complete the Visceral Dagger in about 2 hours and forged it on the spot (got the dagger hilt and sharp metal shard by killing the imprecators, and got the forge hammer by killing the undead smith, and a good/neutral aligned guild with no SKs or necromancers present sold me the other shard.)  We also came away with a Robe of Dalnir... the odds of all this happening are probably about the same as getting struck by lightning a few times and winning the lottery.<br />
<br />
And it turns out that the highest level member in my guild had the glowing skull from Kurn's Tower banked from his days hunting there.<br />
<br />
So between that, the 3 CoM scrolls, the bottle of deklium and the bone key I have from Droga, I'd say I have a pretty strong start on completing the Greenmist, despite TLC.  Really the Dalnir's camp was the one I was dreading most, and it's almost like an omen that it went so painlessly.<br />
<br />
I have a level 11 rogue lined up to help me with the froglok raider portion of the quest tonight.  Tomorrow night the guild has a Mistmoore raid planned and hopefully I'll get one or both of the illegible scrolls that drop there then. <br />
<br />
And I'm pretty sure my guild can handle Chardok and Drusella, but I'll worry more about that when I've got the TLC crap out of the way.<br />
<br />
A question though, how rare is the Mirror of Self Loathing?  The only mention I've seen of its rarity was a comment on Allakhazam's somewhere that said it was rare.  How many times (on average) do you all estimate I'd have to kill her before getting the drop?  I know the greenish metal shard is obscenely rare.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />
<br />
Oh, also.  Greenmist has been completed on Firiona Vie twice that I'm aware of.  An Iksar named Khissh, and a dark elf named Eldraed.  Heh, somewhat ironically I was with a group hunting in CoM for my first time when Eldraed stopped by and pulled for our group, in exchange for our giving him any illegible scrolls he needed that dropped.  In our time there we got enough scrolls for both him and I (he already had one or two of them I believe... of course we got the same scroll about 4 times in a row).  Lame thing is that Eldraed has changed hands via auction sites like 2 or 3 times.  And I believe that Greenmist itself is not NO DROP on Firiona Vie, at least I would be surprised if it were.</div></div><hr />
