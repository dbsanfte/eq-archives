<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shadowsoal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm sick and tierd of fighting the same shit every single day over and over again, for the past two expansions SoE has released like hardly and new models<br />
<br />
GoD models:<br />
taelosian male<br />
taelosian female<br />
truepta<br />
stonemite<br />
hynid<br />
cragbeast<br />
Ra`Tuk<br />
Mastruq<br />
Kyv<br />
Noc<br />
ukun<br />
Ikaav<br />
Anuek<br />
Golem (several colors but all same model)<br />
Zun`Muram<br />
<br />
New models for OoW<br />
Dragorn (several colors same model)<br />
Discordling<br />
griplan<br />
Feran<br />
Bazu<br />
Chimera<br />
Gelidran<br />
Pyrilen<br />
Murkglider<br />
Lightning Warrior<br />
<br />
15 new models in 1 expansion, okay that isn't so horrible, I think it was SoE's lowest new model count when GoD came out, but then with OoW adding only 10 new models and just shipping the muramite models over, lame imo, am I over reacting? or have other people noticed SoE's lack of creativity when it came to generating the models for the NPC's in their recent expansions<br />
<br />
Note: I give them Credit for the Lightning Warrior, one of the best models they've made in a long time, but 1 model of a mob I see in 1 zone doesn't make up for the lack of creativity in the rest of the last two expansions</div></div><hr />

I haven't dyed my armor and it turns at that the BM in Ruined City of Dranik drops some pretty decent boots. Pretty decent mother fucking puddle jumper yellow duck rain boots. Fuck, it looks like they were colored yellow by a 3 way piss orgy and that is not from using dyes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
imo,with the creative design staff that SoE has, ( a pack of wild monkeys flinging shit at a canvas),we don't have much, but i like Baz Thrashers &amp; Co. and could fight em hours on end without much complaint,we could use some more differentiantion in the mob cycle, after 400mobs or so it gets tedious and boring, but that's what friends are there for...chat,bullshit,make fun of gnomes,rangers,and bards in general, and to have Cyborz with.<br />
<br />
Content has been watered down like the tequila,jack daniels,or that hard lemonade youve grown accustomed to at the local bar/pub you go to everynight(or where you hang out at for parties), deal with it you know your bartender does it,but you dont go there for the drinks(mostly) you go for the people you hang out with or the local drunk you laugh at because he can't stand up on his own. <br />
<br />
but in the next expansion comes with rehashed mobs, i swear they are getting a krispy kreme donut box with a bomb inside of it.....ooops *didnt mean to say that aloud*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>kharan_zechts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I want to talk about GoD a bit.<br />
<br />
Hadn't noticed, but really don't care that much. Gameplay &amp; Depth of Content trump graphics big time.<br />
<br />
Well thats partly true. However, graphics and lore really do enhance the experience. They both are part of &quot;Depth of Content.&quot; Hell I never read any of the lore, but the fact that its there makes the game experience so much better. I think GoD would have been a much better expansion if they had more models. It just makes the zones and encounters more interesting even if you don't pay attention to the graphics as much. Killing the same shit from ferubi to tacvi can get pretty monotonous even if the encounters and strategies are innovative and challenging.<br />
<br />
They needed more zone graphics for god also. Ferubi, ikkinz, uqua, inktuta, txevu, and tacvi all looked exactly the same. Maybe a palette swap here and there and a few different structures but they had the same graphics. It really adds to the frustration and mess that was GoD.<br />
<br />
The whole GoD expansion could of been incredible if it was done correctly. The challenge and the raid content were right on the money but the graphics, some of the itemization, and other things could of really used a makeover.<br />
<br />
I kinda agree with Chania too. Back in the days of no armor dye, I remember being a newbie and I could tell when someone had badass gear just because of the way it looked. Those velious helms were so uber.<br />
<br />
I hope they get off the muramite crap soon and go back to more traditional D&amp;D stuff. I don't know if they can ever bring back the good old days. Maybe they should make a server that only has the first 3 expansions.. then again maybe not cuz I doubt anyone would play it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't understand by re-releasing a server that would only contain the first 3 expansions,in which you could go back and explore yourself with any alt or your main, would enrich EQ any better, going for nostalgia isn't what shadowsoal is talking about here, i understand your reason and opinion on this, but myself, would like to see at least a few new &quot;monster models&quot;,like how you said ranging back to the D&amp;D monsters<br />
<br />
all in all everyone's argument on this thread is sound and reasonabl (except mine) but go outside after that 10hour camp or 5 hour exp grind, come back refreshed and have fun again,at least that is my mind set,like i said in my previous post, it's mostly the people you hunt with which makes the game what it is...<br />
<br />
youre looking for a world that's so immersive,when you have one outside,with millions of monster and NPC models to look and gawk at....they are called people lol,i don't think any game developer will come up with a game that our imaginations can think of, it's always that the player has the better idea on how to improve things but do not have the resources to do them</div></div><hr />

<br />
It might enhance the gaming experience for you, but graphics certainly do not have anything at all to do with depth of content.  Depth of content is simply &quot;how much shit there is to do in the game&quot; - if it's not something for your character to do or kill, then it has no bearing on depth of content.  You could be playing EQ with the corrupt graphics file that causes all NPC's to look like naked humans, and the depth of content would be unchanged.  <br />
<br />
EQ's immense depth of content, due in large part to its age, is one of the reasons many people will stick with it in the face of new, up and coming games. <br />
<br />

<br />
You can play whatever portion of the game you choose.  If you don't like the muramites, and you want to return to &quot;the good old days&quot;, nobody is stopping you.  Make a new character, don't twink, and level up in EC, NRo, Oasis, Guk, and Sol A/B.  There are more ways to play this game than the mad dash to 70 and the clamour to get into a top guild... look at Keevel.</div></div><hr />

Right on, mobs are mobs and you can only have so many graphics.  I think the boss type mobs should all look different and those should be the ones they spend time on.  And the items, hell a cool graphic is like an extra reward but they choose to not do that for some damned reason...</div></div><hr />

A man can dream...<br />
<br />
In general, I don't dislike the GoD/OoW models, a break from them could be nice though. Maybe one more expansion with them.<br />
<br />
Some more choices of actual armor looks would be nice too, like spiked shoulderguards with actual spikes for example (though of course with the current state of the game, shoulder is an invisible slot), or some better-looking helm graphics, etc. Something that looks more unique or at least slightly out of the ordinary. Dyes are not the culprit so much as a lack of differing graphics to choose from. There are only so many plate bp graphics, etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I too am no graphics whore, but there is a point where the game Depth does suffer from a sparcity of graphical (and other 'fluff')diversity.<br />
<br />
Change all PC and NPC races to rectangular solides of varying sizes (for the differing races) and denote them as race 00, 01, etc.  The male/female has no effect on gameplay and can be removed entirely.  Weapons/armor have no name, nor graphic and are simply item 00020204.  Have all mobs be &quot;NPC #XXXXXXXX&quot; and play the game entirely in greyscale texture covered (for depth purposes) wireframe (as the geometry does relate to game play).<br />
<br />
I doubt very seriously if the only mob model in the game was 'Orc' people would have played this game for five years to kill bigger and bigger orcs for items whose only differences to them are their statistical attributes and the then increased ability to kill the bigger Orc 1 zone over.<br />
<br />
I remember years ago going 'ooh, and ahh' in a plethora of zones.  Long, long ago I was scared shitless in MM.  A sensation that a mere bland tactical overhead wireframe display of the mobs that would kick my ass would never have reproduced.<br />
<br />
You frankly don't need a whole lot of 'all new' models for new experiences.  But the overal visual context should be such that it is compelling in experience.  This is clear by examining internally any eq era.  Take the breadth of Orig EQ and RoK dungeons.  Although sharing almost all models in those zones with other zones many of zones had a very unique feel to them.<br />
<br />
<br />
Perhaps the BIGGEST flaw I see in use of models in EQ is the recent AVERSION to reusing basic model types and thus having an expansion largely full of only a handful of new models, rather than the plethora of available ones.  This is perhaps largely a by-product of the 'alternate dimension' idea behind GoD and OoW.  What should have been done is to modify more existing models to become 'newish' and serve appropriate roles in the new content.<br />
<br />
Take any expansion and eliminate all EQ previously existing models from implementaion and rely almost entirely on the expansion specific models and you generally have a really crappy looking expansion because diversity of graphical experience suffers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>mac173</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I agree that using a greater diversity of models in the GoD and OoW zones would have made them more interesting. The new models they came up with are pretty good, just too many of the same ones. If they were more rare, they would stand out more as being unique. <br />
<br />
I would like to see more varied graphics for armor. I find it kind of depressing that when I get to level 70, I already know what I will look like. Every class has its top armor, and only one choice as top armor. Every level 70 SK looks alike, as well as every Cleric, Shaman, etc. Some variation, or ability to change teh look would be nice.</div></div><hr />
