Something you never really expect.  Your guild falls apart.  Now you have choicesd on what to do.  Usually, you try and join an on-par level/progression guild.  But issue is, they are all in wrong time zone.  You're PST they start EST.  Which would put you 1-2 hours late daily, not a big application booster.  There's a few (very few) in correct time zone.  But they aren't recruiting at all, any class.  <br />
<br />
There's one slightly ahead of your progression, but they require GoD, which you would rather chew off your own leg than set foot in.<br />
<br />
So that leaves taking a set back, which you don't really mind either.  Issue here, there are none in time zone.  Save one, that has what could be considered the misfits and asshats of the server.  Not exactly appealing.<br />
<br />
Or, retire from the raiding screen all together.<br />
<br />
So that's your choices. <br />
<br />
:confused: <br />
<br />
And to make this SK rant fitting... Shit, shit shit shit!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chayde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Okay, so  the guild is falling apart... what is the 'majority' of the guildies doing? Are they just quiting, or are they going to find a guild to join?<br />
<br />
When DoW on TM fell apart Most of the upper players joined a guild together. Then there were a few scattered throughout the other guilds, but as a majority they all went to the same guild.<br />
<br />
See what some of your other friends in the guild are doing. Who knows, they might join a guild slighty under where you were, and help raise them up to par.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zolexa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">About 15 'retired' from EQ outright, another 15 left for assorted guilds (various as described above), the remaining 'active' about 15 of us, are left wondering what to do.  The rest are the inactive, they likely just stay as is, turn a guild 2 kills from Time, into a retired hang out.  <br />
<br />
The leadership was included in the retired group, the remaining officers tried to keep it going, but after over a week with daily defections, and the last time we tried to raid had 21 online (including bots), they gave up too.<br />
<br />
Haven't been online today yet, stuck at work.  Just trying to figure out what the hell to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Daerkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">This happened to my guild on Veeshan a few weeks back. We had only recently reached Time and only killed Quarm once. Most of the guild went to either other high-end guilds on the server (many of whom have had a problem with retaining members and raid force as so many have gone casual or quit following the path of FoH). Others did server transfers to find guilds doing the same content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">What are your goals?<br />
<br />
Do you want to progress?<br />
<br />
Do you want to have fun?<br />
<br />
Remember that you're really just over one major zone (well A &amp; B) to being at the point that most SK's are complaining about.<br />
<br />
It sounds like you want to progress, but it also sounds like you want to just because that was what you were doing when interrupted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Derraj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">if you have trouble finding a guild, start one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Soulle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Or just quit and start playing a new game.  City of hero's is fun so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>nezzka is bad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">if there 1-2 hours ahead who the fuck cares, oh no i have to raid untill 11 instead of 9. FUCK YOU</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zolexa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hey asshat, learn your time zones.  <br />
<br />
THEY are AHEAD... meaning when it's 5:30 there and they start raiding, it's 2:30 HERE and I'm still at WORK.<br />
<br />
:rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>nezzka is bad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">who the fuck raids at 5!?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shyntlara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hey, it could be worse.<br />
<br />
You try raiding regularily when yer living in europe and the only european guild is a) too far ahead of you content wise and b) closed for recruitment anyway ^^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>DConquest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well Zolexa, as a former member of a Mith Marr Guild... first of all, sorry about Wisdom breaking up.  They were an extremely great group of people.  They would of held the record for fastest guild to Time from scratch if they would of stayed together ( on our server ).<br />
<br />
Secondly, don't believe everything you read.  Our Message boards are fueled by people that are just looking for drama and are bored at work.  Our server is thankfully blessed with great guilds, and they have no idea what a real &quot; asshole &quot; guild is.   If my former guild was 1/10 of what it's described to be I would of left it a LONG time ago.  <br />
<br />
Due to the fact that me and our Bard Mentor made up most of the tactics we used on raids, Primordial Fury, is a very good guild for SKs.   I was part of the guild since they started N ToV and had been Pulling / Tanking for them all the way into when I retired near the time they beat Xegony.  So SKs can really shine in that guild, since a lot of their tactics revolve around them.    <br />
<br />
From your Time zone situation though, Dark Bane is probably your best bet.  They are a CST guild and raid pretty late.  Descendents is an awesome bunch, though very hard to get into.   Well worth trying, if given the chance.  <br />
<br />
I hope this helps and good luck finding a good guild, it's really not too tough on our server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Zolexa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Heya Darc  (psst, check PM please)<br />
<br />
Actually, I was refering to a different guild than PF.  Didn't really look into them much, but last I looked they were closed too.<br />
<br />
Fuck if I know, need to decide what I want to do in EQ anymore.<br />
<br />
DB was my 1st choice.  But their not recruiting, at all.  Desc requires GoD, and I'm not interested in that, at least not right now.<br />
<br />
Guess, I really need to wait till tonight, see how many are still tagged by 'raid time' and go from there.  Who know, perhaps we have a shot still, just get damn frustrating watching another 1-3 people leave/quit/retire everyday.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I've had three guilds break up on me now.<br />
<br />
1) When i first started raiding, I joined a guild that was doing epics/kunark/some lower velious..... they lost every warrior they had and basically stopped raiding.<br />
<br />
2)Joined another guild, leader left within 3 days of me joining, bye bye guild.<br />
<br />
3) Joined a guild that was perfect for me, we were doing SSRA/Luclin/lower PoP and just getting into VT.... when outta nowhere a buncha officers basically said &quot;fuck it&quot; and left, and the leader just folded the guild.<br />
<br />
Now i'm back in my family guild, where I started, where i am now one of 2 lvl 65s, and one of about 6 lvl 60+'s. Do whatever you wanna do to have fun, and remember: the people around you contribute a lot to the fun you have, whether you're raiding or not, and fun is what this game is about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Oagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">PoP killed my guild.  The flagging requirements and the time sink for them just to get to tier 2 was the death, because not enough people would commit, and when it took too long, people just left.<br />
<br />
I shoulda left, but as an officer, I didn't want to bail.  Now, it's just me and about 10 others that play anymore, mostly officers.<br />
<br />
We can put together a decent Adventure group, though.  Otherwise, it's 2/3 boxing and dungeon crawling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>yuggoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Do you have friends in other guilds you might be interested in?  A guild that is 'not accepting applications' might well be open to someone that several members can vouch for.</div></div><hr />
