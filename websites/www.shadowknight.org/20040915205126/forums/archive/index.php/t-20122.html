<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Naaklum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">how much are the MQ's for these selling for atm?  i know it varies from server to server.  just curious.  thanx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm seeing 25k -35k pretty regularly on Zeb.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure which guild has been farming them though, as I was under the impression that the only guild still doing EPs regularly that already had all their members fully spelled was turning them in for Shaman spells to sell at inflated prices.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">seen fo 15-30k on my server.. Terris-Thule</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Naaklum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">so the 20k i'm seeing the actual spells selling for is fair then i spose.  ack =p</div></div><hr />

A friend of mine paid 50k + for each of his level 65 spells.<br />
<br />
They get raped, simply because they're a support class that is completely dependant upon their spells to be of any use.<br />
<br />
If you're a level 65 shaman and you only have your level 64 spells, you're a level 64 shaman...</div></div><hr />

That's because we have retards in surplus on our server.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can't see why anyone would pay 20k for either cloak or voice, unless they were drowning in plat. Voice is rarely asked for or needed, and on raids SoT/BSS &gt; CoL. The only time I generally use CoL is tanking in exp groups. And that isn't worth 20k, since there's usually a Pal/Bst/Rng around for their buffs.<br />
<br />
The spells worth spending for are ToI/AoH.<br />
<br />
BTW Groff, Runes drop like rain in elems. We've gotten literally dozens in a single 2 hour raid in Earth. I think the guilds just choose not to sell them despite having tons. (I think our guild is just hanging on to them for now for recruits but I really have no idea.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>ZilshasisEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I did it to have a full spellbook, I know it's not going to be used much, but thats just how I like my things :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Kyfe,<br />
<br />
You probably have a full spellbook now, but if you run across any runes (or the Shadowknight Spells from runes) that you don't need, let me know.  I've run myself out of much of a budget, but I'm willing to negotiate on a couple of them that I don't have and can't ever seem to find up.<br />
<br />
I still need CoL, AoH and VoThule.<br />
<br />
AoH is obviously highest priority, but I've been told by a bazaar combing friend that he's seen it up a few times for 35k;  I just can't ever catch the guy online with it when I happen to have the money together.<br />
<br />
CoL I'd like to have, but it's lower on the list, and VoThule I'm not concerned about at all.  Warrior aggro is fine now in most situations, and I haven't really been able to tell much difference with or without voice line after the Incite abilities went live.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kyfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I have ceased memming Voice because it eats a slot and the warriors never ask for it.<br />
<br />
Groff: I don't think I personally have any runes, everyone in my guild now has a full spellbook I'm sure (after every raid I get an officer tell &quot;Do you need any 65 spells?&quot; haha). I'll see what I can do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Verlag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I was able to purchase 2 rune MQ's in the Bazaar last night for 28k, and recieved the CLoak of Luclin and AoH on the turn in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I had a EP friend MQ 3 runes for me.... all three of them turned out to be ToI..... is this usual? or am i just getting a royal fuckjob?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kyfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">ToI is the best spell. Just trade it for what you need, or sell it and buy what you need. A fuckjob would be if you got 3 x Voice.</div></div><hr />
