<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xygoz Shadowreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay the other day i went on an Aerin'Dar raid in PoV but afterwards when went through the back entrance to get into HoH, it said i need to prove something about justice. I assume this means doing the PoJ trials. So i went to go get my AA from the guy in PoK but he won't give it to me since i didn't necessarily finish the flagging since i didnt do the PoJ trials, my question is when i do the trials will i get 2 AAs, one for trials and one for AD, or just 1 AA?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Menon Lifeblight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You receive two types of messages when completing a flagging event:<br />
<br />
You have received a character flag!<br />
<br />
This is the good one, meaning your stuff is in order and you have completing all the pre-flagging.<br />
<br />
You have received a checklist flag!<br />
<br />
This means you haven't done all the pre-flagging, and you don't really have the flag yet.  You need to go back and fulfill your requirements, and then unlock memories to get the full effect.<br />
<br />
Without PoJ trials, AD will give you a checklist flag.  So once you do the trials, you'll get an AA.  Then you can unlock memories to get the HoH flag from your AD kill, and you'll get another AA.</div></div><hr />
