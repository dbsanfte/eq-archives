<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wyrdlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'd give my left nut for it.  That said, while I'm all about the bigger HT, it seems to me that the focus is actually weaker than the focus on 1.5, since 1.5 works on all lifetaps, and 2.0 appears to only work on HT/Leech Touch and POSSIBLY combat innates.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rueeliar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The 2.0 appears to be what alot of people have been wanting.  In all honesty, I am disappointed by the AC value on it, and a little by the ratio.  Bonecleaver is a 2.25 ratio, versus a 2.54 (2.56 with the Disease damage).<br />
<br />
However, a reduction in the recast timer of the clicky makes me quite happy, even if it can still be resisted.  Spending 20 percent of my time in combat tapping damage back from melee (as is the rest of my group) is a rather significant impact.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wyrdlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">window,  why is it dumb to thing a focus on all lifetaps is better than a focus on HT?<br />

You typically use numbers, those would be good here.</div></div><hr />

Anyway, I'll be uncharacteristically nice and explain things to you. &quot;Duration: Instant&quot; doesn't mean things that cast instantly. It means things that hit instantly, IE nukes/lifetaps (anything that doesn't have a buff icon, more or less).<br />
<br />
In ending, 1) Use search, 2) Don't be stupid, or 3) Give yourself a lobotomy but accidently take out the entire thing, not that it would make much of a difference.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Khat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">After misinterpreting a Target field, it looks like only Lifetaps are affected by the 2.0 Focus: :-/<br />
<br />
Lifetap<br />
Lifedraw<br />
Siphon Life<br />
Drain Soul<br />
Lifespike<br />
Spirit Tap<br />
Drain Spirit<br />
Life Leech<br />
Touch of Volatis<br />
Touch of Innoruuk<br />
Touch of Inruku<br />
Touch of the Devourer<br />
<br />
<br />
The only difference between the focus of the two is 2.0 is increased by 5%. (40% instead of 35%)<br />
<br />
ADD:  Had a chart to post but HTML seems turned off in this particular section.<br />
Off Topic:<br />
With a chance at a 40% increase, what else would effect an exceptional/crit of TotD?  base+focus*SCF III*ToL=3,808?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Lifetaps only, uh-huh uh-huh.</div></div><hr />

edit - it has no limits to which of your DDs that is.</div></div><hr />

As I said its ass.  IMHO, They should have just made it snow bunny slippers, with the same leech click effect, and +1000 kick bane damage to snow bunny.  Would have been MUCH more usefull. Aside from not being able to kick , that is.<br />
<br />
but in reality, once you get 2.0 and Equip it, your toon should grow a huge bulge, and a script should activate and anounce serverwide , that you know have a huge e-penis, and everyone should bow to your mighty e-power.<br />
Then you should be booted to char selection with the graphics from when you win a game of solitare in windows .. u know the one with the cheesy firworks &quot;congratulations you win EQ&quot;.. and then .. your char should poof, and you should quit playing because you have now got the bigest e-penix and thus have won EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Khat, I calculated 3264 for max heal off a tap.  I think the order of operations is:<br />
<br />
(1.4 + 1) * base * ToL.  Spell crits only affect base damage, not focused damage.... so it's not focus * base * 2, it's (focus * base) + base, then heal crits are applied.  Max tap for epic 1.5 would be 3196.  So it's a pretty small difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Neherenia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Actually spell focus do effect spell crits.  I would get 1k crits frequently from ToI and 2k cits from Scythe of Innoruuk, which would not be possible with only base damage.<br />
<br />
Still was hoping for 100 base damage on the 2.0, more for pride of the SK class then a realistic chance of getting it lol.</div></div><hr />

<br />
no. josahd is correct, focus does not get added to crit, they do not stack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Chania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Here's a question: Do you have to be up to date with the Lhranc pieces (ie Lhranc's Pendant, etc) to be allowed to loot the Discordant Globe? Or can you loot the Globe out of order?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">focus is still applied when you crit, it's just applied to the base damage portion only.  it's not base * 2 * focus, it's (base * focus) + base... or (focus + 1) * base after factoring.<br />
<br />
Assuming you're using ID4 and Touch of Inny:<br />
No focused, max touch of inny would be 940.<br />
With focus, max touch of inny is (2.2) * 470 = 1034.<br />
<br />
If focus was applied after the crit, it would be 2 * 470 * 1.2 = 1128, which you'll never see.<br />
<br />
It basically results in focus being half as effective on spell crits than on non-crits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kelv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">For whatever an opinion is worth, if they wanted to keep it within the powerlevel that epic 2 represents, I would say a full 40% detrimental DDs focus should be on it, instead of lifetap restricted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>BludrainHalovex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Your all missing the point... The effects may be irrelevant, but put a 5dmg aug on it and you got yourself a 100dmg weapon you can slap for as close to 1k as your ever gonna get.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Just like with all of the epics, the 2.0 is the same graphic as the 1.5, but the 2.0 has the particle effects.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Give it another 2 years. If EQ is still around there will be a couple more expansions, and weapons like 200 DMG / 20 Delay.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I already break 1k with a 74 dmg weapon, have done crits as high as 1150dmg, thats with VW2, a pally in guild with same weapon does 1200+ with VW3.<br />
<br />
would speculate 2.0 could do 1600ish crits.<br />
