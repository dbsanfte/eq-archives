<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Pipsqueak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">How come no one wants to be an evil little gnome, slaying far bigger and taller enemies. Ya I know they are not as intimidating as a troll or ogre but I like to play the far less common race/class combos, I guess I just dont like fallin in with the masses.<br />
<br />
So What are some reasons no one mentions the gnomes as SK's?<br />
Heck their stats are better or just as good as humans and erudites, thx for info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Because all Gnomes are dirty filthy twinks, who, by their nature, are inferior to all other races.<br />
<br />
If you start a gnome, you have to be funny or useful to make up for your innate racial inferiority.<br />
<br />
If you start an Ogre or Roodie or DE, you don't have to be useful at all, and can just go on your merry moronic way.<br />
<br />
If you start a Troll, you're as close to God-head as you can get and still retain your sex appeal.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Pipsqueak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">LOL you guys are nuts, and hey I love trolls too, got a troll bst and warrior above 55 but wanted to be different on SK, did a search /who all gnome shadowknight, what came up? in prime time no less?? ONE, and it was a lvl 1 in bazaar mule!!<br />
Plus yes I like to crack jokes while in battle, and yes usually about my own size etc so seems like a good fit, and original one.<br />
And like I said got better stats then human, erudite, lizzy, DE or as good anyway so shouldnt hurt much, right?</div></div><hr />

<br />
About a year later my sk was 65 with 160 aa and I retired him.  Tried to walk away from the game and made it for about a month.<br />
<br />
Came back into game and started my gnome.  Four months later...bam...I'm one of two 65 Gnome shadowknights on my server.<br />

GNOMERCY.<br />
<br />
There was something in the post above that was interesting.  I think people that play gnomes do have to be a bit crazy, quarky or just have something about them different.  I play my gnome as crazy as I can.  Cracking jokes, biting ankles etc etc.  Gnomes have always been my favorite race.  I dont think that will ever change.</div></div><hr />

It would seem a whole lot of people have made a gnome SK, and their reasoning is &quot;I just wanted to be different&quot;  It's not different if that is what everyone is doing.<br />

Everytime I run a toon to Akanon, there is always 2+ SK gnome newbies running around.  Everyone wants to be different in the same way, it's funny.</div></div><hr />

I would like to know where in my post I state that *I* liked to be different. So my race wouldn't matter.  Did I hurt your feelings when I said everyone who plays a gnome, does it for the same reason &quot;to be different&quot;? <br />
<br />
To defend why I play a dark elf, is the fact that I find ogre models utterly disgusting, my husbands SK is a lizard, and I didn't want to infringe on his creation.  I have a gnome toon already and didn't need another. And I also have a troll SK.  Chayde is the SK that I play in groups, and the troll is the one I play when I need time away from the assholes.<br />
<br />
But, this wasn't about me, this was about you getting all worked up because there is no &lt;3 for gnomes, and you had to start another post pointing out that fact.  I know, as good friends, two SK gnomes at high end game. I don't know any human SKs. So, like I already stated, I didn't think gnomes were the minority, I think humans are.<br />
<br />
Now, there was no need for the flame of mangina, you don't know me, nor do I care for you too. As far as I am concerned you can crawl back to that piss infected, shit stained, cock you been sucking all these years, and leave the SK class to people who aren't gay enough to name their toons Pipsqueak.<br />
<br />
Now, go unruffle your panties, take a deep breath, and try again.</div></div><hr />

Fuk Gnomes Dude!<br />
Dude gnomes suck and I eat them.<br />
(have we bonded yet?)<br />
<br />
The only real thing I'm tired of is the same old joke over and over..<br />
Where's the beef?<br />
I've fallen and I can't get up!<br />
Heh, he eating gnomes....<br />
If all the world were SK board members I'd have a career as a comedian.<br />
<br />
Well, one thing is for sure, gnome SK’s are the best at getting agro.<br />
<br />
<br />
In any case the real question here is….<br />
Which of the following is the worst?<br />
<br />
1) People who think they are sooo original by playing gnome SKs.<br />
2) The same stupid gnome jokes over and over on sigs etc...<br />
3) People who play DE SK’s and claim to not to be in it for the glam… well how many bald DE females have you seen recently?? At least dye your hair something other than white!<br />
4) The fact the term “Mangina” runs rampant while “Shenis” has yet to be coined.<br />
5) Why you still giggle at a spell called “Tiny Companion” after all these years.<br />
6) Insert beer filled, testosterone fueled expletive plenty rebuttal here.<br />
7) The small amount of people who actually get the “Fippy Darkpaw” word jumble joke. <br />
<br />
In any case I officially end the whole stupid gnome SK hullabaloo unless:<br />
A) Anyone can come up with a funny original gnome joke <br />
B) Buys us all the next round.<br />
C) Becomes my slave on tribunal (sorry no Tiny Companions allowed)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Gnomes are tiny fuckbags, just looking at them makes me want to kill myself. Gnomes are second only to asslings on my hate list... I think the better question is why in the HELL would you want to be a stupid fat pot bellied ugly weak old man? Gnomes piss me off, all the small races do (cept dwarves).<br />
<br />
And as for why humans are the least played shadowknights, Its because they are the fattest, ugliest motherfuckers in the game. Sony really fucked them over with the luclin models. There stats suck too and they have no night vision. Although on my server Erudites are the least played, which is obviously because of that huge ugly fucking forehead. Im shocked and appaulled every time I read a post saying how cool Erudites look in plate or how good humans look. What the fuck is wrong with you people?</div></div><hr />
