<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Oagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Love the spell....<br />
<br />
Hate the fact that it wears off before it can be recasted.  I'd like to see SoE tweak that a bit so it refreshes about the same time as it wears off, like Aura of Pain seems to do.  With Ferine Avatar and Aura of Hate, my ATK is Fantastic, but I find myself going back to the 55 spell, since it lasts for six minutes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Synapticus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I agree.  This is quite irritating.  I dont mind the degenerating nature of the buff, but the duration is way too short.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kuvak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">/agree</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It gives a good amount of net atk, also lets you play with timing and stuff more for things like melees discing at the same times.  Actually like it in its current state.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Furor Planedefiler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">And has stacking issues. <br />
<br />
What I'd rather see is a spell the Shadowknight casts that siphons attack from his group and adds it to his own. Take three guesses the kind of groups that would be good for. <br />
<br />
So, the SK siphons 20 attack from each group member for a nice raw 100 attack, duration... 4 minutes.<br />
<br />
Aura of Hate is a decent spell, it just becomes a waste of a slot if your group composition isn't melee heavy and totally useless if a Beastlord is in your ranks. <br />
<br />
And the number ONE pet peeve of that spell is the DD component is crap. For a spell with a minute+ recast, 100 damage is insulting.<br />
<br />
It should have been a 3-500 point DD, a 50 point attack boost that stacked with EVERYTHING including Ferocity with a 1:30 recast, 60 second duration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ferocity can only be kept on a couple people.  We don't have all that many of them, actually in most raids we have zero, so I get quite a bit of use out of it.  The dd used to be 200, got nerfed for some stupid reason when it was changed to a group spell.  Efficency wise its better than most other damage spells we have even if we're the only one in the group meleeing.  50 atk+500dd with that duration/recast would have been more insulting, take a look at Torrent of Hate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Atlis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm just confused why we can't click Aura of Hate and Aura of Pain recourses off.  I cast AoP in raids to drop a mobs AC by 120 to make the 30 melee's that much happier, but I'd like to be able to click that buff off, just like I can click off the buff-happy Shamans who cast Acumen every 6 minutes on my Ogre eyes.  Similarly, casters who have Bo9, C5, SD and BoR don't have the buff slots open for Aura of Hate, and get mad at me when I take up their HoT buff slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>synnoira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm less irritated by the duration than the recourse not being click offable and it not stacking with ferocity, since both result in bitching. On the other hand it's certainly popular with other melee who like the gaudy atk numbers. A bigger nuke wouldn't do any harm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Lejina Bloodbath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Atlis, AoP doesnt debuff the mobs AC.<br />
Its only a dd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Atlis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">oh no...well then, i guess i'll pull that one off my list.  guess i'll start paying attention to my spells now and rework my lineups, in case i screwed up other places.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Once in a great while I would also like to be able to click the buffs off, they were able to fix torrents for this (after a long long time) so I dont see why not the auras.<br />
<br />
I would also love to see the duration be the same as Aura of Pain and the DD bumped back up to equal AoP as well.</div></div><hr />
