<br />
I'm aware that Run3 is at 30% while Jboot is at 35%..<br />
<br />
I just accidently put jboot into forge and tried to get it back and it just poofed and I, nolonger, have Jboot and GM refused to reimburse me. <br />
<br />
I had Jboot for long time and had developed habit of having it clicked all the time whenever I can. I got run3 but my habit is die hard with Jboot. Now, I nolonger have it and I realized that I can live without Jboot for good and I would get horse soon in few months or so that Jboot would become a waste of general inventory that can be used for bag or other things. <br />
<br />
My question is for you is.. <br />
1. Do you still carry Jboot full time even with Run3 skill but no horse?<br />
2. Do you still carry Jboot full time even with run3 and unholy steed<br />
3. Do you just bank or destroy Jboot once you get Run3?<br />
4. Do you just bank or destroy Jboot once you get run3 and steed?<br />
<br />
Why? :)</div></div><hr />

Otherwise there's little noticable difference between them and run3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pajita</div><div class="date">03-29-2002, 10:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, the fact that run3 works indoors make jboots obsolete once you get it... when you get your steed, it's basically enhanced jboots.  The only use I could think of would be, like Shwa said, as an insta-click crap buff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Simu</div><div class="date">03-29-2002, 10:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since Run3 don't need a buff slot... Since Run3 is ALWAYS active... 5 miserable percent of pace difference. What could I tell you more ? <br />
<br />
Ah, <br />
Stop smithing, you'll kill yourself once you'll do it with you Circlet *grin*</div></div><hr />

<br />
Guess what? I opened Forge and a bag and put circlet and jboot from general inventory into forge instead of bag assuming that forge was a bag doh. I suddenly realized and took circlet out of it and tried to take jboot out and it poofed cuz of no drop. I was kinda upset about jboot but now I am not cuz I finally get out of bad habit. :) I was extremely glad that circlet is intact. I would be extremely upset to lose circlet than jboot.  I'll be more careful next time! :)</div></div><hr />

As Shwa states, they are critical for the Cazic fight.  They're also really good crap buffs for Klandicar and Sontalak, not to mention all of the other dragons in WW.  They come in handy in VP too.<br />
<br />
Run 3 is invaluable indoors.  I suggest you put your first 3 points into it, if you haven't already.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lzert</div><div class="date">03-29-2002, 12:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I banked mine the day I got Run3.  Haven't needed since.  In fact, I've found them very annoying to use on my wizard since, who doesn't yet have run3 :)  Can't wait to bank them on him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dracsoul</div><div class="date">03-29-2002, 01:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just got Run 3, it's very nice. I banked my Jboots, could not bring my self to distroy them.<br />
<br />
For the junk buff out door's they are nice but I use my 8th ring, works inside and out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rabdos</div><div class="date">03-29-2002, 01:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, you guys that have run3 are banking your jboots instead of destroying them? Just can't bring yourself to get rid of them after having them around so long?<br />
<br />
I've still got my *short sword and black training tunic in the bank. One of these days they're going to come out with a quest that needs it, and I'll be all set.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dracsoul</div><div class="date">03-29-2002, 01:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fear me tracking down a guy who I sold my Green Jade Halberd to 4 months ago and paying more than I sold it to him just to have my old wepon in the bank.<br />
<br />
I'm sappy that way. I also went and killed the merchant that I acedently sold my Dark Reaver to!!</div></div><hr />

For someone who have run3 but no boots, its absolutely not worth the time/money to try to get em.<br />
<br />
I use em for CT and Klandicar too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brael</div><div class="date">03-29-2002, 10:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would keep them, i hold onto mine... its an instant click item, even indoors its useful</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nasiir</div><div class="date">03-29-2002, 11:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm on a PvP server, so having a clickable is more important than on blues, but even though I have run3, I always use the jboots when I can. It is just nice when I'm indoors and jboot effect wears off, I barely notice a decrease in my run speed. However, when I am running low on buff slots I don't bother with jboots.</div></div><hr />
