As an evil, I feel that Neriak is a good choice, for both rp reasons, and banking reasons on the &quot;east coast.&quot;<br />
<br />
I know there are some techniques for getting faction in Neriak, like the red wine quest, but I am looking for some real experience you have had with Neriak faction.<br />
<br />
This is what I think I know =) There is dread guards outer, dread guards inner, the dead, and merchants factions.<br />
<br />
Are there any others I need to know about? Is there anyway else to get faction but the wolform trick? I don't really have a druid friend.<br />
<br />
Any advice on who to kill and how often would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

That's all you really need and both are easy.<br />

Paineel - see the information in the Hunting Grounds section of this site<br />
<br />
North Freeport - Take a swing at Lucan when someone is doing the pally quest.  You can raise bards to dubious in one night of hunting in Mistmoore is you are worried about them in N Fport as well.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zobek</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 12:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Neriak factions include:<br />
The Dead: Kill the 29 High Elf Chanter in Najena around 30 times (6 minute timer) and you should be Amiable to The Dead and can train there.<br />
Clerics of Innorruuk: Iksar are KoS to them.  Only way I have seen, other than doing their guild quests, is to turn in the 4 staves for the Blued 2-handed hammer quest.<br />
Indigo Brotherhood: Warriors... no need to raise, easy to avoid.<br />
Hall of the Ebon Mask: Rogues.. see warrior<br />
The Spurned: Non-necro casters.  I beleive you start out dubious as an Iksar SK.<br />
Dread Guard Outer: Nektulos Guards.  Halflings in Nektulos, &amp;  Red Wine.<br />
Dread Guard Inner: Neriak city guards.  Red Wine (480 bottles should do it)<br />
Troll and Ogre side: Never been on that side as an Iksar.<br />
<br />
There is a guard in NFQ near Smacka (Ogre merchant for IC quest) that is on Cleric faction, but green at 39 and did not attack.  There is another in 3rd Gate at the pool of water past the Cleric guild (wanders to the 2 guards you pass to get to the Library) that is also on Cleric faction, that did attack me at 39.  I forgot to invis, heh.<br />
<br />
Wolf form to do the red wine won't work as it is indoors.<br />
For the Red Wine, you need to be Indifferent to Lokar To'Biath.  If you aren't, I was as I recall from just being evil, pay a lowbie chanter (level 4) to invis you for the 1st few trades.  Or have a guildie/friend do it.<br />
<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
Another place to bank is in Runny Eye near the well on the bottom floor.<br />
<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
Paineel took a ton of kobolds, and once to indifferent, you turn in the Kobold Molars to get to amiable, took around 30-40 molars.   This will allow you to get a key from the guards, and train here.<br />
<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
Halflings, if you want to bother with it...<br />
give the halfling in Misty Thicket 4 stacks of 4 bandages, will need someone to invis you.  Turn in around 1k bandages.<br />
You will still be KoS to the clerics, but you can bank easy, and avoid those.  Not sure where they put the halfling Pally guild though.<br />
<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
Qeynos Blood Sabres:<br />
Kill the kolindil (sp?) fish in the pool under the UFO. There are 2 and they are a 6 minute timer, I think.  This will make you non-kos to the Bloodsabres and alllow you to get to the evil banker in the sewers without getting attacked.   Not sure how many to kill, I haven't done this yet but need to for the IC.<br />
<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
That should do it for banking.  Any other you want to know about, just ask.<br />

<br />
You can buy anything you need in WFP and EFP, and if you want to bank you can just invis up and move into the backroom with the bankers. Guards won't see you back there.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
I suppose I need to byob (sorry I couldn't resist) to get started. <br />
first step is to con Lokar To'Biath.  If he is indifferent, just give him 4 sets of 4 red wine until you are dubious to the Dread Guard Inner.<br />
<br />
If you are less than indifferent (Lokar is around 15th level, so won't attack you), group with a level 4 chanter or someone that can invis you.  Put the first set of 4 wine in the trade window.  Have the caster invis you.  While he is doing that, put the other 3 stacks of 4 into the trade window. Once you see the &quot;Utterance vanishes.&quot; message, hit trade.<br />
<br />
Con him again without invis.  You should be indifferent, but if not one more turn in of 4 stacks of 4 should be enough.<br />

In order to do this you would need to attack him to get his arse out of the wall, FD and then try to get behind him.  This only will help those classes able to sneak, not SKs. :)<br />

<br />
1.  Forget N. freeport..we start off scowling and it simply is not worth it.<br />
<br />
2.  Neriak takes less than 30 min.  Take one stack of red wine to the dark elf.  For the first turn in you will need to be invis.  You CAN NOT use the Circlet of Shadow to do this, but you can use the 'Hide' hotkey to do this however it takes practice.  If you have someone to invis you , then do this.. 1. Put 4 red wines in each of the 4 slots.  2. Have someone invis you.  3. Hit trade.  This will take you to indiff so you can do the rest yourself.  DO NOT put a stack of 20 in each of the slots..you will only be wasting wine.<br />
<br />
3.  Paineel can be done in less than 30 min.  Go to Eurudine and kill Paladine guards there.  You will get huge heretic hits from these guys.  You can do the Warrens as well, but it takes way too long.<br />
<br />
4.  It is impossible to get OT faction because we start off scowling and you need dubious or better to hand in sarnack braids.<br />
<br />
5.  Quenos Aquaducts is a good one and easy as hell to get.  Go to the pond area near the paladins in N.Quenos(I think), there is a pond with 3 fish and some UFO thing hovering above.  Kill the fish and the low lvl paladin , 'Erik something'.  A few round of fish and the paladin will get you to amiable in no time.<br />
<br />
This is pretty much all we have pre-velious.  The Paineel and the Quenos we need anyway to work on epic.  Good Luck<br />

<br />
Have the 'Hide' button hotkey'd.  With the item on the curser click the item on the NPC, a split second (almost simoltaneously) after you do this hit the 'Hide' hotkey.  If you did it right the item should be in the trade window and the 'Hide' hotkey should be depressed(grayed out).  Now to check if you are indifferent, just hit the 'c' button, and that will con the NPC.  IF he cons indiff, then hit trade.  You can do this as many times as needed.<br />

Enter front archway, turn left, and on the main floor, is the door on the left.  Lokar To'Biath will be in the far corner, half stuck in a wall, facing the door.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jobrill</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 09:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I tend to agree that, unless you're REALLY concerned about RPing, NFP and Paineel are the only two places you need to worry about. Within 2 Lucan raids, My Iksar Monk friend was max with Clerics of Marr and Knights of Truth. He never did hunt in Mistmoore to raise bards that I know of, Always just dodged em. So I'd suggest see if you can find a Lucan raid, and offer to help, or just throw a quick siphon strength or shoot an arrow at him as the raid progresses. Then just Invis up through E or WFP, or use the sewers... As a Bard I sometimes didn't even invis, just used Selos to outrun all the guards straight into NFP :p<br />
<br />
If you want to buy and sell in NFP, there's always the Paladin/Cleric merchants in the Temple once you have your faction from Lucan, or I'll plug my favorite quest, the rogue note quest, which'll get you sellable with almost every non-guild merchant in Freeport without any negative faction hit.<br />
<br />
I'd also say Kobolds are more than enough to get Paineel faction especially since some are low as level 5, so you can mass slaughter, but if yer real impatient, I understand there's a couple soloable Paladin guards, Including one that paths to the top of the library (Everyone else there is a Merchant, so they shouldn't assist him), and a couple by the docks. This isn't from personal experience tho, so my info may be off.<br />
<br />
Neriak is doable tho, and some people have given better guides above, so that's cool there....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KaeruWak</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 09:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One option that wasnt mentioned is the &quot;concordance of research&quot; quests in So Ro for evils.  Hand in a greater light stone to get the book needed to practice research (sells back for 7-8pp FYI, and also makes a nice low weight giant-size pack).  This gives Dread Guard Inner/Outer and dark barginers.  <br />
Pros - Less risky then getting into neriak, can be done with lighties around (they're just merchants, no normal NPC's), I believe wolf form ups faction with these smurf jokers, and you actually make money doing it<br />
Cons - GLS's are dropped and player sold only.  This was a great money maker pre-kunark when GLS's were comonly sold and bought. <br />
 I did this with a Troll as I leveled up through the low teens fighting willowisps in WC, and buying up all the GLS's I could.  Upped from dubee to amiable pretty quick (maybe 20 or so GLS's).  I believe you can also turn in normal Lightstones.<br />

 what do iksar sk's do for the qeynos part of epic <br />
The Qeynos part of the Epic involves raising Bloodsaber faction.  The NPC we talk to is in the Bloodsabre area surrounded by them.  He isn't on their faction, but getting to him is the rough part.<br />
<br />
There are a couple of ways to up their faction. One is to kill Kolindil(sp?) fish in the pool of water under the UFO in North Qeynos. There are 2 and they spawn every 6 minutes.<br />
<br />
The other option is to kill the low level pally? in WK near the entry to Qeynos Hills.  Don't remember the name though.<br />
<br />
For both of these, I don't know how many it will take to do it.<br />
<br />
Oh, and when you FD, you cannot turn in items to NPCs.  You can bank though as that is a Right Click type motion.  I tried to FD turn in bandages to the Halfling in Misty, but ended up with my wife invising me.  Only turned in around 60 bandages before I sadi forget it and went back to leveling.<br />

I do recomend you kill paladins in Eurudine for paineel faction if they are not too tough, its much , much faster.<br />
<br />
Also, the part of the epic that takes place in Quenos is the Decrepid Sheath.  You need Bloodsabre faction so that the sk's down there wont kill you when you turn in the items (decrepid Hide, Drake Spine, Enchanted Plat Bar) to Teydar.  Raising Quenos faction is very easy, and you get to kill paladins in order to raise it..what can be more fun :)<br />

<br />
i did this with both my Gnome SK and DE Warrior and used two backpacks each and i was amiable as SK and warmly as Warrior.  you might do three backpacks since you are both an evil race and an SK.  you will still be KoS to the cleric guild near Kithicore and that cleric Thkeela Meepup will tear you apart.  the druid faction goes up a little slower, so Ella Foodcrafter is a good thing to test faction against since if you aren't safe around her, you won't wanna be running between the ring and RV.<br />
<br />
also, handing in bandages (unstacked!) from backpacks is easier in the original EQ interface because completing the trade doesn't take you out of inventory mode.<br />

<br />
Anyway, for those who wonder about Neriak faction, Lothar was indifferent when I went there with my Iksar SK.  I do not recall doing any faction work to get him to indifferent, so it is possible that at some point they changed his faction so he is indifferent to everyone, I dunno.  I got my two bags of red wine, invised until I got into his room, dropped invis, and started handing in wine.  This was when you could still turn in 4 stacks of 4 each, now I think you need to do it 4 at a time instead of 16, bleh. :p<br />
<br />
After two bags full of wine, I was ally to merchants, dubious to dreadguard inner, and amiable to dreadguard outer (thanks to faction work, I slaughtered halflings for a while in Nek Forest beforehand, they only give faction for DG outer).  Didn't bother with the other factions, don't need then in order to buy/sell/bank in Neriak.<br />

Then again, since PoP I haven't set foot in Neriak.  And no idea how the trolls will affect anything, if they are close enough to the bank or merchants to cause a problem for an Iksar.</div></div><hr />

If you really want to go a step further I maxxed out my paineel faction in one night in the warrens but that was for epic so its really up to you.</div></div><hr />

Go to Blackburrow and kill Scout Malityn a few times. He gives HUGE faction hits. + Bloodsabers but - all other Qeynos factions. You'll get ally to Bloodsabers and max KoS with everyone else within a couple kills.<br />
<br />
Oh and he's around level 10 I think. Has high AC however, so don't be suprised if you have to darkness him to keep him from running. I couldn't kill him before he did.</div></div><hr />
