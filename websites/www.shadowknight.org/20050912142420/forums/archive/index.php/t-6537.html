<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nekrosis</div><div class="date">10-07-2002, 11:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi.  I was going to create a shadowknight and was wondering if dark elves make good shadowknights.  From what I see, shadowknights are 3/4 tanks and 1/4 casters.  I know that dark elves have high INT which covers the caster part but do they have the capability of being that 3/4 tank as well.  I was playing a human SK but for some reason they dont look as menacing as I hope they would.  Hope someone can help me with this question.</div></div><hr />
