Sony Online Entertainment and Gamania Digital Entertainment Announce Asia Pacific Strategic Alliance  <br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
 <br />
05:00 ET   Pacific Strategic Alliance<br />
<br />
 - Historic international collaboration in online gaming to redefine the Asia<br />
              Pacific MMO market with launch of EverQuest(R) II-<br />
<br />
    TAIPEI, Taiwan, July 23 /PRNewswire/ -- Gamania Digital Entertainment Inc.<br />
(Gamania), a pan-Asia industry-leading publisher and developer of online<br />
interactive entertainment content, and Sony Online Entertainment Inc. (SOE), a<br />
worldwide leader in massively multiplayer online (MMO) gaming, today announced<br />
what is potentially the largest global strategic alliance in the history of<br />
online gaming.  The alliance of Gamania and SOE will include four primary<br />
undertakings: establishing a joint venture, Asia Pacific products operation,<br />
core technology transfer, and potential investment in China.  This<br />
international collaboration of industry leaders will further solidify<br />
Gamania's leading position in the pan-Asian market, as well as satisfying<br />
SOE's global strategic planning, all together bringing a new level of<br />
influential elements to the global online gaming market.<br />
    The initial task of the strategic alliance will be to assist in the launch<br />
and operation of the culturalized EverQuest(R) II (EQII) in China, Taiwan,<br />
Hong Kong, Korea, as well as Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and the<br />
Philippines to support Gamania as the publishing and operational licensee for<br />
EQII in the aforementioned territories.<br />
    Additionally, SOE is pleased to announce the formation of a new<br />
subsidiary, SOE Asia Licensing Inc.  SOE Asia will have a branch office in<br />
Taiwan and will act as the investor in the new joint venture.<br />
    &quot;Sony Online Entertainment has been a great partner for EverQuest in the<br />
Taiwan and Hong Kong market.  We are excited to take the partnership one step<br />
further with this strategic alliance.  Not only will our two companies work<br />
together to culturalize EverQuest II for the pan-Asian market, but also to<br />
develop new and exciting titles for the global market. &quot; said Albert Liu,<br />
chief executive officer, Gamania.  &quot;By combining our pan-Asian operational<br />
capability, sophisticated community management skill through an industry<br />
leading data center and our proprietary GASH platform with SOE's excellent<br />
development technology and content, we strongly believe EverQuest II will be<br />
the first of many influential titles to bring tremendous impact on the online<br />
gaming communities across Asia.&quot;<br />
    &quot;Asia is becoming a huge focus for online games and online gaming<br />
companies across the globe,&quot; said John Smedley, President of Sony Online<br />
Entertainment.  &quot;The future of Sony Online involves having a significant<br />
presence in Asia, which is not something we could do as quickly without a<br />
partner who has the knowledge and abilities to help us bring our games into<br />
these diverse markets.  SOE believes there is a real opportunity to attract a<br />
large number of new subscribers by working with local partners to specifically<br />
engineer our games to address the needs of players throughout Asia.  We feel<br />
that Gamania is the right partner to combine forces with in order to make this<br />
happen.&quot;<br />
    The strategic alliance between Gamania and SOE will contain four primary<br />
business goals.<br />
<br />
    1.  Establish joint venture<br />
        The partnership between Gamania and SOE will be in the form of a joint<br />
        venture company (JV) located in Taiwan.  The JV will act as a pivot<br />
        point for Gamania and SOE to perform strategic operations in the pan-<br />
        Asian territories.  The JV will focus on game production rather then<br />
        operation, where game development talents are gathered from SOE and<br />
        Gamania to staff this collaboration entity.  JV will focus on three<br />
        major tasks:<br />
        i)  production on EQeast: a successful EQII launch in Asia will take<br />
            more then simply translating the gaming text to each territory's<br />
            respective languages.  Instead, the JV will &quot;culturalize&quot; EQII in<br />
            order to maximize the game's appeal forthe ever growing MMO<br />
            player base in Asia Pacific regions.  Project EQeast will be the<br />
            result of this culturalization process where a greater &quot;Asian&quot;<br />
            feel will be brought to the western counterpart of EQII, which may<br />
            include (and not be limited to): redesign of some character<br />
            models, translating and re-recording the game's voice-over,<br />
            adjustments to the game's controls and user interface, and other<br />
            changes to make the game more readily accessible to Asian<br />
            audiences.  Modification to the back-end system for online<br />
            customer management will also be considered to cater to each<br />
            locale's servicing requirements.<br />
       ii)  EQeast expansions: through the JV, SOE and Gamania intend to<br />
            develop and launch Asia-targeted expansion packs for EQeast. This<br />
            co-production is the first of its kind to fully realize the idea<br />
            of making one title globally accessible through specific cultural<br />
            adaptations.<br />
      iii)  New productions: by combining development skills with the<br />
            knowledge of market preferences, the JV will engage in new game<br />
            development. This will diversify the product line for both SOE and<br />
            Gamania and through cultural integration, produce innovative<br />
            titles with unique style.  This joint venture will further<br />
            strengthen both Gamania's position as a leader in digital<br />
            entertainment throughout Asia and SOE's global leadership in<br />
            online gaming.<br />
<br />
    2.  Asia Pacific products operation<br />
        EQeast, as well as its expansion packs developed by JV, will be<br />
        licensed to Gamania for publishing and operating rights in the<br />
        territories of Taiwan, Hong Kong (Traditional Chinese), China<br />
        (Simplified Chinese), Korea, as well as Thailand, Malaysia,<br />
        Singapore, Indonesia and the Philippines (English).  And beginning<br />
September 1st, 2004, Gamania Japan has obtained the rights to host the<br />
        service for, promote and provide its proprietary GASH system as the<br />
        primary billing platform for the Japanese version of EverQuest.  For<br />
        the JV's newly developed online gaming titles and certain other titles<br />
        developed by SOE that have yet be introduced to the Asia Pacific<br />
        market, Gamania will have the first choice to publish and operate each<br />
        in the territories of China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea,<br />
        Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and the Philippines.<br />
        The high global expectation and market potential for EQII has caught<br />
        the attention of key hardware and software vendors, including Intel<br />
        and nVidia. With Gamania, SOE, Intel and nVidia Asia branches all<br />
        supporting the launch of EQeast, it is certain this collaboration will<br />
        bring Asian gamers to a higher quality in digital entertainment.<br />
<br />
    3.  Core technology transfer<br />
        Certain SOE game engines, R&amp;D elements, and technologies will be<br />
        offered for license to Gamania through this strategic alliance. This<br />
        technology transfer will &quot;fast track&quot; Gamania's development of<br />
        advanced online games. Obtaining SOE's world-leading game engine<br />
        license will promote Gamania's development of games with Asian-style<br />
        artwork, game design and customer support. Through this, Gamania will<br />
        be able to develop &quot;killer app&quot; products in the near future. Also, SOE<br />
        will have the right of first choice to obtain global game licenses on<br />
        those products under development in order to expand its product lineup<br />
        and enrich the content for the global market. For Gamania, this is the<br />
        best opportunity for introduction into the European and US markets.<br />
<br />
    4.  China investment<br />
        SOE and Gamania share a keen interest in investigating, identifying<br />
        and working with cutting-edge development resources in China.<br />
        Utilizing development resources in China, SOE and Gamania would be<br />
        able to further improve the quality and efficiency of game production<br />
        for the JV, giving all new productions a competitive edge. Jointly,<br />
        Gamania and SOE aim to bring the highest quality online content to the<br />
        local and global markets.<br />
