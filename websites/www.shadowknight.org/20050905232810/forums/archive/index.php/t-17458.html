<br />
<br />
Q: How should I pull? Bow? Spells?<br />
<br />
Q: Aggro? My aggro spells suck!!!<br />
<br />
Thats about it... <br />
<br />
<br />
But thankyou in advance! :D<br />
<br />
EDIT: And one more thing, Spell lineup? I know this may ot be right board but figured I'd ask here!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmm....Did you not buy clinging darkness? By 51 you've got your two staples of agro- CD and HF.  Shouldn't need much more than those two for some time.<br />
<br />
Spell lineup is going to vary- there's a thread here somewhere on it in the spells forum. You have only 8 gems and need to be ready for many situations. You'll want FD up at all times of course. Some people like to keep HS up too, I'm one of those. If you're not MA you might still want to keep your CD or a terror up in case you suddenly become MA. At 51 my lineup was usually<br />
<br />
a lifetap<br />
cd<br />
terror<br />
dooming sometimes<br />
spear<br />
varied<br />
fd<br />
hs<br />
<br />
at 52<br />
<br />
a lifetap<br />
cd<br />
terror<br />
varied<br />
varied<br />
comatose<br />
FD<br />
HS<br />
<br />
As for pulling, that varies just as it does when you are solo'ing. Sometimes if you're just getting a single you don't want to snare because the mob's slower movement may mean more chance of a repop in pull path. So instead just pull with a str tap or something small. Sometimes you have to split so adjust accordingly.<br />
<br />
Rarely did I use a bow but that was mostly due to archery sucking and never having a bow up.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ninewest</div><div class="date">10-11-2003, 10:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not really, you're better off just casting CD twice than using heartflutter.  Just my opinion anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lyrith</div><div class="date">10-11-2003, 04:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree at that point i was using chaining cd, nothing for cast time and what 15m? Cant get much better than that im not sure about the &lt;60 sol pop loy spells never used them =/ Just cd is the way to go</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AislinSteele</div><div class="date">10-12-2003, 07:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I find pulling in LDoN (which is my main haunt these days) is easier with a CD macro. It will snare the mob, yes, but any adds that come early get mezzed by our chanter/bard so the one I want shows up just in time to die :)<br />
<br />
Aggro, thats a different story. But again, CD works wonders. And a terror for backup. Use taunt like you're supposed to and unless some ass is trying to steal aggro you're fine. I've held aggro on mobs and forgot to attack it, so unless they have procs no one shuld steal it (except Wizzies/Mages. They can be a pain)<br />
<br />
I always, always have CD, Terror and FD up. Upgrade FD as you can. The rest are more your taste, till 51-52ish I'll have tons of self-buffs, and replace as I can with more beneficial spells</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ashrai</div><div class="date">10-12-2003, 11:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To clarify for you:<br />
<br />
U said CD and HF were good aggro spells...But HF isnt in ur lineup   <br />
<br />
Check my lineups, I have a couple of &quot;varied&quot; slots. If I had the slot to spare back then I'd put in HF in one of those. Varied = situational. <br />
<br />
Depends on what you're doing, your lineups will vary and everyone has their preference. Mine is to have a couple of standard slots that rarely change (gem2 is always CD, 7 is always DeathPace and 8 is always HS). If you're just pulling and someone else is MA'ing then your lineup will be different. If there's another SK in the group then you can split up the tap duties, etc. If I'm MA throughout then I'll have fear up as well. <br />
<br />
<br />
and WTF is HF, HS? <br />
<br />
HS = Harmsheild</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wolff-Kishner</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 11:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heart Flutter for me in my lower levels was a great aggro spell.  But I soon realized the cast time was a waste and so was the mana it cost.  CD is great, but every now and then I lose aggro while I wait for CD to repop, so I compensated by using a Terror in between.  Terror has no where near the same aggro as CD, but it helps to keep me up at the top of the aggro list for little mana and it's timed just perfectly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zero</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 03:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As for aggro, as every one lese has already stated, just use CD, and if your one of the &quot;larger&quot; races with a small mana pool you may want to grab a cougar claw earring. I cant remember what my lineup was at 51 but i'll give you a basic layout of my spells.<br />
<br />
1)Lifetap<br />
2)the ac or attack debuff<br />
3)ac or attack debuff.(If tanking with a mezzer ill memm fear or terror instead of ac tap for breaking mezzes)<br />
4)CD<br />
5)Spear<br />
6) MC<br />
7)Torrent of Fatigue<br />
8) FD/comatose/dp etc. ( I usually dont even memm this as groups tend to whine at you if you FD when everyone else dies....as if I could have prevented anything by dying myself =p )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ziglug D</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 03:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That was helpful Zero, seeing as I am lvl 51! I dont have half those spells!<br />
<br />
EDIT: Woops didnt see that you said those were YOUR spells =P</div></div><hr />
