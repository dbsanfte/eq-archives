<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>steelle briteblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all, made it to 50, still have shitty AC though, was wondering of anyone could reccomend any places where one could solo where armor doesnt really matter? skellys in DL is getting pretty slow...<br />
Or, do u think my gear is so crappy to the point to where upgrading my AC is a must?<br />
<br />
thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Old World is much more forgiving about AC<br />
<br />
SolB, Cyclops in OoT, LGuk<br />
<br />
If you get a slower/healer go to nadox  The steelwrapped will be big upgades for you in the chest and back</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>DrayMay</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">As Keevel suggested old world mobs will be easier on you then the more recent expansions, Lower Guk will be viable for a few more levels.  The lower AC will not make the job impossible just more difficult.<br />
<br />
You have some decent gear on you but a couple slots are in need of upgrades.  Replace anything that does not have AC with items that do. Replacing the Sapphire Electrum Earring and upgrading the Darkforge Breastplate are the top two things that come to mind.  The common thread among most stat discussions here is that AC is king.</div></div><hr />

yeah, that is a great place - rarely anyone ever goes there unless they're passing through. There are a couple other good places to set up camp for nice, long kite paths with minimal chance of adds. If you don't like the little dip, then check out the far wall almost straight out from the steps, slightly to the left - follow the ridge to a flat, triangular spot at the stone wall. There is a drog somewhat nearby but you'll never agro it unless you're really sloppy. The other spot is nearly identical.  As you face the steps, turn sharply left and run parallel to the building until you hit the stone wall. You'll find another triangular flat area for your camp around there. This is a great place to practice different methods of kiting, and eventually, with a level or two, you'll be able to start working your way along the long runway at the top of the steps and be able to mess with the luggalds up there. Just keep that snare up - I always just counted the ticks.</div></div><hr />
