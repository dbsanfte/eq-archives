<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This has been happening to me since the last patch.  In LDoN esp.<br />
I will pull a mob with CD, two will come.  The second mob comes first and hits me and it automatically switches targets to the second mob that hit me?  Breaks mezz since enchanter is on it.  First mob has CD so I switch targets back to the first mob.   What is wrong here?  Something is the last patch is causing me to switch targets when getting hit by more then one mob.<br />
<br />
Anyone else noticed this</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ziglug D</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Do you have the first mob targeted?<br />
<br />
EX=&gt; U pull X &amp; Y mob, U tell everyone, On X! But you dont have X targeted, so everyone jumps on X and Y hits you before X, You will automatically be targeted on Y...=)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">No something is up. I have been pulling for a long time and this has never happened before.  I just have to watch it and switch back fast or call switch</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ziglug D</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well, sounds like you have been having alot of bugs lately, so, I dont really know...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Turns out it was not a bug but a feature<br />
<br />
<br />
I have attack keyed to Z, but I use ~ for the &quot;toggle between last two targets&quot; key. I use it a lot on my cleric as I melee a lot (and it's a lot faster than /assist if I know who's got agro), and couldn't figure out what was wrong when it wouldn't work.<br />
<br />
Find the &quot;Target nearest enemy&quot; key (should be F8 normally), and you'll see the ` (AKA, the ~ key) is set as the alt key. Click on the alt key spot and hit Esc...you'll be back to normal.<br />
<br />
<br />
Remapped F8 and no more problems</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lord Depraved</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Inferna,<br />
I got this as well.....<br />
I put my auto attack to the TAB button and it kept targeting my avatar. Re-mapped to caps lock and fixed it.<br />
Laters~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Makkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">eq is buggy.<br />
<br />
i get this thing lately where i autorun if i hold the up arrow too long. thought i was just being stupid / pressing numlock on autopilot or something..but then i watched it happen when i was watching what i was doing *shrug*<br />
<br />
ive got it happen when i look left too it'll just sit there and spin, have to hit the right arrow to make it stop. or vice versa<br />
<br />
i've basically come to accept all in game bugs as what they are, the product of a peice of shit game. since you report them and they're blatantly ignored etc. like the casting time not met, fd in arch lich(nec specific) etc<br />
<br />
not to mention the targetting system being so primitive it's laughable; f8 doesn't work pretty often etc</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Venlail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Makkon, your situation is due to having your chat open and hitting an arrow/direction key.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>mamdark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i love people who call possibly the most sucessful game of all time a crappy buggy piece of shit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Just because it's popular doesn't mean it's right.  <br />
<br />
We pay (collectively) a lot of money to play this game, and SOME (not all) of the discontent is warranted based on the quality track record of the company.  Of course, Sony is only following in Microsoft's footsteps with the &quot;let our customers test the product for us&quot; method of QA...<br />
<br />
Rest assured no other smaller software vendor could get away with the level of absurd release problems we see from these two giants.<br />
<br />
In any case, though, there's not much we can do about it if we want to play the game, so yes, excessive whining is counterproductive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>mamdark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">we pay alot more for our highways, cars, and traffic laws, and yet death rates on those are going way up..<br />
<br />
im happy with our EQ's slow progress</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Darknyss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Highways?<br />
<br />
I've never seen a highway get paved (upgraded models) and have more potholes than the original.<br />
<br />
I've never seen a highway that your car can't drive on, even though you should be perfectly able to (bugs in which you can't do something you're supposed to be able to).<br />
<br />
the only thing that remains is the customer service... if the cop pulls you over.... it's ALL YOUR FAULT... must have been your car (computer) your accelerator (internet connection)...<br />
<br />
Face it... while I enjoy the game and I think it's an amazing piece of software for its size... the amount of money spent on these does not seem to produce the quality in which we deserve.<br />
<br />
Basically, if I handed my professors code that has the number of bugs that EQ has... I would fail the class... and he doesn't have to pay me!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Krazaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Basically, if I handed my professors code that has the number of bugs that EQ has... I would fail the class... and he doesn't have to pay me! <br />
<br />
Then your professors would be idiots.<br />
<br />
Any business which routinely rolls out software upgrades to it's systems make a budget decision that balances the cost and duration of the QA process against the cost of business interruption by potential bugs.<br />
<br />
Game manufacturers do it all the time, when they balance the revenue loss by releasing a game late vs. the revenue loss caused by bugs.<br />
<br />
SoE could deliver a very stable product in EQ if they stopped providing enhancements and simply debugged what they had, but I think they do an excellent job of responding to reasonable customer requests, making the game better.<br />
<br />
People who rant and rave about releasing completely bug-free software have no grasp whatsoever of the scale and complexity of a product like EQ, let alone the financial considerations involved with running an actual for-profit company.  Most of them are hypocritical enough to be bitching in the next thread, about the delay in releasing changes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Justjoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">i have to agree with kraz, eq was beta released in 98...that's 5 years ago...name another first person 3d game that's consistantly had updates and upgrades for that long.<br />
<br />
i honestly cant think of a single one.<br />
<br />
debugging changing code is like bailing water off a sinking ship with a hole in your bucket...you do the best you can.  i really wish every person who bitches about eq and how it sucks so much would just stop playing.  that would leave the rest of us out there that still enjoy the game more namers and ph4t l3wtz.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Dakkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I've see it a lot Inferna.<br />
<br />
I get it in exp groups when turning attack off when the current mob's nearly dead, to taunt the next while the group finished it off.<br />
<br />
A rogue told me he's getting it if he evades early in a fight while he's being hit too.<br />
<br />
On raids when I FD to drop down the hate list, I hit a hotbutton which takes attack off and spam casts FD for fizzle protection, and it happens then too.<br />
<br />
I've remapped my autoattack key and have my fingers crossed, hoping it's gone away now - thanks for the info on this :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sandmann Dreamcatcher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">i got the same problem like inferna too. <br />
<br />
first i got often  told , plz do not switch tagets.<br />
<br />
my  new tactik is now to pull with a non dark(DOT) spell and after the first hit from the mob, I dark and stay on the mob. if now the 2 mob hits me first,  I will  stay on the 2 then cause all assist  the chanter got no problem to mezz the first one cause no dot is on !<br />
<br />
But I am unhappy with the situation too. I am now in the mid  50  and the chanter can not always mezz all mobs. So sometimes it is important do fight the right mob and  the worst thing  is  to stand  there not fighting and try to get the right target back <br />
I hope  this will changed back soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Krazaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I hope this will changed back soon. <br />
<br />
You did see that this wasn't a bug, but was instead an undesired effect of some default key mapping changes, right?<br />
<br />
There's instructions above on how to fix it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Sandmann Dreamcatcher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">hehe i overread it  <br />
<br />
will try it out hopefully it will work !<br />
<br />
edit <br />
ok its working thx alot</div></div><hr />
