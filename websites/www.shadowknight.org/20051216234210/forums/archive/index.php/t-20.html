Hoohaw.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Okami</div><div class="date">11-20-2002, 05:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">this post was made when The Knight Watch was closed on the EqForge forums.<br />
Someone bumped this simply because it was the very last thread out of all the pages we have here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kebsis</div><div class="date">11-20-2002, 06:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why did TKW close agian?<br />
<br />
/em figures he should know this cause he was there when the switch happened.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No one used it.<br />
<br />
I bookmarked it, about a year ago.  <br />
<br />
Mainly because it was the only somewhat decent SK site around that I could find.<br />
<br />
But I never went to it due to the lack of information on it.  <br />
<br />
I was even trying to write a Guide to submit to it because there were none there worth reading.<br />
<br />
Now, everything I want to know SK related is here.<br />
<br />
I have sometimes gotten /tells from newbie SK's asking me for advice, I give them the URL to here.<br />
<br />
/salute's Soulvoid on a great job of maintaining an excellent class board and one of the most level headed ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jobrill</div><div class="date">11-20-2002, 09:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">TKW the board closed because it's operator, Sunmoon, wanted to go to a donation system for his board system, which includes the still running Shaman's Crucible and Ranger's Glade, and Not enough SKs paid up for him to want to keep running the THW board, so he shut it down to save Bandwidth costs, and Soulvoid graciously set this place up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Buliwyk</div><div class="date">11-21-2002, 08:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Jobrill is correct.  It was a bandwidth issue, and we SKs were just a little too stingy with the money to keep our portion going.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krushum Gudended</div><div class="date">11-21-2002, 08:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yup, we were all being stiffs and our bandwith was being paid for by warriors, shaman, and ranjahs<br />
<br />
Sunmoon decided he could use the extra bandwith from shutting us down for more guild webpages, and honestly, I don't blame him<br />
<br />
Actually, this was one of the first posts on this page, it's not a transfer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kebsis</div><div class="date">11-21-2002, 10:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh, you think its something about being an SK that makes us not want to chip in?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jobrill</div><div class="date">11-22-2002, 12:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Strangely enough, I didn't donate back when Sunmoon was asking for money, but if Soulvoid wanted some donations I'd prolly chip a few bucks in...<br />
<br />
I dunno why, maybe it's the idea that this is TRULY our own place (Seeing as Sunmoon was a ranger), or I've just become less of a stingy bastard since TKW :p</div></div><hr />
