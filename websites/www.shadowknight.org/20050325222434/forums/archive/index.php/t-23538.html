<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">was on my bazzar bot this morning and started my 2nd instance to play when it asks for me to verify password and stuff and says invalid password blah blah blah so i got to lavishsoft.com and download new wineq update still same problem. So I attempt to go to their forums and post about it and it wont let me into their forums first thing it said was similiar to this but differnent now its saying this.<br />

Now im assuming the website is having problems or something and will be fixed soon but its been 3 hours since i've wanted to play eq and im craving my fix heh. (worse thing is i logged off my 1 instance that was on so i cant even have my bazaar bot selling atm =\) I'm a subscriber to wineq too so this kinda sucks for service.<br />
<br />
Anyways if anyone else is having a problem with wineq i'd appreciate to hear that its not just me or if it is just me and I need to fix something my side i would appreciate help with that too.<br />
<br />
P.S. 2 other sites EQW forum and another site i visit are having similiar problems so seems kinda odd neither have addressed the issue yet but others have complained.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ADD:  When it said the id/password are invalid, do you mean when logging into EQ?  Just like everyone else does or something related to WinEQ?<br />
I'm not familiar with that prog since I've never used it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">So im like stupid when it comes to web stuff like html and i guess this mySQL thing that is something i just wait around for them to fix right? Its not a problem on my side?<br />
<br />
One of my sites that was having this problem fixed it but they didn't say anything about it just isn't having it anymore heh. Lavishsoft is still though =\.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Khat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The other sites you mention that are having the same problems, are they related to wineq?  Hosted on the same servers?<br />
If not, then that's a heck of a coincidence for them to be sharing the same problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Nope shouldn't be related one of them is EQW and the other is a guy site (cars, girls, video games and such).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Darkmourn D`Estrellas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Getting the same errors from work, so I'm assuming his server is down or screwed up or something.  And for those that are a little confused, when you start WinEQ, it verifies that you are a registered user each time by connecting to the Lavish Soft site (also verifying that you aren't cheating and letting friends use your pw at the same time), so apparently it isn't able to verify either, which won't let you use WinEQ.  I'd guess they are aware of it and working on it, since he seems to be pretty involved in his product.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Modalex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm am having the same problem so it must be his site.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fantail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">its working now for me</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Feriin Cydovu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">download EQW 2.47 .. works exceptionally well..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">its working now and i used to use eqw 2.47 i couldn't 3box with it and it was super buggy.</div></div><hr />
