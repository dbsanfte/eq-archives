<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Udyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, Going through the forums, I found a few places, but thought id make what seems to be the same tired old post.<br />
<br />
    I have a group, SOILD group. 60SK/61BST/60ENC/61CLR. Im not boxing these, these are people that i know IRL and trust. Bascialy we have grouped since day 1. Just trying to make it a point we are solid. We need XP badly. Gear wise, id say we are midrageish. Don't havea  mageo profile to show ya. But i have a CoS(nerfed) Jboots as clickies and rougly 3.5kHP :( and about 1200AC unbuffed w/ my groups buffs i can get as high as 5.7k, Depending on what weapon i use. We have basicaly no flags. Except for HS/Seb/Trak/ToFS. So If any of you ladies and gentleman know where we can find good XP, please let me know. Like i said im at a loss as to where to take the group now. Thanks in advance for your help :)<br />
<br />
<br />
SideNote the BL can be swaped w/ a 65 necro, and the cleric can be switched witha  65 shammy, allthough i would like to keep the cleric ;/<br />
<br />
Also we have a combined AA pool of 0</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Culdahl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No better XP then that found in PoP.  I'm not sure if you can zone into PoV yet or not, but I would hit there or PoS until you can get into BoT, where you will spend the remainder of your days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Khementari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You haven't given any examples as to where you have been &quot;trying&quot; to get xp. I guess its possible that your little group started playing EQ recently. On the other hand you could be a bunch of poorly equipt twinks...<br />
<br />
Either way I would suggest heading deep into veksar and droga. Both have nice xp and loot for the non-raider. You can even work out some quests. I leave that for you to figure out though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Nothing wrong with 3.5k HP at level 60, sounds like your gear is decent but not spectacular.  You should be able to fight in Veksar or Sol C fairly easy if you want someplace that isn't usually very crowded, otherwise I would say go to Plane of Valor or Plane of Storms until 62, and once you're 62 go into Halls of Honor and fight there.  Bastion of Thunder is similar in exp levels to Halls of Honor, but usually has more people in it.  You've got haste, slow, healing and tanking covered pretty well, and not the worse DPS in the world, so you should do fine.  I would suggest waiting to do the Plane of Justice trial until after you hit level 65 and get some AAs earned so that it'll be a bit easier, no reason not to take the free AA.  You might also consider hunting the Diaku in Plane of Storms desert area to get the pieces for the alternate entry quest to Plane of Tactics, the pit in Plane of Tactics is quite good experience with the chance at some loot, and it usually isn't terribly crowded because it requires a flag to get in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Udyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Right on, thanks for the advice, and the one flame lol. And no, i started at beta ended at luclin. Started again fresh no gear or nothing about 2 months ago. And this is where we stand. As for where we have been trying, PoV once we get a camp is good, however on tribunal they train the undead alot, and we can't really take out more than 6 at a time. Droga sucks for XP, allthough our chanter likes the FT2 neck quested out of there. Im up for challenges and the PoTac Flags sound just up our alley. Last time i hunted there if you aggro one non-kos, they all come from what i remember ;/. So ill let ya know how it goes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Marruk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">LOL if you think that was a flame, I'm guessing that you're relatively new to these boards  :D <br />
I thought exp in the king's room of Droga wasn't too bad at 60-61, but it's been a while, so it may just be my faulty memory.<br />
<br />
Just to throw it out there, if you all have GoD, Qinimi might be decent exp, and should be doable by your group.  I can't say for sure, though, as I've only done aa in Qinimi (which goes at a decent pace, but not as good as the deeper GoD zones).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Udyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yeah we got owned in Qini, takes about 2min per kill and we can only do about 5 kills before cleric is oom ;/. So i broke down and went into PoV, was awesome XP, however cleric freaked out when we pulled two and chanter was STin cause they are to high level for her mez ;p. Sope, guess im gonna hit the gimp way into PoTact. Also, anyone know if we do the key to PoTact do we still have to kill MB/TT for other progressions? Any link on info for PoP progression at all?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Khementari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Forget Droga it sounds like you need to go back to Nurga.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>ssakaschaigidel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Go to torment.<br />
<br />
Set your group up on the bridge past the entry birds.  Get a rune or just use your skin buff and split the two at top of ramp.  It really isn't hard, just make sure the group knows to stay the hell away til you got the split.  If they don't, stay down, f9 and watch them wipe.<br />
<br />
Hardest part of the split is the wanderers.  Just DP immediately if you get one of them as well.<br />
<br />
Once the top two are split, it is completely mindless xp, and it's a so-called hot zone as well.  The two ramp mobs, the two wanderers, and the one before the house should be more than enough pulls for you.  If you find you are waiting on respawns, then either kill the birds or go set off a spider trap or two.  The Inscribable Words also drop off the thing mobs you'll be hunting, so start your VP earring quest.<br />
<br />
Torment is one of those places we really shine as pullers, cause the mobs you want snare.  Make sure they are snared as well, and you can walk them to camp.  If they resist, you can take a hit or two while resnaring. <br />
<br />
Also, as an added plus, this zone has a built in idiot checker for when you use the lfg tool.  Just warn the new addition that the birds silence, and to watch aggro if you are silenced.  Then pull a bird, and claim you got silenced on the pull.  When you get back to camp, you learn if they can follow directions.  If they can't, well....they are dead, and it's not your fault, cause you were &quot;silenced.&quot;<br />
<br />
I've trio'd this spot with a 65 cleric and 51 chanter.  I've grouped it with a 59 druid healing.  Your group should have no problem if even mildly skilled.  As you gain in levels, there are lots of places to move to, depending on group make up and how chaotic you like things to be.<br />
<br />
As an aside....<br />
<br />
No aa's in the whole group?  I firmly believe that levels (for a sk at least) &gt; aa's, but damn.  Grab two dps classes and push yourselves through the PoJ trials for the free aa, then take a few hours and get run3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Udyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I was just coming back to post that PoTorment is the place to be at 60 and 61 so far, btw ding 61.6!. So thanks for the advice. I allso found this little spot called &quot;Forgotten Halls&quot; its semi-broken, only things that are social is anything on nihil faction. There are basical two things to fight, rats and bats. There are two rooms, one with rats one with bats, about 9 or so in each room, and they are NOT social. Needless to say we cleared that for about 2 hours. However you have to be carefull because it seems that once your in there for a while, what seemed to be every 20minutes or so, the XP just stops. It will say you gained XP, but you will get none added. Because i didn't watch i stayed at 30% into 61 for about an hour, quit the expidition. Zoned back into it, and bam was getting 1-2% per kill again, so if anyone wants to check that out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Lynxal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Udyen the Alt entry quests for PoP zones do NOT count for planar progression.  You require boss mob progression to flag for the next level.  SO, if you did CoD alt entry key and killed Caprin/Bert, your flag for that line is screwed up until you kill Grummus, etc.</div></div><hr />

Right on thanks, While on the subject of PoP progression, any link that could help explain what you need for what? I saw the one chart, kinda confuddled me a bit. Any help would be awesome</div></div><hr />

I have a better checklist chart, but ezboard seems to be down atm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Udyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Thank you very much for that link. Im putting together an AD raid for this friday as i post. And i would like to see your better one as soon as ezboards come back up.<br />

    Ok. Reading these posts here, and getting everyones opinions on where to fight and what to fight. It hit me today, SK's are a pet class! So what did i do, i ran to the bazzar and bought up some pet toys, the hands to be exact, and a girdle of magi for the HP/dex. Solo, i went to PoV(outter) and started my pull, /pet taunt off, snare/ayst./terror/run in circles. Kills take about 3-4 minutes, but its easy and fun to get the tells telling me im a weird SK for kiting. Even got a compliment from a druid! While i was discovering this, one key phrase from a great movie came into my mind:<br />

Why do my eyes hurt?<br />
You have never used them before.</div></div><hr />
