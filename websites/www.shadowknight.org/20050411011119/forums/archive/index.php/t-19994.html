<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>VykusSoulsdrinker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Being a non guilded SK, and much of a loner, where are the best places for a level 62 SK to solo, and what are the best tactics to use, I have soloed before in my 40s, but been doing pick up groups for awhile, anyone have any suggestions? Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Keep grouping if you can (try keep the same people in group as much as possible so that you get to know each other's play style and will have more regular groups).  Soloing post 60 sucks ass. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Noctix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you want to continue soloing a lot post-60, you may want to look into getting a second account and 2 boxing.  You will be much more successful running both a SK and a shaman (or some other class) than just a single SK.<br />
<br />
Multi-boxing isn't for everyone but it is far more efficient than soloing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Meneltel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If i cant find a group, i solo the small mushrooms in Fungus Grove...now i am 65 but i believe you can single pull them, just watch for their casting on you and your pet running off to attack them unless you have pet hold.  There are lb to me and not a great danger but i earn about just under 1% AA per kill, so if im want to earn some AA exp, that is where i go.  I dont fear kite, i tank them.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>KrehnLForr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I aggrokited from 61 to 65 + some AAs in HoH. Pretty good except for the no loot part...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Daikoku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">In eastern waistes there are 4 bodygaurd dorf, completely factionless, if you have festering they can be snarepulled  two aren't bad, 2 are a little rough  you might beable to tank solo them, or aggro kite.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Oberyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">... pull Stoneberg and you will be all right at dorfs.  They hit for a max of 70 and that rarely.   With good regen, and a good DS you can straight tank them endlessly.  They drop Heads too:) Back in Velious my friend and I estimated we made about 40K from the heads.  *cheer Dorfs*<br />
<br />
That said, don't neglect Ykesha.  A lot of people trash it (usually high end raid types) but the soloing there can rack up xp at a fast rate to 65, if you have the balls and the time to get off the beaten track.  At 62 it seems to me the Luggald caves at the very back were very good XP.  Use the short fear, and some ingenuity, and its very good.  You can rack up 6 or 8 blue diamonds and multiple other decent loots in a session as well.  Or you used to be able to - its been a while.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ramgar SK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I agree, LoY is the place to solo.  It's always empty.<br />
<br />
Torgiran Mines at the nadox zone is great exp.  Still all blue to me at 65.  2 boxing there I could do 4 named easy (that's with a chanter).  Solo you could do at least 2.<br />
<br />
There should be several places in Nadox too.<br />
<br />
Droga would be good if you can find a place with a little room, like the exit tunnel.  Just watch those casters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vanladar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">What about a 61 SK 2 boxing with a 65 cleric?  Any good ideas on where to go where not slowing the mobs will not be a problem and still decent exp?  Again, non guilded atm.<br />
