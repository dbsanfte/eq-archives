<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Itzena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As a break from the usual modus operandi here (wait until stuff goes live, and then complain that it isn't what we want/need/deserve), I thought I'd start a thread for ideas on what we, as a class, would like to see for ourselves in LDoN.<br />
<br />
My immediate ideas:<br />
An intermediate pet buff spell at around the L49 mark.<br />
Lower level hp-&gt;mana spells.<br />
A number of Greenmist-like quests for all races.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grimbad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A level 49 version of Zevfeer's Bite, that costs 125 mana for 100 tap and 50 mana.  Or turn Soul Leech into this.<br />
<br />
Alternate version of Greenmist that's a 2 hander.<br />
<br />
More +%skill items for weapon skills, preferably charms.<br />
<br />
A zombie looking pet.  Necroes get Specs, I want a zombie.<br />
<br />
Unholy Steed (and Holy Steed for those wimps) with a particle effect graphic on the hooves (flames for them, fear skulls for us) or glowing eyes.<br />
<br />
More focus effect items.<br />
<br />
Troll cultural armor.<br />
<br />
The retaking of Grobb!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Pheargore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Related to Dungeons.....<br />
<br />
Retaking of Grobb, agreed<br />
Move Froglocks into Guk and Revamp Guk, both upper and lower (make upper 40-50 and lower 50-65)<br />
It's always near empty when I go there as late.<br />
<br />
- Peace</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jobrill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">-Stop the frickin revamps (Unless you keep it at the old level it used to be at and simple revamp for risk v. reward) and make new zones. Too many fun quests, drops, and hunting have been spoiled by revamping zones into the high level range. Or, if you are gonna revamp, make sure the quests stay relatively intact at the same level of risk v. reward as they were before. <br />
<br />
-On the same token, more shakeups of existing content for storyline reasons. Have the Militia drive out the Paladins from NFP.<br />
Put the Halflings on the Offensive in Nekultos. Making Innothule a true battleground between Heretics and Citizens of Erudin.<br />
<br />
-More Mana-&gt;HP conversion spells at lower levels.<br />
<br />
-A Spell that gives an illussion that looks like Vakiszh the shade from Plane of Nightmare. <br />

Of course, I'm still waiting for an official announcement from Sony that an expansion entitled the lost dungeons of norrath is coming out, but hey...</div></div><hr />

Well they allready gave a statment atleast two more expantions are in the works and then EB jumped the gun with letting you order Lost Dungeons so Id say its a pretty good chance its coming out soon under that name.<br />
<br />
As for what I would like to see in a new expantion, Id like them to explain why there is an all of a sudden infestation of rats in variouse cities. When Ive been hunting in Felwith, Rivervale, Neriak and Qeynos there were a shit load more rats than I have ever seen.<br />

- AA skills (tools probably, hybrids like their tools) <br />

Say we retake our artifact, freeing the Broken Skull Trolls from the magical oppression of the Luggalds. We move in there and rule one of the cooler cities in the game. Either that or give us the frog city in the Swamp of No Hope, not like the zone serves any other purpose.<br />

Perhaps we could compose a list and add the reasonable things to it, might attract some attention that we might like that way.</div></div><hr />

Something like 5% increased success on taunt per level, give Sk's and Pally's 3 levels, Warriors 5 levels.<br />

20% slow to mob, 15% haste to group, stacks with most hastes (if not all).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">While I personally feel that a whole lot of what's getting suggested is silly (Why should we start AEing now?), or broken(...No. You're not going to get a haste tap. Ever. Especially not one that stacks with anything ever. ), here's a short list of what I'd like to see:<br />
<br />
Bash-stun AA, for all melee classes with Slam/Bash. Let's face it. In the world of the 55+ exp mob, bash and slam are useless, except for their miniscule added DPS. It's not all that much to ask to be able to conk a gnome in the face and interrupt him again, is it? <br />
<br />
A mid range DOT. 1200 damage, 1 minute, 200ish mana. Call it 'Grasp of the Grave', and put it on Cold resist, -100. <br />
<br />
Advanced Theft of Life and Fury of Magic are big winners, imo, as is what we'll call 'innate shadows', though I feel that the invis and ivu should be seperate. Both at once is a Rogues perogative. I'd also find group Shadows very convienent. <br />
<br />
A whole line of Zbite would also be great. <br />
<br />
Rather than AA, I'd like to see a series of /REASONABLY ACHIEVABLE/, progressive quests that start in the mid 30s, and that grant a series of items that right click pets, preferably varied by deity. These pets should, above all, be worth using over the equivalent 'standard' pet. With these pets, maybe Suspend minion would be worth the AAs.<br />
<br />
Just my asshoish take on things.</div></div><hr />

Immediate con to this I can see is getting turned down from a group because you didn't have it and the other 5 members did.<br />
<br />
OK, scratch that idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>RoshenWampa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Upgrades for Innoruuk's Curse or Greenmist? <br />
<br />
Some lessor form of Necro rez, using the essance emeralds they make.  Its not too overpowering if you don't give us the sacrifice ability.  Paladins get a 90% rez.  Necros have 93%.  <br />
<br />
Perhaps a AA that makes Cloak of Luclin/Akheva projectable?  I've been turned down for groups in some rare situations because I have to hear 'Well, gimp_Pal_07 has Brells&quot;.  I wouldn't mind blowing a few AA one something like 'Project Shadow'.. <br />
<br />
Speaking of Cloak of Luclin, they should make it so Call of the Rathe doesn't overwrite it.  I swear... next time a Ranger cast that on me, someone is going to die</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Xanathol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I really like the idea of posting suggestions, in hopes they are read, so here I go. While I disagree with a few suggestions made, I won't point them out, as I do not wish to tear down anyones post / idea. The one idea I would like to see, somewhat mentioned earlier in this thread, is a slow / haste tap. Here is what I would propose, if it were up to me:<br />
<br />
LvL:    ?<br />
Effect: slows a mob for 3 minutes, by 20%<br />
           self haste for 3 minutes, by 20%<br />
Cost:  100 mana?<br />
<br />
It would only be a soloing tool, of course, and the duration, imo, should be short, as if I had this, I would slow every mob I fought anyhow.<br />
<br />
I don't believe this is an unachievable wish, because compared to most melee, only SKs and Warriors have to rely on a subset of items providing haste. My reasoning is the that:<br />
<br />
 (1) epics are easy nowadays ( comparatively ), for most classes<br />
      ( SKs, Necros, and Mages are still difficult ) which mean that<br />
      Monks, Rogues, and Rangers have a fairly easy to achieve <br />
      1% haste item.<br />
 (2) clerics, while having a spell haste buff, do not have melee<br />
      haste buffs, yet Paladins have a 27% self haste spell ( see<br />
      Valor of Marr on lucy's site ).<br />
 (3) Comparing to other hybrid types, Beastlords inherit the<br />
      ability to slow &amp; haste like Shamans, yet we do not have<br />
      the slow inherited from Necros.<br />
 (4) Rangers also have a 50% slow proc on the harder-to-get<br />
      epic, and a couple of more items to provide haste ( Plane of<br />
      Sky cloak for instance ).<br />
<br />
I surely don't think this would unbalance us any, as it is minimal spell haste, and not much of a slow. The only reason I added the slow part in my idea is we have a line of different &quot;tap&quot; spells, so it sort of &quot;fits&quot;. With this spell, we still could not slow mobs enough to replace other slowers, in say Plane of Storms, and anyone else's haste would be better than ours. This would simply be a soloing tool that I feel is missing, and would be useful. Also, if it make minimal to no difference in a fight at these values, then it certainly fits in with a lot of the spells in my spell book! hehe<br />
<br />
Either way, I think it would add to game play, not dramatically though, and not enough to upset other classes or unbalance us.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Darko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">We do NOT need any more  class bluring, no more hasting, slowing, mezing, healing, tanking, damaging classes, and no haste/slow taps.  In the yeas ive played eq atm it seems the classes are most balanced, there are some minor tweaks that could be done (dot damage focus, shaman healing improvmenet, slight melee dps improvement via disc etc), but nothing major like adding an entire new line of spells to a class.<br />
<br />
What is needed is an expansion  that will actually advance the game, with SoV SoL and PoP soe should now know what works and what doesnt, and armed with new tools to implementing this (flags rings etc) make something that isnt a complete piece of crap, like what some of the passed expansions are, and some of the future expansions seem to be turning out to be. That means pleasing the entire spectrum of the player base not just a select few, as well as making the game FUN and WORTH WHILE not a timesink.  <br />
<br />
As far as dungeons, we need more good WELL STRUCTURED dungeons, what i mean by that is more good dungoens IE solb lguk seb vlab, if SOE still doesnt understand what makes a dungeon like LGUK good and The Deep a piece of crap, then ask.  <br />
<br />
Some AAs that would enhance our current abilities are fine but nothing new just improvements to the older aa. Like mentioned before there is no need to give clerics haste, or to give shamans CH, work with what you have instead of adding more problems.  Every class (belive it or not bst too) have their own role, as well as strenght/weakness  leave that role alone.<br />
<br />
MORE RAID CONTENT this goes with out saying, Plane of Time on top of being a retarded zone is not ment to, and will not support more than 1 guild, by the time LDON comes out PoTime will have more than 1 guild on 90% of servers, GMs are going to be much busier and alot of ppl are gona be plenty pissed. <br />
<br />
On a side note, take a poll of what the avrg lvl on eq is accros all servers (take the highest char of each account or even better of each CC) i am willing to bet its over 60, at the very least 57.  With out raid content and with crapy dungeons currently available what are high lvl players gona do? If people were here for chat, there are much better methods for it that dont cost a monthly fee.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lots of quests, when you think you have enough in, double them again.<br />
<br />
An end to large raids, managing a platoon or more of combatants and support personell is no longer my idea of fun.  This I think is my biggest gripe about the game today.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) some fun ass dungeons again....everybody loves a good dungeon, and good old ones are, well, old.<br />
<br />
2) I know this is something that causes a lot of controversy but, an epic upgrade god damn it! Inny's curse looks so bad ass but it just isnt worth using anymore....hell I would settle for a 1:1 ratio and I would use it for crying out loud!<br />
<br />
3) A few spells would be nice I guess, I like the idea of a little higher Zbite, maybe a fear that is somewhat higher too.<br />
<br />
4) AA...I would settle for 1 special line of AA that will help give us a little something (cant come up with anything specific) but something like a gars EQ and AM (doesnt havent to be a DPS AA like that just something very unique to help us out, i personally liked the idea od joust for SK/Pally).<br />
<br />
5) Instead of cultural armor it would be nice to see &quot;class armor&quot; , some of the cultural armor just doesnt suit many of the classes that each race can be very well.<br />

<br />
and the idea of a &quot;Joust&quot; skill, that just sounds fun for a 1 off massive hit while on a horse at start of a fight.

This is something which should have been done a LONG time ago, but now's a good chance to impliment this change. Fixing bugged quests would be nice, but I shouldn't get my hopes up. Making 1h weapons / shields more valued in the high end game would be awesome. Perhaps through the means of AA bash or something, or increasing some 1h'der's Damage Bonus. Better damage shields and more effective lifetap DoT's? I guess it doesn't really matter for me, I hardly ever play anymore. But now's a good chance to make some sweet changes.</div></div><hr />

Not to mention that 2hbash AA completely destroys the need for bash from a shield. sure, higher resists hp and AC on 1h and shield are good, but i rarely see folks outside of elemental planes using 1h and shield. Is it because the DPS is more important than the minor stat increases? it may just be because the output from the old sword and board combo isnt nearly balanced enough with 2handers to make a viable change? <br />
Its best to increase skills in all types of weapons, but with the damage scales so unbalanced between 2h and 1h, whats the point?</div></div><hr />

I dig the zombie pet idea.  A ghoul pet with ghoulroot would piss off the mages since that would be too close to their earth pet.

One thing I'd really like to see is the placement of short term buffs into the &quot;bard&quot; box.  This would include the recourses for SK and necro taps as well as heal over time spells etc.  In some non-raid groups, filling all 15 of those slots is not so difficult and dying because a Celestial Heal won't land on me just isn't right.  We're punished enough that the duration on the recourses is relatively short, so it eats a spell slot, there's no reason to have them eat buff slots as well.<br />

  I agree with this one, although it doesnt have anything to do with LDON.   I would never use shroud of death or cloak of the akheva.  However,  a free dot as suggested would be useless.  It would have twice the cast time of a normal dot and would probably suck.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u74"><b>Gollgoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p74">A lot of good ideas!  <br />
<br />
1. I don't think a haste tap is out of line, but I have worked hard on 2 toons for EoP, and would like, as suggested above, for our buffs to go into the short duration buff box, and be viewed as &quot;song&quot; buffs (thus stackable with clicky/spell haste).<br />
<br />
2. Certainly, our Unholy Steed should be unique, not a version that someone else can pay pp for.  The horse graphic Vaskiz (sp) the Shade has is KILLER, I would truly want something like this instead.<br />
<br />
3. Lower and Higher spells in the Zeefers line (truly and awesome spell, and groups love having a SK who can cast it)<br />
<br />
4. New models for our pets.  Something that will distinguish us from Necros, and from lower level SKs.  Vampire, Ghoul, Zombie, Mummy... anything!<br />
<br />
5. AAXP... We have a nice lineup already, but my thoughts of SKs are offensive Knights.  I don't agree with the Shield theory, because I think of that as a defensive (paladin) trait.  I would like to see an AAXP ability, that allows us to &quot;frenzy&quot;.  It would be 3 levels like Rangers Guardian of the Forest.<br />
<br />
1 Increase haste cap 5%, Increase ATK 100, Increase haste 20%, Decrease AC by 50.  Duration 10 seconds<br />
2 Increase haste cap by 10%, Increase ATK by 200, Increase haste by 30%, Decrease AC by 100.  Duration 20 seconds<br />
3 Increase haste cap by 20%, Increase ATK by 300, Increase haste by 40%, Decrease AC by 200.  Duration 30 seconds<br />
<br />
Or something along that line.  SKs are supposed to be offensive knights, we should have SOME sort of melee ability to sacrifice defense for offensive bursts (outside of our nice lineup of spells and the obvious HT).<br />
<br />
[EDIT] And yes, Epic 2.0 would be long awaited.  Our epic I consider the hardest to complete.  While most classes have the ability to put theirs in a bag for situational use, the SK epic, once you attain SSRA wpn +, is banked, or brought out in the Newbie sections to impress people w/ the particle effect.  Please, PLEASE, allow us to upgrade this highly sought after RITE OF PASSAGE, that ends up collecting dust.  :( <br />

<br />
This way, the new ATK buff line would be actually an upgrade to Grim aura (slot 1 atk buff), and also made to stack with our skelly forms (slot 7 Hp loss).<br />
<br />
yeah, i know, 38/tick HP loss is insane, but we can handle it.<br />
<br />
2) some kind of upgrades for 1HS.  We have no AAs to enhance it, and no innate abilities to warrant its use.<br />
<br />
3) since everyone has their own idea of what the &quot;best&quot; horse model is, why not make have several horse models that you can choose from?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>Kirhouk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">I would like to see more skill play come back to end game, rather than just having a shitload of ppl. to toss at encounters to pull out a win.  I always liked ntov.  (The idea of entering a lava filled dungeon that is home to multiple dragons is appealing to me) I want to see a few end zones like ntov where only a set raid party may enter (5-8 groups or so).  Rings like vulak are cool I think, just need to have better shit than vulak obviously.</div></div><hr />

Kind of odd to me that SOE states that the expansion will be geared towards group encounters but all the screenshots on the LDoN site show a duo progressing through a dungeon crawl.</div></div><hr />
