<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>DrMobius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">You can all slap me around like a redheaded step child if this has been asked before, but can any of these quests be started at level 31?  I want to start a nice rewarding progressive quest, if I can't start these quests, does anyone know of another good quest or two for my level?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>DrMobius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Great!  Thanks for the quick reply too.  I'll look the Greenmist over tonight and see about getting started. :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>yuggoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">With assistance, I imagine you could do greenmist at level 1...  I know it *was* possible to have IC at 35 (when we get hide), but I think they have changed it so some npc's won't talk to you if you are too low.<br />
<br />
All this would be doing MQ's, buying what you can, and having people keep you alive in some tough zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>DrMobius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm going to start some of the Greenmist ones today then...anybody on Bristlebane want to help? :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aoninie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">could start collecting the darkforge pieces you'll need to start IC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shiirak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">To help you out my iksar sk had greenmist at level 32 with help from two friends, i did however quest all the pieces with them myself, hard but fun.<br />

:P Quests are for Pallies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>DrMobius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thanks again everyone for the suggestions!  I know a 63 Ranger and a 65 Cleric, so this weekend they helped me get all but 2 peices of the Greenmist.  All I need to do now is get to the lower caves in Chardok to kill the Apprentice Herbalist and then kill Drusella Sathir in Charasis.  Last week I was working on faction, Friday I did the first 3 Khukri quests, Sunday I finished the 4th, and currently I'm camped waiting for Kly Imprecator #3.  Waited an hour and a half yesterday for him and then fell asleep.  I'm going to log on as soon as I get home and be prepared to camp him another 6 hours.  After that I have one last quest and the two mobs to kill and the Greenmist is mine at level 32!!!<br />
<br />
Thanks again everyone,<br />
<br />
-A very happy SK</div></div><hr />

I'm at the same point.  Need the shard and the mirror, and I'm pretty well set.  51 at the moment, have a 57 enchanter as well.  Maybe we could set up to camp a couple of shards.<br />
<br />
Look for Nocretic, I tend to be on in the evenings or early morning thursday through saturday if you want to catch me in game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>DrMobius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Are you on BB server?  If so, I just got word from my roommate Ktalia that one of her friends from Alaska may help out with the shard.  He has a 65 warrior with all AA points, most keys and flags, and now he's working on becoming a GM in his 4th trade skill.  Sounds like an EQ-a-holic!  He said he could duel box his 65 cleric and has some friends that could help out too.  I also know two 65 enchanters that may help out too.  Two enchanters, a warrior, a cleric, and two lower level shadow knights is almost overkill for those last two pieces.  :D  If I hear more info on it I'll let you know.  --Oh, check out www.bristleboards.com, that's where I've been organizing most of this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What is the IC quest? What zone is it given out in? What is the end result?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Pharr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">IC is Inny's Curse (Shadowknight epic weapon), and there is a complete walkthru on this site.</div></div><hr />
