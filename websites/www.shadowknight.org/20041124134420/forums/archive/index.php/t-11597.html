<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Liabach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">just doing an xp grind in Valor, have a big warrior that wants me to keep him voiced, he really thinks it helps.  But the damn cleric ignored my request for a virtue, and i had to go with potc.  Kept that cleric voiced for 4 hours strait and never killed him once:-(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xanon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">*sigh* Some clerics, y`know?  That`s when you just say 'screw it' and get as much aggro as you can.. then FD... it`s the cleric`s fault for not giving you virtue =)<br />
<br />
Xanon Todesengel<br />
52 Reaver<br />
The Rathe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xygoz Shadowreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ever cross your mind he mightve clicked voice off?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lejina Bloodbath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The warrior asked you for Voice then you turned around and you casted it on the cleric (for 4 hours long, no less) instead?<br />
<br />
Are you that retarded or is that some kind of roleplay?<br />
<br />
To put Voice on the warrior means every damage dealers in the group can dish out 10% extra hate (damage!) until they take agro from the warrior.<br />
<br />
Voice doesnt help for the snap agro against the early slow/debuff, but it definitly increase the sustained agro of a warrior, which is the kind of hate that is needed to hold a mob against the damage done overtime by the damage dealers of a group.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, Xanon, and what would be the point of doing what you propose?<br />
<br />
Wasting the cleric's mana to show him that not buffing you cost much more mana than actually casting the buffs?<br />
Wow, thats smart.<br />
<br />
While the cleric refusing to buff all his group members isnt the wisest thing to do, theres still no absolute need for a SK in a damage dealer role for ac/hp buffs (if he was pulling or off-tanking, thats another problem). Regardless, stealing agro here and there then fd'ing will do nothing but showing what a complete and utter jackass you are. Wtfg.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Like Xygoz said, VoT can be easily clicked off.<br />
So the question raises again : are you really that stupid or do you think that being stupid is the new cool thing to do (in which case, you guessed it, you're still stupid)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cheru Horizons</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you had PoTC you should've asked the cleric for Symbol (hp buff, stacks with potc) and maybe Ward of Gallantry (ac) if you're tanking lots (otherwise don't bother, it's 400 mana for an ac buff, kinda hard on the cleric).  The three buffs combined gives you more hp/ac than Virtue, plus with the PoTC you gain 9 mana per tick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xackery</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">&quot;To put Voice on the warrior means every damage dealers in the group can dish out 10% extra hate (damage!) until they take agro from the warrior&quot;<br />
<br />
I really ponder your logic on this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lejina Bloodbath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If your warrior is dishing out 100dps, then you need to dish out 101dps to steal agro from him.<br />
<br />
Buff him with Voice of Terris, and he will generate the same hate as if he was doing 110dps, pushing the limit of agro generation of all the damage dealers of the group by just as much.<br />
<br />
Of course this is simplifying the thing by quite a bit, but you get the idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Trysbrina67</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You dont need a hp / ac buff when you arent tanking or pulling, but still it does piss me off when a cleric/shaman/druid decides not to buff certain members of a group.  <br />
<br />
Still Terrising him was not the smartest thing to do because;<br />
<br />
it would have never worked<br />
you wasted the buff on someone who didnt need it as opposed to someone who did<br />
potentially ticked off 5 other people in the group for no reason.<br />
<br />
If you didnt like how the group or cleric operated you should have left the group or just finished out your time there without incident and make a not to never group with said cleric again.<br />
<br />
Personally had a similar experience when I was level 55 with a cleric who refused to heal me because I had lifetaps and wasnt tanking.  Its not that I cant heal myself from a moment or two of aggro or a riposte, but the general attitude she presented is piss poor.</div></div><hr />

That is Prot of the Nine that is better than virt with kazad and ward.  PotC sucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zakton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Heroic Bond and a HP buff are just fine for us when we are not tanking.  They don't cost alot of mana and they shouldn't use up a gem unless they use a symbol.   Virtue eats up 1000 mana.  Thats half my mana in one shot.  Clerics have more but that is still a significant amount in a fast paced exp group.<br />
<br />
As for the voice unless the cleric was meleeing its not gonna matter that he is voiced over the warrior.  The cleric would have to be in there fighting just as much as the warrior for it to help the cleric get agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Liabach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">this was suspose to be a reply to a thread about voice agro, and whether it had a noticable effect, and mostly tongue in cheek.  and it was two separate things, 1) a warrior that thinks voice is 'helping' him hold agro, and 2), I was voicing the cleric after the warrior left and I was MA, 4 hours was an exageration, i prolly got bored after buffing him 4 times and memmed something more useful for that gem slot.(voice on me?, not a chance, i dont have a free buff slot). (and this wasnt a pickup group, just friends lol, we arent hardcore players, just a relaxed xp group)<br />
<br />
Most people still 'assume' that you cant click off sk buffs, on raids while we set up, i like to mem all 4 and buff the smelly dr00dz, gawd how i hate them=P<br />
<br />
as to eggo and virtue vs potc or nine, its situational.  what is hitting me and how hard? do i already have a kei? and do i have room to burn mana or will it overagro? and how many buff slots do i have available?  takes 2 buffs for symbol and nine, and more hps than eggo, im assuming close to virtue but i didnt count. <br />
<br />
anyway i'll go back to putting the &quot;F&quot; in &quot;Stupid&quot; now.</div></div><hr />
