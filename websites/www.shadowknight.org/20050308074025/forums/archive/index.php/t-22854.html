Placeholder name is Murkglider Swarmer.  Killed there for about 3 cycles for him to spawn. He spawns adds at 100% health just about 10 seconds after aggro.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Airamwu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Mojo, I was playing with him last night since he popped after I broke up our epic strikers group.   I found that i could tag him move up the  stairs a bit then FD.  He will pop the murkglider spawn at that point.   I kept doing this a few times to pop around 4 of them before i ran out of room to FD.   Seems feasable to have another player tag him with DA and run to zone.   Breeder will probably pop all his pets before returning back to his spawn point.   This trick was mentioned before but i wasnt able to try it out.   I am curious though if i could sufficently tank him with my current gear.    Any thoughts?   Current strikers group consist off  2sk/mage/ranger/cleric and if needed a 12k/1900ac war.   But i would prefer not to ask big bro to tank a dumb mob for me.<br />
<br />
PS Group can inclue a shaman if needed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ndayael Darkomen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i did with me as mt , 1 bard , 2 rog 1 ench 1 cleric ,  pick up group not guild group , so  everyoen beside me  wasnt very good equipped.<br />
<br />
adds are mezable np</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Utmost</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think CREEPER is PH for BREEDER, and STALKER os PH for DEATHSTINGER.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Krushum Gudended</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i can confirm that, swarmer can also spawn as creeper, and a stinger for stalker</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Deathstinger is very easy and can drop spells and augs. Dropped a decent set of attunable chain arms for us last night too. So that might give your group some incentive to help you camp this spot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Lugdug Studthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Confirmed only 6 adds spawn, took him down earlier today with a group and a half, paladin/enc/bst/shm/bard/2clerics and myself.<br />
<br />
He has a ton of HP and has a weak little AE DoT, each spawn also has a ton of hp and he will respawn them if one is killed, the spawns are pretty resistant to most of our spells.  <br />
<br />
The way we did it was, I had the cleric bestow DA me and I ran the breeder around in the opposite hall trying to get him to spawn the adds, after bestow dropped I hit my own DA.  I got 4 of the adds to spawn, and after that we just pulled the breeder and mez'd the other 2 easily.  <br />
<br />
Was a long fight because we didnt have a lot of dps, AE wasn't that bad he didnt hit too hard, not sure of his max hits.  But after a long fight we killed his ass and stole his egg.  <br />
<br />
Hope this information helps you guys in your efforts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>The Zenogias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">How hard does the Breeder itself hit for?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Krushum Gudended</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">940          .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Neherenia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Would it be possible to pull the adds and mez them one at a time, then go after the Breeder then?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Voltayr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">little repative but could you:<br />
<br />
send chanter in AoE mezz the breeder and adds. chanter then slow, and put a more perminant mezz on adds and breeder. Then send in tank let him aggro breeder. then send in melees and whatever else while chanter keeps himself/herself busy keeping adds mezzed(hey its what they get paid for). kill the breeder loot the egg and haul ass outta the zone.<br />
<br />
think that is possible?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Space</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Did breeder last night without a mezzer, had a coth mage in group i basically ran as far as i could away from breeder after aggro to pop spawns and soon as breeder path back we pulled, we had 2 adds on inc cause i didnt pop all of em but a fellow sk ot'd them and we killed the breeder.<br />
mage,cleric,shaman,sk,sk,necro.<br />
and the other bastard won the roll heh. oh well back i go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Xanathol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Had an interesting night last night with the Breeder. First off, a named dog ( Ukun Flesheater iirc ) was popped just outside the tunnel, roaming the area. Hit for 2513 and an AE for ~1100(?) ( never saw AE; necro said he was hit with it ). So, with the dog on the prowl, and our group makeup ( me, cleric, shammy, chnater, bard, necro ) we decided to try to mez the squids as they spawned. Not good.<br />
<br />
We were getting the spawns mezzed ok I guess, but btw spawn and mez it only add to the DPS on my ass. Both the named and the spawns were hitting in the 900s and flurrying, and even though slowed, the named appeared to hit pretty fast. Bc of the spiked DPS eating at me, I got way low, way fast, and the cleric was throwing out all she had, but couldn't fill me up again. Wiped at about 60%(?) when one spawn resisted mez. Note that the adds did not spawn till we actually engaged in the fight. This may be due to the lack of running room we were operating in, or a % of hp - not sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Neherenia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I've had a similar problem getting the adds to pop.  Max my group has ever had popped was 5, and we got that way by trying to kill it, mez adds as they popped.  The breeder plus an add can chew through me and another SK friend pretty fast.  I've tried to pull Breeder away from group so his adds will pop there and the group can then pull breeder alone, but I've only been able to get 1 or 2 at a time.</div></div><hr />
