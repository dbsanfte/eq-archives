<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sereph</div><div class="date">02-10-2004, 09:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok Before anyone else jumps you..<br />
<br />
1st. Search is your friend!!<br />
<br />
2nd. There is a nice sticky at the top of this page.<br />
<br />
3rd. Lord's come from copy and pasted from said sticky.<br />
<br />
<br />
Crusader's Test of the Lord<br />
This is the seventh shadowknight test.<br />
Who Starts: Arch Duke Xog<br />
PART I <br />
First you must collect 6 scrolls. The scrolls are located in the following places: <br />
I: Kaesora Temple in the field of bone - the &quot;failed crypt raider&quot;<br />
Map: http://www.eqatlas.com/kunark/kaesora1map.html<br />
Location: #5<br />
Suggest a solid group of 40s<br />
Raider is around level 30-32 and inside on the bottom floor of the Library.<br />
<br />
Skeletal Warders are around level 30 and are Clerics, which make this very rough without a full group.<br />
<br />
II: This scroll can be found in the City of Mist on a spectral courier <br />
Map: http://www.eqatlas.com/kunark/cityofmistmap.html<br />
Location: # 6: 3 spawn locations, kill everything you see as I don’t know the actual locations. 19 minute timer.<br />
Suggest a solid group 35-42<br />
III: same as II <br />
IV: same as II <br />
<br />
V: This scroll can be found in Castle Mistmore located near Lesser Faydark. <br />
<br />
NOTE: Spawn Timers here are 22-26 minutes<br />
<br />
It drops off the Dark Librarian, who is located to the right when you go through the double doors near the entrance to the castle. Head up the stairs there, and into the library. The PH/DL is on the upper level of this incredibly small room. <br />
<br />
Fight on the right side of the room or you will get adds from the room to the Left.<br />
<br />
Map: http://www.eqatlas.com/mistmooremap.html<br />
Location: #19 <br />
Suggest: Travel in Day hours in-game. Group of 34-40.<br />
<br />
VI: This scroll can also be found in Mistmoore. Rather than going right after you enter the double doors, head left, up some stairs. The hallway turns right. Take the 1st left to face a small hallway with a gargoyle on the end. Enter the room on the left and pass through that room and continue to the small bedroom which has a bed with red drapery on it. The ASSISTANT dark librarian spawns in front of the bed and drops the 6th scroll. <br />
<br />
Map: Use above<br />
Location: Directly across (East) from Location #19 in room near /LOC neg100, neg 100<br />
Suggest: Travel in Day hours in-game. Group of 34-40.<br />
<br />
PART II <br />
Map: http://www.eqatlas.com/kunark/templeofdrogamap.html<br />
Location: #1<br />
<br />
Destination Map: http://www.eqatlas.com/kunark/templeofdroga2map.html<br />
Location : #6 and 7ish<br />
Suggest: Travel invis to jail cell with fallen door. Group of 40+ with Rogue and Druid.<br />
<br />
After collecting the scrolls, you must see and free the imprisoned Argest. <br />
<br />
Argest, the lost and imprisoned crusader is located in Droga's Temple, located at pos 3400, pos 2900 of the Frontier Mountains.<br />
<br />
Before entering this dungeon, bring some shrink potions to get through the locked cell doors if &quot;solo&quot;. *snicker* <br />
<br />
Fall into the pit near the entrance (it is an illusionary floor). Follow the long cave staying along the RIGHT wall until you come to a small over-passing bridge. <br />
Go under this bridge, turn left at end and stay LEFT after that until you get to the JAIL.<br />
Penmaster<br />
There is 1 spawn location for the Penmaster, which is at the fire when you come down the ramp to the jail. You will often see a Spider in his location, and it sees through invis, but not rogue hide/sneak.<br />
Drop the Bone and Bone Necklace keys<br />
<br />
Penkeeper<br />
Penkeepers can spawn anyplace that a regular goblin currently is. <br />
Drop the Stone and Bronze keys<br />
<br />
Other goblins drop random copper, steel, etc. keys but are of no use. They may be to cell doors, but I didn’t try.<br />
<br />
We held main camp in the inner jail inside the cell with the door laying on the ground. This room also has a secret wall directly opposite the single mob in this room.<br />
<br />
We did this over 2 days for 6 hours each day.<br />
Spawn timer is 19 minutes.<br />
Day 1: We had 7-9 people, all 42+, 4 at least 51+. 2 druids, 1 cleric, 1 rogue, 46 SK(myself), 2 warriors, etc<br />
<br />
Day 2: Our group was a 49+ Druid, 42 Monk, 42 Rogue, 51 Rogue, and myself 46 SK. Once broken, we were able to keep the spawns under control easily.<br />
I recommend taking in a Rogue for the locks and a Druid for tracking.<br />
Keys:<br />
* bone key <br />
* bone necklace key (rare)<br />
* stone key <br />
You only need the above 3 to give to “an enslaved iksar”<br />
<br />
* bronze key <br />
This key is for the doors (I believe, I never used it)<br />
<br />
Once you have the 3 keys, head to the inner jail area if not already there. <br />
From the entry, on the right-hand side is a cage with 2 iksar in it. If the left one is a crazed iksar prisoner, kill it. <br />
The one on the right will either be “an iksar prisoner” or “an enslaved iksar” with gold colored loincloth. This is Argest. <br />
<br />
Give him the 3 keys and recieve the wire that looks like a Dragoon Dirk. <br />
<br />
Directly across from this cell is another cell with 1 goblin in it, and a “pottery wheel”. Left click the “wheel” and put in the 6 scrolls and the “dagger” from Argest, and hit combine. You will now be holding the Stupendous Tome (Lore, No Drop). <br />
<br />
Return to Arch Duke Xog and give him the Stupendous Tome and your Hero's Khukri to receive the Grand Lord Khukri.<br />
<br />
Lord of Pain's Khukri<br />
