<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>cames</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">We had a potential bug in the event last night and wanted to check here to see if it was a bug or I screwed up somehow.  We have a mage bot camped just before FA and do 7 mobs when nothing else is up (MoTG, Prog, FA, 4 Ancients).<br />
<br />
So, I aggroed MoTG and got 2 aggro yells.  At the point where 2 golems should have been released, 4 golems were released.  When we have seen 2 released, there was only 1 aggro yell.<br />
<br />
Has anybody else experienced this or did I do something wrong?<br />
