<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Yahoo, only 2 blues to level 62! I was looking at the level 62 spells and had some comments plus looking for feedback on those who have used them<br />
<br />
1) Touch of Volatis - this makes sense, a faster casting lifetap then drain soul...will definately be used<br />
<br />
2) Deny Undead - ok, if hunting in undead zones maybe it replaces the spear in the lineup for nice damage<br />
<br />
3) Zevfeers Bite - seems like a very benefical group spell, the casters will like this (is this true?)<br />
<br />
4) Bond of Death - Seems to me if it will never make it out of the spellbook. Heavy mana cost and slow casting. (Does anyone use this?)<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">zevfeers is nice never leaves my spell book well except on immune mobs and even thne im tempted ot leave it in heh. deny undead was okay for me on some undead bosses i was doing in luclin at the time besides that i never used. ToV is nice ToI is much much better though. I use bond of deaht occasionally for pvp healing and for healing when im using lvl 64 lich spell and there isn't a chealer around etc oh and occasionally on aoe fights.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Bond of death rarely gets used... although it does have its occaisional use (our most mana efficient lifetap.... I use occaisionally on some ae fights), especially if it's a lengthy fight.<br />
<br />
ToV is of course useful- bear in mind that it's longer recast and slightly less mana efficient than our 60 tap.  Faster cast makes up for it imo.<br />
<br />
Zevfeers- that spell alone will get you groups.  Everyone likes an additional FT10.<br />
<br />
Deny- great undead spell, although scythe of inny (ldon) is superior.  Will sometimes mem both for greater burst damage on undead bosses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Buy Zev's bite.  Words cannot describe how incredible this spell is.<br />
<br />
Touch of volatis is another wonderful spell, though if you group with a cleric you are more likely to spear than tap.<br />
<br />
I never bothered casting BoD after trying it out once and didn't buy deny undead (unless it's on a vendor somewhere).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Menon Lifeblight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">ZB is one of our best spells, period.<br />
<br />
ToV is a nice lifetap.  Unfortunately, I'm still using it.<br />
<br />
Deny Undead is kinda useless now with the LDoN spears.<br />
<br />
BoD is great for farming and AE fights.  I also use it occasionally on a slowed mob that is disease-immune, if I have a lot of mana.  I'm glad I have it, but it's only moderately useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ashigaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I am one of the those freaks that uses Bond of Death. With c5, and Sd, means I can permantly keep the tap portion up.  Which means we don't need a healer in LDoN.<br />
<br />
It may not be the best way to go, I freely admit. <br />
<br />
Ash</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I mem BoD, and ToV along with ToI on Bertox/CT/Quarm.  Thats probably the only time I've used BoD.  I'll frequently have both Touch of *'s up though.  Point being, buy them all, they're all useful in some situation.  Except deny undead  =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">yahoo, got 62 and the first 2 spells, zevfeers and Touch of Volatis...now a follow up question.<br />
<br />
I think in group situations I will be firing off Zevfeers as much as possible, and was thinking it may be time to grind some AA's and get spell casting fury.<br />
<br />
Does Spell casting fury &quot;stack&quot; with Zevfeers...ie: does the health and mana passed back to the group increase?<br />
<br />
Does anyone else think it is wise to stop for some AA's at this point and get spell casting fury before grinding on to the next level?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dester</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If you are looking for the fastest power possible.  Don't stop untill you hit 65.  If you are willing to smell the roses along the way, burn 1 AA pt to get theft of life 1 (chance to double the amount of healing for a life tap) and it works on Z-bite's healing also.<br />
<br />
spell casting fury does not effect the healing portion of Z-bite, only the DD portion to the mob.<br />

<br />
No and no.  Theft of Life can affect the healing portion of ZB, but the mana will always be 100.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>NorrynNoir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">i think bond of death is useful in assassination missions as well as aoe mobs. if you have a good puller who can hand you the boss target and let you choose the spell to pull it's a great thing to pull with, it is basically nice regen during this battle.<br />
<br />
don't worry about aggro as i'm pretty sure it's somewhat capped on a pull cast and you can easily follow this up with CD to cement your hold on it. those are about the only times i use it other than parsing. once i've gotten myself really beat up parsing the effect of AC or ATK or something, it's the most mana efficient way to heal yourself.</div></div><hr />

4) Bond of Death - Seems to me if it will never make it out of the spellbook. Heavy mana cost and slow casting.   <br />
<br />
it's the most mana efficient lifetap. so &quot;heavy mana&quot; is pretty wrong if you need a big heal, just not instantly. I personally use it alot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Daikoku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Is useful when aggro kitting, ae mobs on raids as was mention, or anytime yyou are going to be full burning down mana and still need some healing.<br />
<br />
Still very situational.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Khat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I just recently turned 62 myself and keep Touch of Volatis and Zevfeer's Bite memmed permanently.<br />
<br />
I tend not to use Deny Undead as I recently got Scythe of Death. (comparing the two closely might sway me, though).<br />
<br />
I have yet to use Bond of Death but I'm sure at some point I will give it a try.<br />
<br />
Looking at my logs for 3 consecutive LDoN missions last night I found I landed ZB 122 times, of which there were 26 Exceptional Heal messages due to ToL1.<br />
That's the only other AA I have besides Run3 &amp; Regen3 so that helps ZB out a bit.<br />
<br />
As an aside, ToL1 also gave 5 Exceptional Heals out of 161 Vampire Talon procs and 3 Exceptional Heals out of 60 Touch of Volatis landings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I use bond of death for extra punch when pet kiting (particularly if I've taken damage...) and in raid situations if I can spare the spell slot for the extra burst DPS; the extra healing for AoE's and stuff is never a bad thing either.  Not a spectacular spell and not one that'll get used all the time, but it certainly has its good points, especially before you've gotten ID4, SCF3, and ToL3 to bring ToI near its healing effeciency.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">zevfeer's bite is IMO the best spell SKs get.<br />
it is our most mana efficient dd lifetap, even when ungrouped. it ends up 100 mana for 200hp, has a shorter casting time than ToV/ToI... the only trouble is the healing portion doesn't get a bonus when focused or critted.<br />
it is basically unresistable to everything but completely DR mobs.<br />
<br />
deny undead is better than spears/worse than scythes in undead areas. personally i haven't bought a lower level scythe yet, so in undead areas i nuke constantly with scythe of innoruk, and with deny undead as mana permits.<br />
<br />
<br />
bond of death is good when you're not getting beat on badly, otherwise the casting time is generally too long and you can't channel it. i generally just use it when i'm soloing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sevanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I just got Theft of Life 1 and 2 this weekend and noticed a random double heal from Zevfeers Bite with Theft of Life AA. I had to look carefully to see it in the fight spam but when it works it goes something like this.<br />
<br />
You cast Zevfeers Bite on mob.<br />
<br />
You have done 200+ damage on mob (depending on damage bonuses)<br />
<br />
You have been healed for 200 points<br />
Party member 1 has been healed for 400 points (double heal)<br />
Party member 2 has been healed for 200 points<br />
Party member 3 has been healed for 200 points<br />
party member 4 has been healed for 200 points <br />
Party member 5 has been healed for 200 points. <br />
<br />
When Theft of Life works it seems to pick one of the party (member 1 thru 5) to give a double heal to. With Theft of Life (2) I seem to get a double heal on one member about 1 in 5 or 6 casts. Not sure if Theft of Life (3) will cause more than one party member to get a double heal.<br />
<br />
Has anyone else seen this?<br />
<br />
Aggressive Purfection<br />
65 Ogre SK<br />
Allied Giants<br />
Ayonae Ro</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Saruton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Every single heal you do has the chance to crit, so max would be 6 crit heals for 400 and a critical nuke from the beginning, though its very unlikely to get it. 2 crit heals are quite common, 3 is allready rare, not to mention 4+.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Best I've managed is 3 crit heals with ToL2 and a full group.  ToL checks for a crit heal on every group member when you fire Zev's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Khall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I like Zeefer and Bond of death <br />
<br />
<br />
I tend to pull using one of the Dark lines, as the mob wanders my way I throw bond on it, extra regen never hurt, great for soloing.<br />
<br />
<br />
I haven't really used the undead line , though I have tried on raids Vs Undead to get Evocation up. <br />
<br />
Its around 180 or so.</div></div><hr />
