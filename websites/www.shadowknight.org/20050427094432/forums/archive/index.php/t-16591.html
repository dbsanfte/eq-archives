<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jergory</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have an Iksar Shadowknight.  Ive been playing him for maybe 4 months.  I loooove that toon soo much.  i have a 60 shammy that  i dont even play anymore.  just use/sold his gear for my shadowknight.  not about to delete shammy tho... thats a lot of time invested in him.   yea the whole xp situation with iksars suck balls.. it does take longer.  but so what?  i made it to lvl 54 (presently)  in what seemed like a breeze.  now im getting new spells every level ( the majority of which can still be found in PoKnowledge)  .  the only thing i wish i had as an SK... was the ogre's ability to not be stunned from the front.  i do have pretty decent gear... solely for the reason that the mose uber guild on my serve (vazaelle)  has a few people in it that are real life friends with my bro in law.  so i do get hooked up a lot .   with the added regen abilities of the iksar tho... and the nightvision... and the forage... i mean come on theyre too uber to pass up for a pussy ass dark elf SK... everyone says ogre's are better stat wise in game in higher end levels.  but i say thats bullshyt.  just last night with virtue and focus of soul... plus the... what... 7 or 8  self buffs i have...  HP was well over 4k , AC and ATK were both over 1k , and all my stats but AGI and CHA were over 200.  i dont really know a point to me starting this thread... hmmm... i guess im trying to say if u wanna start a shadowknight... dont let whiny assholes scare u away from the iksar race.    plus iksars look WAAAY more phat with new models on</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shirou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I tend to use older iksar models. The new ones with a custom helm look make me cringe as opposed to the old. That little mask thing was cool, instead of the moon shaped thing that is sideways now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Drynnious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Lol first of all, learn to use puncuation. Secondly, all of the advantages you claimed of an iksar mean jack crap. Regen? haha couple aa's and a few items and the 6hp more won't mean squat. Vision means nothing. Forage is a joke. Wow you have found a pod of water and some roots! GJ!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>jergory</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i hate being flamed by morons... let me just state that at the very beginning.  why would i give a shit about my punctuation?  im posting a thread on a message board about everquest.  i mean come on who really cares how my punctuation is here... are u gonna grade me for my thread?? i think not.  secondly... not everyone is born lvl 65 dreadlord drynnious... u retarded homeless ass Ebay character.  so we dont all have the advantages of AA's from the minute we start playing.  i found it to be a big help.. im sorry you dont agree... actually no im not either..  it is my personal opinion that iksar's make good SK's ,  i could give a shyt less what u think ,  the ONLY thing i think that would make me better would be the ogre's no stun from front ability.  that is certainly a nice addition.  so yes the regen is nice.. and with my regen aa's , my iksar natural regen ability , while sitting w/ my fungi tunic on... i regen like 36 hp a tick.. thats not small time.  when as a lvl 54 SK i have more HP than a same level warrior i need to have that regen on me.  night vision OWNS ne ways.  i always have shadow sight cast on me.  and forage owns (albeit for my own personal reason) because I use it to forage up morning dews which im farming to pay off a debt.  so screw you u dood.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aimbot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Regen? Your xp penatly cancels this out, basically.<br />
<br />
Sight? You can turn up the brightness on your monitor.<br />
<br />
Forage? Eh... yea...<br />
<br />
And as for an iksar being a shadowknight... I can't really see iksars as being evil. More like... hostile and proud... but not evil. DE, Ogres, and Trolls. Now these guys are evil.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>jergory</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">honestly your right... the regen iksar ability is a crappy trade off for the BS XP we get...   but  turning brightness up on your monitor doesnt do anything to help u see lol... atleast not on my monitor.  forage isnt ne thing special either... but like i said it helps me w/ what im doing.  personally i love the iksar race.  ive had a barb warr ... and barbs suck.   i regularly go to halas to kill that douchebag bandll ... i hate that guy.  i dont see how u thin iksars arent evil tho... heh... i mean we tried to conquer all of norrath... dont get much more evil than that... were the germans of EQ... put up a valiant effort but ultimately got our asses kicked... now theres just a few hardcore iksars runnin around here and there...   the only other race for SK i would even think about playing is ogre.  trolls are stupid just cause the way they look  (new ogre models OWWWN)  ,  and dark elves are... well... elves.. i mean come on.  theyre just a step above gnome SK's which is also ridiculous.  id kick a gnome SK in the throat... simple as that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aimbot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yea I've also been thinking about starting an iksar SK, but ended up with picking ogre... maybe because I played an Ogre warrior before.<br />
<br />
Iksars are cool tho. Awesome to roleplay (like ogres). And I guess you're right. Iksars are evil. Just look closer at their player model... it's like they are gonna jump out and bite your head off :)<br />
<br />
Yeah.. anyway. When you meet a good Iksar roleplayer it's an awesome experience. Well, just like any race, but I mean how exactly do you roleplay a human or a wood / half elf? Other races are harder to roleplay (except Ogres and Trolls).<br />
<br />
I mean when a monk in your group says &quot;Ssssilly halfling... methinkssss you will be good for breakfassst&quot; to the druid... that's priceless.</div></div><hr />

You need some of these:<br />

Essence of Ogre (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=21168) <br />
<br />
Just as elf illusions will give a human infravision, ogre illusions will endow the recipient with the unstnnable nature of the ogre.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Mahsk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If I had it to do over again I would have picked Troll over Iksar. My reasons:<br />
<br />
Unless your in a raiding guild you get screwed on good &quot;buyable&quot; armor. The 50ac bonus does not make up for not being able to wear BD Cultural, not even close.<br />
<br />
Trolls have better starting combat stats<br />
<br />
Get to keep the nice regen at 65 which almost negates &quot;pact&quot; all by itself.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Supersk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">IMO Iksar are the best race for Sk's Secand would be troll though and Don't BS yourself the regen of both isa godsend we can cancel out the 64 lich and out regen some dot's. Yes the no decent buyable armor does blow but it is justa set back  at lower levels with Pop and newer loot it don't mean jack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Roril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">ok  from my experiences this is what i think.....<br />
Iksars are better in end game....regen cant be made up for in AAs(well at least not the huge regen u get base at 65 since u can only get like 7 regen from AAs) stats dont make a huge difference because in end game odds are u are maxing them fairly easily with gear/buffs....and if u have trouble then work on gettin ancient prismatic weapons. although ogres do have a pulling advantage since they cant be stunned from the front so when casting FD they probably die less. and trolls are basically iksars with better stats / faction.<br />
All that it is is a giant trade off....                                                     do u want regen and visibility?<br />
do u want regen and stats?<br />
do u want to not get stunned and stats?<br />
<br />
Just personal preferance....i hated my SK cause of exp penalty til i hit 65~<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ronoh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">For you guys/gals saying forage is useless... well... not in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
<br />
Recently, I lost cable and have had a hard time raiding even with things turned off cause my dialup connection sucks ass.  So... instead of pouting about it, I figured I go cash grind in Old Seb (ghost town now after LDoN release) for awhile and get minor exp as a plus.<br />
<br />
I planned on being in there a while and had emptied all my bags except for my stat food/water and my other normal right clickies.  I brought 1 stack of foraged food and water from plane of time (miraculous meal and miraculous drink, foraged mind you).  I force feed myself normal foraged food and water before I left East Cabilis for the run to Seb.<br />
<br />
I get to Seb and work my way down to the library (in the disco areas) for my camp spot.  I don't have a second account and I'm not BOTing, only self buffs.  Working down isn't to bad, but it can get hairy if you don't time the spawns correctly.  Anyway... I stayed there for 2 weeks, pulled over 30k in gems and vendor items, plus some of the old rare items that I haven't sold yet, and I never once worried of running out of food/water.  Also, at the end of my stint, I still had all my stat food/water I started with and the food/water I foraged from Plane of Time.  Hence, I don't have to pay to replenish my expensive stat food.<br />
<br />
To most, this is no big deal, but to be a totally self sufficient SK without having to worry about anything but killing, forage is an added bonus being Iksar since it's the only SK race with the ability.<br />
<br />
This is just one person's opinion, your milage may vary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>greenbucket</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Jergory.. you suck. -Kenada.<br />
<br />
before you go out to group again make sure you grab those shammy buffs and kei, otherwise you'd have to play as an iksar, and not closer to what an ogre would be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>DrakainShadescale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Iksar, imo opinion tie or come in a near near second to ogres as the best end game SK class.<br />
<br />
The people who claim that the innate regenerations that iksar have isn't worthless really don't know what they're talking about.  I mean, it's MORE regeneration then what's available to every other race except troll without requiring the use of an equipment slot.  Similarly, the innate regeneration is an important factor for our lich spells which, despite what a few folks seem to believe, is very useful, more so in LDoN.  The very few times that I have died as tank, when we didn't have a chanter, my mana regeneration was largely uneffect and, when we did, they didn't have to cast VoQ just to get me mana regeneration.  Not to mention the enourmous benefit that the regeneration as been, for me at least, when pulling or doing sustained AE encounters.<br />
<br />
The other advantage that iksar have is that we have innate AC.  This AC is something that gets added to ANYTHING WE WEAR.  Meaning, we will have MORE ac, then any other race who has the same stats and same equipment as we do.  This might not seem like much, but the faster you reach the &quot;AC cap&quot;, the more flexibility you'll get with your armor and the effect that armor carries.<br />
<br />
The experience hit is largely imaginery, at least in my experience.  While I know we require a little more exp to level, in the end it has not prevented me from leveling as fast, or even faster, then my other friends who play roughly as much as I do.  And while I haven't investigated it closely, I STRONGLY suspect that racial exp hits does not effect AA exp.<br />
<br />
Also, as someone has already correctly observed, any SK can enjoy the benefits of ogre unstunnablility by simply buying a potion or by getting the spell cast on them.<br />
<br />
But in the end, play what you enjoy most.  If you're a roleplayer, and you want to be really &quot;evil&quot; then play what suits you.  You'll have more fun.  IMO iksar aren't &quot;evil&quot; the same way DE or ogres or trolls are.  We don't activitly seek out to undermine the world around us, we're merely the remants of once great very xenophobic and corrupt empire.<br />
<br />
IE Drakain is basically a megalomaniac with, uh, liberal dietary habits, but he doesn't seek to spread death and decay everywhere he goes.  Just conquer and defeat :)<br />
<br />
One more thing, you may not want to delete your lvl 60 shammy :rolleyes:  They're very handy to have</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Razoren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">My first post btw. Don't hurt me too bad.<br />
<br />
I play a Iksar. I picked him for the way he looked. ac bonus, regen, and forage. I also took into consideration leveling the slowest race/class combination in the game. I am now level 54 with just over ten days played. I don't find XP bad at all. You just need to find the right groups and the right place to fight. It's like real estate; LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION. I now spend 90% of my time in LDON. Whether we win or not, the xp is good, the loot is good, and the possibility to gain points which can in turn be traded for items is nice. The augs are also nice.<br />
<br />
Anyway, to the point here. People pick what they pick for certain reasons. I don't think that Iksars have a gigantic leap all over races, nor do I think the same of ogres. I think we should focus on the class more and not the race. Every race has it's advantages and disadvantages, you just need to accept your fate, decisions and outcome and have a good time.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW-I still find it entertaining to give fellow Iksar SKs a Cabilis Ale and saying &quot;A beverage from the homelands&quot; and sharing a drink..<br />

Personally, I feel shafted with race and I would never be an Iksar if someone allowed me to 'convert' to another race. Low STA and, at least on my server, no one making cultural armor even close to DE or Ogre/Troll makes it really tough to get good AC even with the bonus. The XP penalty I've found pretty brutal...when I calculated how much XP I had compared to friends I was really shocked.<br />

The Iksar Cultural Armor is laughable and simply put, for the two plate classes (warrior and sk) it isn't worth even having.  I used to make the Iksar Cultural (on Brell) and got to the point where I was pretty much giving it away (meaning very very cheap sales).  Even the shamans wouldn't really use it.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure how long you have had your Iksar SK, but if you want to speak of Exp penalty, talk to some of the Iksar SK's who have been around since the beginning of Kunark.  I stuck it out, through the days of no armor, horrendous exp penalties, etc.  I enjoy my Leezard SK and will never give it up.<br />
<br />
Ultimately, at the end game, the race of your sk is just simply the in-game persona.  Comparing race to race, we can all do the same things, just as good as the other race.  <br />
<br />
Ogre no stun from the front might be desired by lots, but beyond the occasional annoyance of being stunned, the effect of being stunned does nothing to agro, etc....so I don't care that I don't have it.  I don't loose agro and in the end, thats what it's all about.<br />
<br />
Low stamina (as with all your stats), choosing your gear wisely and with the help of AA's, everyone ends up with the same stamina (I'm maxed stam/int/str unbuffed...as with most high level sk's).  <br />
<br />
It's never to late to restart your toon, if you think you've made a mistake and prefer another race...start over.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Reflan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Actually one big fat scrambled paragraph full of jumbled half-sentences does make for a very lousy read.  If you're writing only for yourself, you might as well just think it, though I hope your thoughts don't clunk and stumble in your head the way they do on the page.  If you're writing to actually be read, then it's not all about you anymore, so you might as well get used to treating the reader right if you want people to bother reading anything you have to say at all.<br />
<br />
When it comes to regen, you can eventually get 18 regen standing, which is no small thing over time.  The fact that everyone can pay a lot of AA points to get a few more regen doesn't change that, and it sure doesn't change the AA you have to put into it any more attractive.  How many people really go for the regen AA anyway?  I would bet very few, until they've gotten many AA for other reasons -- run speed, natural durability, HT improvements, planar power, horse, whatever.  Innate regen will be the only regen most people have for a very, very long time.<br />
<br />
Night vision?  Bad night vision sucks, but it can be dealt with.  Stil sucks though.<br />
<br />
Forage is completely a joke.<br />
<br />
Experience penalty?  The regen more than makes up for it.  I have a 60 iksar monk and he leveled like lightning compared to my human monk.  And also compared to my 65 ogre shaman, my ogre warrior, and my ogre SK.  Regen is a huge help leveling pre-60.  <br />
<br />
Troll/iksar penalties are 20% and ogre is 15%.  A 20% penalty  really stinks.  My ogres, with a 15% penalty, took much longer to hit 60 than all my friends did.  Very often, in the same groups, they would join the group later than I did and leave earlier, but with more experience.  That can lead to no small moping on my part sometimes.  It adds up to a few levels over the run to 60.  You'll notice it, all right.<br />
<br />
But the 5% penalty for being a troll/iksar compared to being an ogre is nothing at all -- certainly nothing when you have regen to compensate for it to help get you through the lower levels.  And it doesn't suck at high levels either, though it's not as astounding as it is at the lower levels.  Having taken my iksar monk to 60 and 18 AA's and leveled other toons up pretty high too, with and without fungi's, I respect regen a lot.<br />
<br />
My ogre SK still tanks great at 59 with a fungi on, though he has a nice cultural BP with over 50 AC, no dex/agi penalties to it unlike the fungi, and 60 HP.  That's a lot of levels at which regen is still godly.   When I eventually tank tougher PoP mobs, I'll take off the fungi.  When I just do DPS though...  <br />
<br />
On non-stunnability, ogres can be interrupted like anyone else, just not stunned from the front.  So they can fail their FD's etc. just like everyone else.  It's just that they won't spend time stunned before being able to try again, which is pretty nice.<br />
<br />
On being cool, both ogres and lizards are very cool looking IMO and have a nice feeling of menace to them.  I get a kick out of playing both.<br />
<br />
On things like STA, my ogre at 59 has 249 STA unbuffed even not wearing some of his gear with STA on it; he could get over 260 no problem if not for the cap and if he swapped some gear around.  <br />
<br />
STA and STR don't matter in the end game, as by that point you'll either be raiding and maxed through buffs or have enough friends or bump into enough friendly shamans that you will be able to get STA buffs pretty easily most places you go.  <br />
<br />
DEX you can max get very high with a focus spell, and if you are a higher end toon, you may even be lucky enough to have a primal/prismatic to top out your DEX.<br />
<br />
AGI can remain problematic, but luckily it rarely means much to the game, or to you personally unless you hit a &quot;breakpoint.&quot;  Sometimes you can get 8 extra AGI and you get 1 more AC out of it; but sometimes just 1 extra AGI point and you shoot up 8 AC for it.  Swapping gear in and out to watch that happen can be kind of fun and enlightening.  Not to mention bugged--sometimes you'll get two different AC values swapping the same gear in, then in again after taking it out.  Logging in and out fixes it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Winkles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I'm starting to run into some serious problems with my Iksar SK.  I am not in a high end guild and will never see the end game.  Lately I have quit leveling and just spent time working on aa because on several occasions I have been told I am a mana sink when I am MT.  A druid or shaman can not keep up with heals on me and no matter how well I hold aggro I am usually asked to give up the MT spot to a paladin or warrior of lower level.  It's truly embarrasing.  I don't have alot of money and the things that are buyable for an iksar are just too expensive to upgrade.  My ac is 1068 and my hp are 2860 at lvl 55.  I'm thinking of switching races because of the nice items other races can have.  The clockwork stuff for gnomes is really nice and way cheaper than the stuff I can buy for my Iksar.  Though I like the idea of playing an Iksar I believe I'm going to have to try another race.  I just can't keep up with people who expect you to have 1200+ ac and 3k hp.  And I don't want to have a bad reputation and not get any groups.  Any other Iksars having this problem?<br />

If you're just doing tier 1 I don't see why you would be having any problems.  It sounds like you've got better gear than I do, and I've never noticed any complaining.<br />
<br />
It looks to me that the problem resides with the healers rather than you.  A shaman is a non-optimal PoP healer, and dr00ds don't get CH until 58.  Go with a cleric and you should be fine.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Ruuti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Winkles you are making the biggest mistake,  the fastest way to get away from being a mana sink is to get the levels.  The strongest method of Damage mitigation in the game is to get higher levels.  At 55 there is no armor out there that any SK can wear that you can't wear to.  Problem as I see it,  you are trying to think like a warrior when you need to think a little more like a Knight.  I had the same problem you did and asked for advice a couple weeks ago.  The answers I got were awesome.  Try LDON.  The eventual loots there are fantastic,  and the mobs hit lighter than they do in the plains. Honestly man you are just experiancing what everyone else did at your level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>senor sperro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">ruuti what u talking about, as an ogre or troll they have NICE cultural armors, like a 25ac bracer with stamina hp and saves...  that is nice gear that iksars cant wear..<br />
<br />
winkles u should definately hit the leveling instead of aaxp because levels are greater than aaxp in all situations...<br />
<br />
the problem might be u not knowing how to tank effeciently, ie cant hold agro things like that or it could be your groupmates are the problem, but at that lvl i was tanking lightcrawlers in PoD with pretty shitty gear, worse ac and hp than what u had at that lvl<br />
<br />
just make sure u are being a good tank and you should not have a problem</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Winkles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I've been told I tank quite well.  If tanking means holding aggro and not letting anyone esle get hit that is.  I think that maybe people are just getting used to toons that are geared a certain way and expect everyone else to be geared the same way.  I've been asked in game by another iksar sk who asked if I had equipment problems and I told him yes.  He said he was thinking about starting over as well.  I don't understand about the leveling going to help me tank.  It would seems that the mobs get tougher as I level and my stuff stays the same.  So what I've decided to do is pretty much farm cash till I can buy enough stuff to get me to 1100ac and 3k hp and see if that helps at all.  If not then I think I'll cash my stuff in and start a necro.   At least I can solo for a long time on my own off hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Dharkenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">only reason i didnt play an iksar SK all the way to 65 was cause thier cultral sucks ass<br />
<br />
played a iksar sk till 40 before i relized it...<br />
<br />
now i am an 65 ogre sk...i am loving it<br />
<br />
the no stun aspect is awesome...and as for the iksar regen...guess what...if i use an iksar potion, i get iksar regen and i still remain unstunable<br />
<br />
is what i use when soloing, but besides that not worth the time for me<br />
<br />
as for someones stats, by the time u hit 65 and have decent gear, you wont be looking for items with STA on it... you will be looking for items with less STA and more RAW HPS...trust me...280 base STA...is nice for when soloing...got more hp's, but i dont get any extra hp's from Sta buffs...<br />
<br />
when it comes down to it, no matter what race you play, they are all awesome...<br />
<br />
its the person behind the toon that determins if thier char is any good or not</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Ciypher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Last I checked, admitedely a while ago, Iksar Illusion didn't give you regen, or at least my rogues mask didn't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Sabshail1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Taunt (button) still works when stunned (receiving a successful taunt message).  About the only time I have lost agro while I was &quot;stunned&quot; was due to a hard nuke or a CH.  But then again, those can steal agro stunned or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Dragantis Xy`Rath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I skipped over most of this, but I noticed that some one made refference to the Ogre Illusion Potions....I have used those in the past and the illusion did not stop me from being stunned. I still got stunned when tanking, spinning and all. It gives you the ability to Slam, but I could never get it to land, so I don't even know if that works either.<br />
<br />
The last time I used a potion was about 2 months ago, so I suppose this could have changed since then, but I have never seen the potion stop you from getting stunned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Dredmor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Had a friend get project illusion, and automatically asked for ogre. Still stunned. So I went with illusion:fire elemental. With a mage and Cloak, you've got 60-ish? ds. I don't know for sure. Think it was 50's then, but I didn't have cloak. Mage, Cloak and illusion all stack ds's. Very nice.<br />
Anyhow, don't give up. Iksar is worth it. 27 standing/31 sitting. If I'm low on hp's I drop pact and sit. Low on mana. Pact and still regen hp's. 59 was pure and simply hell. I'd been through the old hell levels with other toons. Did 59 after they &quot;fixed&quot; them. Was the most god-awfully slow level I've ever had. Get through that with any race and your SK really gets good. Bah! I sleep now, rambling.<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I have a lvl 62 DE SK... and in all honesty, i've considered re-rolling as an iksar SK, except for the fact that i've put SO much time into mine. <br />
<br />
I agree with so much of what people have said, that race doesn't matter much, because, yes, any and all racial abilities (except for possibly regen, because any regen anyone else can get, you get too, + your race regen) can be duplicated with spells/AAs.<br />
<br />
There is only one thing that anyone has said that I don't agree with is:<br />

You shouldn't say things like that.... the race doesn't make the SK, the person behind it makes the SK.... and honestly, if you were on my server i would teach you some respect for DEs.... <br />
Yes, we may be blue, skinny (though sexy as all hell), and possibly even little intelligent weaklings. Any good DE SK (or any good SK at all for that matter) would utterly destroy some retard iksar like you any day though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Zantor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I have a 59 Iksar SK, I prefer the lizzy's, but that my oponion, as with any race it comes down to gear and player ability, granted we can't get alot of good gear till higher lvls but still some out there.  I've been Tanking in PoV since 58 and PoS since 55 and the cleric i'm usually with can melee to cause I don't bleed to much..hehe<br />
<br />
At 59 I have 3269 HP and 1305 AC unbuffed, so there is nice gear out there for us, just have get farm Plat and look in Bazaar alot.  Soon I wanna do ND3 AA's, only have 6 AA ATM....run3 and regen3.  As with any race you look at what your lacking and get gear to make up for it,  most of the time my str, dex, agi and sta is maxed at 255 or very close to it depending on buffs.  All races are good, but SK's in general ROCK..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>ZarrosLivinglight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">As long as you are in a level-appropriate group in a level-appropriate zone, gear &gt; levels for tanking ability.  If you are 55 and in teir1 PoP, or LDoN, and are a walking manasponge its time to STOP levelling and start working on some defensive AAs and farming cash to find better quality armor.  If you are in teir2 and trying to tank at 55, IMHO you are asking to be a manasponge, because regardless of gear PoV/PoS are really 60+ zones, and 60+ *well equipped* zones at that.  Being a tank is all about having the gear to survive the beating you aquire, well that and being able to hold aggro, but shadow knights are good at the latter to begin with.<br />
<br />
Face it, a level 65 warrior in crafted armor is going to be a crappy tank in BoT/HoH because being level 65 itself does not magically make you uber.  It can open doors, help you get groups, and let you (possibly) get into better raiding guilds (if thats your thing) where you can get better gear.  But by itself, post-60, levels alone mean nearly nothing.  Post-60 you need the spells, weapons, and gear as well, or else you will suck.  And if you suck bad enough, long enough, no amount of levelling will overcome the stigma you *will* aquire as a terrible tank.<br />
<br />
As far as the iksar goes.  I have an iksar SK on the firiona vie server (which is the real reason I loiter and lurk here.)  From a role-playing standpoint the iksar aren't so much evil in the same sense of the world as dark elves, ogres, and trolls, as they are very alien in their mindset, and utterly amoral.  Iksar are very cold emotionally, being almost without them in the mammalian sense.  What they value is honor, loyalty, and power.  An iksar shadow knight spreads fear (which is what their god wants) merely by existing and pursuing their goals.  Imagine a race of super-intelligent velociraptors (based on the ones in the 1st Jurassic Park novel, not the movie) and you get the sort of pack (expanded to their empire) and hunter mentality that pervades iksar racial psychology.<br />
<br />
Its interesting, but on Firiona Vie, the all-iksar RP guild Skathris Ven'Sho, who are die-hard Cabilis loyalists, find themselves more often working with good-race guilds than evil-race guilds, although they aren't especially chummy with anyone obviously ;)</div></div><hr />
