<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So I was browsing the FoH forums.. I do that sometimes because it can be very entertaining, like the Jerry Springer show (only less classy), and I came across this gem.  The trick is old and the thread is old, but I haven't gotten this good a laugh in a while.<br />

I knew it was a derivitive of that old thing where they'd use you're EZ board account to make a psuedo-flame about you, but I didn't know exactly what it was supposed to be doing.  I don't have an everquest folder, you see.</div></div><hr />
