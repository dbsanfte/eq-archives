<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>skang01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Warning: this is another thread where someone complains about SKs being the worst of the tanks for no good reason.<br />
<br />
THE PROBLEM:<br />
<br />
We are clearly the worst mitigators of the 3 tanking classes, but what is our strength?  Dealing damage?  No one is going to invite us into a group because of that unless what they're fighting trivial content.  Basically, for a comparably equipped/AA'd warrior, pally, and SK:<br />
<br />
1.  Warrior is the best tank where maximum mitigation is essential, especially defensive.<br />
<br />
2.  Pally is the best tank for exp mobs because he has aggrolock and the 2nd best mitigation in the game.  He also makes the best offtank in raids for the same reasons, in addition to his ability to heal others, radiant cure, and BSS.<br />
<br />
3. SKs are the best tanks at.... trivial encounters where survivability isn't a factor and where the extra DPS is nice?  Useful in VERY few situations where there are no monks to FD split or necros to summon corpse.<br />
<br />
It seems kinda unbalanced that we're  never the *preferred* class for anything.  Well, other than tanking trivial encounters, which is probably one of the most boring aspect of EQ next to skillups.  In any challenging content with a risk of dying, you'd rather have a pally over an SK.<br />
<br />
True, not all classes have to be preferred at something.  Druids get by just fine but only because they have INCREDIBLE utility, second only to bards.  Beastlords have less utility than druids but by far more utility than SKs and also output better damage.  SKs, as they are now, are probably one of the least desirable class for a group or raid.  Who's more undesirable? Monks?  The 2nd shaman?  <br />
<br />
The problem is that all other hybrids (BL, pally, ranger) are built from parent classes that help their groups and raids (all priests in fact).  SKs, on the other hand, are built from a class that's reknown for soloing.  If you remove our ability to solo, where the hell does that leave us?<br />
<br />
POSSIBLE SOLUTION: SHORT DURATION SLOW<br />
<br />
Provide us with a quick casting, low resistance, very short duration slow.   Something like a 50% disease slow that lasts 2-3 ticks with a recast time of 3 minutes.  This would be consistent with the fact that our spells are harmful, yet increase our mitigation and provide true group and raid utility. <br />
<br />
In raids, this slow would carve out our niche as the best pre-slowers.  In groups, this slow could also be used as emergency CC on an add until someone could root or mez it.  It's not game breaking nor does it displace any other class.<br />
<br />
EDIT: I had some stuff about how Zevfeer's Bite should be upgraded but decided it was minor and removed it</div></div><hr />

Does that mean you don't like the idea?  What's wrong with it?  <br />
<br />
This idea manufactures a completely new line of ability for us rather than building on what we already have.  Having too many things you can do causes two problems: <br />
<br />
1) Other classes see all you can do and are jealous and believe that you are more powerful than you already are allowing your class not to get upgrades in power when all the others do to fix a percieved balance issue when none existed.  or <br />
<br />
2) Now whenever that class gets upgrades the developers pick which lines scale up and which don't, having more disc or spell lines means more of your abilities don't scale up and become useless after a certain point.  Combine #2 with the thought that apparently the developers don't play the class you are talking about and your suggestion opens up a whole world of trouble.<br />
<br />
The box may be pretty, Pandora, but put it down and go look into other ideas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>aress</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Brael is cranky taday :)<br />
<br />
We cannot get slow, that would be stepping on Sham/ench/BL toes way too much.  It can only upset such classes, and SOE will not dare to do so.  This is an absolute no no.  Same as asking for res, haste buffs, mes, etc..  Will never happen.<br />
<br />
Suggestions should be limited on improving our tankability or dps.<br />
<br />
By the way, paladins have the same innate mitigation  as we do.  They take less damage in exp groups because their stuns actually land, and the mob misses hits while being stunned.  Their aggro spells are fast casting and higher aggro than most of ours, therefore, they do get aggro a tad sooner and more solid than we do under most circumstances.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">50% slow? <br />
Sounds like a bard song... Bards and BST can preslow in raids and xp groups.<br />
<br />
I don't think that is what I want to do on raids though... pre slow for a few ticks? <br />
<br />
We are tanks, when we tank in general if the mob is slowable it's slowed failry quickly, why in the hell would we have a slow if it wouldn't land if the mobs is already slowed, how would a slow that won't land help us mitigate damage better?<br />
<br />
&quot;The Problem&quot; is I don't think you have even close to a full grasp on what the problem is and your solution directly reflects this lack of understanding.<br />
<br />
Don't take it the wrong way though, I'm not all high and mighty either. As I advance in the game I see the problems being talked about on these forums more clearly. I don't have all the details on  &quot;the problems&quot; and I sure as hell don't have &quot;the solutions&quot;, but I do beleive I have a better understanding than you do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Skang, start a warrior if SK's suck so bad.<br />
<br />
Please god, don't ever give us slow.  Of any kind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>skang01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">By the way, paladins have the same innate mitigation as we do. They take less damage in exp groups because their stuns actually land, and the mob misses hits while being stunned. <br />
<br />
Yes, pallys gain a mitigation advantage through their spells.  In addition to stuns, heals also increase the mitigation (since they effectively reduce damage taken).  It's also noteworthy that having a pally in the group/raid increases the mitigation for whoever is tanking because the pally himself doesn't have to be MT for his spells to be effective.  SKs' only way to increase mitigation is through lifetaps and that doesn't work unless they're the tank.<br />
<br />
<br />
We are tanks, when we tank in general if the mob is slowable it's slowed failry quickly, why in the hell would we have a slow if it wouldn't land if the mobs is already slowed, how would a slow that won't land help us mitigate damage better?<br />
<br />
The idea would be that its quick casting and has a good resist check.  Bards cannot reliably preslow, even in LDoNs hards, because their slows check off MR and doesn't have a great resist adjust.   Besides, you don't always have a bard or beastlord in group.  <br />
<br />
Any worthwhile raid mob is going to have high MR and you're gonna need to tash and malo on it  before you can land any debuffs.   If an SK can reliably preslow on incoming, it gives the slowers that much time to debuff without any fear of pulling aggro.  After slowing, you can immediately harmshield to drop the aggro generated by it.  As it is now, most slowers wait a few sconds after someone starts tanking to slow due to aggro concerns (even with a knight MT).<br />
<br />
The beauty of a 50% slow for 3 ticks is that it wouldn't displace any of the slower classes.  Shaman, beastlord, enchanters slows are all higher than this, so ultimately you will want to have their slow on a mob.  The advantage here would be that it is quick casting, and that we can absorb the punishment  we'll take by aggroing early.  I guarantee you that a mob isn't going to be slowed for at least the first 10 seconds its engaged, and this is where our slow could shine.<br />
<br />
50% slow, lasting for 18 seconds, every 3 minutes would basically mean that we would keep a mob slowed 10%.  Assuming the mob doesn't mitigate (although most do nowadays), this would be a minimum 5% increase in mitigation for us.  Its not game breaking, but nice to have.<br />
<br />
The additional bonus is that we don't have to be main tanks for this to work.  We would effectively mitigate 5% for whoever was taking, a la pally stuns and heals.  This slow could also be a viable method of CCing, by slowing an add and giving others time to root or mez it.<br />
<br />
Anyway, Keevel has a valid point about us obtaining a new line of spells.  Given the state of GoD spells, I don't think Sony is either creative enough, or has any desire, to introduce new abilities to a class.  In terms of it being a Pandora's Box, however, it definitely doesn't have to be that way.  It's true for any class that subsequent designers may screw them by nerfing/inappropriately scaling abilities.     When this happens, you can bitch to Sony about it then.  However, as things stand, I'd be willing to risk a lot of our spell lines (with the exception of darkness and zevfeer's) if we could get an ability like this slow.<br />
<br />
The problem with building off our current abilities is the fact that we're the hybrid of a soloing DPS class.  First, you can't combine a group dependent class with one that solos because then it won't complement the other group members.  Second, you can't combine a tank and DPS if it wants to do either decently.  Suggestions I see are always about increasing SK damage, but you can't really do this without threatening the lower end DPS classes, namely rangers, beastlords, monks*, and perhaps wizards in high uptime groups.  Having the worst tanking ability of the tanks and the worst DPS of the DPS classes is an unenviable position to be in.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying this slow is the only way to get class balance or anything, but it would address some of the concerns I have about our class with minimal reprecussion to other classes.</div></div><hr />

You know nothing of Bards, they have this spell its called Harmony of Sound, it's better than Malo.<br />

<br />
Raid mobs really don't have high MR anymore, slow mitigation coding allows that gimp method of limiting encounter difficulty to be avoided.  Also, the vast majority of the mobs being talked about that cause us to not be desireable are unslowable.  Also, our Shaman chain click their spears the second the mob is in range, no one waits for aggro anymore, that aspect of the game has been trivialized at this point.<br />

<br />
Speaking as someone at the current &quot;end game&quot; (where the problem lies) I would never mem that spell, I can't think of an SK in my posistion that would.<br />
<br />

We do mitigate damage in a sense, by killing the mob faster, but that value varies alot.<br />

SK's make damn good tanks, better than Paladins the problem is that neither us or Paladins stack up to mobs appropriatley.</div></div><hr />

I would love to see you try and prove that a paladin mitigates damage better than an sk.  Aside from mobs that arnt immune to stun, where the melee damage is merely avoided by stun, not mitigated a paladin will never ever mitigate damage better than you simply because or aura of pain.  Paladins self buff is hps and 30 ac, and of course as we all should know hps do not mitigate damage, ac does.  Compare that to aura of pain, which you get rougly 100 ac from, thats a 70 ac difference, which is retardedly huge.  Again this is assuming the same gear, and the same gear is 100% attainable.<br />
<br />
Mitigation is simply the average hit a mob does to a character over time, and in every instance assuming all things equal aside form self buffs, an sk will beat a paladin.  Self healing, stuns, ect are NOT mitigation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You have no imagination.  I agree a spell like this wouldn't revolutionize the SK class.  They do have a lot of things that make them &quot;nice,&quot; but nothing that quite pushes into the realm of consistently useful.   This would just be something that would nudge their desirability up a bit without breaking class balance.<br />
<br />
Perhaps in the end-game with a group that is all decked out in PoTime gear, a spell like this would not find usefullness.  But for the other 90% of SKs out there, I think this would provide a lot of utility.  I know quite a few hybrid tanks that have a rough time in LDoN 63+ hards (mostly in pickup groups I've been in).  Having some additional mitigation will save clerics some med time (and yes many clerics and shaman do have to med in LDoN hards). <br />
<br />
Maybe the issue is that you're somewhat out of touch with what most people have to deal with.  Although I don't have any statistics to back this up, I would wager that MOST people are not decked out in PoTime loot, or even elemental loot for that matter.  If you feel the end-game is balanced for SKs, I won't dispute that.  But there is a large population of SKs out there that are in the position I'm describing (i.e. where you're the worst of the tanks and worst of the DPS classes).  <br />
<br />
For all those people who say you &quot;just need better gear,&quot; that still says nothing about class balance.  It's only fair to compare classes in cases where gear and AAs are equal.  My contention is that for tanks of equal level gear/AAs, SKs are at a distinct disadvantage without much to offset that.  Of course if SKs spent twice as much effort gearing and AAing than the other classes we could remedy this, but the fact that we have to do so much more just to get on equal footing with the other classes should indicate class imbalance.<br />
<br />
<br />
I would love to see you try and prove that a paladin mitigates damage better than an sk. Aside from mobs that arnt immune to stun, where the melee damage is merely avoided by stun, not mitigated a paladin will never ever mitigate damage better... <br />
<br />
Notice I said paladins make the best &quot;exp tanks&quot; (i.e. tanks for exp groups).  This is entirely because most exp mobs ARE stunnable.  Mitigation, as I use it, means the ability to reduce the net damage incurred.  Slows, stuns, heals, AC, and AAs all reduce the net damage a tank receives, so I lump them all as mitigation.  Would you not consider Lightning Reflexes and Combat Agility as mitigation because &quot;melee damage is merely avoided...not mitigated.&quot;  If you don't want to include stuns and heals as mitigation then whatever, it's just semantics.<br />
<br />
As a side note, I was thinking about ways to make the spell a bit more useful.  Perhaps if it was weighted more front heavy, so it would still last 3 ticks but was a 75% slow for 1 tick, 50% slow for the next tick, then 25% slow for the final tick.  Would still have an average of 50% slow, but would be nice because that first tick would be the max slow possible.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I realize this spell has a snowball's chance in hell of entering the game but just wanted to throw the idea out there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">See, that latest reply just fully destroyed your argument for this spell.  In your own words &quot;end game this spell isn't useful&quot;, what you and alot of others don't seem to get is that the current end game is where the problem first appears so any change should be aimed at that portion of the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>skang01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I said PERHAPS it isn't and can't say for sure because I'm not there.  I have my doubts simply because more mitigation is more mitigation regardless.  A good analogy is our pets.  Yes, at face value they suck but more DPS is more DPS.  <br />
<br />
While this slow may not be used on every occasion, there would be uses for it (i.e. when the healers in your group are OOMing), and you want to trade DPS for mitigation.  (BTW I recognize what you said about DPS being a type of mitigation, but if you look at the tradeoff in DPS vs. total group DPS, its going to be less than 5% easy).</div></div><hr />

2.  Pally is the best tank for exp mobs because he has aggrolock and the 2nd best mitigation in the game.  He also makes the best offtank in raids for the same reasons, in addition to his ability to heal others, radiant cure, and BSS.<br />
  <br />
<br />
With stuns working again for high lvl content, technically a pal can have better mitigation then a warrior under the right conditions.  One stun can avoid over 4 k damage.  I couldnt understand why a pal was having such an easier time in god tanking then me, but the answer was simple...effective use of stun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>aspit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">mitigation is the average damage per hit a player takes over an extended period of time.<br />
<br />
avoidance is the % rate at which a mob hits and misses.<br />
<br />
Utility tanking = heals to counter dps, stuns to counter dps, riposte or melee invuln disc ect.<br />
<br />
These are the 3 components for tanking.  You clearly stated that paladins were the second best mitigating class in all of eq all things equal.  This is a 100% incorrect statement, as shadow knights will take less average damage per hit over a period of time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Belyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Fine.  The sum of mitigation and avoidance makes paladins superior tanks situationally.</div></div><hr />
