<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Brrrrr! Anyone feel a draft? <br />
<br />
http://www.military.com/NewsContent/0,13319,FL_irs_051804,00.html<br />
<br />
The Defense Department, strapped for troops for missions in Iraq and Afghanistan, has proposed to Congress that it tap the Internal Revenue Service to locate out-of-touch reservists.  <br />
<br />
http://www.prospect.org/weblog/archives/2004/05/index.html#003014<br />
<br />
<br />
A friend of mine who is currently an inactive Army reservist forwarded me some memos he received regarding future mobilizations -- memos that indicate that we are not far from some kind of conscription in the next few years. According to my friend, recruiters are telling inactive reservists that they're going to be called up one way or another eventually, so they might as well sign up now and get into non-Iraq-deploying units while they still can. There's also a &quot;warning order&quot; -- i.e., a heads-up -- from the Army's personnel command that talks about the involuntary transfer of inactive reservists to the active reserves, and thus into units that are on deck for the next few Iraq rotations. <br />
<br />
My understanding of how reserve call-ups work is imperfect, but if memory serves, the inactive reservists -- known as the Individual Ready Reserve -- are people who have already fulfilled their term of enlistment but can be called up as individuals if the military needs their particular skills or specialty badly enough. In other words, after a couple of years of dipping into the main reserves -- essentially chewing through them to sustain post-9/11 deployments, the Afghanistan occupation, and then the Iraq invasion -- we're now dipping into the inactive reserves. And if we still need more manpower after that -- well, then we start drafting. <br />
<br />
There is no question we do not have enough manpower (among other things) in the active-duty military to sustain our current &quot;operations tempo,&quot; as the military wonks call it. And there are many good arguments to be made for reinstating the draft, albeit one that would look very different from the corrupt and unfair Vietnam-era draft. It's worth thinking now about what kind of draft we'd like to see if the need for one becomes inavoidable. <br />
 <br />

I think I'll wait for him to answer for himself.<br />
<br />
All I'm curious about is if he is American, and lives in America, that's it.  <br />
<br />
Why? What does it matter? Assume I'm not. Does that mean to you that I can't have an opinion or point out shit? No, the only reason you want to know is to say &quot;stuf you're not american&quot; or something.<br />
<br />
See I know why people get worked up over this stuff - it's cause they *know* it's fucked up, they just don't want to deal with it or think about it. &quot;omg country is run by a greedy fuckup&quot; is not something you can take pride in. <br />
<br />
What I understand is that the american dream is a lie. Hard work doesn't get you shit unless you can hustle like a crack dealer. That shit on the news about the immigrant made good? Why do you think that made the news? Cause it's rarer than our epic drop. I see that people are geared up to hate, to fear, to think that they can't do anything. It serves an agenda - just like public school. That agenda is to pacify the masses. The super rich pay the leaders of men to convince the people that they are TRYING to do something. Like they say, if voteing could change anything it would be illegal. <br />
<br />
Now i'm not suggesting some evil plot or tinfoil hat shit, this is just the way it is, here and everywhere. <br />
<br />
Ok so why do I post? Not because kerry is somehow going to fix this, but because the agenda he is representing, on the whole, will do less harm than Bush's. And if i can convince people like you to stay home on election day or better, to vote for the lesser evil, then even if I can't fix the system I tried to nudged it towards a slightly better path.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Phoenix Connection</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">No, if you're not American, what the hell is your problem? Worry and bitch about your own country you lousy piece of shit, instead of worrying about America. You don't like Bush, oh fucking well, not your problem then huh if you live in another country.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh please, so the fuck what? Everyone in this god damn world is a greedy piece of shit only looking out for themselves. You're no differant, I'm not differant. So what is your point? Bush is greedy? Yeah, so was Clinton, so was Bush Sr., So was fucking John F. Kennedy, and so is John fucking Kerry.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
but because the agenda he is representing, on the whole, will do less harm than Bush's. <br />
<br />
<br />
WHAT FUCKING AGENDA? That stupid ass, lazy cock smoking asshole takes stances on NOTHING. All he wants to do thus far is push for Socialized Healthcare. Other then that he has no political stance on anything. The guy is a fucking tool, the Democratic party can do a lot better then John &quot;I'm a worthless piece of shit&quot; Kerry.<br />
<br />
<br />
And if i can convince people like you to stay home on election day  <br />
<br />
<br />
You don't have to convince to stay home, because I don't fucking vote anyway. Two reasons I don't vote: #1 It doesn't fucking matter. This country was bought, sold, and paid for a long time ago, and the shit they shuffle around every 4 years doesn't mean a fucking thing. Secondly I don't vote because I believe if you vote, then you have no right to complain. People like to twist that around, and I know they say, &quot;Well if you don't vote...you have no right to complain&quot; But where is logic in that? If you vote...and you elect dishonest, incompitent people, and they get into office, and screw everything up, well you are reponsible for what they have done. You caused the problem. You voted them in. You have no right to complain. I, on the other hand, who did not vote, who in fact did not even leave the house on election day, am in no way responsible for what these people have done, and have every right to complain as loud as I want about the mess you created, that I had nothing to do with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Grulknar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I remember Fagwonder admitting he was American before. He's only mad because his Mothers crack supply ran out and she was too busted out to work the corner a few months ago and made Grim take her place sucking semen out of sailors asses. Grim, apparently a slack jawed wonder who is too good for labor or a real job, took a liking to sucking dick for crack. So now he is stuck, licking balls and slurping down cumsicles and despises it, yet loves it. He is confused and hateful and can only yell at the world for putting him in such a position. I think the only reason he hates Pres. Bush is cause he gave him the clap. He prefers Clinton, who only likes sticking long hard inanimate objects in his ass.</div></div><hr />

What if you voted for the person who didn't get elected?  Did your non-vote for the individual who was put in office contribute to their electoral success?  If you believe that, than you sir are an idiot.<br />
<br />
I didn't vote for Bush and I believe my only responsibility in the shit-ass donkey punch that he has given our country for the past 3.6 years comes from not encouraging enough other people to vote the other way...</div></div><hr />

I think that this section may be what Grim is referring to.  Not that their is certainly going to be a draft, but since we are using up all of the reserves that we have we may need one in the future...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Phoenix Connection</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Hey fran, do you think for one time in your miserable pathetic life you could use the last two brain cells in your head, and put forth a coherent thought? I know it must be hard for you, being the cock loving fag that you are, you must have taken one too many shots in the mouth, so allow me to assist you in acknowledging this:<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't give a shit what you have to say.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe if you could find a more meaningful solution to your sad, pathetic life in that damp, wet basement you live in, perhaps you wouldn't find any reason at all to nit-pick everything I say. But alas, you are incapible to do so, because obviously you look forward to these encounters. It's gives you meaning in your life, aside from the updates of gay porn to give you something to masturbate to, since no one in this world is stupid enough to want to spend time with you fat, disgusting, worthless, piece of shit, waste of good oxygen self.<br />
<br />
<br />
But I value human life. So I will make a few examples of how to improve your life from the current shackles that's in, so you can be happier, instead of the current worthless piece of shit that you are:<br />
<br />
For starters you must venture out of the basement more. Now I know it must be hard, given your disgusting physical apperance, and lack of mobility, given the size of your fat fucking ass, but at least try. The world is a great, wonderful place, that is just waiting for you to explore. Give it a try.<br />
<br />
Secondly, more human interaction. I know your ass is glued to the extra large desk chair, to support your fat ass, but really, step away from the computer for two seconds, and find someone to talk to. Considering your fat, unmotiavted worthless ass could never get a job, I'm sure you must still live with your parents. Try talking to them, since they are probably the only two people in the world who will actually deal with you.<br />
<br />
<br />
These are just two steps. Try these two steps for yourself, and see the wonderful results. I personally gurantee you that you'll be more happy, and find a new aspect of life outside of what comes in through that computer screen. <br />
<br />
I hope I have helped you fran. I hope I have helped you to find a meaning in your sad life. God speed dumbass. God speed.</div></div><hr />

There used to be a large Jewish community in Georgia.<br />
During WWII there weren't enough recruits from GA who could pass the reading test (education for minorities in the South  being nearly non existant)  All the Jewish men up to age 40 were drafted.  Old Jewish men with coke bottle glasses getting blown up by German tanks.  Go Go American draft.  <br />

Call it what it is - scraping the bottom of the barrel. the last pool of personel avalible before a real draft.<br />
<br />
<br />
But no.. I'm wrong. I'm just wrong. It won't happen like that. And the pentagon filling draft board seats LAST YEAR that had gone unfilled since the early 80's is just a wacky coincidence. And when the call dissapeared after people started asking about it... well that was a wacky coincidence too. Because they won't start a draft. I'm just wrong. It just won't happen. It's all going to work out perfect. Nothing bad is going to happen. It's all under control.<br />

Wrong. I'm not offended. I'm not even angry, I'm mearly seeing the situation for what it really is. The situation brought forth is as followed: You are a miserable, worthless pile of shit rotting in your parents basement with nothing to do in life except stare at that computer screen. You have no meaning, no purpose in life except make a few post on a message board thinking you know what you are talking about, playing EverQuest, and clearing out the refrigerator. I hate to break this to you but weight does not equal intelligence. The fatter you are, which is your case is pretty disgustingly fat does not mean your intelligent goes up. Maybe if you put forth half the effort you do on this message board into something that will help you go somewhere in life you wouldn't be stuck in that little basement, wasting away your sad, pathetic exsistance.<br />
<br />
I'm just trying to help you realize what you are Fran. A fat, sad, pathetic waste of oxygen. A worthless pile of shit no one cares about. A pathetic excuse for a human who has no motivation, not even a shread of willingness to want to be able to do something in life. All you want to do is sit on your fatass all day and stare at the computer monitor. You're a big wart on the fabric of society. Until you prove to me your opinion is valid by showing some willingness to make something better of yourself, I don't give a shit what you have to say.</div></div><hr />

The fact that I'm apparently &quot;a miserable, worthless pile of shit rotting in your parents basement with nothing to do in life except stare at that computer screen&quot; has nothing to do with what you said in your argument.  <br />

Why don't you grow some testicles (yes, those man-parts you make babies with) and face what you've said instead of running away with your tail between your legs whilst calling me a poopy-head.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Ragranok Soulkeeper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Why you people sit here and try to argue or talk to Phoenix Connection is beyond me.  Never argue with an idiot, they will drag you down to their level and win with experience.  The only damn thing P.C. talks about other than Bush is the rox00rs is some person or another is a cock sucking fag or scum or needs to go outside and see real sunlight.  Or, quite possibly the dumbest thing I have seen, he didn't vote so he gets the right to complain all he wants...right...  Another good one is talk to me when you have proved that your life has a meaning.<br />
<br />
P.C. you tell Keevel that he is a fat ass loser becuase he responds to your posts all the time.  Well...majority of posts I have seen from you is responding to Grim's post and then just blabbing on and on and on about some other person becuase *you think* that you are better than them and more intelligent.  So what makes you sooooo much better then Keevel?<br />
<br />
Kk, now I am waiting for P.C. to insult my intelligence and back it up with the same old shit.</div></div><hr />

There's no need for the comma after society.  Surely a man of your intelligence has to know this.  Guess your not as smart as you thought you were eh?  Worthless assholes?  Ummm...tell me something we don't already know and that you haven't already said.<br />

A spelling mistake?  By Phoenix Connection?  No way, you have got to be kidding me, he doesn't make spelling mistakes becuase he is sooooo much smarter than all of us here.  And another insult refering to us being losers that don't do anything but sit here behind a computer.  That hurt's Phoenix Connection, really it does :(<br />

You're using the we're scum and don't deserve oxygen little insult routine eh?  Come on, I thought you were better than that Phoenix Connection...guess not....<br />
<br />
Are you leaving becuase you now realize that all your same old shit is starting to get really old?  Or maybe it's becuase you are  the loser that is sitting behind that computer in the bottom of your mom's basement.  Maybe he has to go becuase his mom demands him to go lick her asshole forcing him to get off the computer.  Guess we'll never know because the man known as &quot;Penis Connection&quot; is now gone.</div></div><hr />

Oh yeah poor people do absolutely nothing for this country.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Gumms</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Nothing new in this. During Desert Storm they recalled approx. 300 people. Those that whine about it need to reread their contracts. All personnel incur an eight year military service obligation. Whether they join for 2 or 6 years active duty they have an 8 year MSO. They know that they are subject to recall. So if they whine...Fuck 'em!!<br />
<br />
<br />
edit for typos</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Grim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">SORRY! JUST KIDDING! LOLERZ!<br />
<br />
Thousands of recent U.S. Army veterans nationwide were told to choose by Monday a new assignment in the Army Reserve or National Guard -- meaning a potential return to active duty -- or the military would decide for them. The Army now says the order was a mistake. <br />
<br />
The consequence of the error appears to be a sharp increase in enlistments in Oregon and elsewhere by reservists who feared being assigned a unit without their consent. They face possible deployment to the Middle East. <br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Whether soldiers who had signed up under the mistaken deadline would be released from their commitment was unclear Tuesday. <br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Lt. Gen. James R. Helmly, commander of the Army Reserve, declined comment on how the mistake was made, a spokesman said. How the mistaken order was issued is a mystery, said Steve Stromvall, the civilian public affairs director for the U.S. Army Reserve Command in Atlanta.<br />
 <br />
<br />
&quot;mistake&quot; my happy ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Flargle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Some good news at least:<br />
<br />
http://www.registerguard.com/news/2004/05/21/d1.cr.reservesfolo.0521.html<br />
<br />
<br />
The Register-Guard<br />
<br />
The Army told members of Congress on Thursday that it will revoke the enlistment orders of any veteran who signed up based on mistaken information from recruiters.<br />
<br />
&quot;We will revoke the order if the soldier requests,&quot; an Army colonel said in a handwritten fax to U.S. Rep. Peter DeFazio's office.<br />
<br />
DeFazio, a Springfield Democrat, asked that Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld rescind all enlistments made under the mistaken order. In the meantime, veterans need to request to nullify their enlistment.<br />
<br />
The about-face follows several weeks of confusion involving the Individual Ready Reserve, a group of about 118,000 soldiers who had returned to civilian life after a stint in the Army but still had time left on their commitment.<br />
<br />
After the Army said it would begin screening these soldiers for possible involuntary assignment to an Army Reserve unit, recruiters began contacting soldiers and telling them they had to choose between new assignments in the Army Reserve or National Guard by midnight Monday or be involuntarily assigned to an active duty unit. Army officials this week said that was a mistake.<br />
<br />
It's estimated that more than 1,000 soldiers re-enlisted nationwide based on the false information, including more than 100 in Oregon.<br />
<br />
Soldiers who want their enlistment revoked may call the regional office of the Army Reserve at (800) 347-2734, Ext. 1. Or they may call DeFazio's office at (800) 944-9603; staff members will help expedite requests, DeFazio spokeswoman Kristie Greco</div></div><hr />

Like I said, this only involves people in the Army Reserve so the only people who would get a letter in the mail are people in the Army Reserve.<br />
<br />
OH MY GOD THE GOVERNMENT IS ACTUALLY MAKING PEOPLE IN THE ARMY DO WHAT THEY SIGNED UP TO DO! FASCISTS!  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
BZZZ WRONG!!!<br />
<br />
This involved calling back people who USED to be reserve...I guess you never heard the term &quot;discharged&quot;.  <br />
<br />
edit: just read about the 8-year bit....still sounds like shit, but I never actually tried to apply for service, so hell if I know.</div></div><hr />
