<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lugdug</div><div class="date">03-24-2004, 08:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">PoV has become one of my favorite zones to hunt in, its great xp and easy once you know how to do it, and of course if you have a competent group.  <br />
<br />
I've have been MP/MT for WW, EW, and OC I have yet to do an IC group, but i will share what i know about the rest.  <br />
<br />
WW-By far my favorite although i hear IC is better xp.  <br />
<br />
This is probably the easiest camp to pull done right.  There are 6 golems in the camp, it is easily possible to single pull them all.  <br />
<br />
There are 2 standing beside a rock at the back of the camp to the left, one on each side of the rock, one on the left and one on the right.  There is a golem standing in front of them.  The golem in front should be pulled first, the others will not aggro.  <br />
<br />
Then there are 3 golems to the right all separated from each other, 1 behind a rock very close to the camp.  This one should be pulled second.  <br />
<br />
There is another golem a little farther back behind the last beside a rock.  This one should be pulled third.  <br />
<br />
Then even farther back is a golem standing beside a tree.  This should be the fourth pull.  <br />
<br />
Heres the part people usually mess up on, the 2 beside the rock to the left.  What you do is this,  you go to where you pulled the third golem at the rock,  you should see one of the golems you havent pulled yet.  If you pull him from this spot, the other will not aggro.  After this the spawn is broken and its all gravy.<br />
<br />
If you are killing fast enough to pull from other areas, there is a sorta ravine between hills to the right, go through the ravine and there is usually a spider or 2 around, BEWARE  the spiders are nearly invisable and i have gotten adds without realizing many a time.  <br />
<br />
EW-This camp is a little harder and if you dont have a high enough enchanter your going to have to split eventually, i prefer to split anyways but thats just me.  <br />
<br />
Usually the camp is beside the wall near to the drop, i'm not sure how it is on other servers but thats where it is on mine so thats where i'll describe how to pull to.<br />
<br />
The first pull should be right over the hill in front of you.<br />
<br />
The next should be in the puddle a little to the left of this one.<br />
<br />
The third should be behind a rock a little behind and to the left of the last.<br />
<br />
Now what i usually do is go back and to the right corner where the 3 spawn is, people might argue with this but hear me out.  There is no way to pull these guys right out with out getting them all.  You can get someone in your group to harmony/lull or you can feign split.  Feign split goes pretty much like anywhere else, tag one with darkness run back a ways and then feign, wait for others to return to starting positions then get up and wham, single pull.  Only pull one at this time.<br />
<br />
NOW go over to the left abit behind where you pulled the 3rd golem and you should see one standing on a hill, pull this one.  The reason for this is to stagger the 3 camp spawn, in case you need a little down time or med break so you don't have to worry about 2 spawning at the rock at same time.  And having to split again.<br />
<br />
Go back and split again at the 3 spawn.  Don't pull the last one at the rock directly after this one.<br />
<br />
Back where you pulled the golem on the hill, behind the hill should be another golem, pull this one next so to stagger the 3 spawn even more.<br />
<br />
Now go back and pull the last and the spawn is broken and shouldn't have any trouble with med breaks or anything.  If you have a good group and find yourself needing more mobs, there is a spider camp back and to the left a bit, but you will have to split/lull/harmony them.<br />
<br />
OC-this camp is hard because of roamers, roamers mess up everyones day.<br />
<br />
The first mob you should pull is right inside the cave.<br />
<br />
Usually there is a roamer that you should pull second.<br />
<br />
Up the cave a bit you will see a mob standing at the top of a slope, you should be able to single him but sometimes there is a roamer around so be wary.  <br />
<br />
After this again you will need either a harmony/lull or you need to split.  You go up the slope and you will see a golem in the middle of the room and a rock to your right, behind the rock is another mob, but you won't be able to see him from your vantage point.   Be careful here there are a few roamers that like to walk around the room.  I usually have someone either harmony the golem and pull the one behind the rock or just split and pull them normally, its harder to split here because your not exactly sure when they get back to starting position becaues of the slope and you don't want to wait too long, but shouldn't be too much of a problem if you darkness.<br />
<br />
After you kill one of these, kill the other, whichever one you missed last time.<br />
<br />
Now go back up the slope and there should be a mob to your left behind a bunch of rocks, pull him.  Always be wary of roamers.<br />
<br />
Back into the room and there should be a few in the back at the wall, beside an archway.  Always pull the one to the right first.<br />
<br />
After you pull the ones on the wall if the others haven't started repopping yet you should go into the archway and there should be 3 mobs standing inside going up a slope.  They are far enough away from each other to be pulled singly but there is also a roamer then wanders around in there.<br />
<br />
Okay now what spells i use to pull/keep aggro.<br />
<br />
I usually pull with a terror, run back to camp then spam the festering darkness button until the mob is in range, you may change the darkness suiting your lvl, but if you aren't 60 i'd suggest clinging/engulfing cast them 2-3 times  I usually only have to festering once to keep aggro.  This will keep aggro on you even if the slower slows right away.  I usually toss another terror on top just in case.  Then DoT/spear/bite as you like.<br />
<br />
In OC You will have to pull over a pile of stepping stones or through water, begin casting darkness so that when the mob steps out of the water it will hit, because if they are still in the water your spell was just wasted.  <br />
<br />
WW you don't have to worry about anything except the rocks to block your view of casting.<br />
<br />
In EW  you have to worry about the hill in front of you blocking your view.  The first mob you should pull with darkness because its so close.  The rest i usually pull to the the left of the group between the opening of the hill near the puddle.  Darkness there then continue pulling to the group.  You should be able to get another spell off on it by the time it gets to the group if you land darkness.<br />
<br />
Even if darkness doesn't land it still creates considerable aggro, always have your Voice spell up, and i usually use mental corruption for more mana.<br />
<br />
Well fellow evildoers thats how i do it anyways, open to criticism/questions.</div></div><hr />

I like WW the best because it keeps me awake, IC can be boring, the xp is 'ok' but some higher level PoP zones have changed my view.<br />
<br />
Just for some server translations <br />
<br />
WW / WC / WCW / WCY / West<br />
EW / EC / ECW / ECY / East<br />
OC / Outer / Water<br />
IC / Inner / Cavern<br />
<br />
Then there are other camps sometimes...<br />

Lever <br />
Corner / NE /</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Josahd</div><div class="date">03-28-2004, 09:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not sure why I need to read 3 pages to learn how to pull a zone that was never difficult to pull in the first place.  It's barely harder to pull than the dreadlands or OT was, heh.  I guess there's a little more effort pulling inner, but even that isn't a problem.  If your puller hasn't been PL'd from day 1, and has a clue, there shouldn't be any problems pulling this zone.</div></div><hr />
