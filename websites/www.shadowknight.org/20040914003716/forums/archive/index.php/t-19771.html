<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Habyoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">just curious as to what ya'll think is the better of the two to have for a SK that dosen't tank on guild raids.  Only tanking i do is pickup groups in BoT and normal diff LDoN.  I went with SCF3 first cause as i leveled up 61, 63, and 65 i stopped leveling to get the ToF for each level so when i hit 65 i had ToL3 waiting.  Anyway just wondering on your comments</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nzab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i think you shoul just go with SCF3 ... the Nd3 aint gonna make a huge difference since you not tankin the raids and you lifetap anyway :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>SweetMeef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">nah, get ND3...<br />
if you're tanking in BoT, they don't ask &quot;do you have SCF3?&quot; - they ask &quot;how many hp?&quot; (they dont ask if you have LR5 either)<br />
If you're a tank (which you are), go w/ ND3. Then worry about SCF3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Menon Lifeblight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Both are core AAs, you really can't go wrong.<br />
<br />
Personally I went with SCF3 before ND3, but it's almost irrelevant which you pick first.  You should have both very early in your AA path.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I prefer scf3 to get first before nd3.<br />
<br />
SCF3 gives you something new, different, and fun... nd3 just more hp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">ND3 all the way, if you ever tank at all.  Your hp are kinda low for tanking even in BoT, get those tanking aa's up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Awaon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you're going to be MT on adventures, XP groups and such, you really need more HP.<br />
<br />
Unless you plan on getting some serious equipment upgrades in the near future, bite the bullet and get ND3.  While it might not be as fun as SCF3, it's much more practical.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I guess my thoughts were, in general, I like SCF3 better.  If your hp are really low, you will NEED to do ND3 first though.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>shadowblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">bleh.<br />
<br />
Spell casting fury all the way. Its a core ability for shadowknights cause it upgrades so many facets at once.<br />
<br />
Nd3 isnt that much of a Hp boost. Its important to get, but I wouldnt place it on your mandatory list.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Drakkimor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Accualy, if your hps are low, you need hp gear then.  ND gives you a % more hps.  I went SCF3 first.  Just more fun that way and that's the whole reason to playing a game......to have fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ogrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I kind of think the aa's are a situational investment... if you finding you're getting taken down too far when taking damage, ND3 would be a good one to get... but if you want to be able to heal yourself a little more when ya do/do more damage, then SCF3 is a good investment.<br />
<br />
It's nice when you crit on your taps but it's also nice when the healers say they don't have to do anything but sit and watch too...<br />
<br />
(and for perspective, I'm going for SCF3 right now)...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>aress</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">depends on where you raid:  if you face troublesome AEs, go for ND3.  If you feel you are stable on raids, just have some fun and go with SCF.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Zulpel Bonstalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">SCF3 Then ND3.<br />
Its that simple.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>frotty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">the hps gained by ND3 over ND2 is NOWHERE NEAR BETTER than the hps saved by having spears, procs, taps, zevs, undead blasts do 2x damage, possibly crit healing.<br />
<br />
SCF3.<br />
<br />
If you have 6400hps or 6600hps, you're a 6500hp tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Thack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I hate hearing people on both sides saying that it's *THIS* way and no other way can be right.  BS!<br />
<br />
Basically it depends on what you want.  The couple hundred HP that you get with ND3 is kinda nice, but it isn't going to make or break you ever, and SCF3 is kinda nice, but it isn't going to make or break you ever either.  The crits are nice, but you consider that it's only about a 7% chance of a crit.  To be honest, you'd have to parse the damage, because you aren't going to see a noticable difference with the naked eye, and if you can't see a difference, it' isn't a huge deal.<br />
<br />
Just do whatever you prefer to do and enjoy it.  I would have to say that I agree with the ones that say that either one is good.  I also agree that both should be done fairly early in your career</div></div><hr />

do you have a lifetap proc on your weapon?<br />

GET SCF3!<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Just my opinion<br />
if you dont do the above its still amazingly handy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>ZilshasisEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I'm going for SCF first when I do AA :) I did ND on my paladin and while it's a nice hp boost it's not really all that needed. You'd get more out of Combat agility or Combat stability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Dkhar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I said screw hitpoints that's what clerics are for (at least for now). I spent 410 points on scythe of death (560 damage, 1 second cast, 30 second recast) from MM and love it. What's so great about it is I am level 55 and I turn heads when I crit for 1k (also WCR) on an undead !!! Woot, I frickin rule. Well, not really but at my level it surprises a lot of people to see an SK crit for over 1k and it's not their HT :) <br />
<br />
It's all about the eye candy. Highest crit so far with SCF2 is 1036. Will it crit for more with SCF3 ? When I read the description of the skill it said it raises the chance to critical, not the damage done but it is a noticeable increase in damage from scf1 to scf2 ?? <br />
<br />
I am confuseded.</div></div><hr />

<br />
AFAIK:<br />
<br />
SCF1 = 2% chance to perform a 33% crit<br />
SCF2 = 4% chance to perform a 66% crit<br />
SCF3 = 7% chance to perform a 100% crit<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that it is also not a set amount based on the spell itself, but rather a % based on the damage dealt.  So a 500dd unresisted with SCF3 would do 1k.  However if the spell is partially resisted (say it would have only done 400 dmg without SCF) then the damage added by SCF scales down (spell would hit for 800, not 900 in this example with SCF3).  Same is true in reverse with say a DD spell doing more base damage due to ID items and such.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Dkhar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Thanks for the info. Another question though is this, I have War Crested Ring, does it add in the multiplier from that first before adding the critical or critical first then 20% boost ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Before critical.  So for ToI it's more like (470 * 20%) + 470</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Dkhar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Thanks :D That's great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>shadowblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">if you're tanking in BoT, they don't ask &quot;do you have SCF3?&quot; - they ask &quot;how many hp?&quot; (they dont ask if you have LR5 either) <br />
<br />
Get scf 3 then lie about your HP. No one will notice anyway :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>lorddaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">crit is actually calculated as (damage*1.20%)x2...that's how you get those amazing crits for 6!! <br />
<br />
iirc</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>ZilshasisEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">That formula is incorrect lorddaeth. This is an almost direct quote from the Graffe forum. This question was about Innate wizard criticals, but I've modified it to be useful for us. The thread can be found Here (http://www.graffe.com/forums/showthread.php?t=13628) <br />
<br />
The posted formula is correct, and well proven.<br />
<br />
In the case of Crit and with a Focus:<br />
(Base Spell Damage * Focus%) + (Base Spell Damage * Crit%) + Base Damage<br />
<br />
The Crit does NOT crit Focused Damage, only the base damage of the spell. The Focus does not increase crit damage, only the base damage of the spell.<br />
<br />
Focus and Crit are applied to base damage seperately, then summed for total damage.<br />
<br />
Ice Comet : 1120 dmg.<br />
<br />
So, Base Damage is 1120.<br />
Add in a Max of (1120 * 0.20)  from ID.<br />
Add in a Max of (1120 * AA level (0.33, 0.66 or 1.0)  from Critical AA<br />
<br />
Theoretical Max on AA Crit with Improved Damage: 2464dmg without bard song.<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Thus if you took good old Touch of Innoruuk you'd get the following :<br />
<br />
Base damage : 470<br />
<br />
470+(470*0.2)+(470*1) = 1034dmg Or 470 * 2.2 (or 2.35 if you're using bard songs into your calculations) since you can just add the modifiers together.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Reflan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I've never believed much in relying on crits, personally.<br />
<br />
And on the other hand, I've noticed many times over the years surviving by just a few hitpoints.  ND3 will give you hundreds.  <br />
<br />
I'd much rather get the hitpoints, unless I never tanked much at all and rarely worried about AE's.<br />
<br />
Most melee classes are completely obsessed about their DPS and parse and drool and dream and argue about it, but I've always done more damage alive than dead.  I'd rather have the hitpoints.<br />
<br />
Get the HP, avoidance, and mitigation AA's, and you can become a dramatically more long-lived tank.  Get the spell casting fury AA and some other spell AA and you can become a dramatically different caster -- but relying on crits to talk about how well you tank seems to be pushing the point more than a little.  To me, anyway.  <br />
<br />
No glamor or eye candy really in the tanking AA's, and tons of glamor and eye candy with the other.  Up to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I've always been a proponent of SCF &gt; CS &gt; CA &gt; ND personally; it's pretty well known around here that avoidance/mitigation AA's improve your tanking more than ND does, but SCF is our single most versitile AA - it effects so many other things, from procs to taps to HT's to nukes, it plays a huge role all told.  <br />
<br />
You don't have to be &quot;relying on crits&quot; for the crits to be useful, especially considering SK spell damage comes in small chunks.  SCF3 effectively adds just shy of 7% (the full 7% if you have no ID/Rizlona's) to your spell DPS, proc DPS, lifetap healing, SoC healing, and doubles your HT damage if you get UT1+.  That's a pretty fucking awesome value at 12AA's.  <br />
<br />
Also, groups don't ask if you have SCF3, but they'll notice it when your critting lots of shit... if you can't get groups because your HP isn't good enough, there's a deeper problem though; fucking 3.5khp/1150ac tanks can manage BoT with buffs and the poster's far better off than that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">aint that the truth hehe i use SoC over mc partly because i have scf3 and tol3 and i love it when people comment how i crit like crazy :). After getting FotA i hear the same thing about my melee but i dont feel it like i do with scf/tol hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>lorddaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">SCF = pretty eye candy<br />
<br />
ND = bah, more HP, useful, but booring.<br />
<br />
and thanks for the calculations on the formula, explains why i can't get a 2k crit on my scythe, just 1986's.<br />
<br />
I went SCF first, because i thought i'd be raiding more and i wanted the HT line first. but after i got SCF 3, i decided i wanted to be able to tank Hard LDoN's. so that's why i switched to the defensive ones.</div></div><hr />
