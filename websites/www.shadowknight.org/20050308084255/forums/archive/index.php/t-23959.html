1.8ghz<br />

vid card ???<br />
P4 not sure what kind of speed motherboard he has in there atm gonna talk to him tomorrow<br />
<br />
Anyone have a cheap set up to run EQ2<br />
<br />
I'm thinking of going with the <br />
Processor and MB he's installing<br />
the memory im going to go to 512(heard you need more)<br />
staying 1.8ghz<br />
<br />
He's getting me on labor costs which stuff i can do myself easily,friend gave me a lemon of a Motherboard,i go to the guy out of conviencance since i dont have a car and can just walk down the block to him..<br />
<br />
any suggestions(i'm looking for bargain prices that can run below par top of line games)<br />
<br />
i've found a few that's 45-65dollars,but after reading reviews on them they don't do well on mid to high settings</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kebsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I ran it on an Athlon-64 3200 with 1 gig of RAM and a Radeon 9800pro.  I ran it mostly on the 'high performance' setting but it was playable at both 'balanced' and 'high quality', I just have a low tolerance for choppy framerates.<br />
<br />
I also ran it on a Pentium4 2.somthing gigs overclocked to 3somethingorother (I think, it's my brothers computer), with a gig of RAM and an X800xt card.  It ran smoothly on 'balanced' and ran okay on 'high quality'.<br />
<br />
On any 'bargain' system EQ2 is bound to be choppy at best, unless you're some kind of software tweaking genius or whatever.  The game was obviously built to be impressive on to-be-released systems, not current ones.<br />
<br />
You could probably pick up a Radeon 9600 or 9700 for a hundred and some bucks at the right places.  That, combined with a decent pentium 4 and 512megs of RAM (preferably a gig, especially since RAM is so cheap now) will give you a decent looking EQ2.</div></div><hr />

i wont get choppy framerates as much as some think,just finding a reasonable vid card around 45-65bux is fucking hard lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kebsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Don't buy a 45 dollar video card.  Even if it does end up running EQ2 decently, the next spiffy game that comes out is gonna destroy it.  You'll end up spending more on a new video card in a few months.  Just spend a couple hundred bucks and you'll be good for a couple years.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But due to PSU problems (soon to be fixed) EQ2 has rendering problems and EQ1 has huge numbers of Graphic artifacts that totally stuff it up.<br />
<br />
So if you are getting a good card - make sure you have better than 400watt PSU</div></div><hr />

<br />
anyway, right now for a decent vid card i'd get a 9800se and unlock it. should be about $120 but they perform nicely. $250 for next gen up isn't worth it.</div></div><hr />

I'm 47 years old, been working for 30 years, and its the first really good system I ever got. I could only afford it cuz I bought the components all on sale (except the memory, I was determined to get quality) and built it myself. <br />
<br />
Na na na na na naa naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>ugloid foo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Ram definately makes a noticable difference. My brother and I built the exact same machines, the only difference is he reused his older PC2100 ram and I upgraded to PC3200. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I got my 6600 GT cards for the other 2 computers.  Nice card for the price.  Alot cheaper than the 6800 Ultra, and way better performance compared to the 9600 XTs.  Also got 2 17&quot; LCD monitors now, and will never buy another CRT again.  Now if that 21&quot; LCD I want will ever go on sale, I will be set.<br />
<br />
Moderately fast computer is a must.  Would go at least 2.4 GHz with Pentium.  1 Gig ram is absolutely required.  But the vid card is what will totally rock the system.  Can get the 6600 GT cards for about $225 for the AGP version.  6800 Ultras still about $500 minimum anywhere.  BFG is a good one, and is overclocked some from the factory, which puts it ahead of most Ultras.<br />
<br />
I dont overclock anything beyond what they came as.  No need really.<br />
<br />
I ran comparisons with the 2-3-2-5 ram, compared to generic ram.  Almost a 10% increase in performance just from the ram alone.  So dont go and buy top stuff, and skimp on the ram.<br />
<br />
If you go for a new motherboard, you might as well get one with the PCI-e slots.  That version of the 6600 card will drop you about $40 on the vid card  compared to the AGP version.  You can always go with the ATI card though too for a comparable price.<br />
<br />
Memory (1 gig, dual channel, 2-3-2-5), Motherboard, CPU (3.2 Ghz P4), 6600 GT video, can get for about $700 total.  Which isnt too bad.  And gives you a system which pretty much screams.</div></div><hr />

EQ is not compatable with nvidia cards ATM (particularly the new nvidia cards like the 6K series)....EQ1 ran better with my ATI 9800 pro then it does with my 6800GT BFG, despite my 6800GT getting far better benchmarks on 3Dmark5 (got around 2K with 9800 pro and getting 5K with 6800gt).</div></div><hr />

i get extreme quality caus ei got a AMD 64 FX-55 (no overclocking on anything), and a 6800 Ultra, with 256mb ram on it, your regualr 6800 only has 128 i belive, i just built the system 2 weeks ago, cost a few bucks, but well worth it, but i hav eno probs runnign EQ 1 or EQ 2, no choppyness or nothing, but my GeFOrce 6800 was made by XFX, i have heard the BFG ones lag a bit in it, and the stock ones from nVidia, and eVGA, but i am fine iwht mine, it is ubah leet</div></div><hr />

All in good time. <br />
<br />
I have been playing EQ since just after Kunark came out, and have had to quit twice because my comp could not keep up with upgrades. I never had the confidence to try to build my own before, and just took a shot at it this x-mas. So I spent 4 years playing on sub par machines....<br />
<br />
1st comp   Pentium 75, 4 meg video, onboard audio, 14 inch monitor. Died the good death on Luclin releace. <br />
<br />
2nd comp AMD 300 mhz 32 meg video, Soundblaster 16, 17&quot; monitor. Died the good death after LDoN. <br />
<br />
3rd comp  P4 1.5, 400 FSB, 1 gig SD RAM, Soundblaster 16, 17&quot; monitor. Died the good death with DX9 implementation. Still used it, with graphics turned down drastically, and running around PoK with clip plane at 0%, and looking straight down....navigating using the map. Same thing in Bazaar. <br />
<br />
4th comp I listed already, and it runs great, and is the first on I could put graphics at full tilt (mostly..the vid card is pretty average). <br />
<br />
So hang in there, your day will come.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>vilesoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Ditto, just hang in there..<br />
<br />
I've been building PCs for years, and pretty much near every dime I make goes into either my PC, or my stereo...being a bachelor has it's pluses :)<br />
<br />
On the other side of the coin....I usually upgrade fast enough to sell my old stuff....like my current rig...the case with watercooling will more than likely be for sale once the new computer is done.  The rest of the parts I usually sell to my co-worker who either uses them for his main rig, or upgrades the rigs of his two sons.  That lets him get good hardware cheap, and helps me with the cost of constant upgrading...It usually lets me wash out the price of a CPU :)</div></div><hr />

Went to the motherboard web page, and got latest drivers they had for the motherboard there.  Still nothing.  I even tried to reinstall the OS, thinking something might have been messed up.

Although the drivers and such will definitely help, there is still a larger issue with EQ in regards to the 6K series Nvidia cards....I have all the latest MOBO, chipset, vid, audio, etc drivers and EQ2 still runs like shit after a few hours.  There is a known memory leak that Nvidia claims is do to the vid card driver and is said to be working on it...SoE will not officialy recognize the issue despite overwhelming evidence to support the fact that this is an issue that seems to affect their product the most.  Although the problem seems to be the worst with EQ2 it is also a problem with EQ1....my 9800pro ran EQ1 as smooth as silk, but my 6800GT doesn't run it nearly as well (runs good but not as good as the 9800pro which is a dinosaur by comparison).<br />

ATI cards just seem to work better with EQ code....might be a hardware issue and might just be a driver issue as Nvidia claims &lt;shrug&gt;.</div></div><hr />

There is a memory leak with EQ2, its not Nvidia cards.  Constant killing non stop for about 8 hours, things were starting to get laggy.  Then poof, the machine I had the ATI card in crashed, because windows ran out of memory.  The machine with the nvidia card, with same amount of memory crashed due to the same error two kills later.  Exclusive to Nvidia?  Not for me.  Those 2 computers ran out of memory about same exact time.  One was AMD platform, with ATI card.  Other was Intel platform, with Nvidia card.  Not the same chipsets on either.  One was intel chipset, other was SiS.</div></div><hr />
