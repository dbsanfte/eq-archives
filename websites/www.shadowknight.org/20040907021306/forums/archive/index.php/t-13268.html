<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Drayne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Need help choosing a race for my upcoming SK.  My real boggle is regen or no regen.  Assuming all other things equal, a regen race at upper 60's will regen roughly 35-40hp/tick, but a fatty race like ogre or troll would have more base hp.  So I guess what I want to know is from all you upper echelon players out there.  Trolls, Iksar, do you think the regen is worth it?  And ogres, is the no stun/more base hp more useful?<br />

Why would they have more hp ? Max sta = max hp, doesn't matter what race.<br />

At 60+ the only thing regen will do is reduce downtime a bit when you are soloing or when you are lying FD between mobs. Other then that, it hardly has any use.<br />
<br />
I cant really comment the no stun, but i guess it's nice when tanking for that little extra dps. Useless when pulling cause your back will be facing the mob.<br />
<br />
All in all, like i said a thousand times in a thousend threads. You should base your choise on looks/what you feel like playing if you want to end up in the &quot;end-game&quot; cause all the other stuff wont matter.</div></div><hr />

/argee!<br />
<br />
race is more lika looking/fashion choice,<br />
they are gonna be the same stats at the end with those insane drops,<br />
or i should say it determines which stats u would chasing up most,<br />
eg. for ogres, INT is the first priority, for those little races, STA is the first.<br />
but at the end,<br />
for sk, STR,STA,DEX,INT are gonna be cap'ed anyway,<br />
just make sure you joined a guild that raid/hunt a LOT!!!<br />
hah!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>GoBuk Agogo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Don't know why peeps make such a big deal about the int on SKs.  Fact is, in the high end matrix of the game the SK's role is pulling and off tanking.  Most SKs willing give up Int for hp, sta and str in that order.  They are not known for thier casting ability and I have yet to hear &quot;Hold the pulls! the SKs are OOM&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Manslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Mana Pool is a very big factor in terms of your damage output over the time it takes to kill a typical PoP boss mob.  The fights are short enough that mana regen isnt as big a factor as it was during Luclin and the 2 day marathon battles with bosses there.  And we now have a goodly number of effective combat spells that up our dps to a very respectable level.  That being said, I won't typically give up hps/AC etc for mana/int.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Azraelwrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I really wouldn't worry about the regen because when you fear kite you won't get hit too much unless you don't time your fear castings correctly.  Whenever your low on health, you can just lifedrain the mob when it starts running at below 20% health.  If your going on the uber scale, I'd advise either ogre or troll, whichever you like better.  Your gonna be spending about 50-55 levels without the really uber gear so your gonna wanna enjoy those stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Drynnious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Your post doesn't make sence. You say you want regen, but then say you want base hp's like ogre's and trolls. Well, Trolls have regen and what you call &quot;base hp's&quot;, now tell me? Where's the dilemma?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Sorry, but I hardly agree with this comment.  Regen has far more use then that, especially at higher levels for a SHD.<br />
<br />
Firstly, regen is a wonderful offset to our *lich* series, Pact of Hate (&quot;POH&quot;) in particular.  It is extremely nice to offset 30HP/tick rather then substantially all of the entire amount go unchecked.<br />
<br />
Its also helpful for just after getting a rez, when your HP is low and you are OOM.  PoH is a great spell to cast at this time until the chanter, if applicable, can hit the group with c3 or better.  Regen helps in these situations also.<br />
<br />
Additionally, regen also helps during raids.  Blood/EMP takes what--10-15 min or so to kill??  SHD make terrific TM in this situation and the amount of HP that is added during this time adds up to a significant amount of damage that doesnt need to be healed.<br />
<br />
It doesnt have to be, however, a raid to experience the benefits of regen.  You will get its benefit anytime you are receiving damage and dont die.  While many will claim that the amount is insignificant, I can assure you that if you are in an XP group acting as the MT for such group and you XP for any decent length of time, the HP added to you from regen is considerable and nice to have.<br />
<br />
Certainly my *list* above is not comprehensive, nor is it intended to be.  My only point is that you dont have to like it for it to yield benefits.  Regen = good and its good at all levels and for all races.<br />
