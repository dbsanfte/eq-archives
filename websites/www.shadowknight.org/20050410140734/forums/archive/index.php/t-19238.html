<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Winkles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was in pon at gobo camp tonight and I couldn't hold aggro for crap.  I was doing everything I normally do, chain casting CD but I couldn't keep aggro at all.  Was casting cd when hob was incoming and the thing would just pass me by and head for the pulling monk.  Switched to Dooming which is the highest darkness I have and same thing mob would just run by me half the time.  Pulled out terror and chained it sometimes it would work and sometimes not.  Would get 3 failed taunt messages in a row.  I finally just gave up and said I had to leave in a few.  I began to notice the difference yesterday in cod when a monk was mt.  He is 65 with 8k hp and all defensive aa and I would start to cast darkness to snare the mob at 50 because mob resist alot there.  I cast 6 dooming darkness in a row and never got aggro once.  This was after boil blood.  I didn't expect to hold aggro or keep it for very long because of the massive dps he put out but I couldn't have kept it off him if I had tried.  He says that warriors in his guild have little problem keeping aggro off him because of weapon hate procs and augs.  He's in the top guild on Inny so he obviously knows what he is talking about.  The only thing i didn't try was fear.  We didn't have a slower and its hard to get it off without being interrupted but I think at lvl 59 its time to start using it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Menon Lifeblight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have not fought the gobs in PoN in a long time, but CD used to work just fine for me.  It could have been changed though, there are definitely some mobs in LDoN now (mistmoore spiders, for instance) that simply don't react to CD the way that other mobs do.<br />

Try fear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Neric Ikolis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I used to use just heart flutter and a spear and I could hold agro.  Remember taunt is not to be mashed but used when you loose agro too.  I always hit disarm too when it's up.<br />
<br />
It can be hard sometimes to pull agro from a puller too.  It's been established many times that you get a nice agro jump when first to enguage (just remembered this guys life size Capt. Picard cutout from New Years Party :) ).</div></div><hr />
