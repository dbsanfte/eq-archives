Any ideas, plans or suggestions for this fight?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xilith</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 05:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">#1... Don't pull the queen, fight her where she stands.<br />
#2... Dark/FD is good for splitting her guards out of the room.<br />
<br />
Get a few guards out, rush in and do damage fast while enchanters handle the adds.  You can't resist the AE, so go for hp gear, have clerics use group heals, but the important thing is to do damage as fast as you can.  If memory serves, normal HT works well after tash, UA/HT normally got resisted without a disease debuff.  She has like 16k hp but you have to take her down in about 20-30 seconds or the AE will get you.<br />
<br />
My guild sends in a DA Pal to make her waste the first AE, buying you a few seconds before it recharges.  If done right, only one AE should ever hit you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Utaldain</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 05:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks, last night was the first time we had ever attempted the queen.    We tried a couple different ways, what almost worked was rooting her in her room and bringing all the guards out.  would have been nice if the root would have lasted more than 10 seconds, or the puller less.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xarshaaz Dreadbones</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 05:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What about chain-rooting till all guards are dead?<br />
<br />
Just 2cps from someone who has never been there =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kormus the Dark Angel</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 06:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The wussy way:<br />
Get a high warmly/ally down there and park the raid in the hallway between old herb and Queen/King area.<br />
Get a suicide puller to pull her room out to the ramp leading to the hallway where the Chardok faction person is waiting.<br />
Have the puller die and Hail the Queen till her guards are gone.<br />
Pull, have her waste first AE on ramp and you got a win.<br />
Btw: 3 Wizards with Manaburn can down her easily so with AA she is an absolute wuss.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brael</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 06:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">root breaks once, she runs up, smacks your casters (particularly the people chain casting root and the clerics) ae's them, you get low hp aggro on those people... next thing you know your casters are dead<br />
<br />
like xilith said, split a couple guards off from her if you can (otherwise just mez or stun or whatever your guild does to control them) then charge her in the room and do fast damage (charge, duelist, ht/leechcurse, etc)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baael</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 11:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lvl 60 Bard lull queen, pull whole room.<br />
<br />
Setup inside her room, med/buff/pet up.  Then just bring it and drop her in 10 seconds.  Really easy once you know what you're doing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ZarrakDeathknight</div><div class="date">03-27-2002, 10:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">4 mb wizards casting simultaneously and no need for pulling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bainin</div><div class="date">03-27-2002, 12:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another way..<br />
<br />
<br />
Setup in King<br />
<br />
have monk pull queen and all her troupe out to the doorway of her room.<br />
<br />
SK darks from up on the ramp..queen (last time i was there anyways) has pretty low mr.<br />
<br />
Worst case: SK , Monk Die...have MT pull queen into room and beat down with fire pets..everyone sit back and watch the show.<br />
<br />
Best case:Sk lives, Monk dies.. *snicker</div></div><hr />
