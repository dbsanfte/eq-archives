<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sabrosia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Background:  I'm level 60 SK with (right now) 35 AAXP.  (just got PE last night).  I've been at 100% AAXP because I wanted some friends to catch up to me (which all but one has - but she's rising quickly...)<br />
<br />
I'm also a HUGE fan of LDON - I can't get enough of these dungeons...  We try and do atleast 1 or 2 a night...  Now, I haven't seen a 65 dungeon; and I'm not entirely sure I want too...  In the 60 dungeons, the XP's are good and we all have a lot of fun.  That's all that matters to us, so that's where we want to stay for now:  level 60 dungeons.<br />
<br />
Question:  I've had thoughts of hitting 63 (so I can atleast get those pop AAXP's I want up to level 2 (since level 3 requires 65 - and I don't want to jeopardize our 'group average' just yet).  I want to keep our group average below 62.999.  How big of an increase in 'power' are levels 61 and 63?  Is 61 any different from 63 other than a few extra spells?  <br />
<br />
I have no problems tanking in level 60 dungeons - but we've had a few close calls - I'm thinking 63 as the main tank would give us an advantage (our cleric wants 62 as does our wizard)<br />
<br />
Any thoughts on this?  Is 61 much better than 61, and what about 63?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Oggim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You get more adventure points per win based on your level at the time you complete the mission.  For example, if you have a group of all 65 players everyone will get 51 points if you win (on normal). However, if you die back to level 64 during the adventure, you will get either 47 or 49 points (I forget which), while everyone that is still 65 still gets 51 points.<br />
<br />
I can't tell you just how big of a power boost 60-63, although I imagine it would help quite a bit, but if you want to get ldon points more quickly I'd suggest getting levels so as to get more points per adventure.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't be afraid of the level 65 adventures either, even if you have a total jack-ass in the group setting off traps etc, it is pretty easy to win most adventures on normal. Too bad there isn't a medium level between normal and hard, ah well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nikumu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Work your way to at least 62 for the improved Lifetap spells and Zevfeer's Bite.  The extra effects of level and the improved HP will make a difference in your tanking ability.<br />
<br />
Since you seem to be heading for the PoP AAs, I would go ahead and hit 63.  It won't take too long if you are doing LDoN adventures regularly.<br />
<br />
I've chosen to stay 62 (10%xp,90%aa) while some friends catch up (also since my playtime is limited I like to feel some sense of accomplishment and an AA every 2-3 advs helps).  Although as I get closer to filling out some of the PoP aas, the urge to hit 63 is starting to get stronger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kuvak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I used to think AA's were better than exp, but have since completely changed my mind. You'll honestly be best off if your entire group hits 65, then does AA's. Don't worry about a 65 adventure being hard. The only requirement to beat basically any adventure is to have some form of healer (cleric, druid, shaman) and some balance between CC and DPS. There is a huge flexibility in what makes a &quot;good LDON group&quot;. I've seen 3 necros, 2 mages and a cleric do awesome. I would hazard to say that the ONLY group you do NOT want is a group of 5+ wizards and no tank. Since you're an SK, and you'll always be in your groups, just make sure you got a healing class and otherwise, try to keep a full group of 6 peeps, no matter what classes they are, so long as they're good players, you'll have little to no problems.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ramgar SK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">At 61 my stats cap at 260.  So that's one benefit.<br />
<br />
My skills haven't gone up at all from 60, and I think they are maxed.  Offense 225, 2hs 225, Defense 253.  According to Caster's Realm, that's max for 50+.  So as far as I can see, I'm not geting better at combat, but my spells will land better, and I will resist more as I get to 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>gurbuuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Zev's bite is the reason to hit 61 or 62 (dont remember).<br />
<br />
always use it as soon as he pops</div></div><hr />
