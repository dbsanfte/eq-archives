<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Phyro Soulstealer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've made 3 trips into the hole in the last couple weeks and I run into the same brick wall each time.  I go in with 3 groups, average level of approx 58 (i'm a 60 sk).  We make it down to the tower very easily, but once we get there, we're stuck.  The respawn is too fast for us to be able to clear out the tower to get to Glohnor and keep the area clean as well.  Any strategy or thoughs any of you have would be greatly appreciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ainya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Been awhile for me since I had to do this one, but why clear the whole tower? IIRC we jsutr cleared the left side and moved down to the basement where he was at.  Killed him right there then succored back to the top.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Phyro Soulstealer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've read in some posts while searching that he can spawn on the right side after turn-in on the left.  That was my reasoning behind clearing the whole tower enterance, but i'll see if we can do just the left side............thank you<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Milon-MT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Just clear out in front of the tower and the courtyard where the ghost is and do turn in, mummy will rush from bottom of tower and come after u without any other mobs, pull him to camp and kill</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>milkit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i just did this other night had 2 group 's was overkill . the fastest and easist way to get is (this is how i got my groups to tower ) i'm a 62 sk and box a 65 clr , i took my toon 's and used my harm sheild and the clr equiant and jumped in hole when u land go to east wall don't  get in the water as i got some aggro and had to /q out . next i had a mage sacarfice himself by jumping in after he invited a full group . my clr rezzed him and he CoH the rest in . after we all there we started pulling. there is a pile of rocks that has a door in it u will get from 2 to 3 mobs on the first attempt opening door after that pretty much single pull for me at 62 . that tunnel leads to glohor , when looking at tower he is on the left side in a coffin .do your turn in and the skelton form will run out from basement to you without bringing adds. takes a few mins be patient .  hope that doesnt confuse u much and actully helps .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Drakang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">As stated very little needs to be cleared.  Clear the front Courtyard and the area to which ever side the ghost is on.  Usually the left side now which is also where the mummy comes from.  IF you go down to the left you will see a door into the basement of the tower.  The mummy comes from down there.  I usually clear the skeletons down there so I can aggro Glohnor and pull him rather than waiting on him.  However you do not have to.  Do the hand in Glohnor charges the one that handed in.  Kill him.  Note he cannot be snared so make sure folks are ready to blast him hard when he starts to run if you are not trying to keep the front courtyard clear.  Did this with 2 groups ranging from 54-65 so you should have plenty of firepower.   Don't even bother clearing the actual tower itself.</div></div><hr />

Shoot me a tell when you go down next.  I will be doing this same exact part real soon and would like to experience it.  <br />
<br />
Can you do 2 turn ins in a row??  <br />
<br />
If so that would be very nice.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nycathis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">What may be happening here is that they are getting level based aggro ie his group is 58-60th<br />
<br />
Also the gargoyles could be getting involved as well....</div></div><hr />

If I recall correctly, the ghost despawned on turn-in. Which would make sense, though I guess making sense is not a prerequisite for anything in EQ... :)</div></div><hr />
