<br />
My idea is this, create a spell version of the defensive discipline. Knights are specificly spell and melee oriented, no discipline oriented so the only logical way to do it would be via spell wise. <br />
<br />
Spell name: Knight's Defense <br />
Classes: Shadowknight, Paladin <br />
Level Required: 65 <br />
Mana Required: 1000 <br />
Cast time: .5 seconds <br />
Recast time: 18 minutes <br />
Duration: 2 minutes <br />
Description: <br />
1: Increase Melee Mitigation by 40% <br />
2: Decrease Damage Modifier by 50% <br />
3: Chance to Critical Hit(0) <br />
<br />
Only dropped in GoD zones. <br />
No Drop only<br />
<br />
Opinions, ideas on changes? Personally I think this would solve a lot of problems while giving the knights back their raid off tanking abilities, the ability to tank GoD encounters, and since it's a lower level of defensive and requires a lot of mana to be used (Imagine chain fizzles on that), but at the same time still allows for the usage for those that tank in GoD to still use every spell at their disposal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think my opinion on universal availability for the knight tanking fix/upgrade/whatever is pretty well known by now... if not: http://shadowknight.org/forums/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=21178</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">1.  Unuseable to do spell gem refresh, you die you cant use it again for 18 minutes.  Ya, you're screwed there.<br />
<br />
2.  Too aviable.<br />
<br />
3.  Thats too much mitigation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Why is it too much mitigation? <br />
<br />
Thiers is 12.5% more mitigation, lasts 50% longer, and refreshes 58% faster. <br />
<br />
Why is it too available? <br />
<br />
It would be no drop and only found in GoD so that means only those who are 65 and have GoD would get the spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well, it's too aviable because it can be gotten prior to a problem existing (I tend to agree actually that it's a content issue prior to Kod'Taz because other equilavent content in other expansions doesn't give this same type of problem), the problem mentioned exists in all post time content however (LDoN raids, Kod'Taz+ GoD) and thus the fix should only be aviable at that point on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Stryph</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">1) You can't give such a powerful spell without some type of major draw back. I think that the refresh is a good idea.<br />
<br />
2) How can it be to available if it's in GoD, or in the trials? You would get the spell when you needed it (Trials 1-5 only or so).<br />
<br />
3) What happens when the next raid level expansion comes out Brael? When the content is now scaled back up to this level and we're back where we started? Dumb down the content again? If they want to start on that streak I doubt highly people will be very happy at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">As if I didn't have enough spell gems constantly greyed out as it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I too am against the solution for us being spell based.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Xanathol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Its way too availble bc more than 7 SKs would have access to it.

Thats how it works.  Also, you CAN progress still to fix the problem, the issue you're having is that the level of gear required for success is too high for a Knight (or too low for a Warrior, either is accurate but too high is more correct because of equilavent content comparisons)<br />
<br />
Stryph, none of those trials are where the problem exists.  Also, spell based fix is bad.  Silence, stun, inability to channel, stop to cast, spell slot, refresh after death, mana drain, dispell all screw that ability up.</div></div><hr />

Xanathol I ask you this in a civil tone, but what would be wrong with you progressing through content and working up toward doing what is needed to get this proposed fix if it were made available in GoD trials only?<br />
<br />
Every post I see from you, there carries one resounding tone..., you want to be able to tank boss mobs the same way a warrior can..., I can post quotes from you saying that you want to tank as well as a warrior on more the one occasion and that you do not care about balance at all..., you simply want to be able to be the main tank at a raid.<br />
<br />
I ask you again, why is it you feel that we as an SK class at a level prior to GoD need any type of mitigation boost?  We never were meant to tank raid level bosses, and in single xp groups defensive is not needed so I believe the point you are trying to make about SKs pre-GoD needing a defensive disc or any type of mitigation boost really is unfounded and is more apart of the me-tooism that is going on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Xanathol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Brael,<br />
How are knights not *still* losing some with the suggestion? We're losing a LOT right now. 'Can' progress to fix the game? I bet you can too! For all we know, there is ubber HP / AC / % mitigation drops at the end of GoD! Gear up, after the warriors get you through the content! What? Don't like that idea? No shit...<br />
<br />
Other than that, I honestly think that is the first of your comments on the topic / reasoning that I can agree with - yes, if the gear that does allow knight tanking in this way was more in line in such a way that the gap was not as big, maybe that could fix some of the pre-Time conditions. There would still be a gap there, but no one would care, since in the encounters I have mentioned before, they would be 'doable', and efficency, while still a problem, isn't as big of a problem, if the above was done right. Chances of them looking at gear across the board? None. Pass on the defensive sugestion, and it would work. Best yet, it doesn't break anything. If it doesn't break it, no need to hold it back.<br />
<br />

Xanathol I ask you this in a civil tone, but what would be wrong with you progressing through content and working up toward doing what is needed to get this proposed fix if it were made available in GoD trials only?<br />
<br />
/civilanswer Err...bc there are issues before then, just not as largescale, noticeable, etc etc?<br />
<br />
/civiloff...bc that analysis of my prior posts, quite frankly, pissed me off<br />
As far as tanking like a warrior, your reading comphrehension is lacking - I have clearly stated time and again this was NOT the case. Also, you need to go to Webster's dictionary online and look up the meaning of the word 'balance'. If you truly read my post, you'd understand this *and* since no one can state where the suggestion would break the game pre-Time, there simply is *no imbalance*!<br />
<br />
I ask you again, why is it you feel that we as an SK class at a level prior to GoD need any type of mitigation boost? We never were meant to tank raid level bosses, and in single xp groups defensive is not needed so I believe the point you are trying to make about SKs pre-GoD needing a defensive disc or any type of mitigation boost really is unfounded and is more apart of the me-tooism that is going on.<br />
<br />
Search is your friend, then get a friend to read my posts to you. The tanking order on raid mobs is FUCKED - period! Knights are no where in it at ANY time, and ANY OTHER melee capable class IS. That is BROKE. Give up the XP group argument - no one with any clue whatsoever thinks defensive will do anything for XP grinds ( or that there is really any issue with XP grind groups ). SINGLE GROUP NAMED ENCOUNTERS is another story. Where an underequipped warrior ( for the encounter ) can EASILY serve as a tank, due to defensive, a correctly geared knight CANNOT. *Just like GoD 1 group encounters!* *gasp*<br />
<br />
Do I have a sour tone? Damn right I do. I am sick and tired of post that ignore the above statements, make up their own ideas on what other post, that CLEARLY state why to give access to this suggestion, are saying, then COMPLETELY lie about what the poster said. The examples are given, they have NOT been countered ( other than 'overgear', which is not a counter ), and *nothing* is said about how this could break ANYTHING. This suggestion is NOT a new idea, just 'upper end' support for it is, bc the PACIFIER that quick aggro gave us through offtanking is now GONE in GoD. This is not a 'me too', rather this is a counter to 'memememememememe!'.<br />
<br />
Either way, why does this thread even exist? SoE has already shotdown the idea, and its pointless to have repeat threads all over the boards. They are going to gimp content, and with the selfish arguments taking place combined with the clear disregarding of arguments against, I almost hope they do gimp the content. Every lvl 50 warrior will be in the zones, LFG, 'tainting' the 'ubber only' encounters. Hmm...share a skill with your brethren, that only makes sense to be shared, or share tanking trial_mob_01 with gimp bazaar warrior since he still tanks better than you, in all your l33tn3ss?<br />
<br />
Again...read my post, read Brik's post, read Slein's post, read,readreadreadreadreadreadreadreadreadread. Its clear what is being stated, but alas, I am sure you'll dream up your own ideas anyhow, as you have done here...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Brael - The ability to overgear for an encounter should have absolutely no bearing on class balance.  Gear from beyond a given encounter should not need to factor in that encounter whatsoever.  Sure knights can tank luclin with luclin/PoP gear, they can tank some earlier PoP mobs with elemental gear, etc.  That's irrelivant though.  Warriors tank luclin mobs with velious/early luclin gear, etc. - hell, warriors can tank GoD mobs with VT gear.  <br />
<br />
What we can/cannot tank is not even the issue though.  While we can tank many things, warriors can tank them considerably better, and we really don't have any counter to that.  <br />
<br />
Yes knights can theoretically tank anything in existance pre-GoD.  Doing so often requires gear from beyond the encounter being tanked, and a warrior would do the job better, but... that doesn't matter, right? :rolleyes: There's more to filling a role than being capable of doing the job.  Being reasonable in comparison to the other classes also capable of doing the same job is also important, and you simply can't deny that warriors are worlds ahead of us.  <br />
<br />
Mdiyan - Your attacks on Xanthol are quite unfounded.  Try actually reading his posts on the SoE boards and here.  You also clearly don't understand the current situation and have not read the relevant posts.  <br />
<br />
Note that, even given a carbon copy of defensive/stonewall, SK's would not be raid MT's in the presence of warriors.  The power of Furious/AE taunt is not something that can be played down.  Furious gives the healers a moment to get established on the new MT, gives a nice chunk of opening aggro, provides considerable burst DPS, provides a chance for the mob to be slowed if applicable, etc. - it has a huge impact in stabilizing the fight.  AE taunt makes the exact point at which aggro is transfered predictable - you know that, at the exact moment you hit the button, you will have aggro.  And even that (and it's a very noteworthy &quot;that&quot;) aside, warriors would also still mitigate better than us, even if we were to recieve full defensive.  <br />
<br />
Knights aren't in too bad shape in relation to warriors where defensive does not apply (though there are certainly issues, such as non-tanking classes's tanking ability, lack of knight DPS, etc.).  Defensive isn't a factor in XP grinding.  It is, however, a factor in single-group named, and not just those in GoD.  It is a factor in some offtanking situations.  Also of critical importance, however, is the fact that it would put knights back above the DPS classes for most tanking situations (though, even then, they would be better for some very short situations by virtue of melee immunity discs).  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
There really isn't anything I can say that I havn't already in the thread I linked earlier in this thread... just read that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>shaneez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">That is such bullshit all of you time Knights cant see since the class balance Ranger,Rogues and Monks are chosen as Mt over Sk even in POP groups. What a fucking fix, lets give the Sk a defensive/mitigation upgrade but put it out of the reach of 80 percent of the class. How about you stop thinking about how come you cant tank one trial and think of our class as a whole. Yeah thats right Shadowknights are still Shadowknights starting at lvl 1. I thought the upgrade was to make our class desirable to groups,raids and potential apps. to endgame guilds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">i'd suggest something more along the lines of like 25% mitigation boost 1min duration 5min recast, someone abit better iwht numbers play with that abit more but basically why i say this is because Knights were offtanks...a 5mins recast mini defensive would probably give us some of that off tanking ability back. Sure war's have much better defensive but we can use our's more often to tank the little add's that we need to tank. At lasting only 1 min it wouldn't exactly be that desirable in any prolonged raid encounter, having to do tank switchs every 1min wouldn't in my eyes be worth it to a raid and they would much more prefer wars to tank the big mobs, but should the shit hit the fan we would have a chance at being able to tank stuff (even if only for a min) that we cant currently tank without being overgeared.<br />
<br />
Another thing i'd like to say is that im very much against a WeaponShield type disc, 24 seconds of immunity isn't tanking in my eyes and we all made shadowknights because we enjoyed tanking, i wouldn't be happy even if we were given a 45 sec WS because its not tanking its just standing there hitting your agro spells and waiting for the 45secs to end so you can die.<br />
<br />
Oh and i'd like to say how much i appreciate you looking after us lower tier sk's slein, the problem between a defensive war and a non defensive sk when an sk is expected to be able to tank should he need to is a problem way before GoD. A defensive war should be a better tank then a defensive sk, we honestly probably should of gotten this upgrade in PoP just like how beastlords slow went from 50% to 65%, content got harder so they evolved. 75%, 70%, 65% slow is a nice order but 50% mitigation boost disciplines to 0% is not....bah hope that came out right heh honestly do have a hard time relaying my thoughts on class balance and tanking and sadly im very passionate about these topics (spend WAY TOO Much time reading PoN, SK.org, TSW, sony boards praying that i will see a change for us).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Someone please explain what is so different about pre-GoD content since the release of the expansion/melee enhancements. Is it just that Warriors get chosen over knights for adv/exp groups? Because aside from the renewed competition, the content hasn't changed. We didn't have problems back when leechcurse and HT shared a single timer, or before LDoN augments, BoV, and tribute foci...<br />
<br />
Tanking in PoP has gotten easier if anything, or am I missing something?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I've explained it about 50 times already.<br />
<br />
Warriors got over-balanced.  There is no longer the traditional tradeoff of aggro vs mitigation; the warrior is the superior tank, period.  This means that there is no reason to use a knight for the majority of tanking tasks.  When one class's power is increased to exceed that of another who fills the same role, balance dictates that the other class needs an improvement to keep it in line with the former.  <br />
<br />
The problem with non-tanks coming so close to knights in tanking power has been an issue for a long time, but is now exacerbated by the power of weaponshield-type discs in GoD.  <br />
<br />
These two problems combine to make knights virtually obsolete, GoD or otherwise.  Sure we tank alright in lower tier XP groups, but so do a plethora of classes, and there is simply no need for a knight anymore aside from pallys casting BSS.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kroolhand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">To offer another perspective on balance: We (at the appropriate levels) an exp grp were fighting in DL back in the day. Our cleric had to log, and the general consensus amongst the group was to call it a night after several calls for one in /ooc went unheeded. We wound up with a druid somehow, but this was unsatisfactory as mana requirements for the tank and the gimp druid heals didn't match. Don't know who's idea it was but we altered the plan so that one melee pulled we fought the mob and the druid kept that melee alive not fully healed but alive, then while melee one waited back at the camp melee 2 went and found a mob. when that fight was over melee 1 went out again. This worked because the druid had regen, and the melee who was &quot;off duty&quot; was regening to the point that he could go get agro and tank every other mob. Exp continued. Druids and shamans eventually get a version of CH but they are never considered THE priest that a cleric is in a raid or harder single group encounters. But they can fill the healer roll at need even if inefficiently. But if there is a cleric, they still have jobs that they can slide into....CC, DPS, back up heals, buffs, pet CC's, ports slows etc.....Arguably, though there is a priest that sits atop the heap, there is balance still.<br />
<br />
    Not so for the tanking Knights. There is only one role and someone else does it better. Haven't played Krool in GoD outside of natimbi yard trash and so can't speak to that. But by the same token, those of you who are Time equipped haven't played a 61 SK in PoK or LDoN post &quot;melee balance&quot;. The PoK content hasn't changed TRUE, but the perceptions of others have. We simply have nothing (of particular value or note) that can't be done well enough or better by warriors. There is little reason to invite us along apart from guild friendships or rl friends making allowances for us.   Anecdotally I offer the following two examples: Afew levels back I was in a group in PoN killing trash, it was going well, and so someone suggested we move to Hobs. I had 5k hps with the buffs i was wearing and i have tanked them before, so no problem right? No, both the cleric and the shaman in the group, wanted to fill the last open spot in the group with a warrior. In their words they needed a &quot;tanK' if we were going to go there. They got a 52 warrior for the role, and I who had given no reason for concern, a 56 SK was just along for dps and because I was already there. Secondly a 65 pally friend of mine pre balance got at least BoT group invites within 2-3 minutes of donning the LFG tag. He rerolled a wizzy and that is his main now, because he got tired of being lfg hours on end otherwise. There has been a shift very noticeable by us lower level knights, whether for the right reasons or the wrong ones, life as a SK is a little tougher here too.<br />
<br />
   The pre balance roles are gone now even in the lower levels because of the above reason and others. There were as you recall times when a knight was even preferable on some mobs. An example would be certain odd pulls for the sk or stunnable mobs that pallies could do best, this JUST isn't the case now. Think back to when you guys were writing your reputations on your servers and think what it would be like to try to break into the big guilds or convince folks your level that you saw every day that you were just as good a choice as other tank classes. <br />
<br />
   I say all of the above respectfully. I could well be wrong, as I didn't live through your era as a SK. But again you aren't living through mine either. As far as giving to much to a SK to early, it's been done with warriors and others like rangers. Also, this wasn't true for you I know as you all were the pioneers. But for me, the few flags I do have were MT'd by someone way over equipped for the encounter, so imo that is already happening. Plus it would be along time before i was so uber as to turn and do back content as a MT, stopping my own progression, and I guarantee that if I chose to do so, they would still choose a warrior similarly equipped to do it anyway. I am a casual player, my guild is starting into the planar progression, and I'm not even kind of interested in being the best tank in Norrath, just in being perceived as a viable one. <br />
<br />
    My solution from down here is the shield. I hated the idea when I first saw it on this board, but now I think it has a chance of being a class wide solution from level 50? to 65, where the problems exist and it is scaleable. Have a shield disc to begin with, and then improve it with some AA's and have it tied to AC of the shield. In other words your 35 AC shield wouldn't mitigate as much damage as your 100 AC shield acquired someplace that a 50 SK couldnt get to. I truly believe that this is a CLASS problem (if for no other reason than perception, but I think it's more than that) that exist in 50 plus areas, but has only been brought to light STARKLY in GoD because of the unique mob tuning that highlights it. <br />
<br />
   I read here religeouously (didn't even try to spell it right), and the opinions of the BIG Knights on this board are respected by me, and I have adopted them in my own play, so I do not go against the grain here frivolously or with out thought. The class gentlemen, and not the content is in need of repair.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Kroolhand, I think you just unknowingly proved the point of EXACTLY why it isn't needed any earlier than what I and a few others have suggested.  Low-Mid end player balance is judged strongly by the average player of how people see the VERY top end.  You yourself said you're just as good as always but the perception is that you can't tank.  When Knights can't tank is in GoD and not at your content level, players just think it's extending to your area although it isnt.  If Knight tanking problems disappeared so would the perception problems you're expierencing now.  Believe me, I understand your concern better than you realise.  During Velious I think it was there were SK's (including me) who were begging for a patch message saying SK's recieved an upgrade to tanking power.  Don't confuse that with us asking for more at that time we gave up on that, we were just asking for a patch message saying that we could tank better to try and eliminate some of the perception issues.  I know full well what problems perception causes but the way to fix that is to fix the root of the problem not to place upgrades where it's not needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Xanathol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">the way to fix that is to fix the root of the problem<br />
<br />
Exactly! And what is exactly the the problem? The problem is mobs tuned for defensive. So there are two options: (1) remove defensive, which will not happen (2) fix the issue at the *root*. Where is defensive introduced? Level 55, for a warrior, IIRC. The scales start tipping there, and only tip further as mob DPS goes up. Thanks for backing my point. &lt;wg&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Wrong, the problem at his level is player perception, what causes that perception?  What SK's at the very top can and can't do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>ZarvexSkulkrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I'd rather they didn't fix the class at all if they plan on listening to folks like Brael who don't seem to see the problem except for just themself.  I admit it is worse in GoD but the problem is not exculisve to GoD.  Shadow Knights are really screwed in the raid role still pre god.  So what if we can be off tanks we aren't better at it now then Warriors like we were before these changes happened.      <br />
<br />
What really pisses me off on this whole f'in class balance thing is Absor's famous quote &quot;Classes are not that out of balance&quot; then all of a sudden Sony changes their tune.  So which is it if your right before when you thought things were balanced then you know god damn well we were getting the short end of the stick.  Now with their typical ham handed balancing they overcompensated yet again.<br />
<br />
This isn't rocket science its a game.  Class balance shouldn't be this hard.  I don't really give a rat's ass how were balance if they find some other thing for me to do that's an equal contribution to my guild while we are raiding to make me as useful as any other class.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I've never said that SK's prior to GoD need nothing.  Numerous times infact I've said quite the opposite, but I dont believe pre GoD SK's need a tanking discipline, it's spell adjustments there which can make up for the problems.  A global permanent mitigation change would be alright as well but that also involves upgrading Warriors, so thats not really desireable.</div></div><hr />

I've explained it about 50 times already.<br />
<br />
Warriors got over-balanced.  There is no longer the traditional tradeoff of aggro vs mitigation; the warrior is the superior tank, period.  This means that there is no reason to use a knight for the majority of tanking tasks.  When one class's power is increased to exceed that of another who fills the same role, balance dictates that the other class needs an improvement to keep it in line with the former.  <br />
<br />
The problem with non-tanks coming so close to knights in tanking power has been an issue for a long time, but is now exacerbated by the power of weaponshield-type discs in GoD.  <br />
<br />
These two problems combine to make knights virtually obsolete, GoD or otherwise.  Sure we tank alright in lower tier XP groups, but so do a plethora of classes, and there is simply no need for a knight anymore aside from pallys casting BSS. <br />
<br />
Why is this so hard to understand?<br />
<br />
No shit knights *can* tank lower level.  No shit its perception that warriors are the way to go.  But perception always has its basis in experience.<br />
<br />
Further, I have yet to see any person, on any board, explain to my satisfaction, how a knight mini-defensive will unbalance anything, so long as it's properly designed.</div></div><hr />

I'd rather they didn't fix the class at all if they plan on listening to folks like Brael who don't seem to see the problem except for just themself.  <br />
<br />
Brael has acknowledged that high end problems cause perception problems for mid-level players.  Brael's suggestions for improvement focus on making our class viable in the content he is in, the content he knows.  This approach of suggestions is to keep uber abilities from trickling down too far to low level SKs' which would make old content even more trivial and make a perception of SK's being over-powered again (and believe you me no SK on this board wants to ever see a Nerf bat again let alone get hit with it).  Also, I'd rather that Brael focus on fixes that help that level.  He doesn't know what it's like to be a mid level SK with easily accesable bazaar gear competeing against every other twink class.  Hell Berserkers are competition for groups on this level as the therception is they can't take a hit either but at least they're better DPS than an SK.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have to disagree with you there, Brael.  Warriors, as part of the melee upgrade got that 5% innate mitigation boost.  Personally, I think we deserve at least a 3% if not 4% innate mitigation boost.  If nothing else, a move to the Warrior defense table if we aren't already on it.  Also, since they've given the Warriors the aggro generation, they need to give us the edge in mitigation if they're going have the Warriors the Aggro Kings.  It's one or the other.  Before the upgrade, we had the aggro, they had the mitigation.  Now, they have both and we're out in the cold.  What's fair is fair and the Devs need to decide which one to give the knights.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Plubius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I still believe an ability that truncates the damage distribution is better than a defensive copy with a lower mitigation percentage (though I am a big fan of the short time burst defensive suggested by slein).<br />
<br />
IMO, the big problem with GoD is that they specifically designed encounters with SL/HL in mind.  Instead of designing damage/hp ratios for 10 second heals, they designed them for the new, faster heals.  This has had the unintended side affect of making the defensive ability much more important from a survivability standpoint because the original U shaped DI distribution has less random draws to average damage over.<br />
<br />
Having a disc that truncates the damage distribution gives us an ability that has the same limiting distribution as defensive (ie same as defensive at extremely high AC) but is siginifcantly worse in other situations (~40% the damage mitigation in most situations).  The advanatages are as follows:<br />
<br />
1) The scaling of the truncated distribtution would be the same as defensive - thus there would be no balance issue in the next expansion.<br />
2) Mobs could be adjusted in a way that allows high end SKs and Warriors to win without elemental warriors winning (large DI, low Attk).  Mobs could also be adjusted to make warriors superior to SKs (Medium DI, high attk)<br />
3)  It is not strong in the lower end game - thus it wouldn't have the same unbalancing issues as a mitigation disc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Oberyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">...for a top end fix only are going to screw us.  Seriously.<br />
<br />
How tough is it to understand?  Warriors got TOO MUCH.  It doesn't matter if you are in Time, GoD, or fucking Kunark.  When you high end people were tanking in PooP, or ToV, this problem DIDN&quot;T EXIST. <br />
<br />
Who is going to pick an SK for ANY tanking job now when a warrior is available?  Answer me that?<br />
<br />
Ideal solution would be to nerf defensive and war agro. Yeah like thats going to happen:P<br />
<br />
Therefore the problem remains forever:  what good is a knight in a tanking role when a warrior is available?  (nm the level of gear)<br />
<br />
If we want this fixed, the solution is going to be an upgrade ACROSS THE BOARD for SKs and Pals.<br />
<br />
Get your shit together please, and realize that the WAR patch didn't just screw over Time geared people fighting in GoD.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">heh yah would have to agree with you oberyn the posts on this board pre war agro changes said time war agro was overpowered before the patch, so us lower tier sk's are the one's who were the most effected by the change not the higher end knights who were already dealing with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">How tough is it to understand? Warriors got TOO MUCH.

<br />
Ya, it didn't exist because back when I was doing ToV and Kunark if you healed a Knight or wasted mana on buffing one on a raid you were guildremoved for wasting mana that could otherwise be put to use on someone who could actually contribute.  Mudflation has completly removed the importance of Defensive in lower end content, thats why I say it's not needed there.  There are a couple compelling arguments on this that have made me rethink it a couple times however and those are some yard trash being unknight tankable, when stuff is designed for pre VT guilds and it takes a Knight time gear to tank Knights are having issues.  Desireability in groups to be able to attack named mobs and expect to win.  Incite line causing Knights to lose what little offtanking they had at that point, and finally casual players will eventually get into zones they can't right now through mudflation and additional levels but would likely miss raid targeted upgrades that become used as group tools hurting them severely (What if Anger augs dropped off named in VT only for example, it would hurt Warriors despite the fact that any level 65 with the tinyest amount of initiative can get into the zone)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">What pre-VT mobs take a time geared SK to tank, other than maybe the avatar of war?<br />
<br />
The meanest trash I can think of before the elementals are rapes in ntov, and I was tanking those with mostly velious level gear, albeit at level 65 with PoP tanking aa's.  They hurt it but it was definitely doable.<br />

What upgrades and what zones are you referring to?  A ldon geared knight should be able to tank elemental exp mobs just fine.  GoD I'm sure he'd be hurting, but so are time geared knights.</div></div><hr />

As part of a small casual/family guild, the level increase will let us do content like the Emperor and maybe let us get into VT and possibly allow us the option of getting EP access.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And yet even bazaar geared Wars have access to defensive. They can use it prior to GoD too.   No matter their level of gear.  When they move to the high end content, defensive is still there for them.<br />
<br />
Why is it that I, or any other SK, should have to get time gear to even have a hope of tanking trash?  The generic warrior certainly doesn't need anywhere near that level of gear.  <br />
<br />
At this point, a tanking Disc across the board for knights  ( less than wars, but more than rangers and other such scum) seems the best fix.  It certainly isn't going to break anything since pre-time geared warriors ALREADY HAVE IT, and it hasn't screwed anything.<br />
<br />
Well, except the game:P<br />
<br />
That's my point,  and that's BROKEN.    <br />
<br />
Edit:  and unless we can present a united front somehow as a class, we won't get jack as far as a fix goes:  thats my concern.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Here's a thought on how to fix it.  Make it so that AC is more effective at higher levels of AC.  That way, the best geared knights can tank the stuff but the rest can't, and it doesn't unbalance the game.  Make AC more effective for AC values greater than 2000.  Make the NPC's hit for max less often at AC &gt;&gt; 2000.  Then even less often at &gt;&gt; 2100.  And so on.  That way, a knight with 2500 AC has no problem whatsoever tanking single group content.  The problem is that AC is not effective enough at 2200+ AC, IMHO.<br />

<br />
This problem starts WHEN Warriors get defensive and HOW Warriors get defensive.<br />
<br />
We need a fix at a comparable time not just when it makes us not able to play anymore.  We need the fix to come in a discipline not something that changes the way we have to play.<br />
<br />
If Warrior discs are supposed to make them casters then make us the equal of them tanking bosses.  If they are not, then we should be able to have some discipline choices as well.<br />
<br />
I changed guilds because I served NO purpose long before GoD came out.  Why have an SK offtank when you can have warriors do it?  When the rogues began doing the corpse runs (watching them learn how really ticked me off), I knew there was no place for me anymore.  When this guild reaches my level, they will have no use for me either.<br />
<br />
I have no problem getting groups due to the friends I have made over the years, but I do not get invites to pick up groups anymore.  They used to be common.<br />
<br />
Serving the coffee, pointing out tactical concerns, bringing juice to the warriors and keeping track of which rangers died is not the role for which I was trained.<br />
