<br />
<br />
Since they revamped Droga, they moved the whole quest into FM, for those who did this quest a lot time ago. Only thing I really need to know is what is the PH's for the penkeepers, and the penmasters?<br />
<br />
<br />
All I'm doing now is plowing through the whole place, but since my virtue and KEI just faded, I can't do that, so I'm hoping someone knows who or what the PH is...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jobrill</div><div class="date">02-10-2004, 08:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First of all, Wrong Forum. Greenmist forum is down further on the index.<br />
<br />
Second of all, DragonballZ sucks ass, for the love of God stop with the damn Otaku screen-names. <br />
<br />
Thirdly, I did the Greenmist pre-revamp when everything was still in Droga, so I dunno what the new PHs are. You might search the Greenmist forum tho, in case someone has posted that info sense then. If nothing else, suck it up. In my day we didn't HAVE KEI and Virtue. We had Clarity. And THAT was only if we had an Enchanter in our group, cuz the damn thing wore off too soon to be of any use sowing.<br />
<br />
And don't even TALK to me about cleric buffs. We had to save up for MONTHS to buy a single peridot so we could afford a symbol. Yes, and we needed a symbol. None of thse combonation buffs, we needed 5 buff slots before we even got CLOSE to Virtues benefits.<br />
<br />
Damn Whippersnappers.<br />
<br />
Where's my Applesauce?</div></div><hr />

I've been playing EverQuest probably the same amount of time as you, so don't act is if I'm some stupid n00b to the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
http://www.eqatlas.com/kunark/frontiermtnsmap.html<br />
<br />
All inside, we killed many many goblins in there and I got all of the keys in maybe an hour? Was me a Monk and Shammy. They were working faction in there so i tagged along.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ephyr</div><div class="date">02-10-2004, 09:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yes...the keys dorp from penmaster and penkeepers in area b on the frontier mountains map...<br />
<br />
<br />
within area B...<br />
<br />
go to first intersection...go right...go down a slope....<br />
<br />
next intersection bear right again...down agin...opens up into a room of gobbies...same room as the iksar slaave you are trying to free...<br />
<br />
PHs are on the right hand side of that last room...near the entrance...<br />
<br />
took me a couple of hours...but ditd not care...was farming fction and gobbie skins for sarnak quests...<br />
<br />
_Ephyr<br />
<br />
PS to get the correct iksar slave to spawn...you may need to kill pone of the other slaves as PHs...<br />
<br />
i used my pet...then FDed...so did not take any faction hit...you might need to do the same...<br />
<br />
PPS fyi...<br />
<br />
if you go left at first interescetion you get to angry goblin/goblin traitor room for sarnak quests...<br />
<br />
if you go left at second intersection you get to room with chief rokgus if you want to farm him...</div></div><hr />

Well apparently play time doesen't mean shit,since he had the information and you didnt.<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
And I like DBZ, big deal?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And play doesn't mean shit? Guess your right. I've been playing this game since Kunark came out, but unfortunitly I focus more on school, and other aspects of my life, instead of a game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Ahh, the war cry of the slow witted addict....<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yeah?  I'm a stupid noob because I can't read and follow simple instruction?  Well, it doesn't really matter because I have a real life and don't spend all my time on a stupid game! Now how do I get those uber phat l00tz, d00d?!?11!on3&quot;<br />
<br />
You're no less pathetic than any of the rest of us when it comes to your gaming addiction.  You just suck at trolling message boards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gohansama</div><div class="date">02-11-2004, 01:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You know, it's people like you all why I never post on message boards.<br />
<br />
Sad, pathetic, losers with nothing better to do then to show how superior they are by typing in bold, and quotations.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for EverQuest, I do indeed enjoy the game, and love to play it every chance I get, but unfortunitely I don't have much free time in my life to play the game as profusly as some.<br />
<br />
There's nothing wrong with that really. If people are happy spending their entire day playing a game, then that's cool. As long as the person is finding happiness in life, who am I to judge them?<br />
<br />
The fact you keep on insulting because I asked a simple question, because I was confused, and needed some help speaks highly of the type of person you are.<br />
<br />
As for &quot;trolling message boards&quot; I haven't the slightest idea what the hell that means, and frankly I don't care. I only registered, and posted here because I needed help. And I gives many thanks to the one person who was kind enough to help, instead of the rest of you assholes who insulted me. I'm sorry if I lack the vast knowledge about EverQuest that you people posses. You'll have to understand I only play the game for fun. I've been playing EverQuest for a little over 3 years now, and my main character is only level 57. That should speak for its self exactly how addicted to this game I am.<br />
<br />
All in all I'm just sadden by some of your remarks. Seems no one can resort to the internet, and more speficially message boards without being insulted.<br />
<br />
Anyway, thank you to the one person who helped me. Thanks to you I was able to attain the 3 keys I needed, and finished my quest, and now I'm finally do the actual Crusader's of Greenmist quest when I get the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jobrill</div><div class="date">02-11-2004, 01:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. I've been playing since the Kunark era, for what it's worth. That last part was mostly in jest anyway. <br />
<br />
2. I am VERY Casual. As in, go long stretches playing maybe 2 hours every 2 or 3 days casual. As in, I did not have a 60+ character until literally 2 months ago casual. <br />
<br />
3. I am not your nanny, your handholder, or your personal tutor. I learned most of what I know from Everquest by observing, keeping my head down, and searching databases and sites. I see no reason why you can't either. I see no reason not to answer a simple query or a geniune humble request for information, but once again, you barge in here, expect not to have to learn any rules or get any feel for the community or do any sort of work other than shouting a question and expecting an immediate, percise answer tailored to your needs because YOU HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOUR REAL LIFE AND YOUR TIME IS PRECIOUS DAMMIT. WORSHIP ME YOU PUNY LITTLE CATASS INGRATES! WORSHIP MEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gohansama</div><div class="date">02-11-2004, 01:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Or I searched all over the internet for an answer to my question, and didn't find any answers, and was suggested by someone to make a post here at shadowknight.org?<br />

<br />
You know what the really funny thing about all this? You're acting like I think I'm better then you, when in reality I really don't. I know nothing about; your life, your lifestyle, nothing. Heance why I am not passing judgement on any of you. All you are to me is a incarnation of words and sentences, that I read through a computer monitor. Nothing more, nothing less.</div></div><hr />

All you are to me is a incarnation of words and sentences, that I read through a computer monitor. Nothing more, nothing less.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Which is part of the problem, Junior.<br />
<br />
You want to get philosophical?  You want to talk about prevailing trends toward unreprised nastiness on the internet?  You want to talk about people being too nasty and too elitist on message boards?  Ok, fine.  I know the rest of SKO hates when I get on one of these rants, but I hate them all (you included) anyway, so we'll go with this.<br />
<br />
You say you think of us as nothing more than a conglomerate of words (and presumably useful information, as words may or may not contain useful information) that you read on your computer monitor.  Well, we think of ourselves as intelligent (in some cases, we're correct on this account) individuals who happen to have gleaned some knowledge out of a game and who have formed a community to discuss and archive this knowledge.  So it is insulting for you to come here to us and treat us as nothing better than a database.  We're not some inanimate repository of game information for you to mine and then be done with.  We're not here to politely and quickly hand over all the information you're looking for.  We feel like we've worked and sacrificed time (again, in come cases, we're correct about this) to compile this resource.  It is insulting for you to disrespect that work and sacrifice by treating it as your own personal &quot;Ask Jeeves&quot;.  <br />
<br />
If you'd bothered to use the tools that the administrators of this board have provided to EVERYONE who comes here (eg: search), you could easily have found several accounts of the revamp to Droga, as well as information on where/how/when to get the keys for Argest's cell.  If you'd even bothered to sacrifice a MODICUM of your own &quot;precious&quot; time to read the posts in the STICKIED goddamn post in the forum NAMED Greenmist: Unholy Khukri of Rile, you could have easily found the same information.  It's there.  For all to come and browse.  <br />
<br />
That is the service we provide (as a community) for free to any who come here.  Nearly any quest, mob, weapon, armor piece or zone that you have questions about has probably been discussed here, and those discussions are available to you, whether or not you've ever contributed to the knowledge store here.  All you have to do is show a little respect to those who sacrificed their own time finding out the answers to those questions and posting their results here by giving up a little of your own to find the information.  It's here for the taking.  <br />
<br />
But no.  What you decided to do was come here and presume that because some of us spend a great deal of time in game and on these boards, our time is not as valuable as yours.  You presumed that we had nothing better to do than to go find your information for you and deliver it to you on a silver platter with a &quot;yes, massa&quot; and a little cock suck in gratitude for you coming to SKO to find your information.  You wanted us to be polite and accomodating and quick about YOUR business, but otherwise silent.<br />
<br />
Well, I'm sorry that we didn't live up to your expectations, but I've got news for you, pal.  You're not important to me, or to most others here.  You're one of a long string of disrespectful, arrogant, greedy little pricks who comes here and thinks that he/she is entitled to something because we are a free resource on the web.  You've got this idea in your head (and to be honest, I can't really blame you for it, it's a prevailing culture in the US to believe strongly in entitlement) that you are OWED something, simply because you're here.  You are not owed anything.  You are not entitled to anything.  You get what you give.<br />
<br />
Think of it this way:  If you wanted a hundred dollars in your &quot;oh so busy and important&quot; real life, you wouldn't go to some random community and demand that they give it to you.  You know that in real life, you'd at best get refused, and at absolute worst, could end up dead for your arrogant assumption (that these people owed you what you wanted).  When you want something from someone, you go to them humbly and politely ask for what you want after taking the time to learn and follow their rules.  You don't scream at them for not giving in to your demands, because (presumably) you're not two years old.  This community is no different.  We're all people IRL (well, except for Derraj.  We think he's probably a mutant pumpkin pie or something).  We all make our way as best we can, do what we can to try and improve our own situation and that of our communities.  And for the most part, we all understand that if you want or need help with something, you have to understand that you can't set the terms of that help.  Beggars can't be choosers.<br />
<br />
In short, feel lucky that all you got out of this was a few harsh words aimed at you on a message board that you yourself admitted doesn't mean anything to you.  With the attitude that you've shown here, you may be headed for much worse in that important and busy real life of yours.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It has nothing to do with you &quot;being better&quot; than anything, in fact it's the <br />
opposite.<br />
<br />
Last time I checked, it was a goddamned quest game. Please, while you still have quests left to do, just QUEST them. Just keep killing shit until you accidentally find a clue to help you through your dilemma.<br />
<br />
If that fails,<br />
<br />
USE THE FUCKING SEARCH BUTTON. here let me help you<br />
<br />
SEARCH &gt; DROGA GREENMIST ... wow only 400 answers come up that specifically deal with your query.<br />
<br />
Yeah, we're totally arguing that you're better than us<br />
<br />
:rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gohansama</div><div class="date">02-11-2004, 03:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow, you know what the funny thing is Groff?<br />
<br />
<br />
You typed all that, and put your heart into it just to show up someone like me, and earn the respect of your message board counterparts, but you know what I read out of all that?<br />
<br />
<br />
Nothing.<br />
<br />
<br />
Why? Because I don't care what you have to say. If you're going to make a long rant about ethics and critique on a message board, then you really need to find something more constructive to do with your time.<br />
<br />
Actually, no I take that back. Continue making long rants on message boards, about people like myself. I'm sure it makes up, and gives you a positive feeling for whatever sad, pathetic life you live. Actually, I'm thankful that I, a random assement of words and setences that was posted on a message board has given you such a warm, positive feeling in your worthless life.<br />
<br />
But I can understand why you dislike me, and choose to insult me. It's because I haven't &quot;paid my dues&quot;. You see, I registered here, and made this post because I needed help, and information regarding a quest I was having trouble with. I treated you people with disrespect, and like you were a computer database, rather then people behind those computer screens, and for that I do apologize. I'm not a fan of message boards, so I have no idea as to what the standards and practices are here. Perhaps if I had choosen words in my original post that showed more respect, and gratitute torwards you people, we wouldn't be in the current situation that we are.<br />
<br />
But the fact people continue to rant, and continue to insult me really saddens me. I meant no harm, no injustice. I searched the internet, and all the EverQuest sites I know. In fact, I have a whole folder dedicated to EverQuest on my Internet Explorer favorites. I searched all over for answers, which I never found. Someone suggested I try http://www.shadowknight.org , in which I did. I needed help so I sought this place out, as suggested to me by someone. And yes, I did indeed use the &quot;Search&quot; feature here, but still did not find the answers I was looking for. So I regesitered, and made a post.<br />
<br />
In Hindsight, I expected more out of you people. Not information wise, but character wise. I expected nice, kind, considerate people who would gladly help out a fellow EQer. Instead I find a harash backlash of insults, and bigotry. All because I asked for some help, regarding the Greenmist quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Groff Gorespiller</div><div class="date">02-11-2004, 04:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Originally posted by gohansama <br />
 I expected nice, kind, considerate people who would gladly help out a fellow EQer.  <br />
<br />
And yet you didn't offer anything up to us for that willingness to help.  I don't have a problem, so much, with your first post.  You asked your question, you gave what facts you thought were pertenant.  You could have used search (don't tell me you did, because if you had, or had looked through the forum actually devoted to the quest in question, you wouldn't have needed to make the post), but I'm even willing to forgo the usual search nazi-ism for a moment and recognize that you posted more considerately than many who come here and make the same initial mistake (at least you didn't use leet-speke).<br />
<br />
The problem started when you began to take things too seriously, yourself included.  Jobrill posted back with a little information and some joking chiding on your mention of KEI and Virtue wearing off.  Probably because I know for a fact that he solo'd that part of the quest when it was deep in Droga at around 55 or so, and succeeded, most likely without Virtue (as cleric buffs were rarely available at that time, even if you had the money for them).  So did I.  <br />

Then, you take offense to his comments and start spouting garbage about your real life and how this is just a game (which you find interesting enough to &quot;search&quot; all over the internet looking for quest help).  You claim some longevity in the game and you call people names and tell them how pathetic they are.  Please, junior.  It doesn't matter what you originally wanted or originally intended.  You're responsible for your conduct here and everywhere else you'll ever go.  And your conduct was attrocious... WHILE you were asking for help from people who made the effort to go that road before you without that help.<br />
<br />
You consistantly try to declare your neutrality and indifference toward the people posting here, yet when pushed, you start in with the typically juvenile name calling.  &quot;You are probably so sad in your pathetic real life...&quot;  Ok, if you say so chief.  I thought you didn't know me nor care to.  I'm not ranting against you, I'm trying to help you.  You came here and asked for help, and though the discussion has now moved from the topic of the Greenmist quest, I'm still offering you sage advice that will make your life (and, actually, your game too) better.  Take it.  Please.</div></div><hr />

The reason you'll find very little about SKs on any other boards is because out of all the classes, it seems that people know the least about what the hell a Shadowknight is and does. For a long time, you never SAW one- because they certainly weren't being invited to your groups. The people on this board lived and played through those times (as you have) and had to figure everything out for themselves. So it would stand to reason that a forum community made up of those people is going to be pretty insistent on people learning for themselves when the information has been provided already.<br />

Roll up a Druid and you can pretty much get yourself to 65 without ever visiting a message board and get by only on the advice you /shout for in PoK.  The Druid boards are filled with posts that start &quot;Hi! I just got Elementals Flagged today, this is my first post here- how do I find animals in zones??!&quot; And instead of tearing them a new one for being a complete disgrace to the class and the reason why Druids get such a bad name, the community there will hug them, welcome them, and walk them through the things that any self respecting Druid should have known by level 12.  <br />
<br />
Not to be too snobbish or anything but I've come to find there are two types of SK's. Those who read these boards and those who don't. And it is usually apparant which is which very quickly. <br />

If someone suggested you try SK.org, that suggestion is usually followed by the universal in-joke: &quot;oh yeah, and use the search function&quot;.  So now... you know. And Welcome to SK.org.</div></div><hr />
