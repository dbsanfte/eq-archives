After killing countless guards in katta I still cant walk in seru hehe. There must be some other method to raise faction faster. Maybe need to kill higher level named who knows</div></div><hr />

You start out somewhere near max KOS so it will take a LOT of hits to get you to dubious.<br />
You will loose faction with coterie and Seru factions.<br />
<br />
Seru has 8 or 9 different factions! and worse they are not aligned, some oppose others. Some are restricted to certain areas, while others wander. Expect to find the 'eye' faction mobs anywhere - these are the spies of the inquisition.<br />
Seru faction is gained by killing in Katta, from killing thought horrors/Spire spirits in Mons Letis and from killing Recuso in Marus Seru. And of course there are quests.<br />
Killing Grieg in Grieg's End also gives a pretty big hit to a few Seru factions.</div></div><hr />
