<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Won't give me the note.  I'm ogre shadowknight.  Tried dark elf illusion potion to see if that helped faction.  Still dubious.  Any ideas?  What faction is she on?  Can I skip the note and still do the quest?  How do I raise Qrixat faction?<br />
<br />
[Sun Jun 27 21:32:19 2004] You say, 'I received your summons.'<br />
[Sun Jun 27 21:32:20 2004] Qrixat Du`voy says 'Your particular 'talents' are not needed for this task.  I am sure you can find something else to occupy your time.  Now be gone.'<br />
[Sun Jun 27 21:32:32 2004] Qrixat Du`voy glowers at you dubiously -- she appears to be quite formidable.<br />
<br />
Thanks, <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">TSK in my guild has it, but it was quite a while ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'd suggest looking on EQTraders.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Posted there first, slein.  Nobody seems to have any answers.  Everyone gets this quest but me. :(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Skvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If shes on DE Clr faction (Priests of Innoruuk) then doing the following quests raise your faction :-<br />
 <br />
Innoruuk Disciple <br />
Innoruuk Initiate <br />
Innoruuk Regent <br />
<br />
Should raise your faction. Not sure she is on their faction though and cant find anything to confirm it :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">What if I don't have sufficient faction to do those quests?  Any mob I can kill?<br />
<br />
I'll try farming those quests and see how that affects my faction.<br />
<br />
My fear is that they changed it so that shd can't do the quest... or that there's no way for me to raise the faction.<br />
<br />
Tried charming her.  Cant be charmed. :(<br />
<br />
Since it's not a hand in but a phrase, hide/invis won't work.  Sneak works.. but I don't have sneak.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ok... did some testing.<br />
<br />
brand new Level 1 ogre shadowknight of rallos zek, dubious faction -- would not give him the quest.<br />
<br />
brand new Level 1 dark elf shadowknight of innoruuk, amiable faction -- would not give him the quest.<br />
<br />
brand new Level 1 dark elf cleric of innoruuk, amiable faction -- would give the quest.<br />
<br />
level 65 ogre shaman of rallos zek, dubious faction -- would give the quest.<br />
<br />
This makes it look like it's ok to have dubious faction or worship rallos zek or be level 1.. but that being a shadowknight won't give you the quest.<br />
<br />
This really PISSES ME OFF since I've saved up most of the quest drops to do this and just need to turn them in.  Brael, how did you do this quest?  Anyone that's done the quest legitimately want to enlighten me on what I'm doing wrong?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ok problem solved.  Shadowknights have to get the quest from Sir Artanis in North Freeport.  The DE clr wont' give it to shadowknights for some reason.<br />
<br />
Halfway done with phylactery now.   Yay.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">that's weird, i did it on both my sk &amp; dru, and SK got it from dark elf, dru got it from human. odd that it changed, its probably a bug cause i don't think they'd intentionally send SKs into the freeport paladin guild.</div></div><hr />
