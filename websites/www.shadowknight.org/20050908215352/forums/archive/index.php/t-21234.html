<br />
I see people refering to using fear for aggro.  I understand this works because at some level, mobs become immune to fear, so the spell pisses them off, but does not send them running for a train.<br />
<br />
What level mobs does this happwn with, and how do you tell if the mob is high enough to not succumb to &quot;summon train&quot;?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some (the ones that split off LDoN traps are a classic) are fearable though; it's just a case of working out which is which i.e. a real pain in a new zone until you're sure.<br />
<br />
Bottom line though, if you're in PoV or higher, or LDoNs at 65 (guessing at where you exp), almost anything not light blue is immune to fear.</div></div><hr />

Bug or feature? You decide.</div></div><hr />

I have a feeling its a side effect of something else, like disabling &quot;LD-status&quot; effects like Fear/Charm.  Remember that they were removed in tandem from PVP several years ago, so they may be linked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brael</div><div class="date">05-09-2004, 04:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't use fear in Uqua either, have to rely on chaining Festering/Clinging and even that isn't very helpful because sprits touch seriously lowers the spell aggro you generate from cast time increases.  SK aggro in Uqua is pitiful at best, I find myself praying taunt works more often than not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vixeena</div><div class="date">05-12-2004, 09:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is the idea of using fear for agro, that the regular agro-increaser spells are crap?  They seem to work ok for me.<br />
<br />
Fear seems to work also, but im wondering why the suggestion / idea would be to use fear rather than the actual agro increaser spells.<br />
<br />
Also for the most part the darkness line seems to work just fine, unless somone -REALLY- pisses the mobs off, and even then usually 2-3 casts will pull the mob back off them, at least in my (granted limited) experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keevel</div><div class="date">05-12-2004, 10:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The regular line of &quot;agro spells&quot; is technically the terror line.<br />
<br />
Get an idiot wizzy who uses a AE at the wrong time then try to get an incoming add to ignore him just using a terror...doesn't work.  Fear builds more agro, does break mezz and has a qucker cast time (I think).  It's the none damage agro spell of choice.  If you're only using the darkness line for agro you're gonna break alot of mezzes.  It's good to know and use your whole set of spells and thier capabilities.  <br />
<br />
NOTE: the fear they are using is the low level one and really is only good for mobs above 55 (or those immune to fear) as otherwise you will train yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">StPatrick</div><div class="date">05-16-2004, 08:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">(Introducing: been reading these boards for a loooong time and learned much, but haven't posted a lot yet :) )<br />
<br />
I'm still unsure that Fear is a good spell for aggro. Let me explain why I think so..<br />
<br />
Recently I have tried one simple test in Veksar several times:<br />
First pull with CD (Cascading), when mob arrives to camp, pally in group casts some low level stun. I still keep aggro.<br />
Second pull with Fear and again pally uses same stun and gets (!) aggro.<br />
<br />
Fear is not less (I think even longer) cast time than CD also.<br />
<br />
So my question is: maybe Fear's aggro was nerfed or I'm doing something wrong?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">StruzorGnome</div><div class="date">05-16-2004, 09:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When people say CD they mean clinging darkness, not cascading.  Cascading may indeed be more aggro, and clinging probably is more aggro too, BUT there is a recast on the snares incase you want to chain them, AND the snare lines are dots, and alot of the time you just can't dot, and I challenge you to find a better non-dot aggro spell than fear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ogrukk</div><div class="date">05-16-2004, 12:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">level 15 Fear really generates more aggro than lvl 63 Terror of Thule?</div></div><hr />

Obviously thats offers far better insight than using it as your primary raid agro spell for over a year.  It may well be less agro than CD on some mobs, but that doesnt matter.  Its more than sufficient to hold agro and its huge advantage is that its not a dot.<br />
<br />
level 15 Fear really generates more aggro than lvl 63 Terror of Thule?<br />
That depends on what your fighting.  Debuffs including snare/fear dont have a fixed number, they scale to the mob.  Thats why when terrors were first proposed I was saying they'd fail miserably.  Good agro that scales with content and mob difficulty &gt; some fixed number balanced for exp groups a year ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">StPatrick</div><div class="date">05-17-2004, 02:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When people say CD they mean clinging darkness, not cascading <br />
Bah, sorry, messed up with spell names. Yes I meant the level 15 (5 damage per tick) spell, which looks like named Clinging :D<br />
<br />
And you can cast CD twice faster than Fear:<br />
CD: Casting time 1.75, Recast 4<br />
Fear: Casting time 3.5, Recast 7<br />
<br />
You will probably lose the aggro while trying to cast such a long spell like Fear, not to mention that you have more chance to be interrupted while tying to cast it<br />
<br />
Well, my guild is still pretty new on Storm, highest level is 63, so I haven't seen many &quot;uber&quot; mobs or zones and do not have a lot of experience, but from what I've seen, pulling with CD (lvl 15 spell) and continuing either with it or lvl 59 Terror spell during the fight, allows me to keep aggro all the way, doesn't matter if there is a wizzy who nukes earlier or shaman/chanter who slows *shrugs*. Yes, tried with Fear instead of Terror too. Bah, I lost aggro to pally (he was chain stunning to prevent mob's gating) before I succeeded to cast it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dakkin</div><div class="date">05-17-2004, 04:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">StPatrick, buy a ring of goblin lords.  It'll reduce your CD casting time to around one second.<br />
<br />
My fear casting time is well under 2 seconds.  That's normal for an SK with cheap focus and innate 60+ level spell haste.<br />
<br />
SKs going for maximum aggro do not chain cast fear; they drop their highest level darkness on the incoming mob to get a couple more spells on it before it reaches camp, then alternate fear and clinging darkness.  Fear is noticeably better aggro than CD but has a longer recast time so alternating with CD gives better aggro than either on their own.<br />
<br />
Terror is a poor aggro spell due to being configured to basically (a) not work at range and (b) generate much less aggro than snares or fears.<br />
<br />
Incidentally it's best to avoid doing aggro tests on undead or animals, which are often configured to react oddly to proximity and other effects.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps, and thanks for the input.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now i just gotta get high enough level to fight mobs that are immune to fear...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keevel</div><div class="date">05-18-2004, 11:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another thing I've lerned on these boards:<br />
<br />
The agro generated by the terror line is a static amount while the agro from our other spells (fear CD, etc.) scales with the Mob.   <br />
<br />
Assuming that other classes spells scale the same way (slow, tash, etc.) the terror line becomes much less effective in keeping agro off them soon after you get it.<br />
<br />
This might explain why whenever I've seen anyone recommend the Terror line it is always in conjunction with the use of another spell.</div></div><hr />
