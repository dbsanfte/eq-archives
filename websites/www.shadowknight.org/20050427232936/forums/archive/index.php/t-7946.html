VI said there is a penalty for stat's below 75 so I put 5 agi 5 dex and 10 int.<br />
<br />
Now if I have to change out equip for resist gear or better ac or effect I will always have at least 75. (I aviod neg stat gear if possible -cha who cares only worry when I sell and have equip for 112+ cha)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If I had it to do over again I'd put my points in Sta and Dex.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kirhouk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think I would agree with Gash personally</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kharzhoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I dropped all of my points in int (back in 1999)<br />
<br />
If I had to do it again, I would do 5 agi and rest stamina. There was a while that I had to wear agi items just to get above that mark - and it was very annoying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nighteyes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">so keeping the INT at its starting point isnt that much of a henderance then? Since it would be below the 75 thing that was mentioned earlier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aaoogaa Soulhunter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">What ever you do make sure your Agi is at 75.  This is a huge issue so make sure to put those 5 points into agi.  I put all of my starting points into int and am very happy with that (barring the 5 into agi).  I think that building up stamina is important as well but with the additions of the new spells a larger mana pool is nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">When you get to a reasonable level, you'll have AGI bonuses on the odd armor piece such that you'll be well over 75.  I wouldn't put any into it if I were you.  I didn't, and you can check my gear to see what I mean.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Paynreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Raise agility to 75, spend other points any way you like. Dont ask questions, just DO IT.<br />
<br />
<br />
Okay, the reason is with less than 75 AGI you take a bitch of an AC hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shiverr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If I had it to do over I would have bumped Dex up a bit more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Reyortsed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I put mine  in str/stam/agi.  If I could do it over I would probably do agi/dex/int.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Rhone Darkarrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Sta, all of em, stamina tends to be the most difficult stat to raise without sacraficing something else, ac, or whatever.  Besides, in the end, hp is king anyway :)<br />
<br />
Oter stats are easy as hell to raise via decent gear</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">/disagree<br />

Typically, at any raid, my sta is maxed.  Basically, those points I put into it are doing nothing.  My dex, on the other hand, is not.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>TheNephilim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">All good points. The one thing people are implying but not saying is don't waster points on str. I put 5 or so into it and i wish I hadn't. Almost all SK gear has str on it. There are also tons of spells which add str. Sta is good, agi is good, int is good. However with c3 and above, int isnt much of an issue for me cause I regen mana so fast.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>asguth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">id have to agree with bumping up dex its so valuable to me at least</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Darkbeat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">As an Ogre SK I up 10 into DEX. 5 into AGI (gotta get to 75), and 5 into int cuz low mana pool. <br />
<br />
Thats just what I did, i needed the extra dex due to a partial set of Crustacian gear. GL thou.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Lunaticfringesk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">You guys should scroll down and read the thread, &quot;So stamina end all be all...&quot; as some very good schools of thought were brought out.  Granted, that thread deals with an IKS SK, but some of the points made there still hold water regardless.<br />
<br />
I like to argue, for a small race, go hard into STA.  Some other SKs will make an argument for all into INT, even for a small race such as a dark elf, but I personally disagree with that approach (not that it is wrong, just differing viewpoints).<br />
<br />
For an orge or a troll, however, the situation becomes vastly easier.  Go hard into INT.  A troll, probably all 20 points.  An orge, at least 15, depending on your situation, but it would be hard to go wrong even with all 20 into INT.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>dzenith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">5 into agi is important because of the penalty of having lower than 75, like has been mentioned.<br />
<br />
However, I have to question anyone that would recommend putting points into str, dex or agi(beyond 75), as they are all easily maxed with a primal/prismatic weapon.  Most servers have 10+ guilds capable of getting into and doing sleepers tomb, so it isn't as if its rare anymore.  <br />
<br />
The sta vs int debate is interesting for medium/small races.  There are points for putting points into each and what level of the game you plan to play becomes a large contributing factor.  However for a large race it shouldn't be a debate at all.  An ogre/troll can easily max their sta buffed.  Any race can, however large races do it much faster with their much larger starting stamina.  An ogre has 57 more stamina than a dark elf at creation.<br />
So why bother putting points into a stat that you are eventually easily going to max?  So the logical choice will be to put all points but 5agi into int.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Stwongbad Soulkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I went all dex at creation after looking at all the self proccing spells and such.  I think this was a good route for me.  I have an unbuffed agi of 97, so I'm not hurting there I don't think.  As far as int goes, I would probably have split between dex and int if I soloed more, but as it stands, I'm more then happy with where I put my points.  Can't wait for my BAH to start proccing, I get the insufficient will message about 5-6 time per fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Grimbad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">5 Agi and Dex, 10 Int.<br />
<br />
Dwarven Cleric friend of mine loses 40 AC if he removes one of his Forest Loops...  Agi falls to 73 though if he does that.<br />
<br />
We played around with Agi a bit and noticed he loses 35 AC if it falls below 75, and he's naked other than stat jewelry.<br />
<br />
Trust me, the pain you don't have to put up with now is better than the pain you may endure later.  Don't follow the Ranger view of Stamina.  Besides, you're an Ogre, and Stamina items aren't that rare.  Worship Cazic Thule and they're more common with the racial armor.<br />
<br />
I don't really have any evidence for the dex, but if it were me I'd feel better with more dex.  Just me though.<br />
<br />
Personally I'm a Troll, and don't have to piddle with such small things.  I went all Int and am quite happy, as I never have enough mana.  Course, that comes from idiot bards playing their ub3r 6 point DS song and not the mana song in a group full of peeps with mana...  sorry for that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Bohdy Bagg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">i split points btwn agi/dex/int ...it was castersrealm's suggestion b4 they re-did the guides STA heavy...think it was 7agi 6dex 7int or sumtin like that - worked out fine so far <br />
<br />
im currently wearing a fungi n im glad i put a couple extra into agi seeing how i dont have many agi items, have to wear a crappy golden chitin bracer to bump agi above 75 again but yeah wutever ..ill shut up</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Kozak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">5 dex 5 agi 10 int .... anything else is a waste.. 305 sta unbuffed is so easy w/ a guild who can at least do Ntov.</div></div><hr />

It is... topic was OGRE SK not DE SK.... and all the NTOV armor and armor its eqaul to has like 25+ sta on each piece....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Manslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Lots of NToV stuff does have STA, but hardly 25+ on most pieces.  And you only really need 245 to max.  That is very easy to get as an Ogre.  Its obtainable by any race relatively easily once you get to top end Luclin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Lunaticfringesk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">It is not easy to add 178 points to STA, even if you are in a guild that is NToV capable.  You need to play / raid your ass off to get all the loot that would be required to do it.<br />
<br />
You need to remember one thing...&quot;easy&quot; is a subjective thing.  What you might consider &quot;easy,&quot; someone else may not.<br />
<br />
Further, Manslayer is absolutely right..NToV is hardly overflowing with +25 STA items..<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Manslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">You really only need 245 so would really just need 118, which isn't nearly as hard:)  And the easy thing is relative to what point in the game you are at.  Once you start doing emp/vt etc its very easy to reach 245.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Lunaticfringesk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">&quot;You really only need 245 so would really just need 118, which isn't nearly as hard And the easy thing is relative to what point in the game you are at.

<br />
<br />
I definitely agree that reaching 245 is vastly easier then reaching 305, but take a look at his original comment.  He said getting to 305 unbuffed was easy if you are in a guild that can do at least NToV...<br />
<br />
Yeah, right  :) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Kozak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Really wasnt ment as a Flame. Sry if i came accross that way. Been at 278 Sta since i got Planer power5. that was with 80% ntov gear as an ogre SK... now im can take off like 4 items b4 my sta budge's . ;c( <br />
<br />
Very sorry. the whole point was Sta is ungoldy easy to get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Whacko Attacko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Ogre Specific &gt;&gt; 5 INT .::. 15 AGI (or 5DEX 10AGI)<br />
<br />
SK's can last for about 4+ mobs w/75INT starting at 9th level and that's considering you are chain casting all you got memmed. Don't worry about Int. Unless &quot;yooz wanta lurn fasder&quot;<br />
<br />
STR is quit high enough as well as STA! Tons of this gear out there anyway.<br />
<br />
Cram the rest into AGI. Now I'm probably going to be debated here but AGI is the tougher of the abilities to raise IMO.<br />
<br />
When it comes to DEX you really only need to have 115-120 to Proc respectfully (1 every 30 seconds)where as you'll want your AGI 255 (or as close as possiable).<br />
<br />
After 50ish it's not gonna matter anyway =P<br />
<br />
And there's my big fat opinion.</div></div><hr />
