<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Carshail Shel'rac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What's she for? She says something about being on the trail of Gargantula the Mother of Spiders and that some guy named Jazan shouldn't have waited so long. I remembered a Jazan K'jartan in Neriak 3rd Gate but he only told me to piss off :P<br />
She's standing in one of the tents at the DE camp.<br />
<br />
Anyone got a clue? Looked around on a lot of spoiler sites etc but couldn't find anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Morgrist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">When in doubt, ask Morgrist the Lore Guy.<br />
 <br />
She's part of the froglok illusion stone quest (all/all,1 charge Illusion: Guktan) that's used to do an assassination in Gukta.<br />
 <br />
If you're a troll and can get your Spurned and Ebon Hand factions up,you should be able to do it.<br />
 <br />
And face it. If you're a troll, you've wanted to go in there and make one of those yellow puddle pissers die a painful death. Here's your chance.<br />
 <br />
Start by talking to the enchanter at the top of the Spurned's area in Neriak Commons. He should tell you about wanting to get the trolls out of the city. Go from there.<br />
 <br />
The assassin is in 3rd Gate,Ebon Hand building. <br />
 <br />
You'll need a poisonmaker to do this properly. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Carshail Shel'rac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ah alright, thanks man ;) been in vacation for a month, god, I missed a lot it seems : /<br />
<br />
No I'm not a troll, but I guess my Troll SK bro will find this information handy :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Morgrist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Heck,I play a human SK on FV. I still want to do this one because I -hate- frogloks IG.<br />
 <br />
I dearly,dearly want to be known as the first on the server to choke that froglok to death. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aelali</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Theis seems like it would be a nice quest to do for fun, could someone maybe post more info on it? I can't seem to find anything about it anywhere (might just be me) and I can't find the right rogue in Neriak to talk to for the quest to go on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Morgrist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Okay. Here's what you're going to do.<br />
 <br />
First,you MUST go to the top of the stairs in the Spurned building. Talk to the Enchanter GM up there. He'll tell you to go to the Ebon Hand.<br />
 <br />
Next,when you get there (in 3rd Gate) walk in the door,turn right immediately and you'll see a rogue. Say to him &quot;I need to assassinate someone.&quot; Go through the text. You -are- getting flagged for stuff as you do. You'll get a slimy mortar and pestle to do the combine. Two parts you get from a poison-maker. Susceptible Essence and Mind Melt. Two parts you'll need from killing a named in Dagnor's Cauldron and South Ro. Bring a group. They're mean enough that you don't want to solo them.<br />
 <br />
Go to Grimpl in DC FIRST. Hand in the note,track Jagged Fang and kill it,then go back to Grimpl with what you get and get the note for the South Ro Teir'dal and Gargantua. Get the poison component from Gargantua and head back to the rogue with the combined result. Then go back to the enchanter. You'll get a 1-charge item, ALL/ALL with Illusion:Guktan. He will recharge it for you if needed.<br />
 <br />
If you're not an enchanter,you can stop here and enjoy the toy. Or,take the stone to Gukta,zone in and illusion up. Find the right guy and hand him the poisoned mug of ale you now have.<br />
 <br />
Watch him suffer and die. You'll end up with a medal off his twitching corpse. Bringing it back to the enchanter will get you the enchanter Illusion: Guktan spell (NO DROP I believe.).<br />
 <br />
