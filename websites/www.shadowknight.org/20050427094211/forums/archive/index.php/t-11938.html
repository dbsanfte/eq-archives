<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Iamcreapingdeath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I play and Ogre.  I should be hitting 60 in a few days. My int is only 82 and all my casting skills are on par with the spells that I am casting (ie Dooming Darkness).  My conjuration is about 215 or something, and I can get up to about 5 fizzles in a row on the level 49 snare spell.  Then after that, it gets resisted.  <br />
<br />
My question is; does race play a role in fizzle rate or my low int or both?  <br />
<br />
Thank you<br />

<br />
Of course, all evidence at my disposal would lead me to believe that there is a fizzle modifyer that is larger the closer you are to the level of the spell (for your class), but I could be wrong.<br />
<br />
<br />
Seems like we've touched on this general issue before, sometime in the recent past though.  I'll try searching to see if I can find the specific thread, as some days all the topics from 4 different boards just seem to run together for me.<br />

EDIT: Found it. Check HERE (http://forums.shadowknight.org/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=11624&amp;highlight=fizzle) for the full discussion on Fizzle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>kbern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think it is solely up to your skills and the fizzle rate set into the spell settings.<br />
<br />
I will toss out an observation my brother made to me, but who knows, he might have just been stoned, but he thinks he fizzles more once his KEI runs out, which lowers the int and wis back down by 25 when it does.<br />
<br />
Either it does have something to do with it, he was just stoned, or he noticed it more since his mana was dropping more noticably when you fizzle w/o kei and the bigger mana pool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>GenoReaper999</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">if you raise you skill it shouldnt fizzle as much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zakton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Up your INT and casting skills.  They all fizzle alot when your skills are under 150.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Chavo Guerrero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Verant put in a code where you fizzle more as soon as you hit 51.  It's just a way to force you to buy that gimpy mastery of the past bullshit aa.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>gummab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i have to agree with the post above, since 51 for some unknown reason im fizzling a hell of alot more and my skills and maxxed except for evocation, is it true about the code? or am i paranoid:confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jupke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">From what i have gathered Int has a small modifier on fizzle rates. I believe i read something about it on the wiz forum, will see if i can find it again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zugwugger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I've just happened on to Bat Skul's (+5 int Each) and have had a noc blade for some time (+15 int)  being a ogre My intell is 90 (pumped my first 20 in it) and noticed the +25 (+40ish with KEI) does make a difference in my fizzle rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Iskander</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Whole problem with increased fizzling rates appeared right after that patch when Luclin and AAs came out. Shammy friend of mine, I was playing with thouse days, were ranting and petitioning like hell and were getting answers that nothing intentionally were made to increase fizzle rate. But indeed my fizzle rate gone up considerably after that patch.<br />
<br />
Fizzle rates affected by apropriate skill (big effect), difference between current level and level of spell (big effect), intellect (small effect) and I heard that dexterity also affect it (no idea).<br />
Fizzle-reduction buffs increase your current level when determinig your chance to fizzle. Like +5 L for Intellectual Superiority and +3 L for it's early version.</div></div><hr />
