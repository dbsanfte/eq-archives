<br />
I ask because I'm going to have to do a super fast faction switch to Kael/Tormax, then back to CoV.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lejina Bloodbath</div><div class="date">08-04-2002, 03:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do you really wear a White Dragon Helm (FT2 boots kinda wasted) and Zlandicar's talisman (ST key kinda wasted) on your lvl 32 sk twink?<br />
<br />
I know a lot of loot float around in the end game and the twinks can get some decent stuff once in a while, but this looks ridiculous.<br />
<br />
Wait, a Dain Belt on a lvl 32 sk ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vitari</div><div class="date">08-04-2002, 04:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes it's all true, yes it's insane.  Smithing has been kind.<br />
<br />
No one knows if there's a level limit on the Dain belt quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bolas</div><div class="date">08-04-2002, 08:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Earring of the Solstice is level-limited to 50+ isn't it?  So how do you have it on a level 32?  And greenmist on a level 32?  C'mon... who are you kidding?<br />
<br />
-Bolas</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vitari</div><div class="date">08-04-2002, 10:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The earring doesn't give full stats but it can be worn.<br />
<br />
Anyone that likes can log into Torv and look for either me or Sielle.<br />
<br />
I have a lot of friends that helped me with Greenmist, and I'm also the only smith on the server that makes Iksar and Ogre advanced cultural armor for sale.  Monopoly on a market = tons of plat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vitari</div><div class="date">08-04-2002, 10:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just checked and at 32 the earring of Solstice has the following stats:<br />
<br />
AC 3, +3 Sta, +5 Int/Wis, +35 HP/Mana, +3 SvMFC, FT1<br />
<br />
Not the full effect, but not bad at all.</div></div><hr />

Tormax may respond to hails but then he may eat Dain's Head. Saturday, I went to turn in all 4 epic pieces (Lhranc responed to hails and every keyword, and i was indifferent) Hit trade. Guess what, some programmer thought he was slick by giving Lhranc a lvl turn in limit and he ate all the pieces. I'd just buy the head which I assume you are doing, and wait till you get lvl 50 or 51.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bolas</div><div class="date">08-05-2002, 11:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If they give you the quest they have to give you the reward, that's one of the rules for quests that has been stated by Verant.<br />
<br />
So if he says &quot;there are only two things i'm concerned with, the death of dain and yelinak&quot; and you say &quot;what dain&quot; and he says &quot;id give ya somethin cool for his head' then say &quot;uber&quot; and turn it in.  If he doesn't give you the quest, dont' turn it in.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dachande</div><div class="date">08-06-2002, 10:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't risk it. Heres the reply I just received from the lying bastards at customer service.<br />
<br />
&quot;After investigating your situation, it has been determined that we are <br />
unable to reimburse you.  I made a copy of your character and if you<br />
hailed Lhranc you would have found that he would not assist you with the<br />
quest due to your age.  Also I do not see any of your characters turning<br />
in the items over this weekend to any NPC in the City of Mist.  Since I<br />
can not see your character turning in the items for the quest I will not<br />
be able to reimburse them.  I understand that such a loss can be<br />
frustrating, and it is regrettable that we were unable to assist you&quot;<br />
<br />
Good thing I took screenshots eh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Niftystuff</div><div class="date">08-06-2002, 12:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually that's not true Bolas, I lost my decrepit hide cause he gave me the quest but didn't give me the reward and the GM said it wasn't a bug and to &quot;go get another one&quot; and contact him again.  If only the ignorant bastard knew how hard that was.  As far as I know now if an NPC won't give you the reward he won't accept the item but I don't know how true that is.  As far as a level limit on the belt I doubt anyone knows cause probably anyone that has gotten it has always been 55+.</div></div><hr />
