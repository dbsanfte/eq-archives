<br />
don't use dark too many times, unless you got a whole group trying to kill a bard.  a couple tries on darkness and then your good.  if your going up against a higher lvl player with better gear than their MR is probably too high, even if u dispell em..<br />
<br />
pumice is your friend, for about 20pp you can get 5 charges of nullify magic with 3 second casting.  thats two buff slots each 3 seconds so u might get lucky and catch a few keys buffs.  this is why insta-clicks are godly in pvp.  jboots, grim aura earring, and the 8th coldain ring are nice insta-clicks.<br />
<br />
i dont know what lvl you are but you seem low lvl.. in my spell slots i always have lifetap, dark, some dot like ignite blood or blood of hate, FD, our 2 buff cancel magic, aura of darkness, and lich or whatever<br />
<br />
anyways gotta go, ill type more later maybe..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mrbad</div><div class="date">03-18-2005, 07:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So what about heat blood and cascading darkness...and the three spears...that is what I load up.....These other spells u speak of might be PoP spells...where I turn in Ethereal parchments in for them....I  have worked PoD for months and have yet to see one drop off of the pile of bile or any other mob that Alaka says drops it....Doesn't Nullify Magic or Cancel magic work as good as Pumie?   I load those spells as well.... Send more info if you can plz...ty...Btw ..I am above 60 so maybe you can suggest some other spells other than Aura of Darkness....Ignite Blood and Blood of Hate...and why don't I have these spells...do they sell in POK Library...will look later....any info is appreciated...Thanks...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GorranVZ</div><div class="date">03-19-2005, 02:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Stacking your buffs right is really important too.  Certain debuffs/dots will overwrite buffs so you can quickly dispell them if you have your order right.  Like for example, Malos overwrites bobbing corpse and many different dots overwrite aura of battle.  <br />
<br />
The best is to put 2 crap buffs in your top slots and then proceed with your normal buffs.  When you engage in pvp, click the top 2 buffs so they are open for any dots/debuffs they might cast, then dispell them right away.<br />
<br />
Aura of darkness is a great spell to cast in pvp because all debuffs have a 50% increased effectiveness in pvp.  Assuming you're on a pvp server, from what I understand all spells with recourses don't work in pvp on blue servers.  I would ditch the cascading darkness and go with engulfing darkness, it's lower mana and cast time.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">senor sperro</div><div class="date">03-21-2005, 10:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">people get uber by playing alot... thats it plain and simple<br />
<br />
in pvp, i used to use clinging darkness to save mana.. im not sure how long it lasts in pvp but i used it cuz it cost me only 15 mana and bards like to resists that shiat<br />
<br />
spears are ghey, dont use them they are a waste of time~it is better to use spells that have negative resists modifiers like blood of hate, ignite blood, and all those other blood spells we got out there<br />
<br />
as for those uber people with 300+ resists, get ur aaxp horse so u can run..theres no shame in running sometimes<br />
<br />
gorran put it right on stacking buffs correctly, put virtue and c3 last of all so that it has the least chance of getting dispelled<br />
<br />
and theres always strategies on certain classes: like buying cure potions for shamans and necros... those 10charge ones that cure disease and cure poision(seperate ones)<br />
<br />
against druids go all FR, when they dot you just dispell it<br />
<br />
and pumice is so much better than our cancel magic because it has a cast time of 3 seconds compared to our 5 seconds and it has insta recast~in other words u can click it again right after it was used~no waiting to recast!<br />
<br />
on enchanters im not sure about it but i think if u dot urself ( like with disease cloud) it can break their mez, its fun but i still get my ass kicked by them all the time (they dispell all ur buffs most of the time)<br />
<br />
one important thing is to always check the zone and remember peoples class so that you will know who u might be fighting soon :)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shadowsoal</div><div class="date">03-21-2005, 05:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">vs. an enchanter or a bard the dot must be dealing negative hp, so if your hp regeneration  standing is 37 or less and you have pact of hate, disease cloud will work (if you can get your regen to be -1 or more with pact + disease cloud it will break mez),  when you look at my magelo, you see my base regen is too high, that I can't disease cloud myself to break chanter mez, and most other dots we have either don't last long enough to be worth it, or deal too much damage to us, dotting yourself is a good tactic in the low end, but not in the high end.<br />
<br />
generally vs. a chanter, they will mez you strip you of every buff tash you defbuff you move max range, nuke you, rezmez you etc.  gonna wanna start w/ a pet and REALLY hard dps, key to beating a chanter is beating the living christ out of them fast, put dots on them, use bash wisely.<br />
<br />
a key to winning pvp is playing your opponent, if your playing a Tacvi geared person, then darkness + aystol line is totally useless, if your fighting someone who is bazaar geared may consider using them.<br />
<br />
person spell setup<br />
1) best lifetap<br />
2) 2nd best lifetap<br />
3) best poison based dot<br />
4) best fire based dot<br />
5) shadowstep<br />
6) best spear<br />
7) 2nd best poison based dot<br />
8) 2nd best disease based dot<br />
9) 2nd best spear<br />
<br />
use your discs wisely, don't burn Harm Touch till you know its going to kill them, use leech curse when your low on hp and mana, soul shield is used when your fightinging a melee and he pops disc and you can't get outa range, or a mage/shaman etc. casts swarm pet on you.<br />
<br />
kiting your opponent is a good idea, sure fire way to beat any warrior monk rogue berserker, is to get up on that pony, and run your tail off, stop, put a dot on them, run more, its slow, its painful, but they will die</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GorranVZ</div><div class="date">03-22-2005, 12:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh chanters are easy to kill if you can get your dots to land.  Put your lich in the very last buff spot and start casting the shit out of DoTs.  Their rune won't block DoT damage so just stack them up.  Dark Constriction might be a shitty PvE DoT, but with aura of darkness stuck I seem to land it quite a lot.  Another trick that I don't think has been fixed yet is the cloak line of spells will block the druid Hand of Ro debuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shadowsoal</div><div class="date">03-22-2005, 07:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">no AoDarkness on blue servers, best thing we have is tash stick, more user friendly w/ bandolier now</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sivass</div><div class="date">05-22-2005, 03:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As to Dotting yourself at the highend to break mez.. lets not forget that oh so useful attack buff they gave us in LDON. Stacking that along with Pact of Decay should get you over the regen problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">omidon</div><div class="date">05-24-2005, 01:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gonna tell you a little secret about sk pvp....now I don't play on a pvp server and I'm not sure if it's different there...but when fighting well geared players, you're not going to land a snare, you'll waste more mana than you can afford using dots, your best bet is only cast touch of innorrukk, SOE decided to make the 2 lifetaps we get after that one have higher resist checks for some gay gay gay reason. If you're taking too much damage and you have mana to burn shadowstep. Also don't forget to lich and always make and haste a pet prior to duel even if it's only a distraction method, and put as many junk buffs as you can up in front of your self buffs, clickies preferred for as many slots as you have clickies for...hotkey your inventory clickies and hotkey nullify magic. If you're holding them steady below 40% (pending amount of hitpoints your opponent has)-----&gt; disc + HT = duel over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tuco</div><div class="date">05-24-2005, 03:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since were on the subject the one question I have is (now i dont no shait about pvp,i play on blue server) but been dueling a buddy of mine, 65 BST.  Now what am I missing on dueling BST's? (did do a quick search). He pawns me pretty bad, the 1k heal plus hes stuns (and the chain casting pet stuns) doesnt take him long to kill me, now I've dueled all the other classes and just had'nt had the trouble like I am with bst.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Damoe</div><div class="date">05-24-2005, 12:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Couple upgrades on your gear<br />
<br />
Try getting Bloodmetal Earring of Engagement (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=29047) and White Dragon Helm (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=29648) . Or you can easily pick up Warclasp Earring (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=70268) at MPG. I am pretty positive he lands slow on you every time you duel with him. Get your MR up.<br />
<br />
Have a hasted pet up. Your pet on bst, you on bst's pet, dispell bst's pet, dark, then go on. If you are not way too undergeared or not slowed, you have good chance. If your pet is up, have him bash the bst from the back, meaning you and your pet need to sandwich him. If things go wrong, like Omidon said, ToI and Shadowstep is the way to go. Don't turn your back on bst or his pet. Save HT for final blow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lovehate</div><div class="date">05-24-2005, 03:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Always like Shadowstep for pvp if you have time to farm it here is a clicky.<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=7725<br />
<br />
Or if you prefer and have a few minutes the cast time on these is much better.<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=3651<br />
<br />
Not sure if it still works the same but anytime in pvp with a pet class FD is very handy.  Mages expecially like to send in there swarm pets but just like a cleric hammer once you feign they loose interest.  Used to work with all pets and the player would have to redo /pet attack.  Excellent way to disorient is shadowstep/feign/move behind.  <br />
<br />
Another good way to take a pet out of a duel are these. <br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=3930<br />
<br />
Let there pet get on you, horse or jboot run it off/root/fiegn.  Now when you run back again they are disoriented as to why their pet is not attacking.  Like anything keep agressive so they dont have time to get into their own bag of tricks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Damoe</div><div class="date">05-24-2005, 03:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Other great MR gears are Livestone Plate Breastplate (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=31457) and Featherwood Compound Bow (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=29598) . Since you have Woodelf clicky, you can go at him like a ranger.  :D  <br />
<br />
Also prepare 1 button hotkey for atk/bash/disarm for jousting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tuco</div><div class="date">05-24-2005, 08:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Great points guys, ya my magelo doesnt have all my getto resist gear- but im diff'ly tracking down those items. Think the part I fucking hate (which isnt pvp,so much as class balance) is why do BST have a 1k heal in the first place? my buddy just got his ,so not sure if recent 'class revision' or always been there but seems a bit over-powered.<br />
<br />
and on a side note Big Thanks to Chayde that spell list is a huge help, great to be able to see a quick run down with the resist checks on my spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FirstBrood</div><div class="date">07-09-2005, 04:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dont PvP a lot, but it sure is fun. Usually is only one, maybe a pair of foes.<br />
 <br />
First thing I do is dis-spell...I usualy do this twice as to get my foes &quot;crap buffs&quot;.<br />
Then I shadowstep, just to screw with their heads.<br />
Darkness them, if resist first time I try again..resist second I screw it and throw a nice DoT or 3 on them...<br />
If Darkness didnt land first/second time, I try it again, usually one of these will stick long enough for you to run up to them.<br />
Once I am within melee range I DD Spear them while hitting.<br />
My spell line for PvP is usually as follows:<br />
<br />
1) Darkness.<br />
2) DoT<br />
3) Best Tap<br />
4) Second best tap<br />
5) Best spear<br />
6) Second best spear<br />
7) Dis-spell<br />
8) Shadowstep<br />
9) Harmshield(always have it upjust in case)<br />
<br />
I dont even bother with HT in PvP since SoE keeps nerfing our PvP potency.<br />
I think the most damage we can do with our HT's in PvP is like what...30% of foes present HP??<br />
What use is a 10K HT in that situation?? Save it for exp/raids etc.<br />
Jusy my 2 bits.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lorimar</div><div class="date">07-10-2005, 04:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another tip is if you are fighting a pet class, all our taps work full force on thier pets. i.e. bite, ac, aura, epic click, and leechcurse. So if you are low in HP or what not tap the pet or disc leechcurse on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">UGLA</div><div class="date">07-10-2005, 07:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Make sure you have out a 2hander and joust the beast also, don't stand toe to toe with a class that can out dps you.  Theres other small things you can do, such as buy a shaman damage shield potion or pumjuice stones in pok for 20pp for a 3 second cast time dispell, even can do the 8th coldain ring quest also, that just takes a few days now and is completely soloable.<br />
<br />
I would cast blood of discord and ignite blood on everyone you duel also, ...blood of irunku is great also if you have it.  Shadowstep is your friend as well.  But dont' waste any of your mana on spears.  Dots are the way to go for sure espcially since most people don't pay attention to sk dots and just eat them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kelv</div><div class="date">07-11-2005, 09:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tip to land darkness on a duel, mem both clinging and dooming, keep trying with clinging, once it lands you can cast dooming, I have never experienced it failing to stick that way.</div></div><hr />
