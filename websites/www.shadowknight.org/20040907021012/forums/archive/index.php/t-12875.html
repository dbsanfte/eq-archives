<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bohemith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">K heres the setup-<br />
<br />
I'm MQing a full set of SK SS armor onto my new ogre SK (after I get faction, of course). Hes designed to be a secondary tank and perhaps maybe a maintank for my guild.<br />
<br />
I have a level 62 cleric and a 49 shaman, and I can 2 box one of those chars with my SK to power level him up. I'm going to equip him with good weps and stuff so thats not a problem.<br />
<br />
I just have a question with creation; I was thinking of dumping to sta considering hes going to be a tank moreso then a caster, and I figured his INT would be raised easily by the SS armor and other various items I could aquire.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions? Thanks<br />
<br />
Bohemith</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Makk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I feel Hps are the way to go especially if he is going to be MT,.... but make sure you max out all the skills as much as possible. You need to especially work on spell skills (with your ogre int it will be a arduous task I know I am a troll with no points into int).<br />
<br />
With the setup up you are saying you have, it would be really easy to tank all the way up to the high 50's.   That can leave your spell skills to slack a abit.  So a word to the wise, if you are going to be a MT especially max sure you just don't work on Alternation or you will be failing a ton on FD, where you really need the skills.  The rest of what you said made sense, good luck =)<br />
<br />
And about your int question, I wouldn't worry so much about it with all the FF items and C3 readily available.  Yes you will have a smaller pool, but it regens just like everyone elses,  Rarely do people die being oom, but everyone dies if they are ooh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bohemith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hmm thanks for the reply.<br />
<br />
I was thinking also that maybe I should put half to Sta and maybe half to AGI/Int.<br />
<br />
I think that if I dump to sta that I will quite easily max my sta with gear (although I haven't checked this), which will give me some wasted creation points.<br />
<br />
Any ideas on this?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
<br />
Bohemith</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Drynnious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sta is WAY easier to max. Put them all into int.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>SorishMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Wouldn't cultural be easier?<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'd say make a magelo up, put the gear on it that you're gonna buy / MQ, then see what stats you're lacking in.  (e.g. the Fulvous cultural has a ton of +STA on it, I think like 50 points).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bohemith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah cultural would be easier..<br />
<br />
But how many other sk's have full SS quest before level 10? :D <br />
<br />
I'll try the magelo idea, thanks!<br />
<br />
-Boh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>GoBuk Agogo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I would go Dex before Agi.  When I made my Ogre I maxed stamina and then left over points into Dex.  You got a shaman, you can compensate for any weakness and kei will never let you go OOM.  Sta and Dex is the way to go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bohemith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Why dex?<br />
<br />
Procs for keeping argo?<br />
<br />
What about AGI for AC?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Agoni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">My advice:  Put 5 pts into Agi then the rest into Sta.  Use the shaman to pl until 42nd level then I'd just group with the cleric.  Shaman pl's are great for keeping melee skills maxxed, max all your weapon skills as you go.  Also every ten levels starting at 20th go grab KEI, summon a pet, mem five spells with one of each spell skill, target pet and proceed to cast until your spell skills are maxxed for the current level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gorrum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">put at least 5 in agility...wish I had. :(  The rest stamina if hes going to be more of a tank but remember low int=more fizzles .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>GoBuk Agogo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Agi at high end doesn't help as much.  The AC from the armor is more than plenty.  Dex/Agi items will more than compensate at lower levels.  Str isn't an issue with Ogres.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Bohemith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Not too concerned with Str.<br />
<br />
So far for creation I'm thinking 5 to sta, 5 to int, 5 to dex, and 5 to agi..<br />
<br />
<br />
A nice mix of everything. <br />
<br />
But then again am I spreading my points out to much to make to much of a difference?<br />
<br />
Perhaps I should just go 10 to sta and 10 to INT because I can't make my damn mind up <br />
:rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Oh well, thanks for the input guys!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Makkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">You're going to be able to max out str/sta quite easily with decent shammy buffs. I find on my troll sk (similar stats to ogres, actually less str/sta) the only things really lagging behind are agility and int with lvl 57 shammy buffs (IOS and regular stat buffs). <br />
<br />
My thinking is you're going to want int as high as possible for a decent mana pool, for keeping aggro with spells and also FD pulling if you end up doing that. Agility == AC so it wouldn't hurt putting a few points in that. Both of those stats are quite low on the large races..<br />
<br />
If I was recreating my TSK, I'd put the bulk in int and split the rest in agility/dex. Dex is considerably higher than agility for me though..or was before I got the +10 ag hand slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Bohemith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Alite, so far I'm considering 10 to int and 5 to agi/dex...<br />
<br />
I figure with 132 base STA I don't really need to add more points to it. <br />
<br />
But lets say I did add 10 points to sta, that wont = an aditional 200hp or later on will it? (with the same gear)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hehe I agree there.  Just look at the difference between the sta and int on my magelo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Bohemith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Just out of curiousity, what exactly does DEX do for shadow knights?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Hatre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">My understanding is the higher your dex the more often you will proc a given proc, whether that be a weapon proc or a self buff proc, probably has other effects but I would guess the proccing is the important part for us SKs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>SorishMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Correct, DEX affects proc rates... the argument lies in how much it affects proc rates (or what the magical values of DEX are).  Mucho testing (and probably tons of threads in the forums here, or over at steelwarriors).<br />
<br />
Personally, I just aim for a DEX &gt; 100 and let the rest fall where it may.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Shylote Painbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Dump points into STA and STR unless this SK is going to be your main, and winning drop items.   You could in theory buy your way to decent str and sta levels, but you wouldn't end up with your HP where you want it to be.  So max those two out ahead of time, and buy/quest HP items.  If this is going to become your main, INT is still irrelevant, because its about your mana -regen- and not your mana pool.  By the time you're in a position to use your whole manapool in a fight, you will be better off not doing so.</div></div><hr />

I'm MQing full Blood Lords on him.. I've created him and am working on my CoV faction now. Someone told me that DEX is also supposed to play a role how often you connect with your hits. Anyone confirm/deny this?<br />
<br />
Just FYI on my SK creation I put 10 to sta and 10 to dex.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Mutton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Reroll and put it all into int...dex, agil etc mean shit and can be buffed easily to appropriate levels.  Three words, int, int and int<br />
<br />
As to dex, yeah dex does factor into proccing, but 10 dex does not really buy you a noticeable difference in proc rates...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Bohemith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Man you guys aren't answering my question.<br />
<br />
And hes already at indif CoV, theres no way I'm rerolling..<br />
<br />

Can anyone answer  that  question?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Jupke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I believe it was stated that your % hit/misses is fixed (well probably depending on level), only how hard you hit will change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Stwongbad Soulkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I wish I woulda put all/most of my points into int when I mad my toon.  Since I usually duoed with a shammy, the only thing he couldn't buff up was my int.  I'd say for anyone who happens to read this, 15int/5agi or dex is the way to go.  But that's just me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Mutton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">If you want to do it right, you will re roll, because 10 dex really does jack and shit for your character.</div></div><hr />

Yay, another SK twink. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
They are just starting stats, I'm not too concerned. My gear will easily make up for it.<br />
<br />
 Yay, another SK twink. <br />
<br />
Yeah, it says that in the thread subject. Thanks for reminding me.<br />
<br />
But really, why is it so 'bad' that I'm making an SK twink? Do you think I won't be able to play the class simply because I give him good gear from the start? Like I said in my first post, he's designed to be a mt/secondary tank for my guild, so I better know how to play the class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Lizarde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">In regards to your question- as I understand it, DEX will not affect your hit rate at all, that is based on other factors, particularly your weapon skill.<br />
<br />
DEX is said to help with increases in offensive skills.  I've heard that AGI helps with defense skill-ups, but that seems to be a less accepted notion.  The consensus seems to be that AGI is all but useless, just make sure it is at least 75 or you take a big AC hit at higher levels.<br />
<br />
DEX is said to help with procs as well.  Sure, 10 DEX won't make much difference, but every bit helps.  If you put some starting points into DEX, I see no reason to re-roll.  You're quite right that most stats are not hard to get into the 200-250 range with armor and buffs (and higher as you level up and get better gear).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Bohemith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Thanks Lizarde :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Carrais</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">well i would put all you could in sta then dump the rst in agi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Drynnious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I'm glad a warrior is here giving advice on what an SK should do with his starting stats. Priceless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Yeah because all warriors know nothing about other classes. As for the original topic, you will easily max str sta dex (agi if you have avatar+ up) while you won't even come close to maxing int even with alot of high end gear. +10 sta on an ogre is pretty much wasted, if you were really hard up i'd toss 5 into agi (believe ogre base is 70) and the rest into INT.<br />
<br />
But you didn't follow any of that advice line, so now for your second question. Dex influences skill gain with weapons, skill gain with some trade skills and influences critical hit / process frequency. That is it.</div></div><hr />
