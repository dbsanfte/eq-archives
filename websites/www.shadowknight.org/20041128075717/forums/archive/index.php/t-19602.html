This would be far too situational.  <br />
<br />
Our class is situational. Utility. I find a lot of undead in places nowadays. Far less of a useless spell than you might think. <br />
<br />
Don't necros get this spell ? If we got it, it would of course be watered down from the necro spell but is anyone enlightened on how theirs works (level wise)? We could get an estimate of how much our spell would be watered down from theirs just by comparing the other spells we get handed down from them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dkhar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Necromancers have undead charm all the way up to level 65, I would assume the 65 charm works on mobs up to level 60. They have a whole line though, why couldn't we follow it with a little bit of watering down, say 5 level lower mobs are affected by our spells.<br />

<br />
You're telling me at level 54 I would rather have my level 39 pet up which hits for 28 damage, rather than charm a level 40 undead which hits for 120 x2 ? I think you have your math wrong.  I would consider that an upgrade at the expense of twice as much mana. Not to mention the many options you have with a charm spell in the right circumstances.</div></div><hr />

Next on this channel: Why Rangers want charm.  <br />
<br />
Historic point of view ? If my memory is correct, which I am quite assured it is, there has never been a documented case of a real live (or dead) shadow knight. WHAT The FUCK are you talking about. If you are going to disagree with statements such as, it's  &quot;roleplay&quot; or &quot;historic&quot;, use a few sentences to explain what you mean. I can look at this from a roleplayers perspective and see it happening, whereas you might not. Roleplaying is all in the eye of the beholder.<br />
<br />
My perspective on this is... this. I think shadowknights should have all of their undead nukes taken away and given undead charm. Why ? Because we are one with the night, evil, and in truth a shadowknight is a deathknight (old school d&amp;d bro), which is undead. Why would we harm undead ? That's a concern for Paladins. We should embrace death and take control of it. We can already raise an undead servant, whom I have come to love :P We can enhance him and control him. Hell, we can turn ourselves into skeletons :P Might be an illusion but it's a start. <br />
<br />
There's a few sentences arguing for the right to charm undead in a roleplay perspective. Now you try. Or can you just throw Your Momma jokes and bash Rangers ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">So now that you've decided you can charm level 40 undead when you hit 58, why don't you tell me what zone you're going to kill in to get decent exp with that pet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I ding'ed lvl 60 there!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Drakkle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">From a RP standpoint, I would differ on this idea, because where would we get the magical abilities needed for a charm (Bah, I can remember that it would take immense amounts of concentration to even hold one)? But since SoE trashed almost all RPing (Does that even EXIST in this game at all?) I say this would be a great idea.<br />
<br />
As for us being undead, compliments Dkhar, I've read some of the EQ lore and it keeps repeating on the &quot;being born with their god's dark power bit.&quot; Perhaps I'm just tired? But always thought SKs just to be evil warriors granted powers from their god... But how the hell would someone that is undead be birthed O.o Meh, in any case, charming undead would be awesome, considering in almost all cases, an undead MOB hits waaaay harder than our pets.<br />
<br />
I guess all that would be needed is the ability to buff your newly found dead body (unless that would be too much overpowering? Unless it was limited, but then we would kind of start becoming a pet class...).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Ketamina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Actually, from an RP standpoint I think this would work very well. I like this undead charm idea and it works very well in my mind for shadownights. If pallies feel that this is unbalanced from their standpoint, they can shove it ... or get some ghey little angel as a pet (seriously).<br />
<br />
Being able to charm undead (to a certain point) would be extremely within guidelines and usefulness. We should not get charm to the degree that necromancers do, we're hybrids and must deal with that penalty ..just as we deal with having wussy pets. Limits are easily put up with, but the ability to charm undead with risks is definitely something I see as within the SK characters, including RP.</div></div><hr />

A death knight is the horrifying corruption of a paladin or lawful good warrior cursed by the gods to its terrible form as punishment for betraying the code of honor it held in life. <br />
A death knight resembles a hulking knight, typically taller than 6 feet and weighing more than 300 pounds. Its face is a blackened skull covered with shards of shriveled, rotting flesh. It has two tiny, glowing orange-red pinpoints for eyes. Its armor is scorched black as if it had been in a fire. The demeanor of a death knight is so terrifying that even kender have been known to become frightened. <br />
A death knight's deep, chilling voice seems to echo from the depths of a bottomless cavern. A death knight converses in the language it spoke in its former life, as well as up to six additional languages. <br />
<br />
Combat: A death knight retains the fighting skills it had in its former life. Since it has little regard for its own safety and an intense hatred of most living creatures, it is an extremely dangerous opponent. Still, a death knight retains a semblance of the pride it held as a good warrior and fights honorably: It never ambushes opponents from behind, nor does it attack before an opponent has an opportunity to ready his weapon. Surrender is unknown to a death knight, and it will parley only if it senses its opponent has crucial information (such as the fate of a former family member). <br />
A death knight has a strength of 18(00). It usually attacks with a sword; 80% of the time, this is a magical sword. When a magical sword is indicated, roll 1d6 and consult the following table: <br />
Roll  Death Knight's Sword  <br />
1  Long sword +2  <br />
2  Two-handed sword +3  <br />
3  Two-handed sword +4  <br />
4  Short sword of quickness  <br />
5  Short sword of dancing  <br />
6  Short sword of life stealing  <br />
<br />
A death knight wears the same armor it wore in its previous life, but regardless of the quality of the armor, it always has an AC of 0. Hit points for a death knight are determined by rolling 10-sided dice. <br />
A death knight's magical abilities make it especially dangerous. It constantly generates fear in a 5-foot radius, and it can cast detect magic, detect invisibility, and wall of ice at will. Twice per day, it can cast dispel magic. Once per day, it can use either power word, blind, power word, kill, or power word, stun. It can also cast symbol of fear or symbol of pain once per day, as well as a 20-dice fireball once per day. All of its magical spells function at the 20th level of ability. <br />
A death knight cannot be turned, but it can be dispelled by holy word spell. It has the power over undead of a 6th-level evil priest. Its magic resistance is 75%, and if an 11 or lower is rolled on the percentile roll, the spell is reflected back at the caster (the magic resistance is rerolled each time a spell is cast at a death knight). <br />
<br />
Habitat/Society: Death knights are former good warriors who were judged by the gods to be guilty of unforgivable crimes, such as murder or treason. (For instance, Krynn's Lord Soth, the most famous of all death knights, murdered his wife so that he could continue an affair with an elfmaid.) Death knights are cursed to remain in their former domains, usually castles or other strongholds. They are further condemned to remember their crime in song on any night when the moon is full; few sounds are as terrifying as a death knight's chilling melody echoing through the moonlit countryside. Death knights are likely to attack any creature that interrupts their songs or trespasses in their domains. <br />
<br />
Ecology: Death knights have no physiological functions. They are sometimes accompanied by skeleton warriors, liches, and other undead who serve as their aides.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then make suggestions. I am quite sure there are a lot of different things people want or think SK's need. I merely suggest a charm more for RP reasons than anything. SK's don't need a whole lot of anything really, I like my class. And why not a charm ? Check it out. I've been on LDoN adventures where I am not the tank (omg) and I'm not pulling (holy shit). In these cases I am DPS. Yay, frickin great. Well, why not pop off an undead charm on a caretaker or a protector and go to town with it ? That would totally own in my book. Hell, charm pet plus our melee and not having to tank or pull = the shit.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Makkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">DC is not is useful as you think. Very limited situational use; hoh xp grinding (however you cannot fd split with dc pet), veksar farming, some crap in PoV I think. Waste of 9aa. DC'd pets are also pretty buggy - you cannot summon them, they tend to warp away to zonein randomly, they don't go under water..<br />
<br />
SK get the 49 nec pet which is level 44 or thereabouts if I remember. How then should SK be able to charm mobs over level 50?<br />
<br />
IMO what SK should get and deserve is the nec level 53 rogue pet to increase their DPS. Bump it up to level 60. SK should also get suspend minion - if shammy get it for their ghey pets so should SK<br />
<br />
SK (and nec) are 2 previous pretty crap classes that are doing quite well now. Be happy with what you can do, which is a lot.<br />
<br />
I agree that su3 is a bit much but even nec don't get particularly powerful damage against undead, it's more utility line. Mez/lull(very low cap though:P)/charm, slow. Best nec undead nuke is less damage their 61 poison based nuke. I have no problem from a RP perspective of cleric and paladin doing the most damage to undead.</div></div><hr />

Why?  Because I am just that evul, you will bow down before me and serve.<br />

Charming a pet even equal to the level of our highest pets would at least double our pet DPS, which would seriously increase the DPS of the class. This would unbalance us in regards to the DPS classes.<br />
Simply having the ability to charm a mob would have the 'charming' class up in arms about it. <br />
And how useful could this possibly be? If we got it (which we never will), it shouldn't be an ability or spell we would get before level 65. And if it's a 'watered down' version of the necro charm, we couldn't charm anything over level 30-40 (roughly half, or slightly higher than half, the max level of the necro charm). Where would you use that? Nowhere that I XP, raid, or even farm has undead that is that low level. Even if it was, why would I charm a mob to run around with me when I can just slaughter everything the zone without having to worry about charm breaking?<br />
It's sad that hardly anyone cares about the role-play aspect of the game anymore, but this doesn't fit in with the Shadow Knight of Everquest. I could give two shits about what D&amp;D (or any other game) has in their equivalent class. SKs are tanks with some spells on the side. Some of those spells are class defining, of course, but no spell in the SKs arsenal should be as powerful as a charm.<br />
<br />
If we got anything in terms of pets (spell or otherwise) it should be a spell/ability that increases the level (something like the BST spells, just not as powerful), or get a series of pets for different uses. Like one skeleton pet that has a ton of hitpoints, but relatively low DPS (for pet pulling), one skeleton that has a backstab ability equal to its level (for increased DPS), and one skeleton that is an archer or caster (for increased ranged DPS). All of these pets would be the same level as our current pet, but we could choose which pet we wanted depending on what we wanted it for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Radahsam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I was about to reply with basically what Brael said.  Exactly what lvl 40-50 mob are you going to charm while figting lvl 60-75 mobs in LDoN, PoP, and GoD?  Useless!<br />
<br />
The only way an SK undead charm would be of value would be if we could charm mobs in zones that we actually fight in.  We don't need another power-leveling tool for running up SK alts.  Heck, you can fear-kite your way to 60 quite easily already.  And there is no way they are going to give us a charm that actually works with lvl 60-65 mobs.  There is already talk of nerfing charms in their current form anyway.  Why would they add yet another class that can charm a pet for rediculous DPS?</div></div><hr />
