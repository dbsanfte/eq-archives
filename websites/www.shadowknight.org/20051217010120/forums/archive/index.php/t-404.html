<br />
as a side note, what will we have as a name for our new home?  we had The Knight Watch, now what?  other business is the icon for our website.  at TKW we had that skull, what will we have here?  have people submit theirs and we vote on them?</div></div><hr />

<br />
This statement always bothers me.   EQ is part of your RL.<br />
<br />
For example, would you go see a movie or play EQ?  Both are part of your RL.  Both are entertainment.  But you never say RL &gt; seeing a movie.<br />
<br />
Obviously there are more important things than playing EQ but EQ ramains your RL.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">velourea</div><div class="date">04-04-2002, 12:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well, of course your playing &quot;EQ&quot; while in your &quot;RL&quot;, but when people say &quot;RL &gt; EQ&quot; and other statements to that effect, they are saying (to me) that the focus of their lives isnt playing EQ. life has so many experiences in it that you shouldnt let EQ, or anything else for that matter, take up all your time. thats not to say that EQ is bad, it is a great experience in and of itself, BUT life has just too much to offer (and obligations to be met) that EQ should not take away.</div></div><hr />
