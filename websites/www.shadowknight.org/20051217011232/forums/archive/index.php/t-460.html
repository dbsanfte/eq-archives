<br />
i hunt almost exclusively at the main ramp.  do the crusaders that spawn there not drop certain pieces?!  its getting annoying to wait 3 hours to finally see a single crusader pop, who drops two pieces of decayed i already have.  this is when i'm not being KS's by the ub3r 1337z0r dr00dz0r DF and RS farmers.<br />
<br />
anyone have any good spots to spawn crusaders at?  i've seen most of the ramp ones at the bottom of the ramp left side(as you are facing CT), however the SE temple also looks promising.<br />
<br />
ps: no, the ritualist is not there.  scratch that idea.</div></div><hr />

That way you can keep looting decayed. Doing the quest a couple times isn't a bad idea because you could either sell the extra darkforge or help other shadowknights MQ it. The run to the Temple isn't really that long. Just my 2cp<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rabdos</div><div class="date">04-05-2002, 01:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When it was inside CT, I got all my darkforge except for two pieces by level 36 (I'd started hanging out there at lvl 30). I didn't get the last two until I was lvl 38, almost 39. And the last piece (boots) I did multi-quest with another SK. I think I did 2 breastplates, and 2 helms before I finally got a full set. <br />
<br />
Up until recently I would stop by CT when I was passing through and whack the lizard ritualist. I got the pieces for another helm, BP, &amp; greaves (start of Innoruuk's Curse) from doing that on and off. Usually there was a low level SK or two in the zone, and if was a decayed piece I didn't need for that, I'd let them know what was available.</div></div><hr />

Expect this kind of reaction if you're a 50+ starting epic... :0<br />
<br />
Moving darkforge droping mobs outside of CT will bring alot of problems to verant, just like ragefire... :p</div></div><hr />

Leaving CT one night invis dropped and one attacked me, had a unique name and he droped decayed.  At the time didn't think much about it,  since I dont need them anymore, but I havent seen this same ape up since then.   Was not a formal name just one that was more descriptive.  Just a thought but probably a rare spawn like  the Crusaders and maybe he has the pieces your missing.</div></div><hr />

Got a load of decayed from ritualist farming before the change and nothin' to do with it until i get more.</div></div><hr />

I will be partnering with necro and hopefully a warrior.  We could use the money from the fine steel and I would like to get the darkforge armor.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
1) The bottom left or right single spawns<br />
2) The far left and far right upper double spawns<br />
3) The center pair of gorilla spawns.<br />
 <br />
That's five nice fights,each against 1-2 mobs apiece. Keep some anti-healing tricks handy,like stuns-many lizards can heal.<br />
 <br />
The gorillas have special spawns that I know drop ravenscale,and I just finished up a Darkforge BP conking a crusader from one of the pair-spawns. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Muggly</div><div class="date">04-06-2002, 05:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">bp, legs, and guantlets seem to be most common, i've let other people loot about 3 sets of the legs, 1 set of guants, and 2 sets of bps.  still don't have a visor, and have only seen one boot piece, and one vambrace piece.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bunk</div><div class="date">04-06-2002, 05:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you face as if you are walking down the ramp from Cazic Thule the small temple to the right of ramp has a crusader spawn on the groud lvl and the archon can spawn in the little building on top of the small temple.<br />
<br />
Once again facing as if exiting Cazic Thule and heading down the ramp,  the small temple in front of and to the left of the ramp has a crusader spot on the top lvl of the small temple as well as a Tae Ew guy.  Both these guys spawn on the top of the temple but not in the building.<br />
<br />
And once again facing out of Cazic Thule the small temple to the left of the ramp has a couple crusaders that can pop,, have seen them pop at several locations on this temple.  Also got the guy with the Cazic Gate potion to pop on this small temple.<br />
<br />
Spent 20 hours trying to get the decayed visor  no luck :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BrindalayShadowlace</div><div class="date">04-06-2002, 06:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh,  one little note.  I found out the hard way that pullin'  the two spawns by the tunnel ent to CT is a bad idea if there are healer lizzies out there.  The little buggers will heal through the wall.   :(   Just enough so that it's impossible to solo without killin' them first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jezael Dawnreaver</div><div class="date">04-06-2002, 07:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I quested all of my Darkforge before the change luckily, but hung around outside CT since the exp and loot is good for the level, plus its a good area to learn how to FD/split pull IMHO. One area that I didn't see mentioned for the Crusaders is the corner where the Silvered Guards/Radiant spawns. There are two other spawns in front of him that can be pulled separately and I have had a few Crusaders spawn there. I'm assuming spawn rate is the same as it would be as for the ramp to CT or the side temples. If you don't have a group/partner with you, you might want to head there. While I was waiting for the respawns, I'd go whack lower level lizards for plat/fine steel or Lifetap them to heal. You can also safely Fear Kite the two spawns in the corner as well if you want to practice that. Hope this helps some.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Muggly</div><div class="date">04-06-2002, 09:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">just got my decayed right boot.  just right vambrace and visor to go.<br />
<br />
<br />
oh and to lizzie sk's; don't talk about how much &quot;easier&quot; DF is than dreadscale.  i know an iksar sk, he is trying to get DF legs, bp, helm for epic, and commented on how much easier DREADSCALE was to get. =P<br />
<br />
i've been right outside of CT for 12 lvls trying to get all my decayed, still missing 2 out of 14 pieces.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rayzdin</div><div class="date">06-13-2002, 10:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Use your spell sense the dead.  If a crusader is up, it will target the crusader's pet.  Run to it and kill it.  I lived in CT from 28 to 34 and would run and quest pieces as I got them.  I probably quested 3 full sets in that time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eatbugs</div><div class="date">06-13-2002, 10:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hm...<br />
<br />
Maybe just coincidence, but visor is the one piece I haven't come across, and I've been killing lizards non-stop for a week and a half now.  I've made two sets of greaves, three breastplates, two sets of gauntlets, both bracers, two vambraces, two boots, watched probably 10 helms rot... and I still don't have the bleeding visor.<br />
<br />
Far as I can tell, if a Fanatic, Zealot or Justicar can spawn in a spot, a Crusader can.  That includes the spots at the very tops of the three lower level temples. (the ones that have mostly protectors, sentinels and warders) Spawn  seems to be completely random, I've gone 6 hours without a Crusader and had four spawn in an hour, even with groups clearing all temples in the area constantly.<br />
<br />
Now if a damn visor would drop I could get out of the Feerrott and come back as infrequently as possible...<br />

Might be because they often get killed quickly, but I've come by when no ones around and there's a Crusader up, and haven't seen them with pets then either.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ainya</div><div class="date">06-13-2002, 12:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yea, sense the dead worked great in the old CT but I noticed that outside the crusaders aren't popping their pets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pheargore</div><div class="date">06-13-2002, 12:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Exactly.. Back in the CT day (lol not too long ago) I'd zone in, cast Sense the Dead, if nothing came up (other than Avatar of Fear's Pet) I'd zone out.<br />
<br />
It is probably easier now though to just run the perimeter of the Lizard Island and see if the Crusaders or Ritualist are up.<br />
<br />
I did about two sets of Darkforge (as I got the pieces as well) and a couple MQ's for my SK buddy before I got the complete set.<br />
<br />
Still have the Legs and Helm in the Bank and DF BP on (yah yah I need an upgrade I know :) )<br />

- Peace</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frued</div><div class="date">06-13-2002, 01:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">While it may seem like a good idea to wait till you get all the pieces before completinh the DF Armor Quest I would suggest finishing what you have already acquired. The reasoning is because you have (possibly) hit the wall and now are waiting for certain drops. Very Frustrating but by getting what DF pieces you already have it will help renew your dark spirit and push you on to the final pieces. Needless to say you'll also be able to loot the decayed pieces again instead of letting them rot.<br />
<br />
 You must keep the ramp and both temples clear that are left and right of the ramp. Also kill the 4 spawns at the point of the island. Radiant usually spawns here.<br />
<br />
 Never have seen a Gorilla drop decayed. Named Gorillas drop Ravenscale (rogue) and Lizardscale. Crusaders no longer have pets but will HT.<br />
<br />
 I am still trying to get the Decayed Visor. Anything else I just /ooc or /tell if another SK is in the zone (regardless of level).<br />
<br />
 So go get what DF armor that you can. Then return to the Feerrott and renew your hatred for these lizardmen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sabazios</div><div class="date">06-13-2002, 01:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yea...getting DF now is real pain.<br />
i tried doing it to help some SK friends out and after 4+ hours i came up with the same decayed pieces over and over again.  usually i save them so i can MQ if later <br />
now the only time i'll look is if i'm going to CT and i see crusaders up...<br />
like others have said ramp into CT is the best place cause you can get named gorillas makeing it somewhat fun...but not really</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jackkal Darknite</div><div class="date">06-13-2002, 06:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got everything I needed in the old CT but stuck around and hunted outside just because.<br />
<br />
Crusaders no longer summon their pets and I have never seen the Ritualist.<br />
<br />
I've heard that he spawns at the so-called &quot;north point&quot; where the Radiant spawns. I have seen the Silvered, a few crusaders, fanantics and a few others I forget their name but never did I see the Ritualist.<br />
<br />
I hunted there solid for 3 weeks 5+ hours on weekdays and like all weekend and nothing. I was working on some of my other weapon skills and I also wanted to confirm that the Ritualist is still in hte game. I never saw him. Just glad I got my Grimy Lance in the old CT. Feel sorry for the SK's that want to quest it now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BrindalayShadowlace</div><div class="date">06-13-2002, 06:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe,  i gave up on getting a set since i end up selling it all since i'm past that point in the epic.  I camped 'em for 15 hours once and only saw maybe 5 crusaders so they're definitly rare now.<br />
Best thing i've done if you have the patience for it is every time i want to port to the moon and i'm in EC,  i run the whole way from WC-Fee-SK to check for 'em up.  ( yep i get that bored. )</div></div><hr />

I miss CT.<br />

Long time till I see it now.</div></div><hr />

Still no visor, though. (sigh)<br />
