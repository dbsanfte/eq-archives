I've had ICQ for about 7 years now, and my number is much higher than yours. ( 54064087 ) ICQ was an IM/meet people program. I never met anyone through ICQ though, I flipped that option off. And it has become extremely annoying in the last few years. <br />
The 99 cent stores around here make that same ICQ Uh-Oh noise when they check stuff out, and it makes me laugh every time.</div></div><hr />

I know I have been using ICQ for a long time but it must be longer then I thought since you guys with 7+ years on it have a much higher number.<br />
<br />
Well that and I was using it before it became annoying and that HAD to be a long time ago.<br />

So, if a guy wants to pick up a chick like Chayde he has to hang around the $0.99 store?  <br />
That's cool since alot of their employees probably post here already.</div></div><hr />
