<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Draxious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The title names the problem.  Since the recent patch, I have had a terrible time getting over the wall.  Turning off &quot;autoduck&quot; helped.  Running back and forth while trying to go up, and only running intermittently so that the game anti-collision programming doesn't lock me down helped some.  <br />
<br />
Shrinking didn't help.  It still takes forever to get over that wall<br />
<br />
Any tips?  (and yes, I did a /bugreport to SoE)<br />
<br />
Drax</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I always use my horse and just float over the wall, unfortunatley I can only seem to do that on Brael my other characters it doesn't seem to work that well with and it's absolute hell when running 2 or 3 accts on the same computer.  Strafe when you run up it, it helps a bit thats how I've managed to get my other characters up, no shrink necessary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Draxious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks Brael.  I ought to get a horse.  I'm sort of getting the touch after about 5 trips across.  <br />
<br />
Drax</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Radahsam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">When you can clear both roofs and come down on the other side of the castle without having to go THROUGH it, then you are a master horseman.  There should be an AA for that or some corresponding reward.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Draxious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I got a horse.  Now working on getting over both walls at once.<br />
The recent patches have helped keep from getting stuck in the wall while climbing.<br />
<br />
<br />
Drax</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">They &quot;fixed&quot; this problem on Test a few weeks ago and now it looks like it made its way to the live servers. <br />
<br />
Apparently after nearly 2 years of people floating down to the deck of the outer wall it has been deemed &quot;broken&quot; and an exploit. <br />
<br />
The way to get over now is to clear the roof line. This can be done but you have to get very high.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Run up the side of the mountain, across the lava from the castle, slowly you will get higher and higher.  When you stop going up, run over the top of both walls.  SoW is fast enough to make it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The &quot;fix&quot; was retracted awhile back. You can now get over the wall in PoFire as you have always done. I am not sure its been reversed on Live but the invisible wall was removed on Test.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Powerslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">There is a good trick you can do to get over the wall. go into the the behind your character view with your horse and lev on. Then run up the side of the mountian and when you cant go up anymore head for the wall, you will go right over the top into the courtyard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shurlock</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Why the hell did you bump this thread?             Not the brightest bulb on the tree, are ya?<br />
<br />
Come to think of it, I'm not either.          I just noticed your stupid post was dated 4 days ago, so I should have just let it die a slow death until some other numbnutz revives it again in 5 months.</div></div><hr />
