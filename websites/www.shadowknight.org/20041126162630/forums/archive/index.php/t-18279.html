<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Paynreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I want to be non-KoS to Ring of Scale. (Just 'cuz, allright?) Anyway, has anyone done this before? I was considering a slaughter in Mistmoore untill it was raised enough, but i would bet theres a ebtter way. I heard that the Kaladim dwarf king only takes like 4 kills to max it out, but i have no idea if that is true.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Stugein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Mass slaughter in Mistmoore is probably your best and safest bet.  Damn near everything there bumps up RoS faction.  If I remember correctly the Ice Giants in Perma also give +RoS hits and you can get a decent increase if you are involved with killing Vox herself.<br />
<br />
As for King Kazon Stormhammer, yes he does give a big +RoS hit.  You can probably get max ally with RoS in less than a dozen kills of this guy.  Just gotta be careful though.  If enough guards add it can be a pain in the ass fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Paynreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">How many kills in MM from KoS to dub?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>yuggoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The sad thing about killing in MM is that bards like you better...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sithanator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Advoid hunting in skyfire, advoid killing living kunark dragon(pretty sure no hit on trak), Don't kill Espora Of The Ring in WW and don't even think about zoning into Veeshen Peaks(HUGE neg hit on those dragons). <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Talonmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I went 30-40 in Mistmoore and left max ally to Ring of Scale.  Other than not having Gore chase me around the DL from 40-50 I saw no real benefit.  I was probably max ally by 33-35.<br />
<br />
Most of hte mobs in Skyfire and other RoS friendly zones (BW, etc) are on minions of scale faction, will aggro you and cause you to take ROS hit.  <br />
<br />
Never made it into VP while non-kos (decided the faction wasnt worth keeping vs dragon killing) but I have yet to hear of any reason one would want to keep it up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Paynreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My reason is that i want to go to Veeshan's Peak, but nobody else does. Therefore, when i get a goddamn trak's tooth i want to be able to safely explore VP. If maxing RoS is the only way, then so be it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sithanator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Even with ally to ring of the scale I won't consider myself safe there. Best bet is con a guardian wurm in skyfire, see what that think of ya, if KOS your probably kos inside. As far as exploring VP rancors and Wurms don't see invis, Drake so. You will need someone who can pick lock in order to get to the exit, or at least a good amount of the dragons are blocked by locked doors.  So make sure you have a gate item.<br />
<br />
Now if you are hoping to go into VP, my first question is, what part of the game is your guild at? If you are still at hall of testing phase or lower but can kill Trak. There is alot of REALLY good loot in VP. Robe of Azure Sky is the best robe your caster will see until they start farming vulak/emp/AHR. Helm of Rile and Shroud of Veeshen are also both VERY good drops. Ignore melee weapon drops excluding the right clicky sow sword. The caster loot is VERY good in this zone. Also my guild uses this zone to farm spells for the guild bank, which is commonly turned around and spent on some of the higher priced spells out there for are casters. Also this is noticeable better exp then PoV(Idiot free exping is great). <br />
<br />
There is alot a guild can gain from farming VP. Its a great piece of game content that is often over looked or ignored.<br />
<br />
Warnings <br />
Some of those dragon have MEAN aoe's.<br />
Dragons here like to gate,  having chanters,bards to seive and or manaburning wizzy or max out HT SK's, is a good idea.<br />
Repop time is something like 6 minute now on trash mobs, so you have to keep moving.<br />
CR here require one of 2 thing, corpse summoning or an SoS rogue who will hate all after your first wipe past silverwing.<br />

Oh yeah there are some rare spawn named non dragon with some decent dropable loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Paynreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">We're moving in on Vex Thal now. Thats why nobody wants to go - its behind us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sithanator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Then point out to people that it's REALLY good exp and phat loot. Tonight in a 2 hour exp session there my group got these spells to drop Torpor(2copys), sunstike, avatar, wizzy sword pet, EoT, Malo and many other high level kunark spells that don't sell for nearly as much, not to mention a decent amount of gem and vendor loot. Torpor still runs 30k+ on my server. There are very few places in game where you can make that level of loot and get good exp.  After getting unluck on rolls, i'll probably walk away around 5-7k after selling off the spells I got. appel to people greed when it comes to getting them to come into this zone with you, other will follow and as they see the zone they will fall in love with it and want raid it just to see the whole zone. <br />
<br />
Item drops from VP are mostly behind my guild, yet due to people exping in VP we still have who are working on the key. Also every now and then will try to get 2 or 3 groups of people together  with keys during non raid time and go have fun killing dragons.<br />
<br />
there are sites in VP that are truly unbelieveable. The room pictures of Veeshen scaring norrath, IMHO is the coolest room in game.   <br />
