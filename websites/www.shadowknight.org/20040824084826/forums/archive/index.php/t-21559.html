<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Drynnious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ok so I have this little bar thats on my computer. It shows up even if there arent any internet explorer programs running (or any programs in general).<br />
I'll attach what it looks like.<br />
I ran CWshredder, my bro thought it might have been one of those programs. Spybot didnt catch it, and cwshredder didn't either. anyone know how to get rid of it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Oberyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">...Ad-aware 6.0 picks up a lot of stuff that spybot misses.  May want to give it a try.<br />
<br />
Also, try www.trendmicro.com Housecall Virus detection (free, web based).  It has actually picked up the odd thing Ad-aware and Spybot missed, including trojans hidden in my system restore files.<br />
<br />
They should execute all spyware and virus developers they can catch.<br />
<br />
Worth a try anyway *shrug*<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Eludicous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hopefully the spyware you have on it doesnt knock out the trendmicro free online scan on you.  Good luck getting if off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Loneshadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You could try downloading HijackThis, it lists all current running programms etc even ones that dont normally show. With this you can remove any running program but be very carefull, theres no safeguard to stop you from deleting essential stuff so you might wanna be sure what exactly is what thats on the list when you run it...<br />
<br />
tho it helped me get rid of some very agressive spyware that spybot and ad-aware alone could not get rid off...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Drynnious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well, the thing is gone now, maybe i did get rid of it.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I'm looking for a free cd burning program. On this comp i'm just running winXP and it uses winMP to burn things, but it always fails to burn a cd. Anyone know where I can dl one?</div></div><hr />
