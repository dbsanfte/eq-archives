<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So I finally decided to start working on my greenmist (we seem to be spelunking in Ssra more, so I figured &quot;why not&quot;).<br />
<br />
I went on down to Warsilk Woods into the tunnel with all the Iskar Outcasts (near LOIO zone) and killed about 150 before I got bored. (Have to do these things a little at a time before you get pissed off :) )<br />
<br />
Checked my faction and am still at KOS. Approx how many will I need to kill to get to at least dubious?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">go afk in the camp of 3 in warsliks woods right before the OT zoneline on the left (if your coming from OT).  Summon a pet and stand in the middle of the camp so everything will aggro you...<br />
let your pet kill shit for hours while you sleep.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>neodraykl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What you need to do is get a Ornate Velium Pendant, which drops in Icewall Keep, I believe.  I killed about 300 bandits and was still scowls to Zimor, but with a click of the Alliance Effect on the pendant, plus an iksar illusion potion, my faction was brought high enough to do all my turn ins, even as a Rallos Zek Ogre. Note however that this will only affect the necro faction, you still need to do the explorer knives or bone chips for SK faction. Cheers!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">wow, I never knew that. Looks like a visit to icewell may be in store for tonight. :) <br />
<br />
Plus, I am a Rallos Zek Ogre too!</div></div><hr />

She killed 115 Iksar Bandits in Warsilks Woods, LOC #9 and LOC #11 on EQAtlas Map ... <br />
<br />
115 kills made her Dubious to Brood of Kotiz.<br />
<br />
She told me the Iksar are on about a 10 min timer at those camp, and she was able to kill roughly 9 - 10 per each spawn.<br />
<br />
I am taking my DE worshipping Inny to that same camp to check it now.<br />
<br />
If I can just get myself non-KOS status with the Necros I would be very happy.  I already have my Greenmist, but I would still like to walk into the Cabilis SK guild Hall and not have Librarian Zimor get all excited.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nazgaull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well...<br />
<br />
I do not believe it.<br />
<br />
But I killed maybe 60 - 70 Iksar tonight in WW.. at the camps I noted in my above post, plus I went and cleaned the lake further up the river.<br />
<br />
Those kills, plus maybe another 75 - 100 that I have killed over the last 6 months or so... <br />
<br />
And I am Dubious to Brood of Kotiz.<br />
<br />
Dark Elf, worshipping Innoruuk... <br />
<br />
Killed maybe a total of 150 - 200 Iksar over the last year, now Dubious to the Cabilis Necros.<br />
<br />
Wow.</div></div><hr />

This is True. I did the same thing. They live in the Cave network leading from WW to LOIO.  and I think there are actually around 12 u can kill in there. You only need to be Dubious to the Necros, Warmly to Crusaders to begin quest.<br />
<br />
I only handed in about 100-200 bonechips. 11 stacks of Explorer Knives and killed about 100 odd Iksar in those tunnels to allow me to begin quest.</div></div><hr />
