<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yisaar</div><div class="date">04-30-2002, 11:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Too many players take the 'exp. highway' from 1-50 (Newbie -&gt; NRo -&gt; Oasis -&gt; LoIO -&gt; OT -&gt; DL -&gt; Karnors -&gt; Velks -&gt; Sebilis) are rarely have 2 coppers to rub together.<br />
<br />
I am hoping to gather together the wisdom of the SK community to share those sweet spots to level quickly, earn money and/or 'phat lewts' at the same time in this thread ....<br />
<br />
I'll start by adding a few of my favorite cash/exp. 'secrets' to this thread...<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
L12-17 Erud's Crossing (Wisp Isle).  Bring a magic weapon and head along shore to the left between the dock and the shipreck, hunt those Wisps and take the greater lightstones to the Gypsy's in NK(good) or SRo(evil) for amazing cash and even faction.<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
L12-17 Lesser Feydark. 2 camps of bandits dropping bronze weapons with a nearby woodelf Inn to sell at.<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
L15-19 West Karana (good alignments). Near the second guard tower is a farmhouse hiding some bandits, the nearby hill houses 3 more 'camps' of bandits.  Collecting the sashes (to hand in at S.Qeynos) and bronze weapons will yield good coin, exp. and faction.  Evil alignment players will not be able to turn in the sashes to the Temple of Thunder in S.Q.<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
L33-48 Crystal Caverns. The Geonids (10 or so) here are on a 14 minute timer, drop chipped gems (worth major pp) in a very safe hunting location. Fast exp. and 1000s of plat for levelling here.  Note: Int. casters... the faction you lose will hurt your chances of doing the Pheno Crystal quest.<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------</div></div><hr />

22 - 28 (or so) Netherbian Lair. Partner up or go there and group to slay Fungoids and the Drones... they drop upwards of 5pp a wack.<br />
************************<br />
40 - 45 (or so) T. Mnts. Go on a Grimling slaying rampage... they drop nice gems. Again, duo or group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Putrid</div><div class="date">05-03-2002, 12:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am a non-twink 25 level SK and the best exp and loot I found for 20 to 23rd level is the Squire room in upper guk.  8 blues in room or nearby, in nice convenient small groups on a 15 minute timer and an occasional runed bone fork that sells from 700 to 800pp.  Good loot and experience at that level.  The fork is lore so I used an alt to auction in tunnel during downtime.  My friend and I picked up 4 forks by the time we hit 24th level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brazzo</div><div class="date">05-06-2002, 08:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i think one of those camps of bandits in LFay is now dark elves, and larger sized than the bandits were.  i think the fine steel/ore drops in Sol A are really nice if you have a good-aligned person there to sell them.</div></div><hr />

As long as you don't mind slaughtering druid faction.  ;-)  As if you care. Bwhahaha  :-)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kalendrox Grimblade</div><div class="date">05-19-2002, 09:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well Garb, I really couldnt puzzle out a single word in that post.  However, I have my own advice to add:<br />
<br />
1-4  Usually your local newbie zone is the best, however, if you wish to start gathering coin at an early age, I suggest the Paineel Newbie area.  Hunt the decaying skeletons.  Skeletons are on a near instant respawn timer, so there are always plenty around.  They drop the common rusty weapons (couple gold) and cracked staves (1p), along with those valuble bone chips.  You can eaither start saving the bonechips for your Cabilis faction, or you can sell them to those who are doing their faction.<br />
<br />
4-10  If you do your 1-4 leveling in Paineel, consider moving to the Warrens for the next few levels.  This will gain you valueble Paineel faction (if you dont already have it) which will allow you to later purchase a key to the Hole.  It will also give you a city zone connected directly to a level 50+ dungeon with a 20% exp bonus should you choose to fight here at later levels.  In the Hole, collect the Kobold Molars.  These can be turned in to a High Guard in the Overlords Palace for additional faction and a random piece of ringmail armor.<br />
<br />
10-20  Tough call on this one, however, I would advise doing Gnolls in Blackburrow.  It will gain you valuble Qeynos Guard faction along with Qeynos Merchants, Rangers, and others.  The only faction you lose is with the Gnolls themselves.<br />
<br />
20-30  Paudal Caverns.  Now considered to be the fastest exp out there for this level range.  I find it humorous how everyone complains about grinding exp soooo slowly in LOIO, yet they continue to go there.  I took an alt from 27 to 29 in little more than an hour with a full group at the bandit camp, and walked away with over 500p.<br />
<br />
30-40  This is where everything starts to break up.  OT is still nice, but finding a group can be a pain and exp can be very slow.  I suggest Marus Seru, where you will net a blue or more per solo greyhopper kill.<br />
<br />
40-50  DL is still your best bet.  You'll find a group without much trouble (unless youre a paladin) and youll get to 50 in due time.<br />
<br />
50+  Gotta go with the Hole.  Youve got a full service city one zone over, 20% exp bonus, and little traffic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Razaduuul</div><div class="date">05-22-2002, 03:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">that sounded a lot like a guide to getting faction in every city, not that I as an iksar should complain... and it's always good to know alternate spots to hunt, but marus seru.... nothign drops cash, I never got 1 blue from greyhoppers solo, and I hunted this spot under 30 with my ranger, took about 3 greyhoppers (although this was soloable all at once with a ranger, not fear kiting)<br />
<br />
30 ish, if you don't care about faction with sanctus seru then the legionnaires in netherbian lair are still a good spot dropping about 3pp on most kills, the haven guards give faction hits with SH, which is useful for getting to other zones.<br />
<br />
At lower lvls (about 15-25) I hunted in Unrest, it has an xp bonus as a dungeon which is nice, and once you can hunt inside the house, around lvl 18, teh mummies drop gems that sell for up to 6pp, and some bronze weapons, second floor around mid 20s mobs start dropping pp, and FS weapons. in the yard loot the fungus things and such they are stackable and sell for 1gp for zombieskins (I think) 3 gp for grave mold, and about 6 gp for the mushroom thingies. doesn't sound like a lot but in can add up, the problem is I don't know of any good spots to sell here, you can bind in gfay if you cna get a caster, but the closest sell spot in probably the bazaar. though that's probably dependant on race, gnomes could just run down to steamfont I guess.<br />
<br />
By far the best newb money is wisps I think, milk it for what you can as a newb you can get 500pp probably going until they are all lightblue to green, however you need a magic weapon, so do whatever until around 12, and if you have enough for a magic weapon or get one from a quest or something start these guys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Squigle D'Muerte</div><div class="date">06-04-2002, 04:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">DL is fine till 47.  At 48 you can't get experience in a group unless you spend way too much time there.  You can however solo Ravenous Beasts and the occasional Dolrag by pulling them to the Middle of the East edge of the KC building.  No wanderers here so you can kite to your hearts content and you can actually seen the exp bubble move with each kill.  Just kite to edge of paved area.  If they start to run off it pull them back to middle again or you can get buried in adds.<br />
<br />
If you can get a breeze or partner you can mow them down very fast with little damage.  I partnered with another SK a couple times and we could kill quite a few before we had to med.<br />
<br />
48-50 is a hard time to be a melee you usually will be passed over in the best experience areas for someone of slightly higher level.  The difference between 49 and 52 is huge and people know it.<br />
<br />
Plague bone theives are great, if you can ever get camp.  You could make a career out of trying to get in there.:(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">yuggoth</div><div class="date">06-04-2002, 05:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't kite to the East side of KC - do the south side.  They path straight down the wall...  At 48 bloodgill goblins in LOIO should be doable as well - the 4 single spawns on the west side should be ok.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cerena Gloomheart</div><div class="date">06-19-2002, 01:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In the Low to Mid 30's I would like to suggest Sol A.  If you pull from the &quot;safe room&quot;  (Which is the first zone to SolB), or get a friend or two and take the Foreman's room, you'll have it made.<br />
<br />
The goblins drop FS weapons, chunks of ore, herbs, and drops up to about 5P or so.  It's nice money, plus, you benefit from the XP bonus from dungeons too ^_^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mystina</div><div class="date">06-20-2002, 08:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">From lvl 23 to lvl 26 or so, one can kill a lil named nome in L Fay called &quot;Saben Tucross&quot;.<br />
She spawns in a house in front of Steamfont zone, can be targeted through wall with /target saben command.<br />
<br />
She gives good exp and spawns every 6 minutes, also drops some fine steal weapons, wich are good cash for untwinked lvl 20-30 mains.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And OoT is the emptiest zone I've ever been in.  You feel like an adventurer.</div></div><hr />

Running around the desert every once in a while got me 50-100pp per session. From level 15 I could take a derv camp by myself, which is also nice loot.<br />
<br />
20-30 Unrest. great xp bonus, and pretty nice loot here.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm currently 29, and will probably hit 30 tonight (Yay FD!).  Right now I solo the Skulking brutes in Warslik Woods, in the caves that lead to Dalnir.  These are GREAT exp, static spawns small aggro radius, and 5 of 'em on a 15 minute timer.  Once i hit 30 though, they go light blue I believe, and I'm wondering if I can just head to Crystal Caverns and solo the entrance mobs for a while.<br />
<br />
Thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cerena Gloomheart</div><div class="date">06-26-2002, 04:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's a very fast one, no money, but VERY fast XP:<br />
<br />
10(9 if you're well equipped)-13:  Shadeweaver end of Paludal caverns (ask someone for an invis, the way is basically all right turns).  Hunt diggers and mushrooms, and if you need anything, Shar Vahl is only a zone away.<br />
Maybe around lvl 14 or so, you can try the Hollowshade end of Paludal.  Watch out, the Diggers are social!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rhade Kilsbugsded</div><div class="date">06-28-2002, 01:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My first SK did Crazed Ghouls in Unrest... God... Its been soooo long... Anyhoo, you can duo em at around 24, and pulling em to zone and fearing is pretty viable at around 27. Insane exp and if i remember correctly they drop 3-5pp per kill... maybe FS weapons too.<br />
<br />
Get a paladin. Seriously.  I'm willing to bet a sk/paladin duo could hold that camp at 20. Paladin VS Undead is INSANE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vadeer</div><div class="date">07-01-2002, 01:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can't speak to hunting in CC (although I'm interested in the response) I can speak to the Brutes outside Dalnir: they are blue all the way to 32 (although that's only 1-3 of the 5.) As there are still cyan and drop nice tho varying (11c - 6p + gems/words), they are ok until that level at least for xping and skilling (albeit slow.)<br />
<br />
I've wondered about the Yeti caves in DL next, altho I think they were red to 31. I'll need to check back and see if they are an option. Not sure of the drops tho.<br />
<br />
Oddly enuf, I happened over to Sol A for some Imp Blood for the new fiery weapons you can smith, and one of the green shaman dropped the very same silver amulet that dropped off the higher level brutes. Hmmm... maybe farming Sol A isn't such a bad idea after all... hehehhe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lizarde</div><div class="date">07-06-2002, 09:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Soloed my Iksar SK from 26 to 29 in Swamp of No Hope.  At the bandit camp near the zone to Field of Bone.  The bandits themselves are green by level 26, and didn't aggro whenever I was in range.<br />
<br />
The camp itself is practically surrounded by mobs that were dark blue right through level 29.  Many were even at 26.  Some of them hit pretty hard but are manageable as long as you avoid adds.  That is actually pretty easy as there are numerous spots you can pull to that are pretty safe.<br />
<br />
Exp was very good, I got to 29 in a matter of a few hours spread over three days of play.  Loot was very good, I'd guess that every third or fourth mob dropped 1-3pp.  Other drops included jades and ivory and other gems, they sold for between 1 and 6pp with my SK's crappy CHA (around 50 or 60).  Best haul was around 50pp in coin and loot after one particular two hour stretch.<br />
<br />
Only downtime is to med/rest, there was never a shortage of mobs.  The guards are not very far away in case you get in over your head and decide you want to bail.  The zone was empty about 75% of the time that I was there.  The rest of the time there was one other PC (usually a low level char hunting in the newbie area), or a couple of higher level characters on their way to Trakanon's Teeth.  Otherwise, no one there, even though there's a very good newbie area just past the guards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zeffner</div><div class="date">07-15-2002, 04:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">how could u all   forget my most fravorite zone inthe game...<br />
mm   u r good there  from 25 on.<br />
  tons of fine steal, junk armour, gargoye eyes , pages, runes  i say 25  on cause i still get xp in there at 55 and occassionally have still been killed there .<br />
<br />
also  theres always the famous kerra island for u lower ppl  u can  make whole level plan right there in tox,  warrens, kerra , the mountians on other side warrens, the hole  everything u need to get to  50 plus in 8 zones as well as never being more than 3 zones away from a merchant  and your bind spot</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Badnoose</div><div class="date">07-17-2002, 03:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do Not Be Conventional.  Avoid LoIO and OT.  Reasons below.<br />
<br />
From 15 to 24, there is NO faster exp in EQ than Paludal Caverns, right by Shadowhaven.<br />
<br />
20-26, Netherbian Lair is ok. I got my BP from there.<br />
<br />
25-32, Marus Saru - Tremendous exp, no loot.<br />
<br />
33-42, WC guards, good exp, +NFP (bank) faction, -WFP, -EFP factions.<br />
<br />
33-44, WC druids, you'll need a friend at the lower levels. The best loot/danger ratio you'll see until 50.  My SK banked 1800pp there while leveling in not much time recently.  In the 30m waiting for the cleric to log on, my SK alt can make 100pp. Maybe more.<br />
<br />
35-41, Crystal Caverns. Pharm the velium. It sells to smiths for a lot.  Make SURE your invis and FD skills are maxed before you go here. There is a neutral banker at the bottom in Frostone. Dump all the loot here, and sell it when you return the Thurgadin.<br />
<br />
35-?, The Goblins outside of Droga.  I like the exp I am seeing there.  Goblins only assist like types.  At 39+ the adventurous can move into Droga.<br />
<br />
Why you should not hunt in LoIO or OT.  Sarnaks, is why.  They are on a faction called &quot;Brood of DiZok&quot;.  If you don't damage this faction, you can kill Droga-area goblins and improve this faction in short order.   Once you're warmly in Chardok, you can do some quests there that yield superb rewards.  In addition, you can drag failed raids out of Chardok for plat.  You can scout for your guild.  Coffins are 70pp each.  You should be able to drag for 50pp :-)  So 900pp for a 18-corpse raid would be reasonable.  Muahaha.</div></div><hr />
