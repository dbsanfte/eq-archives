5) In game I can tell whether an SK reads these boards or not.  Every single one that doesn't sucks.  You'll get alot of info here.  It will be very helpful if you learn to sift.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would prolly still be an asshat that couldnt hold aggro if it wasnt for the tips on these boards.  At the same time you'll get used to the boards, heck sometimes it's fun to get yourself flamed at....as much as it is flaming others sometimes...so just take it like an SK damnit!<br />
<br />
Anyways....I'm bleeding like a stuck pig, so I gotta work on stopping the bleeding atm...nice bike crash...dont ask..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dude, don't show you have a weak side!<br />
That was a funny rant though!<br />
And you haven't been shafted yet. People are still responding to you. Now because they know it's upseting for you, but still...<br />
<br />
And listen to Keevel, I know what SKs read the boards and which don't, just by being in a group with them. (And don't feel too bad, This SK is my alt, and no, I don't remember saying &quot;Hi, I'm new here&quot; and Yes, I have asked for help on my armor (Because I really suck at getting dressed)<br />
<br />
At any rate, don't take everything so personal. You won't have much fun around here if you do. Must be able to laugh, remember that.</div></div><hr />

I'll be more than happy to shaft you, faggot.  I'll stick my sweaty shaft so far up your rectum you're mom will taste my splooge when she makes out with you later.  You're ass will bleed for weeks, and you won't be able to get the stanky slime out of your colon for days.  I'll shaft you till your anus collapses on itself.  I'll shaft you till you love me, you filthy faggot whore-boy. It might even be incest, since I get the feeling that I might be your daddy; just check the side of your momma's ass for the imprint of my hand.   How you like the feel of that slime?<br />

Why do people spell GAY like &quot;ghay&quot;? Do they think they are offending anyone because they typed the word gay out on the internet? Jesus fucking Christ.<br />

Shame though, i would have expected better from the reach-around gangs team mascot. Though as a one liner its not bad, it lacked the great context id expect.

I was hardly going to try hard for a man who, if this board told him, would suck shit out of public restroom toilets and then come back smiling brown toothed, then when you told the ass-clown the jokes on him would bob his head up and down telling you he outsmarted you and itwas all his 'master ploy' to just look like he did that.</div></div><hr />

I like this guy, his willpower spent, he broke his 'vow of silence' to spew forth vulgarities with no context to who or why he is flaming. Nope couldnt use that energy to say help a knight with a gear check or anything productive. I hope this was directed at Nezzka and not myself, he is much more tolerant of pathetic assanine flames using 8+ year old stale abortion material. Id be insulted.<br />
