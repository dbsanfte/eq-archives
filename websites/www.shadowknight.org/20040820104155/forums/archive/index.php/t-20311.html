<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Pretecf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My guild sent 5 folks of 60 plus level and they toasted him real fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nikumu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I solo'd him with a friend's 65 paladin.  A full group of 50s should be able to take him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gargar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've killed this guy maybe 5 times..   He's pretty easy, but definately not solable in my mid 50's. <br />
<br />
Full group should be cake...    I beat him down once with a 51 sk, a 55 sk(me), and a 55 cleric.  Close fight with one death.<br />
<br />
It's doable, but overkill is better as it SUCKS to lose 3k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jagdwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">First, he summons dont for get this.  Second cant be feared.  Third, me (58 lizi caster sk, &quot;tankings a hobby&quot;) and a druid (59) spend 2 min ping ponging the zombie back and forth.  <br />
<br />
Oh and the spell is worth it.  Especially when you have a ring with Improved dmg IV and AA that improves life tap crits.<br />
<br />
<br />
Its a wonderful feeling to see this scroll across your screen.<br />
<br />
You have performed a critical heal for 741 pts of damage<br />
You have been healed for 741 pts<br />
Your target takes 741 of non combat damage.<br />
<br />
And they say SK's cant cast spells. Who needs a cleric?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Yaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I did this quest when I was level 50.  Took a group of mid 50-ish folks along with a couple sitting outside of the group.  Just random folks that were in the zone at the time that came to help out.  My druid friend ate the HT, he was sitting right on the spawn point.  But hey, that's what druids are good for right?  Took the zombie down comfortably.  Wasn't a really scary battle except that my friend bit it was all.  I bought the White Gold Necklace in bazaar to do the quest since it's droppable.  No prickly pear and crystalline orb were available so had to make a couple special trips.  Taking a 50 SK, 50 Cleric, and 54 Druid into Permafrost for a prickly pear off raid mobs was worse than that zombie battle in RM at the time.  Our DPS really sucked.  I think I had an Argent Defender, ROFL,  remember those things?  Now everyone has a War Marshall Bladed Staff.  But anyway, the quest has a nice reward I used it for a long time as a back-up lifetap since it was a faster cast than the necro class lifetaps you received up to 60.  When the PoP lifetaps came out I was so relieved that they gave us faster lifetaps.  I still keep Life Leech in my book though.  I bust it out on those South wing BoT giants from time to time since they resist disease nukes and such.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ravnos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I did the zombie fight at 51 with a 57 shammy slower/healer.  The initial HT was rather rude, but overall, it was an easy fight.  Take a good slower and you should be golden.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kyzin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Just did this myself last night. brought my gf's 65 cleric and a 65 wizzie friend. GF ate the HT, as i accidentally targeted kazzel's pet and began attacking.<br />
<br />
Hehe, Well, the wizzie killed the zombie in one or two 7k+ nukes, and i looted while kazzel and his pet attacked me. Wizzie succor'd us to zone, (figures succor goes to the Lake Rathe zone) and we ran back and did hand in for completion.<br />
<br />
A couple things for people who don't bring trackers:<br />
<br />
1.- Kazel wanders in the large valley directly to the right and a little down on the map. If ya can't find him run up on the large middle hill and face the small undead camp there. He normally stops in front of it for a short bit.<br />
<br />
2.- Xenyari runs all over the damn place around that druid ring, and she's a half-elf. So if ya don't see her, just wander around a bit and you'll eventually see a half-elf running around.<br />
<br />
3.- Oh and if you accidentally attack kazzel during the fight, just continue fighting the zombie. I had virtue, and the zombie was mostly on the cleric while i was screwing around, lol, but kazzel didn't really do all that much damage. Just loot teh heart and evac or run to feerott zone, and you are good for hand in.</div></div><hr />
