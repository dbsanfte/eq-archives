I thought they had the vehicles in game and had improved some of the things that had bugged players for a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>brian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">yeah and the vehicles added a whole new set of exploits and bugs that are annoying and still not fixed.  the game is STILL a fucking bugfest.  <br />
<br />
there are some totally awesome aspects to the game but the whole thing just never comes together.  I even gave it a second chance and its still not quite good enough.</div></div><hr />

In the words of Johnny Blood: Eat that you discoteria fucks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mutton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Played SWG for quite some time last year.  My opinion is that I wasted about 4 months of my life on that stuff....</div></div><hr />

Tradeskill.<br />
<br />
Thats it.<br />
<br />
Little or no content.  Your idea of 'raids' in terms of EQ... forget it, non existant.<br />
<br />
Vehicles, yeah if you want like 1 or 3.  Bugs, Exploits ( Yes there are still some there ever some that are the same since release ) <br />
<br />
And moving from one 'In game' city to another is so populated by 'Joes Discount Weapon Stores' that it's not even funny, think of the view or Corsicut as they started coming into the planet 'The whole planet is one big city'  This is the major problem with player made town's, houses. You basically can't go Anywhere now without seeing some factory, mineral mine, or town.<br />
<br />
Pro's.<br />
<br />
Quest Terminals, got 30 minutes to play? No problem, take a delivery mission.<br />
<br />
Shuttles ( Basiclly PoK )<br />
<br />
Bacta Tubes - this was nice, it's like a soul binder but  you have the option to Insure your equipment ( the more you have on you the more it costs ) that way when you die your equipment is on you as you exit the bacta tube. If no insurance, run back to corpse.<br />
<br />
Banking / Bazaar.  Bazaar easy, dump it in, set prices, go play, no need for mules or anything.  Banking is linked either planetary or seperately on each planet depending on wich bank you use.<br />
<br />
HuD map, nice being able to see the mobs on radar.<br />
<br />
Graphics - **** ( Four of Five Stars )<br />
<br />
Seemless zones - this was the best part ever in my opinion.<br />
<br />
and on and on.. basically you can see that all the Good stuff in SW:G is fluff..</div></div><hr />
