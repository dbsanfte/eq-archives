Hope this helps.  I'm not vouching for accuracy, although some of the older ones seem what I remember.  Some are insane ZEM's.<br />
<br />
May be worth &quot;stickying&quot; if Mod's feel info is accurate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Androsulach</div><div class="date">01-03-2004, 08:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I knew the ZEM was pretty good in Paludal.  I have 3 alts up there now, all in the 12 to 16 range at the moment.  I'll get them to 20ish, before swapping around to go in from SH.  By then, the last alt, who's 8th, will be up there getting some fat xp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Limdul</div><div class="date">01-04-2004, 05:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not sure it's 100% accurate. <br />
<br />
It lists echo caverns as having a 5% ZEM. But I always have gotten really good exp there.<br />
<br />
Perhaps it's just my imagination.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mordraeth</div><div class="date">01-04-2004, 08:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">And it doesn't list The Hole or Split Paw. Both of which I remember definately having a bonus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oagan</div><div class="date">01-04-2004, 11:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Paw is listed (Splitpaw Lair).  However, this list was before some additional patches that inreased some of the zones even more.  This was on a related thread at the crucible....<br />
<br />
Droga increased by 12% <br />
Nurga increased by 12% <br />
Solusek's Eye (SolA) increased by 13% <br />
Najena increased by 13% <br />
Befallen increased by 13% <br />
Paw increased by 13% <br />
Permafrost increased by 13% <br />
Kaesora increased by 18% <br />
Qeynos Catacombs increased by 20% <br />
Runnyeye increased by 20% <br />
Kerra Ridge increased by 20% <br />
The Hole increased by 25% <br />
<br />
I believe you would add these to the original ones posted on the above list.  The Hole was not listed, but to my memory it is a 25% ZEM.<br />
<br />
Another thing to consider is that there is also additional modifiers for additional people (grouping), which I believe adds 10% for a 2-box team, and up to 80% for a full group of six people.  After group modifiers were added, it took away some of the incentive for soloing.</div></div><hr />
