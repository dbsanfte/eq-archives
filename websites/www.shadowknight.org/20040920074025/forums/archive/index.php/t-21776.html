<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mehatesu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, maybe I only know the slang for it, and I suppose I havent explored EQ to the extent that I should have..But where the hell is Veskar?  Ive pounded the beat on every nook and cranny in PoP, Tier One through 3ish..I havent been to the elemental planes or very deep into the crypt up by PoD, and I havent been to HS yet..Hell, I cant even get the damn key for that place..Anyways, I digress..Where exactly is Veskar, is it in GD in those damn tunnels?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mehatesu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I went to eq atlas and was checking it out and its says Veskar but no listing on whats in it?.  Either way it seems like a low level zone to me, but perhaps Im getting my SK and SM boards confused..Damn those radioactive cheerios!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Muse hasn't been updating EQAtlas for months, as is clearly stated on the front page of the site.  <br />
<br />
LoIO is a low level zone, veskar is not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Envoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Veksar is actually a really fun zone in your upper 50s / lower 60s, with very respectable loots and xp.<br />
<br />
also, its one of the better well thought out zone designs. As far as dungeons go, it is prolly my favorite in game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Oberyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">... follow the pillars out into the lake till you are between the two towers jutting up from the water  (roughly lake center).<br />
<br />
Submerge yourself and you will find a large dome not far under the water.   Follow the curve of the dome deeper, till you hit vertical wall, follow it down to sand level.  Swim around till you find a door into the dome.  <br />
<br />
Thats Veksar.<br />
<br />
The zone entrance has been there since Kunark.  Was dissapointing to find an obvious zone entrance there, and no zone.  Glad they finally put it into game.<br />
<br />
Excellent dungeon, well worth the time to find it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>vilesoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I started tanking nobles in there at  58...given it was fairly  hard with a druid healing,  but it was doable.<br />
<br />
Great zone. The mobs are well made, the zone layout is nothing  short of superb.  This is teh kid of zone I think the devs should make more of.  XP is also off the freaking hook at my level.<br />
<br />
Tip...the nobles hit  a 58 sk for about 450-470 tops...some HT for about 1100, so it's best to have about 3khp unbuffed if you want to tank in there.  That would give enough HP to keep a non-cleric healer from practicallly crapping themselves everytime an SK mob gets pulled.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Howlitoezis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">been tanking there at 4300hp and 1280ac buffed, love the zone, great look and feel and very well planned out, adn like others have said, really, really good XP at at sub 60.</div></div><hr />
