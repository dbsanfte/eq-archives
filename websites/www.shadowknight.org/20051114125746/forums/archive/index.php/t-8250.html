<br />
What percentage of our current standing comes from AAXP? <br />
<br />
For example, if you were to compare SK's to the other classes at 50, 55, 60, and 65, none having AAXP, how much would the comparison suffer as compared to full AAXP?<br />
<br />
Just curious.<br />

<br />
The biggest changes I have seen and liked are put very simply, FAST spells that can be cast that ADD to dps.  I can overlook the 45 sec recycle on the spears becuse they cost no Melee DPS, where as the lifetaps did.<br />
<br />
Many of the 61+ spells were designed FOR shadow knights instead of getting necromancer left overs, this was a HUGE factor in the spells being things we can make real use of.<br />
<br />
A fast casting darkness spell that is worth the mana for the damage it gives now.<br />
<br />
I believe now for the first time in 3 years, shadow knights are what I invisoned them to be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think a lower level version (maybe at 49) of Deathly Temptation... I feel too much of the stuff we've been given to balance us out is high end.  Which ain't bad if you're already 60+... But that doesn't help anyone who's not already there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">synnoira</div><div class="date">11-15-2002, 01:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can't say i've ever felt underpowered level for level, i think the bulk of balancing problems were encountered by folk who were operating in a high end environment in which their abilities had ceased to keep pace with those of their guildmates.<br />
In most of the very heated balancing discussions here there was inevitably a point at which an sk 55 or under would berate some Gravelord for whining about his problems because sk's were so ubah. <br />
That's a fairly accurate reflection of sk's under 55 compared to their equivalents. The primary problem for lower level sk's i found was player perception. But that perception originated in the problems found and bemoaned by sk's in the endgame. I had many many people tell me in various xp groups &quot;sk? cool look but they're no good in the endgame, they add nothing&quot;, quite often adding something like &quot;i had a 55 sk but he was useless in raids&quot;.<br />
One of the things i remember thinking when i got to 55 and was pulling, off-tanking or whatever was that obviously those folk sucked at playing an sk.<br />
I think lower level versions of Blood of Hate would be a nice little thing, but they really aren't necessary. Most complaints i've seen here about lower level sk's are coming from the basis that the player wants to play in god-mode.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We ended up having a very high agro through spells that never were designed that way, we could increase our DPS through spells originally designed to heal...<br />
<br />
These abilities did raise our overall efficiency and prevented us to get real upgrades for a long time, which of course led to an immediate loss of efficiency compared to other classes when the circumstances didn't allow us to use those tricks due to a lack of mana regen, interrupts....<br />
<br />
With experience we were managing to lessen this lack of efficiency and were pulling our weight.<br />
<br />
VI nerfed our instant agro, and through new design eliminated the side effects they didn't want, as a result we were able to gain abilities actually fitting our class and that we can use in all circumstances.<br />
<br />
That is mostly what brings us ahead of what we were, AAs  only come after.</div></div><hr />

Well, really the lower level SK (as in, the exp group SK) has never been underpowered.  In exp group situations, it could easily be argued that we have been  overpowered  for quite some time now.  I could imagine how a lower level raid SK (say, level 46-52ish) could use some extra work, but really, as a whole I don't think we have a lot to complain about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kiztent</div><div class="date">11-15-2002, 03:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Very few of the pre-60 SKs pre-pop had specific complaints (some people complained that they didn't do the most damage and tank best, but that was a minority).  The ones that complained the most were the top raiding SKs, and they appear happier now.<br />
<br />
So AA only really plays a part in our power when AA matters (maxed level in full time raiding guild). When we're not seriously collecting AA, we're fine as it is already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pheargore</div><div class="date">11-16-2002, 02:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye, I only complained about Verant's incompetence.. never had a problem with my SK itself... DC nerf was lame, but mainly because Verant has no clue how there own system works.. Agro was still fine after that using other spells...<br />
<br />
With or without PoP at only level 57 now, still don't need AA, Crazy gear or special secret ghey ass items to do my job and do it well. It comes down to intelligence and being able to multi-task thought processes simultaneously. &quot;Cheating&quot; so to speak is not needed to have &lt;B&gt;fun&lt;/b&gt;.<br />
<br />
Like some one mentioned, a lot of people just want to be in &quot;god-mode&quot;. <br />
I think some have lost touched with the real world as well as the video game world.<br />
<br />
But like the real-world, people do crazy things, act strange, start wars and act like babies for money / ubber loot  &amp; power / virtual-power<br />
<br />
- Peace</div></div><hr />

Probably wont be so useful to high end SK's but will be dam nice for some of us (fingers crossed on no changes and it goes live).</div></div><hr />
