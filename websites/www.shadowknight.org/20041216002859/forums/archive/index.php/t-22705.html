<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been working on this quest off and on; got Rat head, Vaz's heart and just got Junk Beast power source.  Have MQ lined up for Hope Stone, so I figured I was on easy street (picked up trinket and symbol from the Bazaar) after I get the BoT wing gems.  However, someone mentioned that the &quot;Rage Filled Gem&quot; from PoTactics is no drop.<br />
<br />
Can anyone confirm?  In searching on Alla's (where it doesn't say for sure if the gem is no drop), it says it drops off the 68/69 nameds.  Does it drop off of any trash at all?  Reason I ask is that the other two &quot;equivalent&quot; drops for the Intermediate Stealth and Magic Manuals are droppable and drop from trash, yet the piece for the Intermediate Combat Manual is no drop and non-trash.<br />
<br />
Any info would be appreciated -- thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">definitely droppable.<br />
<br />
rage filled gem (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=26697)<br />
you can use lucy to check stuff like this, its accurate, gets updated if the items do change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Excellent, thank you!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, after a week of not seeing any Rage Filled Gems in the Bazaar nor any /auc WTB responses, I decided to (based on info on Alla's) try to take down one of the mobs that supposedly drop this gem.<br />
<br />
Killed Hendin Shadow Master about 4 times in Tactics last night, just dropped standard Diaku trash drops.  My question today is: is there a &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot; Hending Shadow Master?  On my druid, I was able to track 4 or 5 Hendin's -- one or two of them are accessible from the &quot;upper deck&quot; but the rest seem to be deeper in or in way opposite directions.  Does the one or two on the upper deck have a chance to drop the gem I need?<br />
<br />
I don't mind killing Hendin's for as long as it takes to get a gem... but would sure like to know if killing the upper deck one (straight across over the pit from the zone in area) is a waste of time because he will never drop the gem and only the deeper in ones (which I have no idea where these deeper in ones are offhand) will.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Odd, can't seem to edit.  Oh well, nm the above post.  Killed 5 or 6 Hendin's up higher and gem finally dropped.  Hopefully the Hope Stone MQ part will go well...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Goregan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">just as a note to anyone else collecting these items, check what the merchants in PoTranq are selling near the bank area. You will prolly find them there.</div></div><hr />
