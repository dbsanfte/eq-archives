<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Beyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I had 30 AAs saved when the expansion came out, and blew every single one on what I thought the best looking AA was--Weapon Affinity. I now have it maxed, and I think it was worth every point...but I hear many people say it only effects your weapons natural proc (as in, it has no effect on self buff procs like MC or aug procs like Vampire's Kiss). I'm almost positive this is incorrect.<br />
<br />
I have a Greatstaff of Four Winds and maybe I'm just seeing what I want to see, maybe I didn't pay close enough attention before and I'm just convincing myself it's working like I want, but I swear Mental Corruption and Vampire's Kiss are going off far more than before. With all 3 of those augs, I proc damn near every other swing at 305 dex.<br />
<br />
Sadly I don't have any scientific proof, and I sure as shit don't have the urge to parse myself (especially since I never parsed it before, and have no basis for comparison). I'll leave that to the 'professionals'. However, to the human eye, this AA kicks ass. Let the parsers do their parsing and maybe prove me wrong. <br />
<br />
Another thing that I'm sure that's skewed my oppinion is this: I bought the Vampire's Kiss aug the day before GoD came out (thus, the day before I bought Weapon Affinity 5). I hadn't had much time to play with my new and improved weap, so that's obviously effecting my proc rate.<br />
<br />
But I like it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>KrehnLForr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It has already been parsed. Our imbued procs(SoC, MC etc) are not affected by WA. They actually proc LESS than without WA, because the enhanced weapon proc/aug proc takes priority, and you can only proc 1 thing at any one time.<br />
<br />
In short,, the enhanced weapon/aug procs prevent unenhanced SoC/MC from proccing. This is complete BS imo, especially for SKs who spent 18 AAs for SA3. I hope it will be fixed by either :<br />
<br />
a) allowing multiple procs per strike<br />
b) making imbued procs take priority<br />
c) or making WA affect imbued procs.<br />
<br />
The least problematic way that this can happen is by implementing both a &amp; c, but they'll probably go for option b if they ever get around to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nasiir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">why fix something when you don't give a damn?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Seku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Sony has said it is impossible to implement 2 procs in the same strike.

<br />
Some things could be pretty damn inconvenient or tricky depending on how the engine is already set up.  Considering how many interdependancies there are in EQ... not surprising some of the 'cool ideas' are challenging to implement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Blackmerlin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">An easy way could be making -<br />
-&gt;  'Weapon Affinity 6' (or give it another name)<br />
This AA allows the user to configure proc priority (imbued/weapon1/weapon2(aug)/others(to be implemented)) individually.<br />
<br />
Make it cost 10 aa - and i think it still would be really attractive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ueuelr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Because it says Weapon Affinity, I don't think it well ever effect the self buff procs, as much as I would like it to. Best thing to do is make self buffs have priority in case you proc more than one effect in a swing. Then this AA will be right. <br />
<br />
Personally I still think it's good, more procs is more procs, and I'm willing to put up with the odd times when I get 2 procs and only one goes off if I get more procs overall. If you have a weapon with a better proc than your self buff, then you realy have nothing to lose. I'm using BBB with Vampire Kiss augument so I would rather have my SoC proc go first, but if I get a better weapon I wouldn't care.<br />
<br />
Being able to chose the proc priority would be awesome, I doubt it will ever happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>HoschieMondschatten</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">After reading this, sigh...<br />
<br />
Doubt you will get a weapon which has a higher lifetap proc as 195 (from the spell proc).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Crot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Some Thinks Sony said they are impossible:<br />
<br />
It is impossible to move Charakters!<br />
<br />
A bit later they said its possible to move Charakters, but not Chars to a server with different rule set and only with out gear ... Cost 50$<br />
<br />
Again a bit later they said its possible to freely move chars from any given server to another  but without Gear.... for 50$<br />
<br />
Now you can move char's freely from any server to another even with Gear ... and this time not for 50$ no ... just 75$ <br />
<br />
Maybe we should ask if we can pay for WA to work on our selfprocs...<br />
<br />
and did you hear all the rangers curse Sony ? They do have the same problem as we do ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">A side question perhaps, more regarding parsing possibly.<br />
<br />
Although I have parsed myself in the past, I do make, in general, a poor parse subject.  Although ideally I should do parses behind a stationary non-aggro mob, I've mostly been parsing just plain 'ol xp fights, adventures, and whatnot.<br />
<br />
The problem is, whether I am pulling or not (assist on puller), I have autoattack on WAY before the mob is in melee range.  Habit from days old, also likely because I 2-box and by having attack on early I can momentarily turn my attention to the other computer, plus my assist key has a line to initiate swinging.  So I guess I would parse somewhat lower than most as most parser programs start the timer from when attack is turned on.  Anything out there that starts from the first hit around?<br />
<br />
Okay, more on topic, I got WA5 last night.  But I wanted to do a comparison parse as I have plenty of logs from before GoD came out but am a bit dubious as to accuracy, since my weapon has no chance to proc while I am running towards the group, hehe.</div></div><hr />

...Anything out there that starts from the first hit around?...<br />
i'm pretty sure the developers version of yalp only counts melee when you're actually hitting the mob. not certain, as i don't really pay attention to it... in general i only look at general fighting parses to compare total damage output between group members.<br />

<br />
as long as the parses are in the same general conditions, its about as good as you'll get.<br />
<br />
however... if you want to do a seperate controlled parse, you can use the bankers or box in katta.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Nasiir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Got in a conversation regarding this issue inguild today. Person said without a doubt, that they have self procced + weapon procced in a single swing, so they are fairly certain wa5 doesn't impact self procs at all. What evidence supports the argument that wa5 has any impact whatsoever on our self procs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>belize</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">it does not directly effect our self buffs. however, it makes our weapon procs happen far more often. the issues is only 1 proc can happen per round. so if you have a proc aug in a weapon with a natural proc, weapon affinity checks 2 times before you have a chance to proc your superior self buff proc. <br />
<br />
ok fake numbers but used to make a point<br />
<br />
100 hits. <br />
before weapon afinity lets say 10% of your weapons natural procs went off. thats 10 hits. that leaves 90 swings for the augmented proc to attempt. if that is also 10%, thats 9 procs. and that leaves only 81 swings for the self buff to attempt to proc. if that is also 10% we have 8 procs of self buff. all very close.<br />
<br />
100 hits after weapon afinity<br />
20% of natural weapon proc goes off for 20 procs. now we have 80 hits left. 20% for augmented weapon proc from the 80 remaining hits is 16 procs.  this leaves only 64 swings for self buff proc attempts. 10%(cause its not effected by weapon affinity) would mean only 6 procs.<br />
<br />
the main argument is no AA should make our own spells perform worse. if you switched the proc checking order to make self buffs check first, then it would remain constant with or without weapon affinity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Nasiir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I was told the self proc and weapon proc can both proc at once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Menon Lifeblight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">One proc per swing.<br />
<br />
Window has done a number of parses on proc rates.  Search for them.  As you gain levels of WA, your innate proc rate will decrease slightly, due to more frequent procs of higher precedence.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Thack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">It's going to vary depending on what type of spells you use as to how much this will impact you.<br />
<br />
If you have a lifetap proc and you use SoC, you'll probably be better off with WA.  If you proc 5% of the time with self proc (which is about what it seems to me based on rough guestimates.  maybe lower), then that means that you can proc 20 times roughly before you lose a self proc.  If you have the 75 point lifetap proc, that means 1500 damage done by your lifetap would make you lose whatever you would have had with one SoC proc (don't use SoC, so I don't know what difference it will make)<br />
<br />
If you use MC, then it's more a matter of losing mana when you lose an MC proc.  Again though, your overall DPS goes up, but you will lose a very small amount of mana from the occasional loss of an MC proc.<br />
<br />
What people don't point out when they talk about how WA is so bad, is they don't focus on the extra damage done by WA and compare it to the damage lost.  Every extra time your WA makes your weapon proc, it gives you guaranteed damage, compared to a small chance that you would have your self proc fire.  If you take any of the math people have done showing how much less you could have self proc go off, and then figure out how much damage would be done by weapon and aug proc, you would get a very significant increase in damage.  Yes, it is true that you will have a very small decrease in self procs, but the overall increased damage makes up for it IMO.<br />
<br />
That being said, I don't have WA yet and probably won't for about another 100 AAs.  Have too many others that are more important to me at the moment. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
so why haven't you done any of the math to show how &quot;very significant&quot; this increase in damage is?<br />
<br />
in actuality, weapon procs are a very minor source of DPS unless you have a very nice weapon proc. anyway, if you use the formulas (http://www.shadowknight.org/forums/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=20180&amp;highlight=formula) you can see just how much you'd really benefit from WA5 or an augment. for fun, lets run through an example.<br />
<br />
vanazir, auged with 150dd, and using mental horror fighting undead.<br />
<br />
to adjust for resist rates and the damage done with 150 mana from mental horror, i'll rate vanazir at 95, the aug 150dd at 140, and mental horror at 700. (270 base, 430 damage from 150 mana).<br />
<br />
at 19 delay (vanazir 100% hasted) this is what i'd expect in procs/min, each column increasing in WA level:<br />
<br />
primary..: 2.00 | 2.20 | 2.40 | 2.60 | 2.80 | 3.00 |<br />
augment: 1.87 | 2.05 | 2.22 | 2.39 | 2.55 | 2.72 |<br />
self-buff : 1.75 | 1.73 | 1.71 | 1.68 | 1.66 | 1.64 |<br />
<br />
<br />
buff with no augment: 1.87 | 1.86 | 1.85 | 1.84 | 1.82 | 1.81 |<br />
<br />
so at WA0, damage/minute equates to 2* 95 + 1.87 * 140 + 1.75 * 700 = 1676.8<br />
at WA5, damage/minute equates to 3 * 95 + 2.72 * 140 + 1.64 * 700 = 1813.8<br />
<br />
so WA5 in this scenario would up your estimated proc DPS by 8%, or 2.3 DPS.<br />
<br />
without the augment proc, WA5 does even less.<br />
then you're looking at 1499 without WA compared to 1552 with WA5, a 3.5% improvement in proc DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Thack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Good job Window.<br />
<br />
I suppose that I should have been more specific and said a *relative* increase, since the proc DPS really isn't that high overall.  That's part of why I haven't put all the points into it yet and won't for a while.<br />
<br />
Thanks for doing the math for me there since I was kinda lazy and didn't want to. :D  I think that the numbers pretty much said what I felt was going to happen, although it may not have come through like I meant it.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Originally posted by window <br />

/em slams on the brakes<br />
<br />
That means getting WA5 when you don't have a proc'ing weapon yet (a topic unto itself I suppose, but let's say you are holding out DKP for an rare/uber weapon and wanted to be ready to kick butt with it right away), your self buff procs like MC/SoC actually decrease?<br />
<br />
What would cause that?  Is it because the checks are being made still, but since there are no first weapon-innate, and second weapon-aug'd procs to actually go off yet the checks are still in the formula and the chances are calculated, that the third check self-procs still decrease?<br />
<br />
Perhaps that's been apparent to many since the first parses that window posted in earlier threads, but that part sure didn't jump out at me until now.   Well, too late now regardless, I have WA5 and although I don't regret it, it might not have been wise (then again, this comes from the guy that plans to get Pet Affinity next).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Nasiir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">also, are we absolutely certain that self proc and augmented proc can't both fire on the same swing? as several of my guildmates claim.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">For the thrid time in the thread ... you can only fire one proc per swing.  The priority is: weapon, aug, innate.  Your guildmates are wrong and should be shot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
no, they would not... those are the rates if you have either just an augment or just a normal weapon proc (but not both).<br />
if your weapon has no procs your buff procs will stay the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">and this is how it appears to work:<br />
<br />
every melee round, first it checks for weapon procs, and if one doesn't fire it checks for augment procs, and if one doesn't fire it checks for buff procs, and then it determines hit roll and whether you double or not and such.<br />
<br />
procs go off before you actually hit the mob, which is very noticable when you use the OT hammer and proc on the first round.<br />
<br />
<br />
so... you can only have one proc per ROUND, not even per swing. IE doubling/tripling doesn't give you more chances to proc.<br />
and you cannot proc on ripostes<br />
and you cannot proc while casting spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>SkTyger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Uhm, Widow, you sure about the not proc'ing on riposte's?<br />
I'd have sworn in the past I've had proc's go off when I was just standing around (attack not on).  I'll check this later tonight (is easy enough, wield no weapons, SoC, taunt some greenie, and just stand there for a while)<br />
<br />
Actually, I could extend this test (just realized)...  Seperate test, same procedure, but will stand there casting long casting time non attack spells...  (maybe summon pet).  Probably use Orc 1 for this, or A Moss Snake (i.e. so that interrupts would be rare).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">if you proc'd on riposte I think it would be well known. Some procs are DoT's, if you proc'd it on riposte then the mob wouldn't be able to be mez'd.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Funny story...<br />
<br />
My first or second Emp fight.  I was wielding Greenmist, since this was the emp bane that I had.  As you know, Greenmist procs a dot.  I was offtanking one of the four mobs that need to be off-tanked very close to the four mobs that need to be kept mezzed.<br />
<br />
One of the enchanter's mezzed mobs must have gotten a mem wipe and he let mez wear off, because it started attacking me instead of the enchanter and it must have caught a fast riposte because it got Greenmist on it and mez was broken every tick for as long as Greenmist lasted.<br />
<br />
Unless there's some other explanation for how that mob got my Greenmist proc on it (because I had my off-tanked mob on my target the whole time) I'm gonna claim that you can proc on a riposte.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">its easy to check. get any really high delay weapon (75+ preferred), and /duel a shaman,  have them slow you and swing at you. if you swing at them you will proc about every round, but you will not proc when you riposte.<br />
<br />
this is why when warriors do AE groups they don't use their riposte disc with earthshaker... the weapon wouldn't proc. they use their AE rampage disc so they're getting melee rounds for each mob in the vicinity and have a chance to proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Nasiir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Proc usually lands before swing lands. I've procced my OT hammer several times seemingly without attacking.<br />
<br />
So one proc per round? I'm sorry for being annoying, but I could have sworn I've procced twice in a single round before and several people inguild, back when I had the original conversation, said that even if they didn't proc twice in one swing, they definitely procced twice in a round.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Polite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">You can proc more than once per round. You cannot proc more than once per swing. Remember that in a given round you are frequently taking more than one swing via double attacks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">i've parsed me attacking a stationary mob for literally days checking out proc rates and stuff, and never proc 2x in the same round.<br />
whether or not you proc is checked before it determines whether you hit or miss the mob, how much you hit for, and whether you make a double attack.<br />
i already explained above how it works.<br />
<br />
anyway since you won't take my word for it, the attachment is 5 hours of parsing greater stormwatcher horn augmented with vamipre kiss. if you look through it, every melee round follows the same pattern as you can see by the timestamps:<br />
<br />
bella helsin (one of the katta bankers) says &quot;guards!! guards!!&quot;<br />
a proc sometimes goes off<br />
i crush bella or miss her<br />
then i possibly crush or miss her again<br />
<br />
not once does a proc occur after the first swing in a round, which is what would be necessary if you could possibly proc 2x in one round. you can't proc 2x in one round though, so it doesn't happen.</div></div><hr />
