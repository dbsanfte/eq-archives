<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jespar Bloodreaver</div><div class="date">07-14-2004, 08:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm interested in running a 4 box on POP but from what I've noticed since the most recent patch is that PoN, PoD, PoT all run terribly like crap if you run 4 EQ windows on a single machine.<br />
<br />
I currently run a P42.8 with 2gb of memory and a raedon 9200 128 card. Other areas such as Norrath and Kunark (so far I've tested) seem to work properly but when I tried PoP it was terrible. Graphics were very very slow and some textures would just dissappear because of the lag.<br />
<br />
I was wondering if anyone would have suggestions to fixing this problem? Is it just entirely impossible to 4 box on a machine in PoP?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bloodmere</div><div class="date">07-15-2004, 06:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Are you running 4 full effect windows? If you only run one window with all models, effects and such and let the other have the old models, no effects, low clipplane, no 3d sky and all off that and that you make a document nameds nosound.txt and put in in the dirs. That would mean btw that you have to make 4 folders with eq, and have unique settings for each folder, then you should be able to get some better performance. You have enough RAM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maicom</div><div class="date">07-15-2004, 06:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i run a sk/clr/chanter on 1 machine(1900mhz athlon xp, 1gb ram, geforce 5700U-- needed linux support). Have my sk's eye candy on max, the other 2 accounts have everything on low, with only horse/their race luclin models on. Running at 1280x1024 and everything works dandy.<br />
I'd get eqplaynice, helps loads. You have to pay for it now though, somethin like 10 bucks for 3 months i think? its like at lavish.com or some shit now, think there's a link to the new place at the old site(http://teqim.sourceforge.net).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jespar Bloodreaver</div><div class="date">07-15-2004, 12:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I actually turned off dynamic lighting, all models, 3d skies, mipmapping, and all the other resource hogging options. I did this for all 4 boxes. The one thing I didn't try is the nosound.txt mentioned. <br />
<br />
Funny thing is I was in OT yesterday with all 4 and had clip plane all the way up and there was no problems. First time I step into a PoP zone like PoT or PoD there is graphical slowdown everywhere and the ground graphics get all screwy, often dissappearing from one of the box views.<br />
<br />
I guess what I'm wondering is with my machine and all 4 windows turned down to bare bones should my machine be able to handle 4 windows in the planes?<br />
<br />
Thanks for the replies.<br />
<br />
<br />
PS- My basic rundown of setting up my boxes on one machine.<br />
<br />
1) Install EQ to drive.<br />
2) Copy and paste 3x folders to the drive.<br />
3) Name all folders character names<br />
4) Make shortcuts and also direct them to said names.<br />
<br />
Basically aside from running EQplaynice and all options off, thats pretty much it.<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW, I do use EQplaynice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its possible. All settings at lowest, all toons but the sk looking at the ground. Set up hotkeys for fast targetting.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Naelyan</div><div class="date">08-23-2004, 05:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alt + Enter to go to windowed mode, if you use WinXP then you need to hit Alt+Shift+R to free your mouse (default), but you can change that in the options window in-game. Alt+Enter to go back to fullscreen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kynan</div><div class="date">08-23-2004, 06:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Then I can run another instance of Everquest? Or do I need to copy paste over another instance and run it from that?<br />
<br />
I got a barton 3000 9700 pro so horsepower shouldnt be an issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Naelyan</div><div class="date">08-23-2004, 10:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can run the same client twice, though I would suggest copying and pasting to make seperate clients so that you can have your main &quot;everything looks pretty&quot; client and then have seperate ones with settings off and a nosound.txt file in them to make things run smoother.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Syfon</div><div class="date">08-24-2004, 09:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Once in windowed mode you simply use ALT+TAB to switch between characters.</div></div><hr />
