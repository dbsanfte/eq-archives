We also dropped Maestro, got warrior epic piece, and dropped a few minibosses.<br />
<br />
Anyway, just a Soulleech and Rharzar Spine to go, not bad for bein 46.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaiyn</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 12:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I hate ashenbone drakes. They say that the hide supposedly drops in hate, but I have yet to see any information backing that up :). That was some good luck for you getting that, way to go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LaBlade</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 01:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is no SK epic! How do I know? Well, &quot;they&quot; say you need a hide off an ashenbone drake, but have you ever seen an ashenbone drake? They're skeletons, all bones, no skin, so no hide.<br />
<br />
It's either a conspiricy, or an elaborate practical joke. Everyonce in awhile, one of the SK's on the inside announce they got their hide (or epic), and then they all sit back and laugh their asses off while the rest of us hunt in vain for this non-existent piece.<br />
<br />
The worst part of it is that &quot;they&quot; claims it drops in Hate, which has got to be the worse place for SK loot drops. We SK's go on these Hate raids, watch all the clerics/rangers/warriors/etc get their cool loot, all the while knowing we won't get anything from the raid, except this hide which I now know to be a myth.<br />
<br />
I thought the circlet club was bad enough, this is just plain mean. ;)<br />

Seriously dude, grats. <br />

PS. The post above was meant mainly as a joke, I don't really believe it.....well, sometimes in my more cynical moments, I wonder..... :)</div></div><hr />
