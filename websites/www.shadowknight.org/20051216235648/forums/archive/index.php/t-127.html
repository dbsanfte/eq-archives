A lot of the goblins drop several plat, and with shroud of undeath and any sort of regen tunic, you can clear the whole place using clinging darkness to stop runners (not that you NEED to) on about a bubble of mana.<br />
<br />
Did that one night for about 3 hours, banking all my small coins, as well as the various armors and magic items to sell in EC. All told I made about 600pp in cash and with what I sold in EC. Not uber money, but effortless and undangerous if you're bored. Do it enough, you can even end up able to use RV as a banking spot.</div></div><hr />

I got a lset of black alloy, a ba longsword, ba bastard sword, grotesque alloy mask, black alloy medallion.  Sold it all in E Commons in about an hour and made 700p.  Added bonus is the banker down there so I could stash stuff and bank the coin about 10 seconds from where I was hunting.</div></div><hr />

But it's been a while since I was there last, maybe they changed it<br />
<br />
Of course the big money comes from stuff like seb groups and winning a roll on something that sells big in EC, but I was never a big fan of that, thus I've never really had the &quot;big money&quot; hehe</div></div><hr />

Dalnir can make you some serious cash.  <br />
Just wander around killing anything with a weapon.  For the most part it is all FS, but the female erudites and the male DEs occasionally drop the Tower Guard's Blade and the Charred Thulwar, each sell with a 60 cha for 27 plat.  The female gnomes drop the Sap of Piety (13/36 1HB), that sells to a merchant for 3p, and the iksar monks drop the Iksar Stave.  The other nice ones are the Kly Imprecators(grrr!) that drop Bo Stick (14p) and the Robe of Dalnir, Earring of Station, etc.  The one that pops the most in on the 2nd floor in the shackle room, and the Coerced Crusaders (live version is a PH in shackle room, undead version is on 3rd floor in the broken table room past the one-way door).<br />
After you clear the ones with weapons, clear the rest.  They occasionally drop emeralds(10p), golden medallions(11p), opals(?p), and up to 4p in cash.<br />
<br />
Without really trying (I was camping the Imprecators on the 3rd floor) I made 150-200 plat a night, which isn't bad really for level 44.  If you went in to sell FS and get some of the monk/bst only 2HBs, you can make a large amount of cash.  <br />
<br />
Lumpies drop the Batons that you can sell to players if you wish, but I'm not sure of the market for those anymore.<br />
<br />
Hope this is of some good, if not to you, then to the rest of you that are in your 30s and 40s.<br />

Alternating between Giants and undead.. The undead drop 5-6 plat, plus some random trinkets to sell. The giants drop all sorts of crap that sells for anywhere between 10-60pp a piece.. I make about 350pp an hour here, + decent xp</div></div><hr />

<br />
The boots are the lords common drop and he spawns on avg about 1 out of 4 times.  At 58 and below, all the imps/guardians are still blue, and at 59/60 about half are, so the xp is still very good.  It's one of my favorite soloing spots at 60, decent AA xp and good fast cash.</div></div><hr />

<br />
lots of cash loot and the necros drop JB helm occasionally which you can sell for 500pp or so to a PC, or to a vendor it still sells for over 300pp.  can single pull everything at 60 except the back room if you get bad luck on the frog spawns, but even if you do, it's easily split.<br />
<br />
just remember to dispell all the necros.  banshee aura on you = good.  banshee aura on them = bad</div></div><hr />
