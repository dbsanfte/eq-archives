I always just thought it would be that I pull a mob, run away, FD and wait for his buddies to walk off one at a time. That's the way it worked in CC when I was 30ish. I'm 40 now and I've been doing the gnomes in Echo and noticed that they go back together. I've been using engulfing to get them to stay, but then I have to FD again, then wait for it to refresh, then hope it doesn't fail. And some times when I FD I get wiped from hate, other times not.<br />
<br />
So is there someone who can explain the ins and outs of FD pulling for an SK? I would rather not have to resort to going to Monkly Business as I assume there are some pretty big differences between SK pulling and Monk pulling.<br />
<br />
Thanks :)</div></div><hr />

Seems like a newbie zone and I want advice from people who know what they're doing :) In any case, I didn't see anything. Is there a nice post that was made that you're thinking of? Maybe one of the moderators could dig it up and sticky it so you don't have to waste your time answering the questions of a newbie SK.</div></div><hr />

Might as well read Lao Tsu's guide to advanced pulling.</div></div><hr />

That helped me learn a few things.  I still think experience is the key.</div></div><hr />
