edit: brian hates blizzard and jupke makes up his own imaginary emotes so I took down the pic of two gnomes spanking each other and replaced it with a retard trying to jam his finger up his ass through his pants, which you also wont see in EQ. It's funnier anyway.</div></div><hr />

sorry guys I was wrong about this game.  I think we should all pre-order at least 2 copies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chayde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">haha When brian circled the 'flowers' on the floor, and said &quot;shitty&quot; in the senetence above it, made me do a double take at the picture.<br />
<br />
too bad the gnomes weren't standing over it, then they could sell the pic as &quot;gnome shit fetishs&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jodgrim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Jesus christ brian, did blizzard shit in your mouth while you were sleeping or what?</div></div><hr />

I like to go out into the maedows every night and fuck sheep while wearing rubber booties!!1! And playing WoW cuts away from my available time to fuck those warm wooly sheep :(...that is why i am so negative about WoW...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Brian's goal is to get a custom title and place the words &quot;Sheep Tackling Fuck Puppet&quot; there...<br />
<br />
Edit /fingerfuckmyowndickhole has also been an EQ emote forever...puleez</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Androsulach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">So, is there a /doggiestyle emote in EQ or not?  I mean, all those barbarian chicks wear skirts and a number of human female merchants wear dresses.   We should be able to bend them over and have some fun now and then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kebsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">If those barbarians ladies were real, they would look like China from the WWF. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Go to Erudin <br />
Palace and look at all those hotties wearing the see through white dresses.<br />
<br />
Just wish there were more wanderers so you could see them wiggle.</div></div><hr />
