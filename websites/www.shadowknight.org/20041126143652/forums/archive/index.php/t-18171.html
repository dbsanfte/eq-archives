<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>wWanda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Possibly me but did they nerf switching factions somehow? Ive been attempting to switch from CoV to Kael faction for the past few days. <br />
  As of right now I have 200 coldain heads to hand in to capt.Bvellos,  Im allied to Rif faction giants  but still KOS  to the zek faction of them.  <br />
  For some  reason I remembered that rif was one faction above zek.  Dubious to rif  meant kos to zek.   Or was I dreaming this?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sithanator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">First why are you trying to change factions? If you have Frostweaver or Yelinak head in bag. Since you already have 200+ coldain heads, you shouldn't any more heads to raise faction with KT for turn in. Your best bets for faction would be, named in WW, icewall keep(with a group of friends), or soloing coldain in EW/GD.<br />
<br />
If you are just trying to raise kael factions then some of those heads into the recruiter at the EW zoneline every 10 or so check zek faction. Once dub start turning them into Bvellos. you will go max ally with him after about 40 heads. Also note you will need to use hide trick used with running seals for turning heads into Bvellos until appren or indifferent(I waited until indifferent).<br />
<br />
Don't bother faction in SkyShrine unless your hurting on pp. When they revamped SS they nerf the faction hits something hard. Much easier to just kill coldain. Also out of impatients of wanting to know how far along I was, I download eqanalyser from eq toolbox web site. It will show you how many faction you have had + and - for a faction based off the logs you feed into it. It won't show you the size of the hits, just how time you have seen increase message.<br />
<br />
As far different faction in Kael<br />
King Tormax- look like Kromzek(made up of 5 npcs in the castle area)<br />
Kromzek - Plate wearing giants for the most part.(These are the Elite force of Kael trained to protect Kael from the dragons)<br />
Kromrif - chain wearing giants. (these are the giant model you se near zone lines in kael, and out on the open field zones)<br />
