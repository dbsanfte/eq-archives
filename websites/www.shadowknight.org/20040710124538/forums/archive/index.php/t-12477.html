<br />
I would appreciate if you would look at it and comment on it. <br />
<br />
Also, given that the quest is THE ONLY ONE that has not yet been solved, it is reasonable to assume that it is either broken or at least very poorly implemented. Please /bug /feedback and email about it until it is fixed.</div></div><hr />

I am very pleased that my thread there hasn't yet been derailed by the self appointed &quot;TNZ Board Police&quot; and that the feelings on the issue are unanimous.<br />

I really like my SK, and he's the only character I play, but the treatment we receive pisses me off sometimes.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kyfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Just wanted you guys to know that I am continuing the crusade to have this fixed. I saw Alan replying to various stuff on Mobhunter so I posted the following message (as Anonymous, I didn't set up my handle properly):<br />
<br />
http://www.mobhunter.com/message.jsp?articleid=155233032&amp;msgid=1047897075#message<br />
<br />
He replied, I replied to him, he replied again. He indicated his email address and asked that the info be sent to him. I will do so. Hopefully something will happen. <br />
<br />
Edit: I was reading the current Mobhunter, and Moorgard actually quoted my letter :). Quote follows:<br />
<br />
Alan also responded (http://www.mobhunter.com/message.jsp?articleid=155233032&amp;msgid=820420919#message/) to one of our reader's concerns that Comatose, a necro/SK spell introduced in the Ykesha expansion, isn't available because one of the quest components doesn't appear to drop:<br />
<br />
That came up at Fan Faire. We recently bumped up the drops for the quest (doubled them, in fact). We asked that the guy who brought it up send us an email if that wasn't the issue. If it's something other than drops (like something broken with the quest) drop me an email with details and we'll fix it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hopefully this'll get the issue some publicity and it will be solved.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Good work on keeping up with it, Kyfe.  I've not even started to think about going to get Coma yet, since I'm going to ding 54 tonight (less than 2 ticks left) and I JUST got BoP, but hopefully your efforts will have some effect on the way this quest works and it might be a possibility in the near future.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kyfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Just another update. Alan had asked me on Mobhunter to email him the details of the problem. I sent the following letter to Alan, straight copy/paste follows:<br />
<br />
Hi Alan. I am the fellow who posted up on Mobhunter concerning Comatose. I am a long time player of EQ and have a 57 SK main and a 39 Wiz alt.<br />
<br />
Comatose is the only LoY quest spell which remains unsolved more than a month after LoY was released. <br />
<br />
The pieces in general for both Blood of Pain and Comatose are insanely rare. How rare? Killing a massive number of luggalds in the hidden cave in Dulak (where this stuff drops) with two 65 wizards for 6+ hours yielded zero drops. Some people have spent literally weeks killing in all the LoY zones and still do not have the drops for either spell. I don't believe doubling is enough. This quest should be brought more in line with the other quest spells in difficulty.<br />
<br />
Blood of Pain, while ridiculously time consuming, has been solved.<br />
<br />
For Comatose, the NPC mentions that he needs Luggald Blood, Bile and Saliva. I personally have the Luggald Blood, so I know that exists. I have seen reports of the Luggald Bile dropping as well. I have not been able to find a single report of Luggald Saliva EVER dropping since LoY was released. And trust me, I have done extensive leg work trying to find it. Posting everywhere, checking every SK and Necro board, asking repeatedly in both serverwide.sk and serverwide.necro, asking every Necro and SK I know. The drop does not exist.<br />
<br />
So, in summary, Luggald Organs, Luggald Bile, and Luggald Blood need DRASTIC drop rate increases. Significantly more than double. It should not take a few days /played to obtain a 44 or 52 spell. Luggald Saliva needs to be added to the drop table of some mobs as it clearly is not in the game at the moment. Surely the combined efforts of every Necro and SK serverwide would have produced a single confirmed drop if it existed.<br />
<br />
Realize that there are a fair amount of people out there who are pretty angry about this. For many SKs (who are pullers), including me, this spell was one of the chief reasons they bought LoY. It is a massive pulling upgrade for the 52-59 SK. Having it still be MIA a month+ later is quite upsetting. <br />
<br />
Thank you in advance for your help.<br />
<br />
P.S. As an entirely different subject, are you aware that SKs are the only class in the game who needs a different class to make certain spells for them as their ONLY way to get the spell? I am speaking concerning Necro research only spells (Harmshield, Bond of Death, others). Every other class can get every single spell via their own research, drop, PoP Quest, or vendor. Even the new Int-caster research for priests is an alternate way of getting spells which can otherwise be gotten via drop. Please add SK only versions of all SK spells which are currently Necro research only to some vendors.<br />
<br />
He replied rather quickly with the following:<br />
<br />
Thanks for the info, I'll pass it on!<br />
<br />
A<br />
<br />
<br />
So this information has now gotten to the relevant people via Alan and hopefully the issue will now be properly addressed.<br />
<br />
I'll keep you folks posted if anything else occurs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>TooCrooked</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">i had started to lose hope, or at least, my next hope was the now cancelled april first patch (the cancellation of that patch was another amazing blow regardless of its comedic implications)<br />
<br />
that letter you wrote was PERFECT. you not only pointed out that the spell wasn't dropping and how much thats created an impact, but also that in general the spells are out of whack.<br />
<br />
im still dubious as to &quot;we doubled&quot; it. if only one is supposed to drop in like 1000 spawns, double doesnt help much!!!<br />
<br />
great job kife!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Ktuluu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">So no fix to Comatose in the new patch. Now what? Spam /feedback ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Nazgaull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">So no fix to Comatose in the new patch. Now what? Spam /feedback ? <br />
<br />
Actually, it may have indeed already been fixed in this patch and no message about it was added to the Patch Message.<br />
<br />
Sony has done things like this before.<br />
<br />
So before you rant about it, go prove it.<br />
<br />
In other words, wait and see... It might be fixed, it might not be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Kyfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">The problem is, &quot;proving&quot; it involves spending a ton of hours killing Luggalds all through LoY. No thank you. This quest is clearly broken, so as a courtesy, we should be told when it is fixed.<br />
<br />
Letter sent today to Alan (straight cut and paste):<br />
<br />
Subject: Followup on SK/Necro spell Comatose<br />
<br />
Hello again. We corresponded previously on this issue.<br />
<br />
I just saw today's patch message, and there is no mention of fixing the Comatose spell quest (the one with the missing drop). Has this been &quot;stealth fixed&quot; (ie fixed, but not mentioned)? Or is it still broken?<br />
<br />
I ask because I do not wish myself and others to go back and kill greens for numerous hours if the drop is still nonexistent. <br />
<br />
I will be passing along your response to the community (via SK.org and TNZ) so they are aware of the situation as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
I hope he replies, and I hope it is fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Ktuluu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Any new news on Comatose since the last patch?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>TooCrooked</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">of course not. they would rather start new projects, ,like that picture of the iksar on eq.com.<br />
<br />
how long has it been since loy came out? not only are they starting a new project,  they havent totally imprelented their last. or well, since only a small group is complinging, they can be ignored. this is proven fact because our problem has not been fixed, and there is no mention of it other than a &quot;increased drop rate&quot; message to placate us for a little while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>cigarskunk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">@#$% - WTF is it with them and blowing off SKs?!?!?!??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>cigarskunk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">** Quests ** <br />
<br />
- Fixed the drops for the Comatose spell quest. <br />
<br />
From today's patch message - but is it real or is it memorex?</div></div><hr />
