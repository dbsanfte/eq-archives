<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kharan_zechts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anyone experimented with this since the patch? I tried trial 7 and it has been changed alot. Tanked Pixxt Decimator easily (he only hit for 1400's). But after that we tried the Diabolic Destroyer and he was still hitting for 2k. 2 clerics couldnt keep me up, however our bard wasnt able to slow him and mez the 4 adds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kemora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I was able to tank DD, so I don't see any reason that you should have any problems. I sit at about 7150 unbuffed and 1800ac, and was able to /barely/ tank her unslowed with two clerics doing an SL rotation. We had raid buffs (luv the bot army!) so I was sitting at around... 10010hp and pretty close to 2000ac. I didn't end up winning, but our loss was larely due to the fact the wizard decided to root one of the adds on the rogue, killing our dps (smooth :P). I definatly think you can win with you tanking, you'll need good clerics though.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't recommend it, but with 8k unbuffed I don't really see that you should have any problem tanking. One really important thing is to just beat her down fast, she seems to act like a Rathe and hit for less as her hitpoints go down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Did 3rd trial minus the boss without a healer (me, ranger, rogue, bard, enchanter) thx retuning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kalendrox Grimblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Tanked DD for about 30 seconds while the dumbshit cleric in my group chained supernal remedy and supernal elixir.  (this was after the warrior died a horrible death, same reason~)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Iskander</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Was it Sinzan?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>kharan_zechts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Pretty sure the reason i died was because bard couldnt get her slowed and mez the 3 adds. Are they easily rootable?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kemora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">They really hit these with the nerf bat, the trash are pretty much complete jokes compared to how it used to be, both in difficulty and number. Usually took us around 3-4 hours to kill all the named and DDs room, now we can do it in about 35 minutes.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Last night doing them my group was crying, we want some god damn medals for beating them with a Knight tank in their very original form (except we didn't use charm although it was possible).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>kharan_zechts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Finally got her, ht took the bitch from 28 to 9, so get a group of 6sks and zerg the named hehe.</div></div><hr />
