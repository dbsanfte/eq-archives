<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kilkulan Darkwarrior</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was wondering if anyone had some infoz on this guy... Im wanting to keel him (have magleo link on sig)<br />
<br />
Some of the main Questions are<br />
<br />
is he soloable?<br />
how many ppl would he require if not (think EP+ geared)<br />
how rare is the willsapper exactally?<br />
<br />
<br />
any other help would be appreciated (tips, tricks ETC.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>HagtharTP</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I am 95% sure you won't be able to solo him, but with a cleric equivalent to yourself in both level and gear, you and another dps might be able to drop him.  Then again, I have never fought him myself.  You might want to look into it a bit past my post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rocraft</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Vaniki isn't very difficult I did him a while ago with a group composed of a cleric, druid, enchanter, ranger, rogue and myself.  The main difficulty is getting past his 500 life taps that go off a lot and getting him single.  I found that it was easier to single him to the zone in then try to fight all the way in to his chamber with the group and given the fact that he corpse camps and casts weak necromancer dots makes it easy to slowly run him to the zone in feigning to take off additional adds.  It's important if you take this route and pull him by the Shade you are careful not to get very close otherwise you will be death touched as the Shade doesn't like it when you mess with rats.  Most likely though you can position your group past the Shade's chamber and pull Vaniki to there his melee is weak around 250 and he flurries a decent amount.  I would say that a healer, dps, and possibly an enchanter for runes would be sufficient to kill him and the key is just to have more dps then his life taps.   Also he always wields the Willsapper when he has it and I'm fairly certain he drops it every time as I have never seen him without it the many times I killed him after I got mine.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Alukar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sk (me), Pal and drood (2 box), all ep gear and few aa (300-400 each),  did him recently while we were going to kill Zlandicar, think he dps like Zlandicar, easy fight, he runs under 15%. drop the Willsapper, Vaniki's heart and spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kelefane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Did him with just myself and a Druid and the fight wasnt even close...Im Time/Ikkinz geared.<br />
<br />
Then I spotted him up one evening and soloed him and slowed him w/ his own weapon =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kilkulan Darkwarrior</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">thanks for all the imput :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gobgob frum Grobb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Nailed him last night and got the Willsapper - been on my &quot;list&quot; for a while.  :) <br />
<br />
Reasonably easy for a 65+ SK to invis/flop down and stealth check spawns/kill PH's.<br />
<br />
There are alot of roamers in the main tunnels. PoTime/Qvic geared with 68 Pet, Skele and I ended up getting to many adds to contend with most of the time to consider clearing a tunnel to fight in.<br />
You have to pick your spot carefully burn down the PH, FD off the adds then go looking for the next named/PH.<br />
<br />
Once I had actually spawned the rat bastard after a few nights I had two goes at Vaniki solo with self-buffs only.<br />
<br />
First try got him too 50%, second try I got him to 35%. Died on the second attempt because I chanced my luck a bit too far, I got a couple of interrupts and he got off a very lucky string of those procs. (He was DD proccing on me often for 450hp - I've read it's s'pose to be 500dd).<br />
He appears to have some decent regen for a Velious mob<br />
<br />
Got a Cleric buddy to come give me a hand and ratboy went down no problem.<br />
<br />
Slowed with his own Willsapper he may well be soloable like Kelefane said - his melee isn't too much of a pita (he flurries, but mainly hit 80-90, had a few for 150) but combined with his procs it does burn you down, if he's not hitting you as much (slowed) he won't be proccing as much.<br />
<br />
Solo was quite a long fight - several minutes before I had to FD (1st try) and died (2nd try), ... you have no idea of the shame of admitting you died to an over-achieving lab-rat. :rolleyes: <br />
Blood of Hate would'nt land at all which drew things out further.<br />
<br />
With all the bugs-spawn traps and DD traps in the tunnels you are way better pulling ratboy to a safepoint to kill than trying to get a healer down there with you to his spawnpoint - they inevitably trip traps and without FD and &quot;that which shall go unnamed&quot; theres a very high possiblity they will pull adds which turns into a train once all the wandering tunnel rat bastards and bats happen along. (With spider traps mobs and adds you'd be very lucky to get all aggro off the healer.)<br />
<br />
&quot;Good bashin' too yoo an' hope yooz rat squishin' goez gud.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>runcade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I killed zlandicar with myself and a boxed sham last night and Vaniki was up in the hallway so I pulled her.  I could not for the life of me get her below 80%.  Her melee was nothing once she was slowed but after 5 minutes I gave up and gated out.  The willsapper isnt worth it to me especially already having a shaman.</div></div><hr />
