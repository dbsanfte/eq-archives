Has my bashes, either 1h / shield bash.  Or 2h aa bash... been possibly stunning at all this whole time and I just never noticed it?  And the immobilizing bash aa will increase the chance?<br />
<br />
OR<br />
<br />
No DE's can't stun on bashes, and this immobilizing bash aa will do nothing since I can't stun, or will it now allow stuns to possibly happen.<br />
<br />
Never thought about it till now with 3 aa's saved atm and deciding what to buy so trained it and have fought 20 mobs with never seeing any type of stun message or the mob look stunned.  Guess could be unlucky and no stun percent happened, or mob was unstunnable but doubt it.  I'm wondering if I wasted 3 aa on a skill useless to a de ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The stun aa works just works better on lower level mobs.  It seems to be a small increase in a chance to stun with a bash, there is no message attached to it.<br />
<br />
Its fairly useless I wouldn't get it unless I had a ton of aa and not much else to buy like me.  Does seem to help a bit on normal ldon's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Visvires</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Works nicely for stunning gaters and in the arena, i have lvl 3 and its a noticable difference for me. Good 18aa spent for how i play, though I imagine if your not in a situation where you are looking to stun mobs.. ( i two box often, nice to interupt ch and gates + snare resist + run etc..) then i cant see any real point to purchasing it, because its hardly going to negate any dps from the mob</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I feel it's points that were wisely spent for me; however, the prob is that our skill cap on bash isn't that high and we miss a lot.<br />
<br />
As stated above, we don't see actual stun messages, but we do see interrupts when we connect, we see runners stop in their tracks (then they may start moving again when they become unstunned) and they don't hit you when stunned... and there is some aggro attached to it from what I've observed.  Bash also stuns mobs that may be flagged as unstunnable by stun weps or aug'd stun weps.<br />
<br />
Disclaimer: these comments are based on the mid-level game I play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Stronteum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ok, thanks for responses.  Just a few saying both sides.  I'm planning to spend in it and max it in hopes of it's effectiveness.  Possible stunning of mobs seems beneficial to me.  It's an expensive aa line to buy though it looks like. <br />
<br />
But finally after 3 years of pretty much searching for hide and soulleech to finish up the epic to sit in inventory, Now I have time to do all the xp push heh.  Oh wait, damn you BiC quest.... ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Askeer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I purchased immobilizing bash, its not that bad.<br />
I stun runners quite often for example.<br />
Not a top priority AA but not a useless one either.</div></div><hr />
