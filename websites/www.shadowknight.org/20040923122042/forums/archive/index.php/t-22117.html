<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Booze the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So far in the few hours time I've had a chance to play tonight after work I noticed 1 disturbing problem. Shroud of Chaos and SA3 is only critting for 260. Is this the result of Sony's &quot;AA fixes&quot; ? Or was I just too drunk to have noticed it land for 390 at least once and there is now a random amount to our tap procs? I shudder to think. Hopefully it is just a mistake on my half, or if not that it will be fixed soon enough.<br />
Anyone noticed anything else bugged that affects us negatively thus far?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Derraj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">probably a bug, considering the race changes as you zone and the gigantic pets.<br />

INC! EMERGENCY PATCH</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Booze the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">All English Language servers will be coming down for an update at 4AM PDT -7 GMT, July 15th, 2004. The expected downtime is 3 hours. <br />
<br />
Yep!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yep!<br />
<br />
maybe one day, they will get it right the first time.<br />
<br />
<br />
That was a 9 hour patch, one would think something that long would have went a bit more smoothly.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
4am to 7am is best time for me to play, the house is quiet, no one calling to disturb me, still before breakfast time so I'm not hungry, and the atmosphere kinda has this calmness to it, people are nicer wee hours in the morning.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Derraj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">atleast its not on the weekend, only time I ever get to play is on the weekends.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Oberyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">When I logged in I was an NDT style scarecrow.  NO idea where that one came from, and it wouldn't go away, hehe.  <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Warrl Kyrie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Friend of mine was complaining because she is supposed to be a female Vah Shir, instead she was running around as a male gnome.<br />
<br />
She logged off and refuses to play until they get that fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Parasite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Now if she was a beastlord and instead of a tiger your friend would have had a Manaetic Behemoth as her warder.. now that would've been cool~ :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Belyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">My hps were almost 200 lower then they should have been.<br />
<br />
Gotta say I hate hate hate the fact that casting a spell no longer makes you auto stand from FD.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Personally, I'd welcome that change back so that when spamming FD -- you don't stand up again because you got one off but didn't realize it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Parasite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Isn't there a button in the options window called &quot;Allow Auto-Stand&quot; or so that also makes you standup on cast?..<br />
Didn't try it out yesterday if that affects the Standup for casting or only to stand up when pressing forward...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Krushum Gudended</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I dont want to stand from pressing forward, I just want to stand from casting a spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Xanathol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Had the scarecrow as well after a zone...funny thing - could not summon a horse with error stating I needed to have horse and luclin graphics enabled ( I have everything enabled )...use PoH and clicked off, back to normal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>TelimTor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Had the scarecrow as well after a zone...funny thing - could not summon a horse with error stating I needed to have horse and luclin graphics enabled ( I have everything enabled )...use PoH and clicked off, back to normal.<br />
<br />
I became a female halfling (I think), after zoning into the PoK from Gunthak.  Scanned my logs for a cast message, didn't see one.  Zoning again fixed it... wtf kind of bug is this?  <br />
<br />
I tried the /face, said I couldn't use this command while under an illusion... interesting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Angebleu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I still auto-stand when I cast a spell. Check your option window and turn &quot;allow auto-stand&quot; as up.<br />
<br />
I have been a male wood elf at some point tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Meriboh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">PoK on all PvP servers were set to PvP-enabled.<br />
This was a safe zone for everyone.<br />
Lots of crying going on from the good team in the Bazaar; which seems to be a safe zone still.<br />
Evil team is now controlling this zone  :)  No free rides for anyone.<br />
……………<br />
<br />
Looks like all PvP servers are coming down for an emergency patch…<br />

Hahahahah.. That is awesome.<br />
<br />
TZ is in PvP mode now too heh...  Too bad they just took the servers down.  I was having fun suprising people who weren't paying attention.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You still autostand when casting a spell when sitting, autostand while FD from casting a spell is now disabled.  There was never autostand from fd by pressing forward.  Hitting a spell gem that wasnt refreshed never caused autostand from fd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Vyrion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Shroud of Chaos still broken =(</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Derraj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">so, how does this patch rate on how close they came to perfection?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">How far can you go negative? -10 maybe?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Androsulach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Any guesses on how many more patches it'll take to smooth the 7/14 patch issues out?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Derraj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">was reading some other class boards, some mobs are able to zone aswell. I'm betting my account, that EQ will be completely destroyed the next time they patch.</div></div><hr />
