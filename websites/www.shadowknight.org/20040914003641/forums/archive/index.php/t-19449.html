but I figured I would create a whole topic for it.<br />
<br />
This is generally a query as to who would sign a petition for increasing the drops on the decrepit hide? Much the same as the clerics did for their epic (white scale).<br />
<br />
Please post below if you would be interested in signing this petition and lets see how we go.<br />
<br />
Give a yay or nay (or yes/no :P)</div></div><hr />

SK's are all about hate and suffering.  The pure definition of the epic.  Want an easy epic?  Go make a beastlord.  Want an epic that means something? STFU and camp Hate.</div></div><hr />

You must be looking for a clue, I wasn't looking for love, I was looking for votes on a poll, not people opinions on love and how many sk's are assholes ;)<br />

People make the chars not vice versa.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if thats the case then im glad you spent hours in hate, and then come here bitching about the drop rate.  You even petitioned it ;p now it dont benefit you its not as cool, eh?<br />
<br />
Mark me down, i havent hunted for it for a while but the time sink is ridiculous for a weapon like this, not to mention all the other crap you have to farm on top of this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The easiest way to tell the old school SK players from the new twinks is by whether or not they have their epic.<br />
<br />
(I know its not  perfect system, but i have yet to see a n00b fucktard with an epic, though I have heard rumors of them.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
That sounds like a challenge if I ever heard one. :D<br />
<br />
To be a newb Fucktard with epic that is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I know a newb fucktard with an epic... in like 8 playdays (something like 2 or 3 weeks RL) he got lvl 60, elemental flagged, and epiced, both Inny's Curse and Greenmist, along with quite a few other nice long involved quest items. It pissed the hell out of me; I've only been playing a year, I know that i'm still a newb fucktard, but at least i'm a newb fucktard that worked for what shit i have.</div></div><hr />

<br />
By their own stats, we have the hardest quest to do.  Look at how many SKs have completed the Epic compared to the other classes.  If ours was easy as they think it is, our numbers for completed quests would be much higher.<br />
<br />
Heck, Beastlords are just below us and they are a much newer class.  That shows that either the quest is too hard or we are too lazy....and we arent lazy....if we were, we would be Wizards....*sit and nuke and sit and nuke*<br />

  <br />
<br />
<br />
White scale is not a cleric epic drop, and what the clerics petitioned wasn't a drop rate, seeing how every mob they kill is a guarantee drop, they petitioned the bottle neck camp of Ragefire, getting him to become a turn in, instead of a spawn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>^UGARK^</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Excuse my incorrect info then, couldn't remember the exact info as I'm not a cleric.<br />
<br />
Even a static three week spawn and a definate drop would be an improvement atm.<br />
<br />
Most people seem to have problems just getting people to hate ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Mandiin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I havent even started my epic and I say nay. Little blood sweet and camping never hurt anyone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>halcyonforever</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I got my hide just after 100 drakes.  I've even seen one rot becuase no SK was in zone and they were trying to bring one on to get it but too late.<br />
<br />
My problem was the drakes in Rathe Mountains.  I spent weeks killing drakes waiting for Rharzar to pop.  Soul Leach I eventually had to buy a MQ, couple shouts in PoK netted one.  Heck my guild picked on up for MQ last night.<br />
<br />
&quot;Respect is fine, but actually I've always wanted to be feared.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Amphitryon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">as much as the hide was a pain in the ass..i say Nein..nicht..nada, nyet<br />
<br />
i camped Hate, you camp Hate<br />
<br />
The SK epic is still one of the hardest quests in the game to complete and I want it left that way..getting that IC shows that you arent a wuss like a rogue or a BL<br />
<br />
it says, im a badass, i didnt power level, I diodnt ebay,i took the time to learn my class, and you can take that windblade and spin on on it!! I dont hink anything says &quot;imma REAL SK&quot; like a an IC and that means NO WUSSIFYING THE SK EPIC QUEST.<br />
<br />
and I speak as somone who has completed both the Greenmist and the IC quests and with those two weapons in hand, I really dont need anything else weapon wise..other stuff just isnt that big an improvement and I could care less about what weaps are needed in the Teir 3/4 planes because Ill never see them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>jergory</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Brave sir, well put.  I agree with you.  It's a hard quest and it is worth doing solely for the status that comes along with it.  Im at the point where all i need are the three rare drops, the BoAbbrogation, Soul Leech, and Decrepit Hide, then it's Lhranc time</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Covi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Woot! my post has been cross posted and feel I said something special.....I got IC at lvl 53 and to me, I beat the game....Leveling takes too long, I will stay at 59 and 1/8 PL my Alts (SK can PL pretty damn well) and could care less about getting 65...If I could pick and choose my own expansion I would keep the PoK books, luclin horse, and Kunark. <br />
<br />
As far as the poll of making the drop easier, IMO I would suggest  looking for that one SK that holds the record for Drake kills before he/she got the hide and make that a required number of kills before ya get the drop.<br />
<br />
That would balance out the hostility of those that spent a shitload of time in hate against those that were born with a 4-leaf clover growing out their ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>jergory</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">aye, increase drop rate, 214 drakes, no hides</div></div><hr />
