<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wuchie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As we well know Pallies get there slay undead aa,  I have been jealous of that aa skill forever.  I had an idea for an SK aa that would allow SK to get a little something extra from fighting undead.  We could have an aa that allowed us to lifetap on crits against undead.  Weather that life tap would be the amount of the crit or 4 times the crit would be left up to game designers.  Of course we would want that crit to fall in line with the excetpional heal aa too.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>draknorx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i thougth of a idea to modify ZB as a proc vs undead , call it deanimation or something like that , it would actually be a defensive ability vs undead like how the pally got the offensive ability vs undead . Some kinda 500 DD , 250 heal 125 mana or something to that nature .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">hehe im thinking solo toy though :). I was told a story once when pop came out zbite was bugged and it was a complete heal/mana regen for a few hours heard one of the uber sk's on at the time solo'd like 15aa in that time hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>DragonKnight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What would really be awesome is that since the pallies can have those kill spells against the dead (darkness). Us SKs should have something like that against the Light creatures :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Melkiah_SK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I like Dragonknights idea, something to use against the living but well probobly never see that.  What about sometype of undead slow or an ability to do up to twice the dmg from our lifetaps/melee vs undead.  Maybe even a damage reflection ability vs undead where we would take half the damage from undead melee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Drakonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I was thinking about that Decapitate someone mentioned a while ago... a reformed idea on that could be something like...<br />
<br />
Allow SKs to score heavy damage crits (not near Slay Undead, but higher than normal crits) against Living mobs when they get under say 20% or 15% hp.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, perhaps allow us the chance to perform a finishing blow on ANY mob under 5% HPs, regardless of level (requiring Coup De Grace 3 to train it)...<br />
<br />
Doubt we'll see either of them but its an interesting thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Stud Gnome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">slay undead is mainly just a solo toy, so we should get somethin sweet like it for soloing too :0</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Maniacles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I guess it's my turn to quash this...This has been discussed.<br />
<br />
Of the ideas:<br />
<br />
The bad:<br />
slay living: too many as a percentage.<br />
Extra lifetap? hello, we already get that.<br />
<br />
The Ugly:<br />
Undead expertise (extra defense vs undead):Not worth the outcry by warriors<br />
<br />
The Good:<br />
Slay clergy:  limited, but those limited situations are exactly when you'd want it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Silence</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i never thought people would like that slay clergy idea as much... itd be awesome to see it put in but i doubt they'd do it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Loneshadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">give us an AA or spell that helps us land our spells or something, called something like corruption or whatever, that lowers disease resistance significantly or makes our spells unresistable for an amount of time or something,or vs undead../shrug. just an idea :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Aelali</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Everyone has been saying that slay undead 3 is a solo toy, and rightly so we should be one as well, so how about finding a way to allow Fear to land on things that are too high lvl to fear (immune to fear because they are over the lvl limit for the spell, and not because they are generally imune to it). I also have read that many people enjoy using fear as an agro device, so why not an AA that could &quot;turn on&quot; and &quot;turn off&quot; our ability to fear higher lvl thing ? That would give us a nice solo toy...<br />
<br />
Well, just an idea ...</div></div><hr />

NPCs being immune to Fear is such a croc. I am L65 and I am not immune to Fear! If mobs over L55 are immune, I should be too. I shouldn't have to wait till L59 and spend 24 points to buy the Fearless AA. Either that or NPC's should just be able to be Feared, either with a higher level spell or something... I prefer the latter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Drakonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Fear being level capped is good atm, its one of the only good agro spells I use anymore...<br />
<br />
As for Slay Clergy, assuming it means to allow Slay Undead type crits against Cleric mobs (or any healer mob for that matter) it would be a great idea... limited, but useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Aelali</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Well, maybe I should explain my idea a bit more. If we had an AA that would effect fear then I think it should be one that we could use to turn &quot;on&quot; or &quot;off&quot; fear's ability to land on higher lvl NPCs.<br />
<br />
So, for example, you want to fear kite, so you hit the hot key made for that ability, and now your fear spells will effect them. If you want to use fear as an agro spell, then hit the ability again and the spell no longer would effect NPC that now are immune to fear because of their lvl. They of course would have to work in a refresh time (hopefully very small) between when you turn it off and when you turn it on, but basically my idea is to be able to toggle it as you want it... with the ability staying in effect until you turn it off. Basically an on off switch for fearing higher lvl NPCs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Drakonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Interesting idea, but it won't happen for one simple reason unfortunately... Fear isn't intended to be an agro spell.  So if this AA was created, it would permanatly allow you to fear NPCs with it... turning it on and off would only allow a use which isn't meant to be there in the first place.  Of course, if the Terror line generated agro as much as Fear, I'd have no objection at all to Fear working on higher level mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Supersk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">IMO i think sk's should also get a inate invis since it seems most other class's who have a self invis have one.  Necro's get inate ITU ranger's get inate camo i think us gettin inate invis would be cool</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Dragantis Xy`Rath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I think the idea of an AA that lets you fear high level mobs is awesome...I mean for crying out loud...we are Dread Lords....we use intimidation as a tool to gain advantages in war. We are the single most feared entity that can wield a sword in the game....but a level 55 fire beetle doesn't bat an eyelash when I start casting on his ass....WTH is up with that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Drakonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Same logics as why we should be more inclined to use CoL instead of BSS.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately EQ's roleplaying dosen't go much beyond spells because it's hard to keep a game balanced at the same time.  Being able to fear higher level mobs would make us too powerful (in the devs's eyes at least) and at the same time, remove one of our best agro spells...</div></div><hr />

You know your scary, you've mastered the evil look, cultured the ultimate bad mutha attitude, parents tell their children stories about you to keep them good, the townsfolk close all the shutters and bolt all the doors when you ride into town, unfortunately for you a fire beetle no matter how high a level it is has barely enough intelligence to think of you as tinned food and nothing more.</div></div><hr />

Increase our proccing rate against undead by whatever factor is balanced...</div></div><hr />
