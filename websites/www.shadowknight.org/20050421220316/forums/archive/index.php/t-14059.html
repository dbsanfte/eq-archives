Can someone tell me what the respawn time is for the Shattered Blade of Rile.  Went into KC tonight, invis then invis to undead.  Got to box, not blade :P  Does it spawn x hours after server reset? Same question for when someone else grabs it how many hours to respawn.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

As for respawn on it, I haven't a clue.  I think the reason it's not mentioned is the area isn't heavily travelled that deep and it's not such a highly contested ground drop that people actually put it on a timer.<br />
<br />
If you happen to find out, post it in the Greenmist thread itself.  Might be useful to someone. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zzketza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I actually found out the rough respawn timer on this blade thanks to an assclown of a guildmate of mine.  In guildchat he suddenly links the shattered blade asking what it is for.. (bear in mind he is a smurf SK - 15 yrs old in RL), so I explain to him that it is for Greenmist, and I had been planning on going there that evening to pick it up myself (true, I had discussed such with friends not 30 minutes before).  He gloats a bit about having it, but no big deal I can wait out til it repops.<br />
<br />
Roughly 4 hours later he spams guildchat with the blade link AGAIN.  Apparently it had spawned within 3-4 hours of being picked up, and he destroyed the old one to pick up the new one, and felt the need to rub it in that he intentionally grabbed it again.  After dealing with his oh-so-entertaining job of fucking up my night, he became one of the few, the proud, the only guildmate on ignore.<br />
