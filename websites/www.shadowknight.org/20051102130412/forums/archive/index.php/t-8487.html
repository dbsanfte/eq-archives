<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SenkenRZ</div><div class="date">11-21-2002, 03:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK I don't whine much let alone post much but... I am sooo sick of EQ...I used to play EQ so hard core i dont think anyone could beat me, I woke up, played, ate (while playing), slept, played, etc,etc for a whole summer when EQ first came out, then I played and played... Kunark came.. I still played... Velious came out, my time decreased slightly (+high school), and now PoP comes out and I havent played EQ in a month... I knew this fact already but it really never set it.. YOU CANNOT BEAT EQ.  After listening to my friends tell me &quot;Tony, you've been playin a god damn game for 2-3 years, aren't you sick of it?&quot; I used to say No, I WANT MORE EQ, but now that PoP came out and im so far behind in my guild (emp key/ shards) i dont even feel like playing anymore. (eye break)<br />
<br />
What is with camping keys anyways? FOOK KEYS, I need to camp a key to be able to camp another key for a peice of armor thats in a gay place when sooner or later another expansion comes out with better gear where people can just zone in and loot.  All my work for nothing.  I read the message boards still, and it's interesting... But playing the game is retarded.  If you think about it in my eyes, you are playing a game that will never amount to knowing, it won't help you in life (unless you ebay) or the game turns into actual real life and you become this super bad ass character you have created which won't ever happen unless Jesus comes down and turns games into real life.<br />
<br />
I REPEAT: YOU CANNOT BEAT EQ, it beats you... Your money is spent monthly so that you can play a game, and things keep adding up... Expansions, upgrades of prices, the electric bills going up (which doesnt matter, i just said it). I'm not tryin to say people shouldnt play this game, cause it took a big chunk out of my life which i want back, but unless i have a time machine it wont happen... I played a character(S) on RZ for so long tryin to make my rep the best it can be... And now I see these faggots commin from Legends with better things than me when I worked hard to be among the best. Anyone can surpass you, anything can happen and get you banned.... With a single click of your mouse 3 years of your life can be banned by a retard that gets paid 1 dollar an hour (i dont know the actual price).  3 years of your life you won't ever get back. <br />
<br />
In conclusion,  I hate you Everquest.<br />
<br />
 btw, i know i wrote a lot and you prolly dont care, but i had to tell someone, ITS BEEN BUILDING UP<br />
FLAME IT<br />

<br />
But to me... it just adds a kind of escape function key to my life... for the past two weeks I have ben waking up at 5:30am... working until 3pm... going to school until 8:30pm... working on a design project until 1am... and repeating... and I am totally spent.<br />
<br />
Which is why I made a SK... for those days you just want to escape... slap a 2HS in your big, green hands, and run around and kill whatever crosses your path...<br />
<br />
In EQ I can be who I want to be... I can be a PO'd, evil, mysterious Troll if I want... running through a noob gnome zone pointing at all the tiny people.  Or I can play my shammy and be nice all day long... it's just a nice release.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry to hear what happened to you... and I just wanted to share my limited experience.  I just hope everyone doesn't leave EQ when it starts getting good for me... the networking makes this truly unique and a great experience (this is my first MMORPG if you couldn't tell :) )<br />
<br />
Blabber blabber... I just wanted to reply because I thought you needed a hug.<br />

The folks here in the Flames forum are here for you, bro. :)<br />
<br />
The fact is, EQ DOES have an ending, we just don't know what it is yet, or how it will come to be, but EQ will &quot;end&quot; one day. <br />
<br />
Lots of folks will play right up until the plug is pulled. Others will cease playing along the way. <br />
<br />
If you are looking for the &quot;boss mob&quot; that you meet, and beat, and you get a nice screen shot saying &quot;The End&quot;... no, you probably won't see that in EQ. <br />
<br />
But you are EverQuesting, throughout Norrath and beyond, and the ride isn't over until the system is eventually shut down. ;)<br />

When I bought it, I thought cool! Never-ending game! This be what I need! But, Yeah, EQ is a scam, no denying that. Just a ploy to make money. (and a shit load of it too). But hey, if you no wanna play, don't. Sell your account on ebay and try to get some reimbursement for all the time you spent. It's what I plan on doing when it gets horrendously boring</div></div><hr />

I can't think of a game that could hold my attention like EQ does for 4 months (actually I play on Stormhammer, so it'd be a month, but most games don't even last me that long unless they are exceptionally what I want and the chaff takes less than a month to separate out).  Therefore EQ is a cheaper leisure time activity that other computer games.  I'd be really suprised if $13 ($40) of books would last me a month, it's cheaper than cable, and way cheaper than a good dinner out.<br />
<br />
I don't think of EQ as something to be beat, but a way to waste time enjoyably.  For that, it's got great bang for the buck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aaoogaa Soulhunter</div><div class="date">11-22-2002, 12:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its a game.  Its a social game.  The point of playing is to have fun meeting and talking to other people from other places.  If you cannot control yourself in playing it then maybe its not for you.  It is there to provide a bit of entertainment, nothing more.  I laugh at the pathetic souls that play this game for other than the social aspects.  The real losers are the people that actually spent money on Ebay to purchase virtual items for a game.  <br />
<br />
Yeah, EQ is a scam, no denying that. Just a ploy to make money. (and a shit load of it too).  <br />
<br />
EQ is not a ploy its a product.  The goal of any good business is to come up with a product to make money.  SOE has done just that /cheer them.  Noone is making you pay them to play their game.</div></div><hr />

Any product in the market is. It's not like anything in this day in age was released to make the world a better place. Humans care about no one other than family and friends. They don't care about anything else or than self gratifacation. It's how its been forever. If it's a disc comp game and you need more online fees, it's a scam..a damned good one, but a scam none the less. If you aren't that way...you sure are suppressing instinct</div></div><hr />

VI is not a scam.<br />
<br />
<br />
Noone promised you something that you didn't get. What happened was, you went to a game store (online or in the mall), bought a computer game called 'Everquest', and then agreed to pay $12.95 a month (used to be $9.95) to play the game. Noone forced you to buy Everquest. Noone forced you to sign up a credit card so that you could play online. And certainly noone forced you to create a character and run around in that virtual world.<br />
<br />
It's a business transaction. You agree to pay them to play every month, they agree to provide the service (the game) and the support (fixing things that get broken). <br />
<br />
Now, to the original poster:<br />
<br />
Most people that play EQ do it for the VERY reasons you said you hate the game. I, for one, am sorry that you feel you wasted so much time playing. So, are you saying you didn't enjoy the time you played? You say that you spent so much money and time playing a game that you will never get back, but that;s the case in EVERY kind of entertainment! <br />
Go to the movies, go to a concert, buy a nice dinner, buy a drink in a bar, go on a trip to Disneyland (or summer vacation)...all these things cost money that you will NEVER get back! DOING those things is time spent that you will NEVER get back! If you want to spend money on something that you WILL get something back, invest in real estate or something. Entertainment is just that; there to entertain you.<br />
<br />
I think playing EQ is great in regards to what you put into it. Even buying all the expansions, that's about $90 (buying the trilogy, Luclin, and PoP). Then you spend $12.95 a month. That's $155.76 a year, for a total of $245.76. Now, if you play an average of 3 hours a day (average for a casual gamer) that's 1095 hours of playing. That is only $.22 an hour! Where else are you going to get that kind of entertainment?!? You're not. And if you don't have a full time job, that means you probably have even more time to play than 3 hours a day.<br />
<br />
Anyway, if you don't enjoy playing, THEN QUIT! Just give away all your gear and plat and go find something else to waste your time on!<br />
<br />
That's all I have to say about that...</div></div><hr />

I just play eq now, $12.95 a month...I save quite a bit :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PlatPhoenix</div><div class="date">11-23-2002, 10:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">EQ saps your life more than television how, exactly?<br />
<br />
But TV is an acceptable form of entertainment. Nevermind those people that freak when they miss an episode of the Sopranos, or General Hospital. Nevermind the fact that EQ is, from the start, 100% fantasy-based and TV tends to have documentaries that are more disturbing than any fiction we can make.<br />
<br />
Whoever said it (I don't much care who you were) was right, entertainment is a money-burner. But have you ever seen workaholics? They get fried out at about age 35 or so. And no entertainment = workaholoic, because in reality, what else is there in life? Work, eating, sleeping, sex, and empty time. <br />
<br />
I play EQ to fill the empty time. I have a full time job, a fiancee, a nice apartment and a new car. Yes, my fiancee hates EQ, but at least she knows where I am. Could be screwing some other woman, but no, I'm playing EQ<br />
<br />
In short, quit your bitchin'. SoE and Veriant were pretty damned smart to make such a legally addicting product. I quit twice, and I'm sure anyone else can quit if they really want to as well. It's called uninstalling EQ. <br />
<br />
No matter how you look at it, your life will never look good when you're in a bad mood, and the only people really whining about EQ aren't playing anymore. We have this thing called free will. Free will to bitch, free will to tell whiners to piss off, and free will to play or not play EQ as we wish<br />
<br />
-d'Arnaxx<br />
<br />
P.S.; and I agree, EQ is cheaper than most other forms of entertainment. Whats your budget look like now that you quit? Fucktard<br />
<br />
P.P.S.; Jinsei, you need to shut the Hell up about that human nature shit. I'm the only one with a license to be a hypocrite. You don't do things for self gratification I suppose?</div></div><hr />

I'm also tired of people ranting about a friggin video game. It's obvious to me you still have no life, if you have enough time to rant like that on this board (yes, I admit to having no life, and I don't care).<br />
<br />
Shut up, get a life, and move on. And I doubt anyone that actually plays EQ will argue with me on this point: if you quit, then you lost all right to bitch about the game. So piss off<br />

Don't give him some bullshit about &quot;if you don't play anymore, you can't bitch about EQ&quot;. He has the same right to bitch about the game as you do. He has played it, and obviously for a long while too. Just because he thinks it sucks and doesn't play it anymore, he shouldn't say it sucks? I fail to see the logic in that. <br />
<br />
He didn't come here and say &quot;You all must quit EQ now! It's the Devil!&quot; He expressed his opinion of the game right now. It sounds like to me that he got banned from EQ and maybe he wants to vent. That is what this damned thread is for.. read the title &quot;Releasing my stress&quot;, not &quot;YOU MUST STOP EQ NOW!&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm also tired of people ranting about a friggin video game. <br />
<br />
Seems like you did this pretty well in this thread. (http://forums.shadowknight.org/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=8563) And if people didn't rant about a video game, then this board wouldn't exist and you'd have nothing to fill all of your empty time with. I guess you'd just stare at a wall or something, because after all, ranting about a video game is stupid, huh?</div></div><hr />

I can rant on whatever I want, because I was a shadowknight.  If I stop playing eq I must stop posting?  And you are correct you are a loser.  I rant so much on this board I have worked up a total of 12 posts (All rants, right?). You said yourself you quit twice, and yet your still here bitching at people(me) who bitch about eq. I posted this thread to let everyone know how much I hate eq, did i ever say &quot;YOU PEOPLE SHOULD QUIT EQ RIGHT NOW BECAUSE I DID&quot; No, you fucking dipshit.  My budget, it's still the same because I'm a 10 year old child who USED to sit at home playing game as his parents paid for it.  You want me to get a life?  How about rather than let your pretty fingers talk for you bitching at people who are just tryin to release some stress that a game caused them, you go take your fiancee out for a nice dinner, or go to work since you work full time, or clean your nice apartment, or maybe you can wash your nice new car, rather sit at home on computer and call yourself a loser? Oh wait... Sometimes, people lie.  I have one million dollars in my pocket, i'll pay you to drink my big warm glass of SHUT THE FUCK UP, ok?</div></div><hr />

<br />
-both involve hours and hours of sitting. <br />
<br />
-TV has you sitting, not moving, just watching<br />
<br />
-Games have you sitting, moving your hands, and interacting. <br />
<br />
-some TV shows have good stories. some games have good stories. the games, however, let you live the story, or something make up your own.<br />
<br />
-TV is a good excuse to invite friends over. <br />
<br />
games (like EQ) allow you to make new friends, albeit online ones. friends are friends though.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall I think Games just make your mind work more than TV. And personally, they are just more damn fun. Id rather feel like im doing something than just watch things happen. cept for porn. some of that crap is better seen then attempted. unless you have a good chiropractor. but i digress.<br />

Now for you Plat, guess what? On Sunday, i logged on Everquest for a total of 10minutes, so I guess I can bitch now because I still play...I guess all your rambling is worthless since one of your main topics is how people who don't play eq can't bitch. I'm a play-a, oh and my wife is also into a weird thing which FORCES me to play, when shes on the other comptuer sitting next to me looking up (http://www.heptune.com/poop.html) I get my chance to play eq. I love it.  Right now I'm at my job(sit-at-home-care-taker) so I have so much free time.<br />

Why the FUCK did you say 'Jesus loves us all'? How does that pertain to anything on this thread? Hell, how does it pertain to this board at all?<br />

Ah, and your initial statement about me being downsized. Well, downsizing can only happen when one has an ego to be bruised. I don't much care if you like me, hate me, or have no care at all. Talking about EQ is dandy. Telling people how much it sucks, is not. If we want to play, we'll play, and we don't need little Hershey squirt's like you getting uppity about it<br />
<br />
There will be those that love Everquest. There will be those that hate it. Those that love it, or tolerate it, feel free to say anything you want. Those that hate it, go to EQAnon or whatever EQ support group there is (yes, they exist, sadly) and bitch there. I know I don't want to hear you, and I doubt anyone does<br />

If you smoked cigarettes all day everyday for a whole summer, you'd be sick<br />

If you drank 40's all day everyday for a whole summer, you'd be an alcoholic and a bum<br />

If you had sex all day everyday for a whole summer, you'd have back and hip problems<br />

Sounds like you need a well deserved break from video games in general heh..<br />

It always seems to turn up when one can't really argue very well. I find this interesting because it's rarely said verbally, simply because theres so many gay people these days doing so would surely get ones ass kicked<br />

Senken, do me a favor and go away. You no longer amuse me.<br />

<br />
&quot;Me saying &quot;Jesus loves us all&quot;, if you had a sense of humor it was suppose to be funny. But i guess your assuming it's not suppose to be here, just like all your gay posts about people not being able to bitch on a board that is titled &quot;Flame On&quot;. Is there a certain definition for &quot;Flame On&quot; that I am missing? And as for me going EQanon, I am the leader of the &quot;Flamers Aganist Everquest&quot; aka FAEQ. You might have heard of us marching outside the White House approx. 3 months and 18 days ago. We held signs that said &quot;Stop the EverCRACK&quot;, etc. If you say you do not care about me or what I say, please tell me why you keep clicking on this link and responding to my thread. Can you answer that for me Sir Dumbfuck? Prolly not because you are a loser. Step back from the computer and ask yourself &quot;Why am I fighting a 16 year old kid on the computer over the game? Why am I so gay?&quot; You will find both answers ... ----&gt; up your ass (_o_)&quot;<br />
<br />
There are 5 questions in that paragraph... You have successfully answered = 0.<br />
<br />
The only thing you can say back is how I shouldn't say the word &quot;gay&quot;? Did you actually read my post, because I know you did since you know I wrote the word gay in it.  Did you answer my questions, or you just sit there and call yourself a loser again?<br />
<br />
Heres a question taken out of text, so maybe your retarded ass can understand.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you say you do not care about me or what I say, please tell me why you keep clicking on this link and responding to my thread. &quot; <br />
<br />
*Note for your retard ass: There is no question mark, but you sure can answer it.<br />
<br />
*enken<br />
<br />
P.S. Maybe I don't amuse you is because everytime I post, I prove you wrong, and it just kills you not to be able to chew out a sixteen year old on a comptuer over a game... Because after all... <br />
