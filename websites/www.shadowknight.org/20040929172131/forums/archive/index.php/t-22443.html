<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Eatpeople</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just did an LDON raid. Butcherblock.  A Pally and me traded MT Duties.  When all was done, I look at my Yalp, and the Pally's Slay Undead (it says Cleansing Blow in Yalp) added 20 ADPS!<br />
<br />
I know we want to lessen the Warrior gap, but am I the only one who thinks this AA ability is pretty darn overpowered?????  What is the SK comp to this??I read this site every day, and don't hear any chatter about this.<br />
<br />
Jealous and Pissed, for a change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Viserys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well it does have very limited applications.<br />
<br />
A counter to that would be 'Slay Living' which would have very wide applications.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tukka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">We get pets... 12-17 ADPS when hasted with Augmentation of Death according to Yalp.  Would be more DPS with a mage muzzle and enchanter haste.  We also get better damage inflicting spells, even against undead unless I'm wrong, via the Scythe line.  Also, with SA3, and especially with SCF3, I'm pretty sure our innate proc buffs produce more damage than theirs.  This (aside from the Scythe line) applies to virtually all mobs, not just undead.<br />
<br />
Granted, pets and spells require more effort devoted to them to keep them in the fight at maximum damage inflicting potential, and spells cost mana to cast, which is a limited resource.  But DPS is DPS.<br />
<br />
I was pretty envious of those occasional enormous undead crits too, but really, if 20 ADPS is all they're getting out of SU, I'm not really that bothered by it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thenger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">This issue isn't stated on the boards because, well it's old.  Yes it's a wonderful ability that the Pal's get, but that's one of their AA's, and we need to get used to it.  In most cases Pal/SK are in the same boat with alot of things, and I really don't mind their slay undead ability.<br />
<br />
At this point, I have found my place in the game, and I know when OoW comes out, we will redefine our role again, as we always do with a new expansion.  I am happy that I can off tank on GoD raids if need, help with pulls, and feel that I am usefull. <br />
<br />
Ofcourse this amounts to the equipment we have, but this is EQ, and lets face it this game deals a huge deal about equipment.<br />
<br />
So as for Slay Undead, let them have it and we have our own abilities as well.  Don't be jealous, we can do alot that they can't and vice versa.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You do know what the Scythe line is correct?  Why don't you check out the type of DPS that adds to us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vaclav</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Assuming you're only loading one and the land for max all the time (which they of course won't, -50 MR should reasonably often though, no? [I don't find undead often could be way off]) and no focus or crits - about 30 DPS from just the L64 Scythe.<br />
<br />
Next one down is like 18 DPS under same conditions, and the weakest one is 12 DPS.<br />
<br />
So assuming you would load all three, never zist (unlikely I know), never crit and not have a focus - about 60 DPS vs. undead with a manacost.<br />
<br />
That seems substantial vs. 20 DPS manaless for Pallies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm deciding between getting a 40 hp aug, a scythe of innoruuk, or a 75 hp lifetap aug next.  Already have 4 x 10 ac augs, 150 dd cold aug, and the +50 atk spell.  This makes me think the scythe might be the way to go since it would help speed up the exp vs undead and help earn additional augs faster.<br />
<br />
-Bolas</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tukka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Scythe of Innoruuk and Call of Darkness were the first things I bought in LDoN.  Haven't bothered with any of the augs yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Eatpeople</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Fucking Brael. Goddam uselesshybrid.  Gonna go blow some LDON point on that spell now.  You owe me them back!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Vekanos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Brael,<br />

You have tits in your background; but it's still funny as hell.</div></div><hr />
