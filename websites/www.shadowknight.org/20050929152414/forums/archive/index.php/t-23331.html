<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Silvershadow</div><div class="date">10-23-2004, 10:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">How often do you use aura of pain and under what circumstances? I'm curious as to how useful a tool this is viewed as by the SK community. I mem it when I know I'll be tanking something challenging, like a boss mob or going to MPG or some such (which is challenging to me at least).<br />
<br />
Extra AC is always good, mostly curious to see if higher-tier SK's (I'm only doing VT and other pre-elemental stuff yet) still use this regularly or not I guess, or if they consider it a waste of spell slot/buff slot because they have so much AC already?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">window</div><div class="date">10-23-2004, 11:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">any time i'm tanking i use theft of pain.<br />
<br />
theft of pain: 260 damage, 75 mana, -50 resist check. 3.4666 damage/mana ratio.<br />
spear of muram: 928 damage, 312 mana, 0 resist check modifier. 2.974 damage/mana ratio.<br />
<br />
the pain spells are more mana efficient as simply nukes than our spears... its really dumb to not use them any time you are tanking.</div></div><hr />

Just got to be careful not to cast it as the mob is dieing sucks waiting 72 seconds to recast it cuz you cast it on a corpse. Normally this is the 3rd spell i cast each mob. first 2 being cd(festering) then fear. Then just replace it everytime it gets near dropping.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Silvershadow</div><div class="date">10-23-2004, 04:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for your replies, glad to hear it is as useful (and used) as I thought it was.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Naelyan</div><div class="date">10-23-2004, 06:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So what you're saying is that if there is an SK in-game that I know, and he told me he never even mem's this &quot;useless&quot; (as he calls it, cuz his AC is already good, 1600 unbuffed :confused: ) spell, that he is stupid?<br />
<br />
P.S. It is in the list with Death Peace (no AA yet) and Zbite which never leaves my spell list. It is one of the spells I cast every mob, without fail.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, that's what I told him. He laughed at me. Then I laughed at him when two mobs later he died.... but oh well, can't help the stupid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
haha, I do that regularaly, I try to get it off in time for the next mob coming so I have that extra AC at the start of the fight when I really need it... always end up wasting it :(. Anyways, if you havent gathered yet, its a great spell, always in my spell line up.<br />

I can use (need) all the AC I can get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Croix VorAbaddon</div><div class="date">10-26-2004, 05:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use Aura of Pain almost constantly, though there are a few situations where I might not:<br />
<br />
A) My buffs slots are already full. This includes saving any room for HoT or DoT's as needed. I'm hoping to avoid this annoyance by getting the AA buff slots, but have a few other AA's I want first.<br />
<br />
B) I'm stuck with a bard who insists on twisting in Selo's while not pulling. I hate this and wind up clicking it off constantly, but if they continue to do so, it's not worth the risk of filling up on buff slots and missing a HoT. If I still have the buff slots, I'll still use it.<br />
<br />
C) Raiding when I'm not tanking. And even then, I'll cast it as soon as I notice it's refreshed, though I'm not as vigilant as when I'm tanking. This is assuming that point A isn't already the case.<br />
<br />
However, always keep it memmed, as it can be a lifesaver.<br />
<br />
One question further on this subject though: Does Aura of Pain block any other buffs? I know that Torrent of Fatiuge's recourse supposedly blocks Avatar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maicom</div><div class="date">10-27-2004, 08:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">AoPain/theft recourse is good enough that you should click off one of your other buffs to make room for it, if slots are an issue for you...</div></div><hr />

Here is a list (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/stacking.html?id=3404&amp;source=Live) of all the spells that don't stack with Aura of Pain. As you can see, they all suck compared to AoP, besides Theft of Pain, so.. no.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">senor sperro</div><div class="date">11-02-2004, 10:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">about how much AC does it add?  and it does affect group like our hate spell?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arikash</div><div class="date">11-02-2004, 10:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">like 150-200ish intially, then it decays from there over however much time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Airemus</div><div class="date">11-02-2004, 11:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aura/theft of pain only affects you. Aura/theft of hate is the one that affects the whole group. As far as how much, theft is pretty close to 200, i had 1700ish ac, and it would go up over 1900 with ToP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Syfon</div><div class="date">11-03-2004, 02:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Theft of Pain means I tank with 2200 AC instead of 2k. I cant speak as to how much that truly helps (the mobs in MPG still beat me down like a bitch) but it makes me feel better at least  :D <br />
<br />
I love that spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zenlan</div><div class="date">11-03-2004, 10:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i also use it everytime the gem pops while i'm tanking.. it can make a noticable difference in certain situations otherwise i keep it going as a 'just in case' or to keep it going as habbit~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sesshou</div><div class="date">11-03-2004, 10:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe that Aura of Pain is somewhere in the 140ish AC range initially, and decays a bit down to around 100 before it wears off.  Certainly well worth using against any enemy that will give you exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brael</div><div class="date">11-03-2004, 10:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">AoP is 136 over time.</div></div><hr />
