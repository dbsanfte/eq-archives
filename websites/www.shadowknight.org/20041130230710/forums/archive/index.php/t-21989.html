<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Asegai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have discovered the beauty of xping in Kurn's tower as a SK.  My party wiped because our fearless Barbarian leader/puller.  Pulled a train on me, the tank, then ran away when he realized our danger. (He was also the highest lvl, 14)  He and the monk both disbanded leaving me, the bard and the cleric to get our bodies by ourselves.  I hit my new favorite spell, Invis to undead, and got my corpse then drug the other two to the secret room.  The retrieved their corpse and we grouped for another our getting me to lvl 13 and them to 11.  Now I know not to group with a certain bezerker, but in exchange I have a bard and a cleric on my friends list.  I'll take that trade!<br />
<br />
Question:  I want to stay here awhile.  I know paludal can be a little better, but invis for corpse runs can't be beat in a dungeon.  Can I stay here to about 18 when I can do bandits in Paludal?  Is it worth it loot wise?<br />
<br />
I am untwinked and have crap for weapons and gear. I have not done and will not do the Erudite newbie quests because I have wasted hours not getting any calcified bones.  However I do have a ac 15 chest piece and ac 10 helmet.  IS THIS PLACE GOOD FOR PLAT AND DROPS!  <br />
<br />
ARE THERE REAVER WEAPONS AT THIS LEVEL I SHOULD TRY TO GET?<br />
<br />
What are the loot rules?  In groups there is no sharing.  People just grab loot whether need it or not.  Usually its worse with newer players here on Stromm because older players don't need loot as much.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>BullMarkOne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Straigh up, Kurns was my fav zone as an SK. If you push it you can make 20 in kurns, but at that point yer hunting almost nothing but light-blue. Loot is fairly decent imho.. save them bone chips, and sell them on bazaar during your downtime. Check what the going rate is and set yourself a little below that. <br />
<br />
If you have the expansion you might want to consider LDoN for experience. I just found out that the level to do them was lowered to 15.. Makes me feel like an idiot for believing the manuals and waiting till 20. <br />
<br />
For a somewhat slower alternative to Paludal at lvl 18 you could try soloing in Overthere. Dunno if erudite SK's are KOS in the populated area, but if not merchants and bank in same zone is always nice.  The pok book is in a safe-ish spot. Stick to the northeast area. Killing rhino's, Tigers, Succulents and Cockatrices. Most of these have a semi-common drop that sells to vendors for about a plat. Sarnak are ok for xp too, but loot sucks. Fear kiting is pretty viable on any of these.<br />
<br />
Can't help ya much after that since at 20, I've been almost exclusively LDoN, with the occasional side trip to farm plat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gordrach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">At your current level, Befallen would also be a good choice.  The place is crawling with undead, and has a very nice xp bonus also.  You'll need to obtain some keys (dropped in Befallen); check EQAtlas.com for a map and an explanation the keys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Satist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My personal preference was Kurn's until 20.  The bonechips you collect will take you a very long way.  I think I still have around 2 full backpacks full in the bank.<br />
   <br />
   At 20, you can either head to Paludal, or to LDoN, PC will only take you to 26-28, and LDoN can take you to 65.  The advantage of PC over LDoN is that you don't have to look for a group in PC.  You can just solo along one side or the other.  Loot is decent, with bronze ringmail and bronze weapons dropping.  I stayed in PC until 27, soloing one of the bandit camps from 22 to 27. (but you can group for them, but xp will go way down at 24, grouped, but is still decent).<br />
<br />
   Then you can go to the Feerot (sp) and do the lizard camps (solo or group), or to Warsliks to work golras (solo), or to SK (solo or group) to work on gnolls, any of these will take you to 30, and all 3 of these have decent loot...  (up to 5pp, and most weapon drops are fs).<br />
<br />
   At 30, you can head into Split Paw (solo or group), which can take you to 35, perhaps higher. (don't go past the double doors, without a full group, and a mezzer)   Or, you can go to Butcher (beware the dorf guards)  to the crazed goblin camp (solo camp only), which is 3 spawn, single pull, and can take you to 39 (the last level about half the spawns are green/light blue, but it's an easy camp, so I stuck with it until 39, using a ranger, and going toe to toe with the mobs.  they only hit for a max of 90) with loot drops of up to 5pp, and perhaps some small ringmail, and/or a fs dagger.  Also, at 30, there is the Overthere, and, for soloing/group, hit Timorous Deep. for the golras on the island in the south east corner, I think.  If you do these golras, stay away from the named one (starts with a H, I think).<br />
<br />
   All of this will easily get you to 39, with enough money to get halfway decently outfitted, but, also keep in mind, most of this is solo.<br />
<br />
   If you want to continue soloing, you can head to &quot;Sol B&quot;, also known as Nagafen's Lair, and work the window room, and perhaps, the pool room, also.  XP is quite good here, but takes a major drop at 45.  :(   Again, up to 5pp, plus fs.  You can take your group here, as well.<br />
<br />
   At 45-50 you can head to the Dreadlands, and either pick up a group, or make one.  Either way, when I was here, we were chain pulling, and I was averaging a level about every 4 hours, right up until I dinged 50.<br />
<br />
   As far as this problem you are having with people just grabbing loot, and not sharing, set up a loot order, alphabetical works good, or you can go by level, low to high, or high to low, and request that the other party members turn on the loot split.  On top of that, familiarize yourself with some/most of the &quot;rare&quot; drops in the area you are hunting, and roll for them, most groups I've been in just do a /ran 100, with either the high roller or the low roller being the winner.<br />
<br />
  As was mentioned earlier, an alternate route is to do mainly LDoN's, but with that, you are faced with trying to find a group.  If you play odd hours like I do, a lot of times you are better off going to a normal group xp spot, or going to solo.  (There have been times I've waited for up to 2 hours for a group, and then said screw it, and went to solo.)<br />
<br />
   Enough of my ramblings.  As I said, this route will take you to 50, all of it grouped, or solo. your preference.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zakton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You can head to paludal as soon as you are 15 if you want, just don't tank.  After 17-18 you will be ok to tank.  Paludal is good up to 24 too.<br />
<br />
Edit:  If you ever plan to do Greenmist, LOIO is good place to go at 17.  Not sure what level the explorers give exp but might be around 17.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>kassdax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I pretty much solo'd in Kurns until 20th. Around 18th the xp slows down a bit but the stockpiles of bonechips makes it worth it (if you sell them in the bazaar).<br />
<br />
On Saryrn, it isn't too tough to get 20pp a stack for bone chips. Two backpacks full should get you enough money to gear yourself for a bit. With your new found wealth and gear you could go to East Karana and kill spiders with little to no downtime. Collect the silks from the spiders and sell them in the bazaar. Check your server prices, you might be surprised how much they go for (around 5pp each on Saryrn)<br />
<br />
Some of the lions and wolves will aggro you regardless of your level. When they do, just kill them and sell the pelts in the bazaar along with your silk. The lions and wolves will be green so the xp will come from the spiders. The little bit of extra plat from these skins though never hurts. East Karana would easily take you to 25th or so. It will also get you a couple thousand plat if you play the market right.<br />
<br />
I am untwinked and have crap for weapons and gear. I have not done and will not do the Erudite newbie quests because I have wasted hours not getting any calcified bones. However I do have a ac 15 chest piece and ac 10 helmet. IS THIS PLACE GOOD FOR PLAT AND DROPS! <br />
Kurns tower plat and drops are in selling the bone chips to higher level people that don't feel like farming them. There is also some rhinohide armor that you can wear and/or sell to vendors but you won't get rich off it.<br />
<br />
<br />
ARE THERE REAVER WEAPONS AT THIS LEVEL I SHOULD TRY TO GET?<br />
None that I'm aware of. For now you can probably just use whatever the best weapon you get to drop off a mob or your newbie weapon.<br />
<br />
What are the loot rules? In groups there is no sharing. People just grab loot whether need it or not. Usually its worse with newer players here on Stromm because older players don't need loot as much.<br />
Loot rules are usually decided at the beginning of a group session. I prefer the master looter set up. Master looting means one person is designated to loot everything for the group. When the group is ready to disband (or somebody is ready to leave but the group is going to stay together) the master looter divy's out equal shares of the loot gathered. Sometimes a master looter &quot;accidently&quot; goes link dead right before the loot is handed out. If they come back and pass around the loot, great. If they don't come back, add that person to a &quot;will not group with again&quot; list. From what you described though, it sounds like you have some loot happy ninja clickers. Over time you'll learn who loot happy and who isn't loot happy - group with people that have the same loot concepts as you do and the game will be more fun for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>yuggoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I love Kurns - I still go there when I need a bone chip refill.  It taught me the joy if trains :p<br />
<br />
Not a lot of loot there - the Iksar Berserker club off the Jester, and the icebone skellys can drop a nice wizzy wand both used to sell for lots and lots back in the day.  I remember killing Bargryn in the basement just so I could have some cool looking claws...  otherwise, not much.<br />
<br />
As has been said, sell the bone chips in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you stay until 18-20 in Kurns, get to know the Stables and get a IBC (Iksar berserkers club) Great weapon for the untwinked (hell my twinks have it) and it procs and over haste (short term haste that stacks with other haste and procs at least at 11 if not sooner).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Stattic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have played a lot of toons myself and I have a road map to My succes. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kilkulan Darkwarrior</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">hmmm I personaly LOVED Crystal Caverns<br />
<br />
if you stay up top you can kill Ry'gorr Orcs .. go at lvl 23ish<br />
<br />
the miners drop Velium ... which sells VERY nicely in the bazaar allong with sellable loot (once u kill enough orcs there is a city inside that you will become ally to and will be abl to sell stuff in)<br />
<br />
the watchmen drop: Ry'Gorr Chain Coif, Slot: HEAD  AC: +13 Str: +3 Magic Resist: +3 Mana: +15  <br />
<br />
and the herbalists will also drop loot you can pawn off in the bazaar or just to vendors...<br />
<br />
Inspector drops: Crystalline Belt, Slot: WAISTAC: +5 Wis: +3 Agi: +3 HP: +10 <br />
<br />
Velium weapons also drop here<br />
Velium Two Handed Sword: Damage: 12 Delay: 43 Effect of Velium Shards.. which is a  12 damage proc<br />
<br />
other velium weapons drop here and are sellable to merchants<br />
<br />
The formans might be a little tough BUTthere worth it...<br />
they both drop:<br />
 Foreman's Skull Cap: AC: +8 Str: +4 Dex: +2 Sta: +2 Cold Resist: +10 (works as lightsource)<br />
and Foreman Smason drops a sword that you can sell for 17pp each<br />
<br />
<br />
whatever you do DONT sell the velium.. buy a traders sachel or 2 and put them in your bank... the velium sells for 40pp (small peice) on Mith mar<br />
<br />
higher lvls will commonly camp orcs (I did at lvl 55 for loot) and you will be able to get some of the drops off the foreman.. if orcs are taken you can kill spiders just as easy they drop nice little silks that sell for decent PP also :D<br />
<br />
<br />
hope this helps.. and ejoy</div></div><hr />
