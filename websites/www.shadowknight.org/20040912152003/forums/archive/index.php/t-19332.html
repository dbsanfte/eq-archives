<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">/em raises his hand in a confused state...<br />
<br />
1) Why would warriors get shield specialization instead of SKs/ Pallies. The warriors are using duel wield or a 2 hander, why would they even equip a shield?<br />
<br />
2) It is nice that Pallies get Bash Damage, but shouldn't we get that one too?<br />
<br />
3) I am a little bummed we did not get a weapon affinity. :confused: <br />
<br />
I would gladly give up Recovery and Suspended Minion (even without knowing what they do completely) for a weapon affinity and bash damage! :) <br />
<br />
Oh, SOE, please hear my plea!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Saruton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">/em sees the hammer too.<br />
<br />
Yet i would love to know what recovery does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tumy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">WTF, no shield AA??<br />
<br />
not happy, realy realy realy hope theyadd it in there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">/em keeps forum minimized in anticipation of Brael's response. This should be good! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Warriors get shield spec, we get.... PET CRITS?!  15 aa's worth?!  That's fucked up.  That's gotta be the most awful return on your aa's ever... 5 levels of crits is gonna what, increase bony's dps by 2.5% or something stupid?  ie... like 1 dps.<br />
<br />
That... needs some tuning =p.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">As an Ogre I used to see myself as 75% Tank, 25% caster...with these AA's I think I will restate that to 60% Tank, 40% Caster. :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ganaith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Still, *what* is recovery, and why the fuck would i spend 15AA on it :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Nenadar W'Vern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Seems someone has posted more info on them here:<br />

Though that recovery doesn't sound useful for an SK unless by Elementals they mean pets -<br />
9293 Recovery<br />
9294 This ability imbues your elementals with the ability to land critical hits.<br />
<br />
9326 Packrat <br />

<br />
9187 Persistent Casting <br />

<br />
9163 Mastery of the Past<br />
9164 Must spend 6 points in the General Abilities. o Description: This ability makes it impossible for you to fizzle a spell or miss a note.

You may train in this ability once each level, upon reaching levels 62, 63, and 64. <br />
<br />
9191 Critical Affliction<br />

9193 Requirements: Must spend %1 ability points.<br />
<br />
9247 Death's Fury <br />

<br />
9299 Suspend Minion<br />
9300 This ability grants the summoner the ability to suspend and recall their existing pet at will, provided they remain in their current zone.

You may cast a second pet while your first pet is Suspended. You may train the first rank upon reaching level 62 and the second rank upon reaching level 64.<br />
<br />
9261 Intense Hatred<br />
9262 This ability intensifies the overall effect of damage shields that are cast on you. Additional ranks increase the effectiveness further.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Recovery is rumored to be a cross zone summon corpse, guild necros are saying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Deathfighter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Clairify the difference please?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Thack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">First of all, recovery has nothing to do with pets, I'm sure, since there are more than one AA that have that description.  It's a goof that will be fixed I would dare say.<br />
<br />
Second, someone goofed on the Packrat description.  That description isn't what it is.  Think about it anyways.  That name fit with anything dealing with damage shields?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Messer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Brael must be snared by festering darkness.  <br />
<br />
/em watches from affar as Brael smashes the continuous insolence from the peasants.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Brael is probably preparing his picks for this weekend's NFL playoff games and reading Pete Rose's betting for dummies book.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Krazaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">It's safe to assume that Mastery of the Past is just going to raise the effected levels of spells, maybe 60, 62 and 64 or something.  Not being able to fizzle Death Peace would be nice.<br />
<br />
Heightened Endurance: useless, unless they're adding more disciplines or attacks for us.  I don't even check my endurance bar when using Leechcurse and Unholy Aura back to back.<br />
<br />
Death's Fury: sounds at least moderately useful if you use your pet.<br />
<br />
Recovery: doesn't sound like it has anything to do with it's description at all.  Perhaps faster pet health regen, if it has anything to do with pets at all.<br />
<br />
Consumption of the Soul:  I bought Leech Touch back before Unholy Aura, when the choice was 900 lifetap or ~1500 HT.  Even if this raises the tap to 1900 points, it'd be hard to justify using that over a 7-9k HT.  Put it on a different timer or make it auto crit and it'd be worth spending AA on.<br />
<br />
Suspend Minion: I'd use my pet more with this.  I'd be happier if the suspended minion were saved when zoning or camping, but it'd at least allow me to more easily use my pet when pulling.<br />
<br />
Critical Affliction: Seems useful, wish we had more good DoTs, but Blood of Hate is already high DPS, even better with crits.<br />
<br />
Persistent Casting: Yay, FD through stun.<br />
<br />
Intense Hatred:  We'll have to see on this one.<br />
<br />
Packrat: Who knows, but it better not be some sort of increased carrying weight capacity.  I haven't had weight issues since I was 20th wearing bronze.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Thack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Rumor has it that recovery might be a corpse retrieval AA.  Who knows if it's true or not, but it does fit in with lucy info put in a while ago with a self only corpse summon spell that hasn't shown up anywhere yet in the game.<br />
<br />
Packrat doesn't increase weight you can carry or add bank or inventory slots.  That's been checked already.  There is a small chance it could possibly reduce weight of stuff carried, but I know for sure it doesn't increase max weight you can carry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Winkles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I sure hope those aa aren't set in stone.  Give us something neat like mounted combat or the ability to turn in to a visious skeletal beast for a few ticks.  Shaman get rabid bear aa that turns them into a bear and increases attk and haste so it shouldn't be that hard to give us something new and exciting.  I think verant is kind of confused where the knights are fitting into the over all game.  I wouldn't be surprised if they are just thinking that we are RP class and really don't serve much purpose at all.  The paladin radiant cure aa is actually a pretty awesome ability.  Throw us a damn bone please we need something cool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Morbent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I demand MULTI PETS! Call it Army of Darkness if you will!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Suspend minion lets you use invis without having to recast the pet again, which changes quite alot in turn...<br />
<br />
Buffed up and with mage summoned weapons/girdle/haste mask, the pet almost seems like a light blue con...the extra haste and stats combined with the Fist of Ixiblat/Blade of Walnan dd procs turn our 64 pet into a really great dps addition for aggro kiting solo or in participating in kite groups.<br />
<br />
Compared to 325 mana for 36 seconds of Blood of Hate, the pet costs 490 mana and stays up indefinately, doing more DPS. It will be nice to have this aa line...</div></div><hr />
