I work 6 months a year out at sea, so I level slow only 44th (that and I have a higher level Ranger) and you have some better stuff than I do.  I would say for the mobs you will encounter at your level your AC is just fine. You could save up for a major upgrade like a multiquest of SoV armors.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Syfon</div><div class="date">03-31-2002, 01:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">your twinked and at level 30 your gear is WAY more than adequate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Attyla</div><div class="date">04-01-2002, 12:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hrm, either:<br />

[list=1]<br />
 You twinked yourself.  Therefore you should have every idea what you should get<br />
 You have been twinked by a friend.  It's a shame you won't be feel the excitement of acquiring an item you really want with your own hands<br />
[/list=1] <br />
<br />
Personally, I'd cancel my account if EQ was only about PLing myself on my first run.    Anyone able to get that gear on their own, would know what to get next.   If my assumption is wrong, I apologize.  <br />
<br />
However, you can resubmit your question on the proper forum.  I'm sure SKs on this board will be lining up to further hand this game to you on a silver platter.<br />

Figures he's a Greenblood :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaiyn</div><div class="date">04-01-2002, 01:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow that was harsh, dude was just asking for advice on equipment. My advice to you would be to get some more ac on your ears, other than that I would save up to buy something better in the future, like an RBG or something of that nature. Other than that your gear is fine, much better than what I had at 30. I was wearing a sentient BP till 46 :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
 Otherwise your set for a while.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Save your pp , you don't need an upgrade.<br />
