<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>gutspiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Dumb question, will our pet still do that /shield ability if we use /pet hold?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If he's /pet hold ed, he doesn't do anything. He'll cheerfully watch you die, cackling all the way.<br />
<br />
The question for me is, if I get Pet Affinity, will bard songs/group buffs land on Goner while I'm pet pulling and pass aggro to the group? If so, you almost nerf pet pulling by buying Pet Affinity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gorgonbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">dont think so <br />
<br />
I saw a cleric heal my pet while pulling and got no aggro</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">quick question if i may, if im pulling with pet bard songs hitting me wont cause on due agro pre pet affinity right? think that was already a yes. Now if im pulling without pet just with arrows and fd and stuff and bard songs hit me will that cause them to agro the bard and the raid? i haven't had that much exp with pulling around a bard in a raid setting but just always thinking about it when i screw up a pull and there is a bard around heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Oagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">nt.  was gunna be sarcastic, but the caffiene kicked in. :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aoninie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My question is why are you pulling with a bard in the raid? Our bard is the baddest puller I've ever seen. If he has the right aa's your bard should be doing the pulling.....just my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">We use a bard / monk team in raids so I am afraid that I cant help you about raid pulling with bards around. <br />
<br />
Our bards are sweet sweet pullers, as I imagine any decent geared, well AA'd, solidly played bard is. <br />
<br />
I just cant see an sk pulling with bards and monks around to do it with their much better abilities (lull and the spell AA for monks) unless its some kind of DA type parking or pulling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">SKs pull brilliantly, and even enjoy a sizeable advantage in pulling some encounters. Also, in alot of guilds, SKs work with Bards and Monks on pulling roles...it isnt very fast or wise to limit the classes involved usually.<br />
<br />
The times where we really fit the pulling role best often involve either snare or harmshield as a strategy, but our FD on its own definitely is usefull. Remember that Bards cannot use their Fade as often as they would like to be able to. I think Rathe Council is probably the highlight of SK pulling in PoP, but there are also numerous kiting and parking situations in Time and GoD at which we excell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Aoninie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Some good info. My guild is still working on getting Elemental flagged. Slow process for a family / casual guild.</div></div><hr />
