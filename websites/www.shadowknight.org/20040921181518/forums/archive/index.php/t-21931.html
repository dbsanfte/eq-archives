<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Oagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Went to Hate last night for the first time since revamp.  Was pretty damn easy from what I remembered from the old days, that's for sure.  However, the lag was horrible, which I didn't remember.<br />
<br />
Killed 4 drakes - no hide.  However the Mage staff dropped off a male revenant near the bridge by zone-in.  Also, the chanter essence ashes dropped, too.  So, I guess I'll keep trying it occasionally.<br />
<br />
Anyone else have lag problems up there?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Elkar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Everyone does.  It's an issue SoE is supposedly working on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Oagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks.  Glad to know it wasn't my computer.  Damn armor was dropping a lot, too.  I could have outfitted a cleric with the drops.  Hopefully, a hide will happen.  I might think about an epic to pass the time with if it does, since the hide seems to be the biggest time sink.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>kutsokare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">According to the devs, they found a coding problem in PoHate involving multiple wandering/roaming/pathing NPCs.  This will be fixed in the next update, July 8th.</div></div><hr />
