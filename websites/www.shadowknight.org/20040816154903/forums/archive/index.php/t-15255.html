<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Murgutroid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Here you go, I just ran it yesterday. Not a bad little quest for that rare (at least on my server) untwinked newbie SK. None of the items you need to collect in the Feerrott are no drop, but most are fairly common. So even if you're too little to get them yourself, they're probably for sale on a merchant nearby. The &quot;assembly kit&quot; you get is a nice 8-slot, giant capacity container. It's Lore, but if you run your butt over to the Warrior guild, you can get another one just like it, but with a different name. Better than a backpack, and lighter, too. Anyway, here's my walk through... Hope it helps.<br />
<br />
--Mooglan can be found in the Shadowknight Guild in Oggok<br />
<br />
You say, 'Hail, Mooglan'<br />
<br />
Mooglan says 'Yuz come lookeeng to make sum armorz? Yuz come to da right place, if'n yuz be a shadowknight. Is you a [shadowknight]?'<br />
<br />
You say, 'I am a Shadowknight'<br />
<br />
Mooglan says 'Mez tink dat yuz were.  Letz begin yur traineeng. Da furst ting dat yuz needz to do is gather da itemz dat will be uzed in da krafteeng of da [armor] and den yuz can kraft dem in dis majikal assembly kit.'<br />
<br />
--At this point you receive an Assembly Kit of Darkness - 8 slot container, can hold giant sized items, Lore/No Drop<br />
<br />
You say, 'What armor?'<br />
<br />
Mooglan says 'Da itemz you will needz to gather will be all ober da Feerrott. Dese itemz will be hard for yuz to gather, dey come from some of da meanest tings in da Feerrott. Once yuz are redy to begin, tell mez da piece dat yuz wantz to kraft and mez will give yuz da recipez dat yuz will need when making da armor. I have recipez for [Helm], [Bracers], [Sleeves], [Boots], [Legplates], [Gloves] and [Breastplate].'<br />
<br />
You say, 'What helm?'<br />
<br />
Mooglan says 'Da helm iz da most impotent piece to get, since it protekt da smertest part of da body. To kraft da helm, yuz needz to gather a pristine lizard scale, one chunk of light colored fungus, and two spider legs, and kraft dem into dis here majikal assembly kit to get yur brestplate material. Den yuz take dat material and dis mold to a forge and smelt dem together into a gud helm.'<br />
<br />
--You receive a Helm Mold of Darkness<br />
<br />
You say, 'What bracers?'<br />
<br />
Mooglan says 'Da bracer is a gud piece to have. If yuz want to kraft a bracer, yuz need to gather a pristine lizard scale, two bone chips, and a pristine spider silk, and kraft dem into dis here majikal assembly kit to get yur brestplate material. Den yuz take dat material and dis mold to a forge and smelt dem together into a gud bracer.'<br />
<br />
--You receive a Bracer Mold of Darkness<br />
<br />
You say, 'What sleeves?'<br />
<br />
Mooglan says 'Da sleeves is also a impotent piece or armer, one dat will serve yuz well if yuz decide to make some. If yuz want to kraft a sleeves, yuz need to gather a pristine lizard scale, one long lizard tail, and a chunk of dark colored fungus, and kraft dem into dis here majikal assembly kit to get yur brestplate material. Den yuz take dat material and dis mold to a forge and smelt dem together into a gud set of sleeves.'<br />
<br />
--You receive an Armplate Mold of Darkness<br />
<br />
You say, 'What boots?'<br />
<br />
Mooglan says 'Da boots is a gud piece to have, dey is gud for trompin around in da Feerrott and even gud for skweeshing da big bugs dat lives out dere. If yuz want to kraft a boots, yuz need to gather pristine a lizard scale, two spiderling silks, and a giant bat wing, and kraft dem into dis here majikal assembly kit to get yur brestplate material. Den yuz take dat material and dis mold to a forge and smelt dem together into a gud set of boots.'<br />
<br />
--You receive a Boot Mold of Darkness<br />
<br />
You say, 'What legplates?'<br />
<br />
Mooglan says 'Wez Ogre have big legz, which make big targets for da enemies, so itz a gud ting to protekt dem as best you can. To kraft some legplates, yuz need to gather two pristine lizard scales, one black spider silk, and one chunk of multi-colored fungus, and kraft dem into dis here majikal assembly kit to get yur brestplate material. Den yuz take dat material and dis mold to a forge and smelt dem together into some gud legplates.'<br />
<br />
--You receive a Legplate Mold of Darkness<br />
<br />
You say, 'What gloves?'<br />
<br />
Mooglan says 'We also have big handz, which makes dem very easy to get hurt in da battles, so it also be a good idea to protekt dem too. If yuz want to kraft a gloves, yuz need to gather a pristine lizard scale, one black lizard scale, and one spiderling silk, and kraft dem into dis here majikal assembly kit to get yur brestplate material. Den yuz take dat material and dis mold to a forge and smelt dem together into a some gud gloves.'<br />
<br />
--You receive a Gauntlet Mold of Darkness<br />
<br />
You say, 'What breastplate?'<br />
<br />
Mooglan says 'Da brestplate is a gud piece to have, it protektz yuz from all da beatingz dat you get if you fight in da Feerrott. If yuz want to kraft a brestplate, yuz need to gather two pristine lizard scales, one black lizard scale, and four black spiderling silks, and kraft dem into dat there majikal assembly kit to get yur brestplate material. Den yuz take dat material and dis mold to a forge and smelt dem together into a gud breastplate.'<br />
<br />
--You receive a Breastplate Mold of Darkness<br />
<br />
--The different types of fungus drop off both lizardmen and spiders/spiderlings. The lizard scales and tails seem to drop equally off any lizard on either side of the river, whether in a camp or not.<br />
<br />
--After you gather the items you need for each piece, you combine them in the kit to get the appropriate material. When you've done that, place the material in a forge along with the mold that Mooglan gave you for that piece. This is a no-fail combine and will result in the finished piece of armor. All pieces are No Drop, and all pieces except the bracer are Lore.<br />

<br />
Great update!<br />
<br />
You might think about forwarding that to the guys at  Allakhazam. Last I checked, they did not have anything on the SK quests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>traucet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Nice update for the newbie quest.  Have any idea if this quest had a weapon as most of the other newbie quests in Everquest???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Spinecracka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">One clarification:<br />
<br />
As far as I can tell, there are no &quot;Black Spiderling Silks&quot; as mentioned in the text from the NPC.<br />
<br />
Use Black Spider Silks instead.</div></div><hr />
