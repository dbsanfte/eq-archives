And am now wondering where to now? OT is starting to become really low in exp.<br />
<br />
I have gotten a character over 39(To 51) but doing this now is completely different, my soloing capabilities are much greater.  I am not just limited to Animal kiting anymore.. Yay!<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

Just got done doing them on my mage and I went from 37-40 in like an hour and a half.  And the best part is you can stay here until lvl 44 even the light blues give 1% exp and they only have 1k-1200 HP and hit low 60s.  Also tons of FS made around 2k as well.  Where else can you get 1% exp per kill on light blues that die so fast hehe.  Oh did I mention you get to kill Gnomes?</div></div><hr />

I went from 37 to 46 in 4 days and 2 rez's, but that was when fabled were up and dominating, since they took them down you can get better with King and other named, bats, and spiders. But thats me, i like Sol B.</div></div><hr />
