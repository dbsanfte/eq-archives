<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nambkab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I recently moved, and set up a wireless connection for the new apartment yesterday.  Last night I was able to log on to EQ with no problems whatsoever, everything seemed just great.  My roomate unplugged the wireless router this morning to move it, and when I started my comp today my connection was completely gone.  I goofed around with it for around 30 minutes and finally got it all working, and after numerous restarts I'm satisfied that it is here to stay this time.  On the flip side,  I can no longer connect to the patch server to start EQ.  Figured maybe someone here might know enough to help me (digging through EQLive for help is like subjecting myself to a powdered glass enema).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Androsulach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you can surf the web you should be able to patch.  You might need to doublecheck that the firewall on your wireless router isn't filtering the ports that EQ uses, as that would interfere with your ability to connect to the patch server or the world servers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nambkab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I managed to bypass the patcher and just run EQ last night, had no problems in game.  It had worked fine(and even patched) the night before, so I'm gonna try to reset the router tonight, see if that helps.  Otherwise I can only play till they patch again  :D</div></div><hr />
