<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kelefane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, gonna do 1.5. My question is this however, would it be easier to do 1.0 then to do the 1.5 entrance quest, assumming you dont have 1.0 yet? I do not have epic 1.0 and was just wondering if it would be any faster/easier to do 1.0 ( Instead of killing Varns and Olidan ect ect )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Slithinknott</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Depends on how much your guild is willing to help.  i went epic 1.0 so i wouldnt have to stress them extra battle.  most of the epic 1.0 is 2 man minus the last kill (buying mq and stuff).  usually you can get a cleric to come out just for a chance to roll on DI on lhranc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kelefane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I can get help w/ fights ect np...I just kinda hate to drag peeps to LoY zones and far outta the way places (especially if not needed) <br />
<br />
Varns and Olidan single groupable w/ Time geared peeps and a 8k hp unbuffed SK tank?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yuppers.<br />
<br />
Just read through some of the other threads on here and you'll get some good info.<br />
<br />
Basically, Varns you'll want caster dps in your group and Olidan, well he's just a giant that hits sorta hard, rampages but not too often, and well that's about it. Varns is definently a tougher challenge than Olidan.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kelefane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Does 1.5 &gt; Any weapon up to OOW if auged right? I mean, is it really that huge of an upgrade over anything Time/GoD has to offer? Accept that Tacvi weapon (Name escapes me atm) :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There are a few better weapons in GoD I think, though it is on par/slight upgrade to time weapons, yes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>roxxyy0</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">texvu Great maul of the mighty is better and the tacvi death blade of zum muram or somthing is better. <br />
<br />
you can maybe argue kele axe or the uqua spear are better then epic 1.5 but guess its prefernce. Its better then anything from pop  unless your enamored with the vdd proc and better then all but 2 god weapons imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Renaey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Im in a current position where I can not play as much as i would like to at the moment. Yes the said weapons above may be better. But when not flagged, or severely  limited on time like myself. I believe we can see which is easily obtainable. <br />
<br />
But hell. If you got 12 hours to kill a day without responsibility (exaggerated  <br />
, I know), and dont mind playing eq like a mindless drone then go for it.<br />
I'll gladly take 1.5 over GoD just because of its simplicity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Elkar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If you want an opinion, Epic 1.5 bypass quest is less time consuming than IC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Moardok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If you want an opinion, Epic 1.5 bypass quest is less time consuming than IC.<br />
<br />
100% agree!  <br />
<br />
I play liek 3-4 hours a day...In a semi-raid guild we raid like 3 nights a week.<br />
With there help for Oldain,an Captain..an then a 9 F*#!ing hour camp in hate I had all 3 drops for the Bypass quest in lil over a week about 10 hours total for all 3 drops in a time period of a week playing about 3-4 hours day</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Bumluk Rayrspaun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hate was the worst part.  Just getting the named to spawn sucks.  Took me 3 days, about 14 hours in Hate (on the upside, we got a decrepit hide for a guildy when we were leaving; first one I've ever seen, lol).  Most of it I two-boxed, had some random dps for part of it.<br />
<br />
Varns is always up (or at least has been everytime I've checked), and wasn't too hard (warrior didn't even use defensive).<br />
<br />
I tanked Olidan (with under 9k hp buffed), boxing the only cleric there, with a couple druids helping heal and about a group of random dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Iosif_McCloud</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It all depends on your resources.. if you have the ablity to gather 2-3 Low-Mid PoP groups then Ya bypass is faster ... if you cant really eazly gather that kinda force just do IC may take a week or so looking doe MQ's and some light farming other then that it's just time involved but eazer...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>kharan_zechts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If you have the Souleech then doing 1.0 might be a good option. Otherwise I wouldn't recommend it. That stupid thing took me about 7 golem clearings back to back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Skoggel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Soul Leech is the sole reason I'm not bothering with epic 1.0. If the golems didn't DT I'd maybe do it, considering how much the Hate camp sucks (though it is productive irl, 30 min spawn timers keeping 2 mobs down gives you lots of free time to get stuff done.)  Otherwise though, Varns and Olidan aren't really a big deal, so...</div></div><hr />
