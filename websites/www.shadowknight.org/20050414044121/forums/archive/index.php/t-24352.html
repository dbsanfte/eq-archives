<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, I was hesitant to post in case it was a secret -- nothing game breaking here but possibly unintended.<br />
<br />
It would appear that summoned items, such as food/water, bandages, etc. can be stored in the Guildbank and remain there, even through instance shutdown.  Of particular interest are that pet weapons, such as muzzle, girdle, fireblade, etc. also remain too.<br />
<br />
While this doesn't affect large guilds where the mages summon up stuff based on need; it can be handy (moreso if the mage or you are a designated guild banker) for smaller guilds or ones where mages are scarce, because the mage can whip up a bunch of pet toys which can be deposited in the guildbank where they won't poof.  Or if you get two pet packs but 'lil boner didn't die today -- and you don't feel like giving your extra pack to n00bie_00 in PoK, you can deposit your spare set in the bank (this is where it's handy to be guild banker status, so that you don't have to ask someone else to flag the items for you).  Note though, that you can't put the entire pack into the guildbank, each item must be taken out of the pack and deposited separately.<br />
<br />
Disclaimer: although this has been tested and confirmed, it may be changeable at any time without a patch (although the guildbank is technically separate from the guildhall instance but can only be accessed from the guildhall).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brenaux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hi guys, just want to issue caution in using the guild bank to store No-rent items.  Ashlanne has stated that this may be an unintended effect and that she is looking into it.  You can view her statement for yourself here.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah, I read that today.  It may be unintended but I don't see it as an exploit or whatnot; since one can just bring up a mage and summon those same items fresh, etc. anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Daemoness</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Brenaux, thank for nothing.<br />
 I have a mage as a main and this was good, it sure as hell reduced the begging and pleading for pet toys while i was busy. Unintended or not it was useful and made alot of difference to me and how much i get chased down by other at the wrong times.<br />
Next time you want to find something to go crying to SoE make sure it isnt of any use to anyone at all....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Croix VorAbaddon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If it's unintended, it's unintended. /feedback SOE if you feel like it, but in the end, bugs should be reported and fixed, because who knows what other multitude of problems a broken piece of code could cause later down the line, which everyone will bitch about. Deal.</div></div><hr />

Wow, thanks for the thanks.  You're welcome.  Glad I could help you to not get uninentionally banned from the game.  Have a nice day.<br />
<br />
For the record I didn't go &quot;crying&quot; to SoE.  I asked them if it was meant to be that way for the safety of EVERYBODY playing that they don't get caught possibly, unknowingly, exploiting and therefore Banned as it has been recorded by stories from others that SoE seems to have a ban first, ask questions later policy.</div></div><hr />
