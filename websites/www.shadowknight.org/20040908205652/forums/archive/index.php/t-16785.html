<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Caktis1981</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am one o those few people who will not upgrade epic, I know 40/45 sux ass but I have a iron will about this, no windblade or war marshalls bladed staff, just epic. What augment should i put into epic to give it the best beef up i possibly can. Anything that is in hell diffuculty or insanely hard to get i out of the question, what could a once or twice a week eq'er save up for or look for that could be my best bet? I heard that there is 75pt lifetap augment I can buy thats is over 1200 points from what i heard so if i am wrong about that my appoligies. Is there anything better I should put in? any opinions is much appreciated, exept opinions to buy a windblade 8p. tnx in advance.</div></div><hr />

Ok I know LDoN resembles Diablo 2 in a lot of ways but thats getting too much now :p<br />
<br />
On your question: Go with either a lifetap proc or one of the DD procs, depending on what you prefer (Assuming epic is Type 4, havent checked since LDoN release).  Can get up to 150dd max in either Fire, Cold, or Poison, or the lifetap which does less damage but compensates with the healing... Personally, I'd go with a DD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Duke Xerro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">For the amount of points to get the 75 lifetap proc, I don't think its worth it, much better IMO to get the DD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Apokx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Personally if I put anything on my epic,it would be a stun/stun+dd.<br />
<br />
Since we don't have a stun type spell,its just added aggro for us with can be used with darkness/fear etc.<br />
<br />
As any dd/lifetap proc prolly wont mean shit for keeping you alive/damage..the stun will make difference by itself.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sivass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I would say upgrade the damage if possible, but if it has to be a proc (type 4) then i would go with more of a utility such as guard or spell guard. IC already has a nice lifetap and added dps from DD procs is small and unreliable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>GranochTonka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Guard ownz all..mirror proc is nice too..i have mirror on my one hander for when im fighting casters..nothing like seeing a goblin in droga hit by his own ice comet.<br />
<br />
But since you can bash with your IC, Mirror is nice..</div></div><hr />
