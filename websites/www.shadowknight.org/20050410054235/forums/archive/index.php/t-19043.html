<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rigur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know this is extremly broad, but i am lookign for tips on how to set up different hotbutton banks for different situations.  Do you guys have one for solo, 1 for group, 1 for pulling, 1 for spells or clicky items?  I am 37 any advice would be very appreciated.<br />
<br />
OH, what macro's have you guys set up?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dakkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have a couple of hotbutton banks so I can activate them by pressing the number keys in combat.<br />
<br />
Fairly standard is the following (I have another setup with range attack instead of assist for when I'm pulling outdoors):<br />
<br />
Button 1 - assist<br />
/assist &lt;pullername&gt; or if needed /assist luller or chanter<br />
<br />
Button 2 - aggro<br />
Clinging darkness spell gem<br />
<br />
Button 3 - caster interrupt<br />
Slam<br />
<br />
Button 4 - Call assist<br />
/doability 8 (taunt)<br />
/doability 7 (slam)<br />
/attack on<br />
Assist me on %t<br />
/cast 1 (clinging darkness)<br />
<br />
This is actually the most useful macro I have, and makes a huge difference in fast groups and for breaking mez; if I'm tanking, I rarely turn attack on except through this button.  I have a similar one for offtanking.<br />
<br />
Button 5 - taunt<br />
/doability 8 (taunt)<br />
I'm taunting %t<br />
/cast 2 (terror)<br />
<br />
This works a LOT better than standard taunt for pulling mobs back onto you, and can be used for taunting mezzed mobs.  Considering adding a disarm in front of the taunt too subject to some checking; Brael says it improves taunt effectiveness.<br />
<br />
Button 6 - HT<br />
When you get higher, you'll want to change this to a macro to pop discs and stuff prior to HT.<br />
<br />
Button 7 - feign death<br />
/stand<br />
/attack off<br />
/cast 8<br />
/cast 8<br />
/cast 8<br />
<br />
This will cast through fizzles to get a successful FD almost all the time.<br />
<br />
A couple more buttons I've kept for clickies; when I hit 45 I found the BE gauntlets incredibly useful for saving mana on aggro, and I still use them surprisingly frequently for various things.<br />
<br />
One other general macro I've found useful:<br />
<br />
Incoming<br />
Incoming %t<br />
/cast 1 (clinging darkness)<br />
<br />
I poured scorn on this when someone suggested it for pulling in LDoN then tried it and embarrassingly enough found it incredibly useful.<br />
<br />
That's about all I can think of offhand; I have a ton of macros and hotbuttons for raids but those aren't worth going into here.  I hope it's useful anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rigur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Very similar to the way I have mine done.  The /call assist and FD and taunting will be very very useful.  I really appreciate the help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Duke Xerro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have a few different setups.....<br />
Regular group <br />
1) attack<br />
2) range<br />
3) taunt<br />
4) INC message (inc message switch with assist if im not pulling) 5) aggro (darkness, fear, etc)<br />
6) lifetap<br />
7) HT<br />
8) FD<br />
<br />
Duels<br />
1) attack <br />
2) bash<br />
3) range<br />
4) HT<br />
5, 6, 7, 8 for spells <br />
<br />
Raids<br />
1) INC message<br />
2) Tank message (if im in tank order)<br />
3) taunt<br />
4) assist <br />
5) aggro<br />
6) lifetap<br />
7) HT<br />
8) FD</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Putrid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">When soloing, I add a /who to my feign death macro key, just in case I will be needing a rez.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ramgar SK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">lol Putrid.  True.  True.<br />
<br />
I've only found one set of hotkeys to be useful.  My second set of hotkeys has the ones I seldomly use but need to be repeated a lot, such as /corpse, /loc.<br />
<br />
Most important key:  Assist.  Type out the MA's name, don't use %t, you might not be in his/her group.  The only time you don't need it is then you are the Main Assist.<br />
Secondary assist key is nice also.  Very useful in raids, edit the key any time MA changes:<br />
/gsay Assisting Ramgar<br />
/assist Ramgar<br />
/pause 5<br />
/gsay on %t<br />
<br />
<br />
Pause is useful in macros for assisting and casting a spell on incommng, when I'm not the puller, but I am MA:<br />
/stand<br />
/assist Ramgar<br />
/pause 5, /cast #<br />
<br />
I've found that /pause 5 works 100% after assist, and /pause 4 works about 4/5 times.  The latter resulting in castings on myself.  :)  /pause has to be first, followed by a comma, then /doability or whatever.<br />
<br />
It's a good idea to always have an &quot;Incomming&quot; key that tells the group and or raid what is coming, or added while fighting:<br />
/gsay INC ---&gt; %t<br />
/rsay INC ----&gt; %t<br />
<br />
I also have an &quot;Assist Me&quot; key, for raid tanking, breaking mez and multiple incomming:<br />
/gsay ASSIST me on a --- %t ---<br />
<br />
Unholy Aura Key:<br />
/disc unholy<br />
/em Ramgar becomes ENRAGED!<br />
/doability # (# = harm touch ability number) (can also use /alt activate)</div></div><hr />
