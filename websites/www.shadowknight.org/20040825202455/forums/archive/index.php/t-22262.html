 <br />
She may be great at a lot of things, but she is only average at collections(can you say dead weight? ditzy? airheaded? unmotivated?).  I also know she really wants to move on to a &quot;showbiz&quot; career.  So help her (and me) out and throw a vote her way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Derraj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">how would it be helping you out? gonna get some hawt smelly sticky freaky BDSM gay and lesbian bondage type sex from her eh?</div></div><hr />

<br />
If she were gone, there would be an opening that could be filled by someone that would actually do some work instead of sit around and BS all day.  The better my results are, the better raise/bonus I get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">So fire her lazy, &quot;unmotivated&quot; ass? Yup, that solves everything.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And you keep her around in Collections because why?<br />
Being pretty to people that owe money or a service isn't going to spawn the happy-money-fairy for them no matter how dead-bang-sexy she is.<br />
Dead weight == She won't bother doing anything out of her way to get her job done.<br />
Ditzy == She'll fall for any excuse so the debtor can prolong his payment.<br />
Airheaded == She'll fall for any excuse so the debtor can prolong his payment.<br />
Unmotivated == She won't bother doing anything out of her way to get her job done.<br />
<br />
The company you run/work for is losing money having her employed.<br />
I can appreciate that she wants to get ahead in whatever she wants to do with herself, but slacking in the meantime to get there is bad news.</div></div><hr />

The problem is, the company they work for was just bought out by another company, and since the buy out, no one has been able to fire anyone for not being able to collect. Only reason people are being fired from there right now is if they fail to show up, or if they call in sick more times then the alotted amount. (associates, the managers are still under pressure to make them collect, or their job is on the line..) He KNOWS she is pulling his team down, he has tried to get her to work, but she is unmotivated.  And since she shows up to work, there is nothing he can do about it at this time, except urge her to leave. (Well until the head of the building gets his act together and starts following more of the new company polices and less of the old)</div></div><hr />

I was thinking of more of a nooner at the local Hojo's<br />
<br />
EDIT: Thanks for telling us who she was, I NEVER would have voted for her otherwise.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Dark Lord John Denver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">maxim sucks now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Apokx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I just spent three hours browsing that link,and I parsed the results.<br />
<br />
<br />
Average erection time:2.5 seconds<br />
Record erection time:1.8 seconds<br />
Average erection duration:3 minutes,12 seconds.<br />
<br />
Now we take J's personal stats into the equation we find that she is somewhat below the average specs for most of the girls.<br />
<br />
AeT:2 seconds.<br />
ReT:2 seconds.<br />
AeD:8 minutes.<br />
<br />
I hand-tested each girl,and I have to say J just doesent earn my vote.Although since she seems like a stupid bitch,I'll vote for her if she goes away.</div></div><hr />
