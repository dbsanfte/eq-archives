<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dirj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've played a Ogre SK to 50 on Xev over 2 years ago named Durj.  Now starting with a new account, another, but this time chose Cazic Thule instead of Rallos Zek.  I've noticed the racial crafted armor for RZ ogres and trolls is a lot cheaper in the bazaar than the stuff for CT followers.  Not a big deal as their are lots of other options for armor, and I am pretty low level still.<br />
I know Fierce Heraldic is usable only by warriors and bards.  I was hoping that by choosing Cazic and having access to some illusion potions I wouldn't have to  do much if any faction work for Greenmist quest, and for erudite quests, though I suspect, the erudite quested stuff, is race specific to erudites and humans.  Am I correct in thinking the Greenmist will be half the work for me?  Are there other benefits to following CT rather that RZ?</div></div><hr />

Chooze Cazic-Thule if you want to do the Greenmist.</div></div><hr />

Honnestly CT cultural armor is a little better IMO but with RZ you do not need any excuse to charge on anything ... you play an ogre remember, lesser races think as an ogre anything you see is your next  meal ... just listen to your pet sometimes after 2/3 wip (2 that is the number after 5 ... I should ask... ). ;)<br />
Ogre rule ... remember that we were master of the world once.<br />
<br />
Do not bother to take RZ for POT scouting I am KOS there since my first zone in ... as an ogre sk you are generally KOS to everything remember, I still am surprised anytime a new npc do not charge me on sight (did you ever try to enter freeport at level 10... like you did with your wizard... since then I invi and keep FD memed when I travel I do not even try to con, I am sure of the result).</div></div><hr />
