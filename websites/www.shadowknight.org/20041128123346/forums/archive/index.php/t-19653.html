<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tukka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I don't know if this idea has been tossed around much, but I've had it in my head almost since I started playing, and unlike a lot of the ideas I had when I first started playing, this one still seems pretty good and hasn't been implemented yet.<br />
<br />
It seems clear by now that Sony doesn't want to give us any new spell slots/gems to force all the casters to make a strategic choice about what spells they want to have memorized.  It's a drag, but I can understand and agree the idea.<br />
<br />
However, it makes rebuffing needlessly irritating.  Having to de-memorize a spell, memorize a buff, wait for it to un-grey, cast, de-memorize it, and re-memorize the original spell is very annoying, but I don't think it puts you at that much of a tactical disadvantage... it just forces you to take a few more moments to rebuff that you otherwise wouldn't have to.  An unnecessary pause in the action.<br />
<br />
So I think they should give us two or three new spell gems, but to use them the spell you memorize in them would have to meet the following conditions:<br />
<br />
- Spell is beneficial<br />
- Base/minimum spell duration is greater than 8 minutes<br />
- Recast time is less than 1 minute<br />
<br />
I realize this wouldn't resolve any critical class balance issues (and would benefit us less than some other classes) and recent UI improvements have made switching out spells a bit less burdensome than it once was... but if they aren't going to give us any more normal/real spell mem slots, then I think they could throw us a bone and use this proposal or something like it as an incentive to buy a future expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Doryshan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I use the Spell sets for buffing. I have a Buff spell set which I use when the group first buffs up or when we have a med break. When I need the short duration  buffs I swap in the buff I want and then reload the spell set I've selected for the current group. Loading the spell set is faster as I only have so search for the one set entry. It also preserves the timing on spells such as Voice and Zevfeers.</div></div><hr />
