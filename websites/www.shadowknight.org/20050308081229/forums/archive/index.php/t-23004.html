There are usually no mobs there.  Now get to beginning part of tunnel and get on your horse with bobbing corpse.  Invis and run like hell to the plateau area and FD.  Pull the horses so that you are close to your healer.  You will find that your healer's spells can reach you even though they are not on the plateau with you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Halfwarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">hate to say it but the easiest way is to solo them this is what I did, there are 4 spawns so the first one i used both my /discs and strait up tanked it and killed it, after that i med to FM and kited the other one using both of the two spawns spots for running room  just using ingire and blood of hate, and spears (just to drop it faster)... (no snare there imune) , after that repeat for the other two, doing this i was able to kill all 4 about 30 mins before repops ... respawn is about 90 mins so you have plenty of time to get HT up again and do the same thing with the first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lzert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I parked a shaman down below the plataeu and did my solo run.  Shaman heals were sufficient, and when I sic'd sham pet, it would warp up and help me kill nightmare, speeding things up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Elkar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I parked a cleric down below, ran to plateau on horsie.  Barely needed anys healing, just one or two HoTs was enough.<br />
<br />
About kiting, I could have sworn they summon.<br />
<br />
Edit ~ got mine on 6th kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Halfwarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">they definally don't summon (as i soloed about 15+ kiting them) and there is no point in speeding up the killing since they respawn every 90 mins so.... even soloing you'll have about 20-30 mins downtime before 1st one spawns again</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Deathfighter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Memmed 2 taps. Pulled one, Tanked/Tapped Killed it. Pulled next one, repeat. Then I was medding and another SK wanted to join me, So I waited and we duo'ed the last 2. I had 71 DS which worked nicely. (Shaman potions Rule)<br />
<br />
I agree, Having a priest heal from below is a great way to do it, however, If you are Time Geared you will have no problems soloing these.<br />
<br />
If you are Brael you won't even need to take a break.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lzert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i sped up killing because i wasnt' going to be there for more than one round, and allowed me to take a break between rounds if needed :)<br />
<br />
Got it first round though, so was only there about 20 min.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I got my hide on the first drop so I got lucky. <br />
<br />
But I was able to solo that horse just using Bond of Inruku + Touch of Inny + Touch of Volatis. Didn't even burn HT as I wasn't really ever close to dying.<br />
<br />
I am not geared very well compared to alot of people on this board so if I can do it most people here could I would think.</div></div><hr />

3. /pet attack a_gloom_nightmare<br />
<br />
horses come down.<br />
have to clear some goblins for 2 of them to come solo, other 2 just do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Vaeldarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I hate to post this since I'll just get /flame or /rude...<br />
<br />
I just threw on bobbing corpse, ran like hell up there, FD'ed near horsey at far end of plateau. I was flying solo, had 16 minutes before raids, and thought I'd see how bad this camp was gonna be. I tossed a few DoTs at the nearby horse and melee/spear'ed it down. It dropped the pelt, I laughed, and I went to raids &gt;.&lt;<br />
<br />
Mostly just posted this to affirm that getting there is possible, soloing is possible, and drop rate can't be too bad since I'm yet another person who got it first shot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Krulik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Great info here. I did this boxing a shaman in 30 min. I followed the advice above. I parked the shammy by the boulder near the plateau.. right where you can see Kalista or whatever her name is. I cast harmshield and dove in the water and hauled butt thru the cave all the way to the plateau and fd'd. Once aggro cleared , i went to the corner where Kalista(sp) was killed the Gloom Nightmares there. Shaman healed from below, could target the mob but said was too far away no matter where i was when i tried to malo/slow it. Mobbs arent that hard tho, so it wasnt a problem, patch heal, killed 2 and dropped the hide. Jus hopped off the plateau and was out. Glad i read about healing from below! Thanks guys for that info. Woulda been a pain gettin shm up there, theres alot of mobbs in that cave.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Maniacles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I used this method myself.<br />
Those who were soloing were higher level than me, and with all their spells.  I was level 66 and had none of the 66 spells, but me and a druid could so the horses in this manner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Vindarius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Did this the other day. Guildies wanted to help and I was so sure frotty's method would work so I said sure i'll pet pull them down. But, his post is a bit dated and they apparently changed it because though the pet confirmed my typed attack command saying &quot;attacking a gloom nightmare master&quot;, it couldnt get onto the plateau. (in hindsight I wonder if I was too far away from their location - If someone trys this, try moving all around the edge of the plateau until pet gets close enough maybe) So, instead of watching guildies twiddle their fingers and watch while I solo meleed them in a fight that seemed to take forever with heals from below, I just did the run each time and pulled them right down off the plateau one by one so my friends could help. This toon can't solo them anyway, so this worked well. Swimming to the tunnel was cake with no agros as long as you enter the water from the plateau side and hug the bottom and turn north when you hit the middle of the stream. Used lev with horse for the run, but be sure to click off lev as you enter the chamber in the mephit area because with lev you will hit the wall above the next cave opening and won't be a happy sk shortly thereafter. Hide dropped on fourth kill. Kills were fast with friends. The 2 minute FD at the end of each run took the longest, but still seemed faster than single tanking them.  All in all spent maybe 45 minutes on this start to finish.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ephyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">did this with a four box and a friends sk...ran my sk through the caves...did a run and flop every few mobs...and regen a bit before next stage...as i dont have aa horsie...and then had others in group down below edge...<br />
<br />
could have soloed them...but was easier/faster with heals from below...<br />
<br />
couple more pieces of info...<br />
<br />
1.  anyone with a pet class can assist you from down below...just assist and pet attack...and pet warps up to help...did this with mage and shammy pets to speed dps...<br />
<br />
2.  normal heals work...but quiesence did not...may just simply be further away...or could be a block on heal over time spells...<br />
<br />
3.  mage could re-damage shield me from down below....but shammy could not cast regen on me...<br />
<br />
4. others in group could not cast spells (slow, nuke, etc.) on the gloom nightmare from down below...<br />
<br />
5. on the last one after i pulled it...i fded and let the other sk down below pet pull it down to group...it worked just fine...mob came down off of plateau and was promptly slowed, tanked, nuked and dead. so if you need a group to do this... anyone with a pet in group (doesnt need to be sk pet) can pull the mob down to the group once targeted from up on the plateau.<br />
<br />
6.  there is no restriction on going off the plateau vs getting up on it. on one of my pulls i was not watching were i was going...and went off edge...and had to go all the way back trough the caves again to get the next mob.<br />
<br />
got 1 to drop on 4th horsie....guildie got it...ill go back with my bot team again...as we had to go to raid...<br />
