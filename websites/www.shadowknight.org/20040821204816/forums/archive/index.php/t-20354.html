I knew my role in a group was to tank usually or deal out decent damage when not tanking. Now with GoD, It seems I wont be able to tank worth a damn, and dealing out damage will greatly be hindered with the high resists of the spear line of spells.  Thanks SoE for taking a class I had fun playing and giving us no real meaning.</div></div><hr />

Last time I looked SK/ Kinghts held and could draw aggro better than any other class. A well played  SK can be a slowers best freind.<br />
I would say thats pretty class specific)<br />
<br />
What do you want??? to be able to tank the hardest baddest mobs in the game better than anyone too!!:P<br />
<br />
They have a class for that too, go play a warrior!<br />
<br />
I suppose if we had Paci added to FD, ummm ......defense and discs of a warrior, could pick locks, sense traps, self buff some haste and VOQ, oh not forgetting to summon corpses on occasion wrapped up with a nice dual wielding 2HS, high end slowing and a complete heal spell you would be happy!<br />
<br />
......<br />
<br />
Sorry to flame but really look deeper into the class and you may find a bit more than just... doh....... hit mob, slam mob, loot mob:)<br />

Warriors grab/hold aggro better than us Tanadil. <br />
<br />
At your level maybe. At my level I can seriously laugh at warriors. Sure they can hit taunt, so can a ranger. But I can assure you that my list of shaman, wizard, cleric and chanter friends would prefer I tank over a warrior any day. As long as some dumbass isn't smashing his taunt button, noone ever pulls agro from me if I don't want them to. And that is consecutive fights without sitting down. SK's still rule for agro. Now granted in a serious fight you might want to give me .5 seconds to cast another spear before you assist but I don't care if you want to get smacked once just to remind yourself what pain is like. Other than that, good luck getting agro from an SK.  <br />
<br />
I don't use taunt unless I am breaking a mez. Ever. There is no reason to taunt as an SK. Unless of course your chanter failed mez a bunch of times and the mobs have dropped her and they're all on the cleric now... might want to hit taunt then :P Other than that as long as you pull with agro and DON'T hit taunt and let your melee and spells build agro... is there even doubt ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agro Warriors can have the following agro<br />
<br />
primary with EB with EB aug<br />
secondary with EB with EB aug<br />
Taunt<br />
Discipline to grab instand agro<br />
<br />
Brael plays with Warriors who have optomized their setup for agro when they are playing that role.<br />
<br />
But even at lower levels say 55 for instance Wars who have chosen to optomize for agro can get some serious serious agro and hold it over time.<br />
<br />
I strongly suspect that the wars he is talking about could grab agro at lower levels without time gear if they made a twink and put 100k gear on it or so.<br />
<br />
With primary proc happening 3+3 times per min(305 dex +WA5) there is a 10 second expected time before first proc.  During this time they can use taunt or their discipline.  An SK needs to sacrifice utility to keep up with the agro the above war could put out.  Because I don't chain cast fear agains fear immune mobs or constant CD I don't really know where the SK max agro point is but the agro war can maintain very high levels of agro now.  <br />
<br />
Weapons Affinity increased agro from EB procs by 50%.  I don't see how SK agro increased in gates can someone tell me?</div></div><hr />

I'm wondering about Newtank.  With all the AA that he got why didn't he get some levels in Natural Durability?  <br />
<br />
If you don't rely on CH as your main healing option natural durability only helps you if you get killed in situations where you almost killed the mob first or ran away etc.  Regen increase your rate of kills more hp doesn't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Mdiyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I think that newtank feels that relatively if you have fewer HPs then you will regen faster.<br />
<br />
As far as warriors and aggro..., their new profane line of discs allows them to get snap aggro..., that is why they can get and hold aggro so much better then they were able to before..., along with the EB weapons that will always go to a warrior unless you are in a DKP guild and a ranger gets it(its happened), the warriors are and will continue to generate more aggro then us, especially with the refresh time as short as it is<br />
<br />
Note: OMG did I just agree w/ newtank?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wouldn't natural durability decrease how much you get hit for which would decrease the amount of hp you had to regen which would decrease your down time which would mean more kills per houR?</div></div><hr />

At lvl 55 AA only increase Hp or sta.  The lvl 59 durability increases CA, CS and Hit points.</div></div><hr />

We just lost the agro crown.  Are you so mellow that you have no problem with that?  Wow man impressive.  You are the kinda guy that would watch as someone stole your car pissed in it and then yell at your wife when she complains about the smell and wants you to call the police.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is no agro crown in KC. Agro in KC is accomplished by spending more than 10 minutes AFK at the zone line- something will eventually arrive (usually behind a druid) and agro you. Mission accomplished.<br />
<br />
<br />
Granted there seem to be issues in GoD in places I will never see-so for the time being I am perfectly happy with the way things are at my personal level of the game with regards to &quot;Warriors and Me&quot;. What the changes have meant is that I can pull to a War now and don't have to stand there while he performs a voodoo ritual in hopes of getting his weapon to proc. Even still on raids I see &quot;let the MA get agro!!&quot;.  Never once seen that with an SK at the helm. My mojo's doing just fine thx.</div></div><hr />

guess again, what im talking about has nothing to do with the recent changes. Note the use of the words &quot;long ago&quot; in my original post.</div></div><hr />

<br />
fag.  You should be known for your individual skill, not your generic class-based attributes.  <br />
<br />
Then again, you have your reputation already, don't you?  It would suck if some warrior came to live in KC too, wouldn't it?  Then all the groups might pick him over you and you'd just have to continue soloing crap with your fungi!<br />
<br />
fag.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Brahms</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">I think that SKs tank better if they just stand there, hitting darkness, and not even attacking.   <br />

Do people still do that?  People call me out on it, and I compare a pull with mobs while I hit'em and not, and 7/10 times I can say it works with higher level reposters.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>lot3k</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">I'm not giving out info, but trust me SK can tank in GoD, not as effeciently as warriors, but if can be done, and quite well.  This specific zone stuff people spout off isn't valid anymore.  I assume most you higher ends in these uber guild will know what I am talking about.  All I am saying is GoD changed the way encounters and raids are handled, they didn't nerf our ability to do them.</div></div><hr />
