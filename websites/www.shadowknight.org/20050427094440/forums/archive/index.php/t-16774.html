<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Black Knight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey everyone, I finally made my Shadow Knight. His name is Saidean and he's a human. Got him some Ry, Gorr and here's my story.<br />
<br />
I started him off and at first, I didn't really like it. After all, my main is a mage... Anyway, finally got to my spell level. Now my friend, a Dark Elf Sk helped out and let me use some of his old gear, stuff like some haste gloves, etc.<br />
<br />
Now I must say, since I've gotten better equipment and can actually hit stuff now... Its gotten fun. And I've only died once! And that was because I was in the Unrest running from a Ghoul and since I was blind... Well... I couldn't see my way out and died... So I went out and got a fire beetle eye. :D <br />
<br />
Here's my question, I know SKs can tank quite well. Paladins hold agro by chain stunning which really pisses the target off. How do I keep agro? So far I've been getting my taunt up, its about 70 right now, so at my level I can hold agro pretty well. And I can hit for about 29 damage max.<br />
<br />
Can someone give me some tank strategys for a Human Shadow Knight?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Duke Xerro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Good choice. Human SK is the best..<br />
<br />
Ok, just use your darkness spell (what lvl are you btw) once and you should be able to keep aggro fine for the whole fight (at lowers lvls) when you start getting a little higher you may want to cast again to negate slow/tash/malo etc... Also, you don't need to keep hitting taunt, only when somebody takes aggro from you hit taunt to get it back. Taunt just makes your aggro the same as the highest person on the aggro list +1, so if you have aggro, don't hurt your fingers. Basically, just use darkness to keep aggro. Also, when you get in lvl 60's you can also use fear which is a good way to keep aggro too. But dont try on anything lower than 52, because it will fear, and your group might not like that too much. Hope this helps. :eek: <br />
<br />
Btw, good choice.. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Black Knight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks, atm I'm level 13 with about 400 to 500hp. With Temp I have about 1.4k HP with over 400AC so I think I can probably tank quite well.<br />
<br />
I just pratice taunt because my SK friend says its hard to get the skill up in it once your a higher level. And its quite easy I just hit the 2 key over and over again. Lol<br />
<br />
And whats funny is I didn't even pay over 1k to twink him. Alot of the stuff he has is from my SK friend Thwort.<br />
<br />
Haste Gloves, can't wait till level 21! Woo!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Stwongbad Soulkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Clinging darkness is the easiest, most mana effecient way to get/keep aggro.  The terror spells also work pretty well, for me anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Black Knight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I was wrong, I have a little over 600HP unbuffed at level 13. :D<br />
<br />
Right now I'm trying to get level 15 so I start fear kiting and get a better pet.. (I need a better one... God...)<br />
<br />
I'll take you guy's advice on how to hold agro. And anyway, heres my profile if you guys have any suggestions let me know. I may try to break the 700HP mark tommorow.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aimbot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Don't group at that level. Go to Paludal Caverns from the Shadeweaver side and solo shrooms and those crab things. Xp will go much faster, trust me. Also, get a fast one hander. At your level the only thing that matters is delay, since you cant hit for more than 30 I believe.<br />
<br />
Start looking for a group at lvl 16-17.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Arcmus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">WOOOO another Human SK!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Duke Xerro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I meant that you dont need to keep hitting taunt once your skill is maxed (keep smashing taunt until skill maxes :D)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Black Knight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well, right now its about 72. So thats good, and today I out tanked a Troll SK. :p <br />
<br />
Anyway, I sat in the bazaar last night casting spellz on that bank guard getting my skill up.<br />
<br />
And atm I like my weapon just fine, its good enough. =)</div></div><hr />

Use your begging Macro in conjunction with your taunt. It does add aggro (dont believe me just go beg from a npc and wait till he smacks you). <br />
<br />
Bashing from rear stuns more often = pissed off mob.<br />
<br />
Proximity to mob plays a small part in aggro. If you and a Pally are at the same number of hate but your closer guess who gets the prize!<br />
<br />
Keep Begging and Taunting when you solo...ding 13 now taunt and beg till you get the next 5 additional points for those skills.<br />
<br />
Aggro gaining spells at 14 disease cloud (9)used to piss em off like no tomorrow, I think it was nerfed a little though. 15 will bring you CD a spell you will use to gain aggro in your Reaver levels for that alone! Mobs hate the darkness line! Resisted Fear gets their attention as well, assuming your tanking a mob and your group is frantically healing you (High Con) and you spells are getting resisted anyways.<br />
<br />
As puller (if it isnt you) calls incoming fire one arrow at it to establish yourself on the mobs aggro list as close to the top as you can. Their is some mad logic behind this one but from a player who doesnt devote every day of the week to the game it does seem to help me when Im the &quot;Chanter/Cleric help Im gettin a beat down tank!&quot;<br />
<br />
Max all your skills you can, Weapon and Spell skills. Find a spell that is most mana efficent to recast over and over to get that skill up, but you play a mage so you probably already are all to familiar with the reson why for that. <br />
<br />
Dont be like Reaver StihlBohrn and run around looking for mobs to bring your peircing from 5 to 200+, tust me its not fun!<br />
<br />
As ou get more powrfull your next questin will be how is it that I cant keep from gaining aggro?<br />
<br />
Hope this helps! <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Koldariah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hey!<br />
I started my SK (human female - like me :p) a little while ago. She's about to break 30 now. <br />
<br />
So is it better to train ALL your weapons at the same time or just try and max out on 1 or 2. Right now shes about 145/150 on her 2HS and 148/150 on her 1HS. I just started training her piercing cause I bought a really sweet (imho) 2H pierce and I wanna use it. The question being, wouldnt you start falling behind on maxing your skills as you level if your trying to max 5 or 6 instead of 1 or 2? <br />
<br />
I have been pumping my skill points everytime I level into the weapons to try and keep them as close to max as I can, but with more than 2 thats going to start bein a real pain in my ass. That, and wouldn't it be better for holdin your aggro if you were actually doing some damage instead of stickin it for the big 2pts?<br />
 <br />
-kold</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ancatdub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The question being, wouldnt you start falling behind on maxing your skills as you level if your trying to max 5 or 6 instead of 1 or 2?  <br />
<br />
No. Long as you rotate them on a regular basis per level you shouldn't fall behind. I tried to max all my weapon skills each level. You may not have all of them maxed at a given point but you'll be able to keep them all within 10 points of your max unless you were being PL'd. The only weapon skill I didn't keep up with was piercing. And guess what I was awarded on a raid one night...Shard of Night. Nothing is more boring than running around asking folks if you can stab their MOB and earning 0 exp. <br />
<br />
Right now I'm trying to get level 15 so I start fear kiting and get a better pet.. (I need a better one... God...) <br />
<br />
:D  Face it now...your pet will always be weak in comparison to NEC. Nothing is more sad than running across a SK who doens't use a pet &quot;because they suck&quot;. Go be a warrior or a necro then. And it's best to learn pet control now rather than when your pet gets a bit better post 50. IMO your pet is a viable source of damage 90-95% of the time. Damage is damage is damage.<br />
<br />
Almost forgot....yeah Human Sk's</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>yuggoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">As a former mage, you should not think of the SK pet as a real pet, but as a very long lasting DOT.  He adds damage, gives you a few seconds to escape, and will laugh at your jokes - what more do you want?  <br />
<br />
Don't expect to do a lot of serious fearkiting at 15 - your mana pool will not be big enough, and the snare you get is not that good.  But, it is worth the practice.  You get engulfing darkness at 22, that works pretty well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Xikuliz Litecleaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I never worried about training weapon skills on my SK too much, since when I made him I was a true newbie and I couldn't even afford to keep the fine steel I found.<br />
<br />
It's not hard training the skills at higher levels if you go to a few raids, where nobody will really notice your damage anyway, and then work up unused weapon skills.  I didn't train 2hb until the early 50's and it's capped now at 55.  It does take awhile, but nothing to lose sleep over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Zero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">imo human isn't  a great choice but race doesnt matter in the higher end :p<br />
get ALL your weapon skills at least above 120 as soon as you can. its boring as hell trying to raise them in the higher levels. and as for doing it on raids...I find that mildly offensive..I mean shit why the hell should you even get a chance at anything that drops when your contributing next to nothing to the raid?<br />
also-I think I tried putting beg on my macro once a while ago but I got a message similiar to &quot;You cannot beg while attacking.&quot; they change this or was I hallucinating?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Koldariah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Originally posted by Zero <br />
I tried putting beg on my macro once a while ago but I got a message similiar to &quot;You cannot beg while attacking.&quot; they change this or was I hallucinating?  <br />
Nope, that's what I see. I think you need to stop attacking for a second, beg and then start attacking again. I still haven't gotten around to trying it but I will soon</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Zero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Well that would most likely work I guess but I doubt that the dps lost between attack being turned off then on would justify the very very small amount of aggro beg might give.<br />
