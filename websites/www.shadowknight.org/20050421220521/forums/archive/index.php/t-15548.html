<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grotar Von Smash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have two questions:<br />
<br />
1) I have spent about 70 hours camping the Crypt Raider and was later told he was broken and was not spawning.  Is this true and does anyone have info on finding this out?<br />
<br />
<br />
2) Did they revamp Droga and is there any info on how that affected the quest with Argent?<br />
<br />
Any info would be greatly appreciated, those are all I need for the completion of the Lord of Pain's Kukri.<br />

Not sure about the failed crypt raider, tho I know Xulia got her Lord's Khukri recently.  The Droga guys all got moved to the old burynai caves in SW FM, not just Argest but the monk shackle guy, Rukgus, etc.  Much easier to deal with, and not a bad place to faction hunt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grotar Von Smash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Awesome!  THats good news, thanks Yugg!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">So are you saying that  the Keys and the Enslaved Iksar etc is now in FM??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hollenritter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I killed the crypt raider fairly recently (within  a few weeks).  He spawned just as we were about to give up for the day.  All I can say is, keep at it, and make sure you're in the right place.  library area, same area the ghost spawns for the iksar monk shackle quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grotar Von Smash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well Last night we got the crypt raider after about three hours of camping.  Myself and my shammy friend went to the Burynai caves and got two of the keys.  One more and I get my piece from Argent.<br />
<br />
My biggest fear is the Jail.  I know I am going to have trouble with that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tumek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ok, I have two questions.<br />
<br />
<br />
Does anyone have an approximate /loc as to where the Failed Crypt Raider spawns?<br />
<br />
Also, I got all the keys for Argest today, and when I gave him the Bone Necklace, Bone Key, and Stone Key, he returned to me the Bone Key and gave me a &quot;A Coarse Iron Needle&quot;.  Is this the correct item?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tumek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ok Tumek, this is Tumek,<br />
<br />
You found out that the FCR spawns on the bottom floor of the library and can be VERY rare (it took you four days of camping to get him).<br />
<br />
&quot;A Coarse Iron Needle&quot; is indeed the correct item. <br />
<br />
As for other information regarding the Hero and Lord of Pain khukris, it took about 5 hours for you to get the three scrolls off spectral couriers, and four or so to get the mistmoore ones.  You apparently were really lucky with the Kly Imprecator spawn in the Laboratory, it spawned within' an hour for you, but the kly in the church took maybe 8 to 10 hours.  Not sure if you were lucky with Argest and the keys, or what, but you got all the keys in about two hours.<br />
<br />
Finally, everything in all the quests up through Lord of Pain is soloable at 51 with non-twink equipment (Tumek plays on Stromm, so there is even less possibility of twink).  The only place where having a partner was truly helpful was camping the couriers in CoM, since the mobs can be a difficult solo at 51.  Everything else was a breeze.<br />
<br />
Good luck SK's<br />

<br />
1)<br />
I know you already went over this a hundred times, but can anyone please tell me, where exactly the FCR spawns?<br />
I heard rumors his PHs are A Tome Keeper and An Iksar Spectre, which both spawn inside the library upstairs in the NW corner.<br />
Can anyone confirm this?<br />
<br />
2) Has anyone done the part with the turn in of the keys to Argest since the revamp of Droga? I 'd like to know how dangerous it is now to get there, how tough the mobs are, etc.<br />
<br />
Any comments (well, almost any :) ) are appreciated!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Hollenritter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Best advice for FCR.<br />
<br />
Kill the library.  Kill anything and everything in and around it.  When he spawned for me, he was standing at the entrance on one side of the library.  If I remember right, it was the back side.  He spawned after about 3-4 hours for me.<br />
<br />
As for Argest..  sounds like he's in the caves in FM now, close to the lake of ill omen zone.  I'd check there.  Collecting the three keys will likely be a pain.  I got the first two quick, took forever to get the last one.  You don't need to go into droga for the turn in, from what I hear.  But the machine is still there apparently.  Invis works.  If you're not a short race, get shrink potions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ciredorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Thanks for the quick answer :)<br />
<br />
I just asked about the FCR because it was a quite frustrating experience sitting 10 hrs in Kaesora, killing everything in and around the library in vain. But I guess I 'm not the only one who suffers from Verant's time sink quests ;)<br />
<br />
I only need the scroll from Kaesora, I even have all the keys from the goblin caves in FM  (if you 're using the map from www.eqatlas.com it's the entrance marked with &quot;B&quot; ) but I didn't see Argest. Maybe he was not up. I 'll check again.<br />
<br />
Good Luck to you all,<br />

Camp by the fountain and he should spawn in the left corner before you enter the main room of the library.  When you see him he is a normal human looking skeleton, not a ghost or those annoying iksar skeletons.  His place holders are the trash that sits in the bottom of the library like the minions and servants of xalgoz and the other sarnak ghost (the name escapes me now).  Do not touch the tortured librarian or the Tome Keeper.  THey do give negitive faction to the Brood of Kotiz.  Just be patient, he eventually showed up for me.</div></div><hr />

If you do not have access to a Greenish Metal SHard by now, be prepared to feel one of the worst stings that SOny can apply.  I had an easier time getting a mirror MQ than getting that shard.  Its rarely on sale in the bazaar and when a group of friends and guild members took me into Chardok, spending 2 and a half hours to fight our way to the three bridges, we wipe.  I have done everything now 'cept to forge the sword, and its depressing.  Just one stupid piece.<br />
<br />
<br />
I only need the scroll from Kaesora, I even have all the keys from the goblin caves in FM  (if you 're using the map from www.eqatlas.com it's the entrance marked with &quot;B&quot; ) but I didn't see Argest. Maybe he was not up. I 'll check again.<br />
 <br />
<br />
Argest is the one on the left in the caves.  Some people looking to get sarnak faction kill the slaves too.  The spawn every 2 hours or so, from when I sat in there and some guy came in and killed them while me and a shammy friend were clearing the room.  So he is there.  Your biggest problem is in negotiating Droga, if you are below 55, its deadly, and even then its not a cakewalk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ciredorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Thanks for the information, Grotar, this will help a lot.<br />
<br />
I see a lot of painful experiences coming on my way to my Greemnist ....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kentsin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I think they may have changed the rarity of the failed crypt raider. Or me and some other monk are just real lucky. I walked into the library in Kaesora and the failed crypt raider was standing there waiting for me. Killed him, looted, walked my way over to City of Mist. There happens to be a monk there killing the stable area for couriers so I join him. Well we are talking and I end up finding out about half an hour before I went to Kaesora, he was there, and the failed crypt raider was up when he walked down there too.<br />
<br />
Maybe they've changed it? Or we just got real lucky. I'm now sitting in the CoM stables alone..2 scrolls to go...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tumek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I can say from personal experience that the FCR still has the possibility of being a *very* annoying camp.  I just finished camping him last SAturday (8/2/03) after four days of camping for about five hours a day.<br />
<br />
As for Argest - I was probably very lucky, but I got all my keys within two spawns of the goblins in the room.  I simply gave my keys to &quot;an enslaved iksar&quot; and I got the &quot;A Coarse Iron Needle&quot; which is the right item.<br />
<br />
Good Luck, <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Nazgaull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Well... <br />
<br />
I finally got this guy. <br />
<br />
Out of all the scrolls for the Stupendous Tome I would have to say that this guy was the hardest.  He just would not spawn.<br />
<br />
But, he eventually did, around 2:30am EST on Bertoxxulous Server.<br />
<br />
I friend and I were camping the library all night, started around maybe 9pm... took a half hour break, and took some time to go beat up ole Xalgoz for his fang, which he dropped 2 of.<br />
<br />
Anyway, since information seems so sketchy on this Failed Cryt Raider and no one can confirm that he spawns upstairs or downstairs in the Library...<br />
<br />
Well, we sat upstairs, where we could over look the downstairs.  <br />
<br />
We were just doubting his existance when I looked down, and he walked through the hall!<br />
<br />
So I jumped down and pulled him up and before I killed him... <br />
<br />
I took his picture.<br />
