<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>nnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A guildmate of mine tried the invis trick to hand in the Soul leech to Duriek, but when he did so, he got the response:<br />
<br />
&quot;I will do nothing to aid the likes of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
I decided that this meant the sword was eaten, so I didn't turn in the rest of the items. I'd rather stay at the same place I am in the quest than get bumped back 3 steps.<br />
<br />
Still, does anyone know if this means the sword was eating or was that actually a successful trade that would have resulted in a good MQ? Just curious.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ganodoar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It is clear nnod that your friend forgot to con Duriek and no doubt failed to successfully hide. ALWAYS make sure to double check on that when doing the hide trick. Hell I am at apprehensive and when I turn in the decrepit hide, platinum bar, and the drake spine I am going to use the hide trick.<br />
<br />
Even though I have enough faction for the turn-in to Teydar and Duriek it is not worth risking the hardest pieces of the epic. That hide is not worth losing especially cause for all we know it could take 400+ drakes before another drops. Same with Soul Leech, BOA and Ghoulbane. Moreso with Soul Leech cause the Ireblind Imp makes Fear break-ins a pain now.<br />
