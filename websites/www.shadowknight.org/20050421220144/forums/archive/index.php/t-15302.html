<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Steelbreeze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">With the recent revamp of droga ive heard various rumors of the quest npcs for this and several other quests being moved outside of droga into Frontier Mountains.  So i decided to go have a look for myself and i walk due east out of Burning Woods zoneline in FM and found the cave, mostly green cons, 1 lblue, i ran through it all invis to check it, in the very end there was a strathbone spider up, and 2 iksar slaves, i went to entrance buffed up cast pet and worked my way down.  After clearing the end room a couple times i hailed the iksar prisoner and one gave the normal text the other gave the steel shackle bit.  Theres 3 bigger areas to these caves and hadnt cleared the other 2  so didnt know if any1 knew for a fact what got moved.  Any other info would be helpful since i just need my Stone Key.  Also, i didnt see the always works pottery wheel so im assuming thats still in the jail.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sasasaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Checked this morning. Goblin Penmaster and Pen Keeper spawn in the same room as the Iksar slaves. Both appear to be on a 19 to 20 minute timer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Graack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The penmaster and penkeepers have been moved to the goblin caves in Frontier Mountains!  And this is a good thing because theese goblins are green to my 58th level SK and I can solo them forever!<br />
<br />
The &quot;Contraption&quot;, however, has not been moved and is deep in the new Droga!<br />
<br />
To get to it takes a long and perilous journey past many a dark blue goblin!  These goblins do not see invis, so you can hurry past them while invis.  Once you get to the jail you will be in for a treat.  Entering the jail requires a key from the janitor!<br />
<br />
When I undertook this quest the other day and arrived at the jail I discovered that an old friend was ensconced within!  He opened the doors for me and gave me his key!  This was a lucky turn of events!  Otherwise I would have had to enlist a team of stalwart companions to undertake this journey with me!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>yuggoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Can you get into the cell using shrink - like before?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Furiousgeorge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You can still use shrink as before I just did it succesfully. You can also fall into the jail via the trapdoor.  Kill a Gobby Janitor (cons light blue to a 65 and is a pushover) to get Droga Jail key (lore, no rent) to get out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Undevine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks everyone for the information.  Im about to do this part on the Stromm server.  I havent herd of anyone getting thier Greenmist on that server yet. Maybe I'll be the first. *shrug*</div></div><hr />
