<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dolaan</div><div class="date">03-29-2002, 07:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I have worked for 53 lvls having great faction at the outpost I have the hammer and everything, but I went to Charasis with a few guild members, dammit it was when the faction messages were screwed up.  I totally forgot it screwed up outpost faction.  Well  now I am VERY KOS  and I was only there for 3 hrs.  I know there is a way to use the hammer and avoid agro in the outpost.  I have the pre-nerf CoS if that helps me at all.  <br />
<br />
Any ideas</div></div><hr />

Then walk out westward invis and swim around the outpost if you want 100% safety. If you dont mind a little risk then just run thru the door invis, but remember the skelly patrols will see you so you can get aggro that way. Still possible to zone em with jboots I think, or feign em off.<br />
All in hammer is still very useable and you can even bank. For safe banking wait till nite then general walks out, if feeling brave just run in bank invis and feign near banker, then bank as long as you want, get up and circlet invis</div></div><hr />
