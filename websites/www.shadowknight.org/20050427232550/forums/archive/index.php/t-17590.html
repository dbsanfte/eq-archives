<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Darkdogg Bonegrinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have/had a level 56 Dark Elf Shadowknight on Tarew Marr that a buddy of mine got sick of and gave it to me. I played him for some time, got him some great gear, leveled him to 57, and gave him back. I loved playing the Shadowknight but I wanted to get high levels under my own merits. So, I made a Troll SK on the Lanys Server. I know no one on the Lanys server, and have never played here before, because I dont want any friends giving me any equipment or Powerleveling me. I leveled him to 4 in about 90 mintues, and have gotten just about a full set of cloth armor from decaying skeletons. I do have all the expansions as well. I have been playing EQ since month 2 back in '99, and have had some mid-range characters that I have leveled under my own power, but I have been the happiest with the ShadowKnight. I put my starting points into STR/STA and INT. Both my STR and STA are 125, and my INT is like 67. Is there any advice that you feel might be useful to me? I would like constructive criticism please.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Raven of Doom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Id say jack up your INT as much as you can. str and stam come naturally for a troll, but if you neglect your studies you'll end up oom just when you need a crucial lifetap. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Starting anew with a untwinked toon on a server your not familiar with is very valiant seeing as you had a lvl 57 well-geared sk in your possesion. I would suggest to just level up and get gear as it comes; playing the sk class to the best of your ability. Gear really doesnt matter a whole lot at any stage of the game except for boasting rights ( the way I play anyway) and if you learn all the tricks of the trade you will be 50+ soon. I'd recommend darkforge tho for  starters, as the quests aren't very hard and the armor is pretty good. after that you may want to look into tradeskills to earn yourself some money, or just farm. either way gear will come and leveling will come easier. I do recommend more intelligence though...:p</div></div><hr />

You might also want to do the newbie armor quests.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>UnholyWarrior</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Using hides from bears and silks from the various spiders et al in Neriak, make yourself hide armour (ups your tailoring skill while you are at it); should keep you busy for a few more levels...<br />
<br />
At lvl 11-ish, quest the newbie armor (Dark Bashers armor); should keep you busy until 15 or so (with some long waits for some crucial peices).  Wouldn't recommend the dark forge until well in your 20's (unless you want to buy the no drop peices)...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lizarde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Troll Shadow Knight Newbie Armor quests (http://www.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q149&amp;menustr=120070000000)<br />
<br />
They're a great way to get some decent armor that can hold you over until you are ready to try questing Darkforge (or until you can start getting points for LDoN armor).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Apokx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Totals for the armor:<br />
AC: 36<br />
INT: +11<br />
AGI: +22<br />
STR: +2<br />
WT: 26.5<br />
<br />

Very nice for any Level 10ish player with limited plat.~.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Azaezel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Depends how far you want to take your toon. I honestly think almost no matter the class sta is the way to go. Hps matter a ton, even for casters. My sta isn't max I'm E-flagged and guild just got time flagged...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ziglug D</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Then ur one of the ones that didnt get the EP armor =P</div></div><hr />
