<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>smoses799</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Im trying formulate a &quot;battle plan&quot; to obtain my 1.5 epic. Im decently equiped atm, you can checkout my gear in my sig.  However, Im unsure what i should beable to solo vs what ill need to have a group vs what ill need a several groups for.  From what i have read, our epic is incredibly easy compaired to other classes. So, I figured that I would just post the mobs that are needed and let the rest of you inform me on what Id probably need assistance on  . &lt;note: most of the info has been pasted from a epic guide and some fights&gt;<br />
<br />
--Pre-1.5 epic req--<br />
<br />
1. Captain Varns in Dulak's Harbor (AOE slow, slow casting, 500DD ! Patch made this guy TOUGH hits for 1900's reported, combined with is AOE hes nasty! Thinking like 2 groups on this one<br />
<br />
2. Overlord R' Gahbsa in the Plane of Hate or Mistress of Malevolience (this is probably soloable)<br />
<br />
3. Olidan in the Plane of Storms (1600 hitting Ocean giant, rampages but slowable.) Thinking like 2 groups here also<br />
<br />
--1.5 epic req--<br />
<br />
4. Murkglider Breeder in city of dranik. You need to kill him, doable with a group with the right tactics. He spawns 6 Murkglider Spawn during the fight. Quad 940 max, the spawn hit for the same and flurry. &lt;one groupable meybe if spawns can be kited away&gt;<br />
<br />
5. Get 3 items... this is probably soloable or easily farmed w/ a group<br />
1. Lock of blessed Unicorn Hair ( PoG drop from A rolling plains steed)<br />
2. Eye of the Dark God ( Pofear amy drop)<br />
3. Gloom Nightmare Hide ( PoN drop of Gloom Nightmare horses at the platform)<br />
<br />
6. Fragda in Valor-- He quads 2850, rampages, has low atk, summons and casts paladin spells Partial slowable, unsnareable, does not summon.---- one groupable<br />
<br />
7. The Wailing Sister. Ponightmare, (Max hit 920, ae cloud of fear) .. definately one groupable<br />
<br />
8. Kill 4 sk's--<br />
   1, (Timorous Deep) Silithis Sisnta is an iksar, quad for 1170 max,   <br />
   harmtouch, and cast SK spells, unsnareable, summons<br />
<br />
    2. (Ocean of Tears) Gubblegrot Smashfist is an ogre, quad for 1170 max, <br />
    harmtouch, and cast SK spells, unsnareable, procs a small lifetap <br />
    frequently.<br />
<br />
    3. (Swamp of no Hope) Skurza Slickutt is a troll, quad for 1170 max,   <br />
    harmtouch, and cast SK spells, unsnareable, summons, and procs Deadly  <br />
    Lifetap. (Traks proc, 1500LT)<br />
<br />
    4. (Iceclad) Giligattabus Igglebix is a gnome, quad for 1170 max,   <br />
    harmtouch, and cast SK spells, doesn’t summon, snares easily, probably <br />
    soloable.<br />
<br />
9. kill 6 pallies and get their blood--- single group event in Kith forrest...<br />
<br />
10..FINAL --Kill Sir Elmonious Falmont quads for 3500, casts an AE for 2khp/1kmana, and does a single target 2 second stun. AE is every minute at -175 prismatic check, stun is every 30sec unresistable. He also single target rampages. &lt;this seems like a 3 or 4 group thing to me.&gt;<br />
<br />
Now, in terms of things i could solo, we are looking at: PoH mistress and the gnome pally...i think <br />
<br />
Ideally, I'm really hoping to beable to use this thread to help me &quot;schedule out&quot; my epic.  Im hoping that i will beable to constuct a viable timeline w/ the force needed for each fight after reading the replies i get to this.  I then would be able to pre-arrange each epic fight and let the ppl who's aid im going to enlist know ahead of time when, where, and what ill need them for. <br />
<br />

<br />
so what do you think? :p  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Croix VorAbaddon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Assuming everyone else is at the gear level you are at:<br />
<br />
1. More than likely so, hard to say, given I did him before the patch, but the fight stats I'm reading say as much. Just make sure your healers adjust themselves beforehand for the spell slow to keep the heal chain ready.<br />
<br />
2. I'd assume so. Bring a healer, preferably a druid, to keep the downtime to a minimum.<br />
<br />
3. At that gear level? Certainly. Did him easily with a force of about 13 with no gear above Sol Ro Tower during a BoT key run. Only thing to watch is push, since getting him up a tree can wipe you.<br />
<br />
4. Read up on the pull tactics. Some have figured out clever little ways to single pull him. But make sure the group is aware they may be camping a PH, or just check for when it's spawned.<br />
<br />
5. Yay for agriculture!<br />
<br />
6. Did him with about 10, again no better gear than Sol Ro. Not that difficult, just spiky DPS. Make sure the healer knows this before hand and quick heals.<br />
<br />
8. Bring lag repellant for SoNH... maybe a tracker if you don't know the locations. Bout all I can offer.<br />
<br />
And that's about the extent of my knowledge of the epic fights so far. I've read up on them, but you can find t he first hand accounts in this section. Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>smoses799</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">any other thoughts on this? any advice on order or numbers needed? ect...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Trysbrina67</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Everything is 1 groupable or soloable by someone with your gear (and your group mates are similiarly geared) save for the Final Fight.<br />
Breeder Camp you might have some trouble getting people to join you unless it is up, the camp isn't exactly fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>smoses799</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">thanks, guess im just a little nervous about the thought of trying to most of this solo.  :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Moardok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Breeder Camp you might have some trouble getting people to join you unless it is up, the camp isn't exactly fun.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tyrs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Captain Varn only hits for 1300, AE rampages , 500dd ae, 50% slow,spell slow and snare AE.<br />
<br />
2 groups of Pre ele is easy kill.<br />
<br />
He has 200k hps, takes a while to kill with the slows.<br />
<br />
Bring 2 healers makes it easier and lots of casters.<br />
Melees take a while to kill him.<br />
<br />
-----------------<br />
Olidan can be done by less than 1 group.<br />
hits for 1600 rampages, think it was normal rather than ae rampage.<br />
<br />
Did him with Me SK, War, cleric,ench and druid.<br />
<br />
War at around 11k hps.<br />
<br />
Ench and druid Cod pets.</div></div><hr />
