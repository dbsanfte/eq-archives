That used to be one of the log in screens when I first started playing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Belyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you meet those requirements you also qualify to be a developer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Derraj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">That used to be one of the log in screens when I first started playing.<br />
an yet, it hasn't been updated. I got the link from current news on the official site, saying we want you to become a guide(or something similiar) and the gave a link to that site. so, I'm guessing it hasn't changed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Apokx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I applied to be a guide,friend got in..but no reply for me yet.<br />

Iirc you have to have an account in good standing,and I'm 90% sure I have a couple warnings from training/starting faction wars etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kroolhand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Those are artificial level guides though, in that no one with 2 level 10 toons will be able to answer the questions on the app. I applied once. I can't recall if it was at the end of the Velious era, or justa at the start of Luclin.<br />
<br />
At the time I had a 45 Main and a 35 alt and prolly 4 or so other toons over 20 across a couple of servers. I'm thinking I'm pretty well overqualified. But part of the application process had you looking at pix of zones and labeling them. <br />
<br />
I'm sure most have seen all those zones now, but before the PoK stones, and come to think of it even after, no level 10 could have survived long enough to gain the pre-requisite knowledge.<br />
<br />
That's probably academic now though, as I don't think I have seen a TRUE noob in at least 2 years. Even the greenest player (who is asking stuff like: why did the gnomes agro me in wolf form in IC...or How do I get up into Kelethin?) usually turns out to be someone who's rl friend got them to play...and as soon as he signs on his 65 necro he's gonna.....etc.</div></div><hr />
