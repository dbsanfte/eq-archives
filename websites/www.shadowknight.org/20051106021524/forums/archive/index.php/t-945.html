<br />
I'm new to EQ (bought game in Feb 2002) and I have a 32 DE SK currently hunting the Lower Guk dungeon.<br />
<br />
I was wondering if there are any SK item/armor/weapon quests that I or a group can do for this level?<br />
<br />
I've been looking through the message boards here, but almost all of the quests I've seen are for higher levels.  Maybe I've just missed the info posted for around my level.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for the help!<br />

You will probably need some help there though, the crusaders can be tough, but the healers are worse. Do a search on darkforge here or on any site. Tons of info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vali Evillica</div><div class="date">04-22-2002, 11:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Darkforge Armor Quests are perfect for that level.  They used to be based in Cazic Thule but now they revamped that dungeon and its 55+.  But, they took all the special mobs (including the Crusaders) and moved them outside of Cazic in The Feerott.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Looks like I must have mis-read the Darkforge messages.  Going back to re-read them now!<br />
<br />
Thanks again!<br />

I'm packing a nice shoulder piece,a meditate cap for downtime,and an AC 10 w/stats haste belt-and I've barely scratched the sub-bosses...never even finished a war.<br />
 <br />
Plus,it's fun being able to determine what spawns where and even reset the whole thing if you like-by winning. At low levels,I'd avoid letting the grimlings win,though you want them to at least take over the owlbears (wolves/grimlings are best for nice SK loot,IMHO). <br />
 <br />
A group of mid 30's will have a blast here. A well-equipped mid 30's SK can have a field day looting the named spawns,but won't be able to change what spawns where without help.</div></div><hr />

Any info on this would be much appreciated. The mob that drops it and level of it and stuff like that. :D</div></div><hr />
