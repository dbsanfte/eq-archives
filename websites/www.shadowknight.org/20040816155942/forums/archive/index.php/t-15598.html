<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kizzestra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">For DE SK Newbie quest armor? They are unbeleivably rare. Try the skellies near the zone to Lavastorm and near EC, they are still like a 1 in 1000 drop, but better than 1 in 10000 drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gashrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I searched in Nektulos forest for days for a Calcified Sternum, without finding one. Apparently they don't even drop from calcifieds, only greater skeletons drop them, and only extremely rarely. Given the slow spawn of greaters, coupled with the rarity of the drop, and the fact that every Sk in the zone was looking for one, I decided to try the skeletons in Toxx forest. I managed to get one in there in just about an hour and a half. I don't know if I was simply lucky, but I don't think so. They were dropping all manner of calcified bones, maybe 2/3 of the time, so even if the sternum is kind of a rare drop, it'll still come up fairly fast I recommend having sense the dead hotkeyed.<br />

Good Hunting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gamluk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I needed this also as a Troll but after killing tons of skellies I gave up since it seemed to be REALLY rare. I heard that it should drop from Greater Skeletons in Nektulos but didn't have any luck with them myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Moreeta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I can confirm it drops ONLY off of greater skellies.<br />
<br />
Good hunting!!!<br />
<br />
The BP was my last piece.<br />
<br />
Was nice having the full set.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gashrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I can confirm that it does not drop off of only Greater skeletons, hence my post. It drops from Greater skeletons in Nek forest. It will not drop from Greater skeletons anywhere else, that I'm aware of.<br />
It will, however, also drop from normal skeletons in Toxx Forest. Kill all the decayed's that you find, and you will start to find more normal skeletons, using 'sense the dead'. They drop calcified bones at about a 2 out of 3 ratio. You will probably get a Calcified Sternum in about 90 minutes.<br />
Good Hunting.</div></div><hr />
