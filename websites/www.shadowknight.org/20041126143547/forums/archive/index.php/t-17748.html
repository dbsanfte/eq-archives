<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>AkumaShreddies</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Could a 49 SK solo the Cristaline shardwurms in GD caves?<br />
<br />
TIA</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wolff-Kishner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I did with valor and 56 Shaman buffs.  Personally, I feel the xp is better elsewhere.  If you're soloing them for you shawl, then I'm sorry it was boring for me.  I pulled the first few that wandered up to the entrance of the cave, then I fear kited them a few feet outside the opening.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>AkumaShreddies</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I was told you can get Shroud of Pain as a drop from them. So not really safe to farm them at 49?<br />
<br />
TIA</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wolff-Kishner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I bought shroud of pain in the bazaar for about 25pp.  If you're planning on farming them for that reason, I'd recommend against it.  If you need platinum, look at Ramgar's post in this thread.  He put together a really good list on how to get pp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>wwxc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Not to mention the xp blows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ramgar SK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I camped them for a whole night with a group around that level and after about 4 hours one finally dropped.  So I would say it was pretty uncommon off them.<br />
<br />
Unless your gear is quite outstanding, I would recommend against trying to solo them.<br />
<br />
Like mentioned by Wolff-Kishner, the bazaar is your best bet.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Paynreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Shroud of Pain is EASILY bought on the cheap. Also, you'll stop using it soon enough anyway (Torrents).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Xikuliz Litecleaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Echo Caves, off Shadowhaven on Luclin is the place to be at 49.  Kill the hell out of gnomes.  Kill the 4 guards, theres plenty of room to fear kite, they path well.  Leave the casters on the right alone, they're annoying.  The next mob is in the upper room on the right, kill him.  Then farther on the back right wall, closest to you, is a rogue mob, fear kite him as usual.  The spawn time is 20 minutes to so, and you'll establish a good pace after a couple runs.<br />
<br />
The King of Above and King of Below are tricky.  First you have to know the zone, which isn't hard.  It's not echo caves where the evil trainers are, it's another entrance and place altogether.  It the one that leads to the deep if you wanna check eqatlas.  I've never killed the king of above, but to split them you have to pull the king of below (you know this because he'll scowl at gather shadows, when your faction craps out).  Pull with dooming darkness, and run like hell.  A cleric, the other king, and 2 other melees higher level than the guards will join in.  Run to the Deep with the king of above not far behind.  Try to zone when he's in the middle of the big chamber so people like me can avoid him.  Run back and you'll see the King of Below sitting whereever he was when you zoned in.  The Kings don't move from where they deaggro.  If you try to split with FD, you drop, and they sit down until you get back up again.  If you /q you'll log on and they'll be right there unless there is a patch.  I'm not sure if the king of below is fearable, but he's snarable.  You'd have to try to straight tank him, and i'd wait til 55 so you can DS yourself. <br />
<br />
Anyway, at 49 the levels flew til 52 here.  Echo caves rocks.  Generally feared mobs flee toward the zone out to Shadowhaven.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am in PoJ mostly now. half a level a night, pretty good I think</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Taeluuan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I noticed many people dont like to start up their own group but the best exp you will find is form a group with people that are higher levels than you. Get a group for PoD or PoJ with a low 50's tank and a slower with a couple high level DPS classes and head to places where things will con yellow to you. the others will like the exp and you will see much better exp. It will be hard at 49 to build a group but hit 50 or so and they will go much easier. I was in PoJ or KC at that level and made incredible exp at both if you can chain pull. If you get a mid 50's tank head off to PoI exp is much better there and the best time to build groups i have found is late at night.</div></div><hr />

The faction hit for killing gnomes in Echo Caverns is only with the gnomes there, and as far as I know not used anywhere else.  The hits are Kingdom of the Above and Kingdom of the Below.</div></div><hr />
