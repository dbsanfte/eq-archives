<br />
When I played with a Beastlord alt a while back, I remember there was a table they (the Beastlords) had made showing what kind of weapons you should give to your pet. I was wondering/hoping a similar table could be found somewhere for ours? I've been giving mine rusty far'eshs, since thats they seem to trump all the others. I'm not sure what stats to look for, or even what kind of weapons. <br />
<br />
Any help?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Skvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There used to be something on the necro boards about this and seeing how our pets are the necro pets they get an earlier level their boards might be a good place to go look.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Daemoness</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Use mage toys.<br />
Muzzle of Mardu (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=1348) - 11% worn haste<br />
Belt (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=28594)/Girdle of Magi'Kot (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3044&amp;source=Live) - 250hp, 10 to physicals for belt. 500hp, 15 to all physicals for girdle<br />
Fist of Ixiblat (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=28596)- 50hp, h2h weapon that procs fire DD at the pet lvl of 12<br />
Blade of Walnan (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3041&amp;source=Live)/Kedge (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=28597) - 50hp, 1hs that proc at pet lvl of 40 (Walnan = magic DD, Kedge = Cold DD)<br />
<br />
But if you wanted to go all out you coulf ask a mage to summon a full set of plate armor (76ac all up) and focus item (non-visable slot hp).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Oagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yep, what Daemoness said.  Although, I like skinny weilding swords more than the fists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Klaaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Also, for our early pets that don't have dual-wield, grab a Weighty Polearm in the bazaar for 25 - 50pp.  This will be even better once the pet zoning goes live.  With the way pet damage works, even you first bag of bones will be able to hit for a max in the 60's, which at that level cna make a signficant difference.<br />
<br />
The downside is that it is obviously gone afterwards, and since they are lore, you can't stock up on them.  Just an idea for SK's in their earlier years.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>SweetMeef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I was wondering about this also.<br />
So the proc on Blade of Kedge does work for our 64 pet???<br />
That's good news. I'll start bugging guildies for those when soloing tables.<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The proc on the blades also seems to have a stun.  My shaman goes no where w/o those or the gnoll hide lariat's from Splitpaw</div></div><hr />

<br />
Although pets don't use no drop items, they do ignore the lore tag. One jewlery bag will give 2 bracers but if you want to bug mages more, ask them for a second ring and earring once you give the first ones to your pet. Total AC gain is 57 and 160hp. I'm not sure if the recommended level on the focus items affects the pets or not (with lower level pets that is) but even the lowest level pet would get some benefit from the items if the recommended level does decrease the value of the stats. Also remember that if you give your pet the 2 focus bracers, you don't need to give it the two summoned phantom plate bracers.<br />

If your pet duel weilds, make sure to give it the two weapons before giving it the shield. If your pet doesn't duel weild, give it two of these things (one for back and one for secondary).<br />
