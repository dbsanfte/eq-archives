I just started a lvl 6 DE SK and I noticed that most of the newbie players in Nektuloss were SKs. I was thinking about an Erudite to be different. <br />

Has anyone ever made an Erudite and then travelled to the Dark Elf land and was able to train/bank there?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any info.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But overall, play whichever class you think you'll have fun with.</div></div><hr />

I played a few diffrent classes before trying my sk but when i did i was extremly happy with it. <br />
I've leveled up to 28 right now and i still enjoy every sec of it. <br />
<br />
I have not, however, been to the darkelf home and tried to bank or train there. I do believe it is possible and if not im shure it would only take an hour or so to change it. <br />
<br />
If your on Tarrew Marr feel free to give me a tell and i'll gladly help out. <br />
The newbie garden in Paineel is also one of the best in the game from what i have noticed. No zoning to merchants and mobs all ready for you to kill in (dis)orderly fashion.</div></div><hr />

I have a buddy with a Eru SK.  Its great.  There are all kind of low level quests you can do.  <br />
<br />
I wouldn't worry about traveling to Nek though, the Paineel  newbie garden is one of the best newbie zones in the game, and the the Warrens are right there to get you up to 20th in no time.</div></div><hr />

I would post more..but I think I had answered the same question 2 days ago and gave a longer answer there if you want to look it up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
interesting.  as a CT worshipping ogre shadowknight, i'm WARMLY to the ghouls, but dubious to The Dead, so cannot train there and cannot use several merchants.  quite odd indeed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jobrill</div><div class="date">04-05-2002, 07:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, Ghouls in front of the dead seem to be pretty much completely race-based in thier starting faction. Probably since 'Evil' Erudites were added later in the game Verant didn't bother making them non-KOS to those ghouls.<br />
<br />
BTW, I agree with others, there is really no reason to run out to neriak. Myself,  even levelling up pre-Warrens, I stayed on Odus til about 6, did blackburrow til about 9, And only then did I head out to Eastern Antonica, where I did some hunting in WC, Highpass, and Lavastorm...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Syfon</div><div class="date">04-05-2002, 10:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yes there are indeed Eru sk's in the world.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 Human SK are KOS to these guys also.  Didn't see them till it was too late myself.  :)<br />
<br />
Now I go there all the time, just remember to invis first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tyrrax</div><div class="date">04-06-2002, 11:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As an Erudite you'll only have two major problems.  First: nightvision, or actually the lack of it which isn't much of a factor until 22 when you get Deadeye.  The other isn't that big a problem but do yourself a favor and put some of your starting points into Agility which is the major score Erudites fall behind in.  Oddly enough Erudite SK start with a little more strength than Dark Elves.<br />
<br />
In regards to faction don't worry about the ghouls.  The ghouls everyone is talking about are in 3rd Gate in front of the Lodge of the Dead, the Burnished Coin (bank) is in Neriak Underground in Neriak Commons.  <br />
<br />
WHen you make your character do yourself a favor and worship Cazic so you can start in Paineel.  Mainly because the n00b area there is one of the best around.  N00b are practically spoonfed there first level hunting undead there.<br />
<br />
Just my thoughts.  I'm still Tier'dal all the way.</div></div><hr />
