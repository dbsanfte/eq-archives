<br />
And who the fuck said I wouldn't know how to play my character?  <br />
<br />
We did.<br />
<br />
 I have almost ever lvl 65 Class there is... 65 Ranger 65 Shaman 65 Cleric 65 Druid and a 65 Pal...  <br />
<br />
Then you don't need to ask where to level from 1-65 dumbass.  Since when was 5 of 16 &quot;most&quot; anyway?<br />
<br />
How would I not know how to play a god damn SK.. <br />
<br />
Because you don't pick up any knowledge/experience/practice being PL'ed.<br />
<br />
Pretty fucking easy to learn..  <br />
<br />
Then why are there so many horribly shitty SK's out there?  <br />
<br />
 And im not pling to 65 im stopping at 51... Gonna get the 6 AA's and grind to 62 grouping and get my other aa's I need.. Then 65 and get flagged...  <br />

<br />
Good for it, make a warrior.<br />
<br />
But im sorry for not looking for hunting grounds I searched on stuff about being pled in this forum didn't find any..  <br />
<br />
You're clearly not sorry, fuck off.  We don't have &quot;PL your SK!&quot; guides because nobody wants more PL'ed SK's running around.  <br />

<br />
Yep, at level 51 you should already know the basics of being a good SK, and here you want to join a group, who will expect you to know your role, and you wont, because you were PLed to that point. Sure, you could learn a few things, Like how to FD in a corner when you pull a train, or because you aren't skilled enough to grab aggro away from the chanter/shaman/healer..... that will go over well with any 51+ group.<br />

Because they think that just because they are level 51+ they know everything, when all they really know is how to run around, gather a train of mobs, and let the &quot;thorns&quot; do the work..... duh!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Darkenesis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Here's probably the non-flamiest post out of the lot.<br />
<br />
Don't worry about finding where to PL your toons.<br />
<br />
THE GAME NOW TELLS YOU WHERE TO PL!<br />
<br />
Found this out when my ranger alt hit 50.   Yes, the game tells you where to PL yourself at.  I'm amazed, because you could very well just go to the exact same places you xp'd at on your main.  My whole theory on just killing whatever cons blue was a pretty good one too.  Or at least I thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Lizarde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Slein is my hero.<br />
<br />
Anyway, just to parrot what everyone else said- if you leveled five other characters to 65 then you would know where to go in order to PL to 51.  Even without help you claim you're already 34.  I'm not really sure what the initial post was about, aside from trying to impress us with your l33t ability to get PLed by a druid/shaman combo.<br />
<br />
But there's hope, you don't need to post in order to get all the help you need, these forums have pretty much any and all info you might want about the SK class.  Search + an IQ above 6 is all you need!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Skvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">an IQ above 6 <br />

Ok, so if you wanted to make a alt.. You wouldn't give it any money? And decent gear isnt a twink <br />
Look at my magelo.<br />

Twink projects like my warrior, cleric and bard are boring as shit.<br />
<br />
Kassdax, totally self reliant with no help from my main is a major kick in the ass to play - pretty much on par with my mage.<br />
<br />
I have one server with all character slots taken - one is a bazaar mule and the rest are played. My main, as mentioned earlier is a mage. Kassdax is a non-twink, the rest are twinks. Guess which toons get &quot;played&quot; the most - and no, I don't &quot;play&quot; my bazaar mule.<br />

By the way, you claim to have all those level 65 toons but don't know where to pl yourself? Um....I'll bet your eyes are brown and not because of genetics.</div></div><hr />

How about you dont know how to play any of your toons?  You come here, saying your guild needs &quot;another good tank&quot; Why the fuck did you pick a SK?  You have such leet gear, and such a great knowledge of the game since you have so many 65's, leveling anywhere withing range should not be hard, unless your a ebayed fucktard *seems to be * or your just fucking stupid * could be hand and hand with the ebayed comment*.  You are stupid, please delete your account, and then off yourself.</div></div><hr />

Unlike the pure melee/tank class there is a huge gap in learning this class well. Sure anyone can play any class at any time but are you effective?<br />
<br />
Sks play such a huge roll in grouping, not just being a Tank but a Puller, croud controll when that Ranger (puller) decides to pull 3-4 adds back to camp ( when you should have pulled a single  :D ). Holding agro at all times ( if needed) or pulling agro so your group can RUN while you FD..etc...etc..<br />

Ok, who said I was 2boxing? I don't have access to elementals yet with this character, so two-boxing with one character stuck in PoTranquility just doesn't make much sense. I said I was tanking with a shaman in PoE for my group. As in the shaman's group. As in there were 6 people there, and the shaman was tanking. With little over 7k hp, and few defensive AAs. So fuckoff, I do know what I'm talking about, thanks.<br />

Heck, my twink 52 warrior has as many hps as you.<br />
<br />
You're absolutely right, according to my magelo, I have the equipment of a level 50 kunark-era knight. Since then, I've joined a time-level guild (Hint: &quot;My guild is still messing around in Ikkinz/Yxtta/KT&quot;), and killing mobs to get flagged for elementals can give several nice upgrades to one geared such as myself. Thinking that my magelo describes who I am makes you sound arrogant and stupid.<br />
<br />
Ok, now, my original comment that you quoted was:<br />
PoE..... goddamit. PoE is the new BoT.<br />
<br />
Then you said:<br />
Really though, if you aren't even equipped to handle past tier2 PoP, then you haven't even begun to face the issues in high end GoD where the SK class suffers most of it's setbacks.<br />
<br />
Where did I say anything about high-end GoD? Never have I given my opinion about what we need changed in high-end GoD. I've never been there. I have no opinion on it.<br />
<br />
Aaah, you're one of those who reads and tries to make every issue into first hand experience. Again, get there and experience the issues yourself before you talk about issues you 'read about'. Everything I have ever said on this board, I DO have first-hand experience on, or else I clearly state that what I am saying is based on other people's experiences and posts. Don't put words into my mouth.<br />
<br />
Right back at ya. Your drinking issues aren't my problem, is your life that terrible? :D<br />
No, I just have friends. There was a party, I got home, wasn't tired, and turned on my computer to look at the boards. There is a difference between being drunk once in a while and having drinking problems. My life is going pretty well in fact. I hope, for the sake of stupid arguments like this, that yours doesn't last very much longer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u106"><b>doomslayd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p106">3) When I can take my friend's shaman (who, when my magelo was correct, DID have more hp than I did) into PoE and tank for my group because I'm bored.... then yes, I will call PoE the new BoT.<br />
This insinuates that your Sk was taking hits, not your friend's shaman.  Also, not sure what a 'time level' guild is doing with a pre-elemental SK, but hey, to each their own.  Also, again if you have even exp'd in PoE on your friend's shaman, you'd know how many available camps there actually where and wouldn't attempt to comment on a PoE/BoT comparision.  12 people in zone, other than a raid party, is a full zone unless a group is actually exping behind the locked door where the big croc pops.<br />
<br />
And again, I don't care about you petty drinking problem, I just find it funny that you are one of the most arrogant people on this board with the least to actually stand on as far as experience and utter board trolling.  I don't think I've seen a post yet whereas you weren't telling someone off simply because you feel it somehow makes you feel bigger than whatever you would assume people would believe.  It's amazing how you don't realize how pathetic you sound every time you post.<br />

If you were just going to make a biatch for tanking you should have made a pure tank rather than an sk for the light show and to just say you have one.

I used to call one of my officers that and that used to be hin Public note, but he's on extended EQ leave (i.e. finally getting laid) so I hadn't a chance to use it much lately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u110"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p110">This insinuates that your Sk was taking hits, not your friend's shaman.  Also, not sure what a 'time level' guild is doing with a pre-elemental SK, but hey, to each their own.  Also, again if you have even exp'd in PoE on your friend's shaman, you'd know how many available camps there actually where and wouldn't attempt to comment on a PoE/BoT comparision.  12 people in zone, other than a raid party, is a full zone unless a group is actually exping behind the locked door where the big croc pops.<br />
<br />
Sorry if it didn't come through properly, but as of yet my SK has never been to PoE. And as for the BoT/PoE comparison, I was more comparing the fact that you don't need to be anywhere close to uber to tank there, just as BoT went from the uber xp zone near PoP release to the zone where every jackass can get easy xp. And just for referance, when I was in PoE with the shammy, we were one of two groups at zone-in.<br />
<br />
My time-level guild has a shitty SK like me because we've been recruiting lately and I have a lot of friends in the guild. Yes, my gear sucks; they know that I play well enough to make up for it, and that gear can and will change.<br />

I'm really not trying to pick an argument with you..... yes, I'm an asshole who posts a lot of shit, I pick on people who are (sometimes) undeserving, and I open my big mouth way too much. I can admit that. Don't try to say that you don't do the same though. As far as board trolling, if I'm a troll, fine, I never started out that way. I started coming here for information, found a lot of it, and when I started to post I guess that my asshole-ishness started coming through. I honestly don't care what you think, but for fuck sakes, can we just leave this be? You think i'm a no-experience wanna-be asshole, I think you're just trying to beat a dead horse (btw, I haven't seen a magelo from you, so how the hell do I know that you even know what you're talking about?), so lets just call it a day, eh? Goddam.</div></div><hr />

Well your wrong on that one...... there is a rule that you have to be atleast 21 to have an official drinking problem. Because by then you should know better, but you just sit at the bar and drink the night away for no good reason. Think about your comments........ How does this make the people feel on the board that really do have drinking problems? You insensitive bastard.</div></div><hr />
