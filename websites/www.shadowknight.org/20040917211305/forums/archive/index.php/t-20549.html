<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As an Ogre, I have never even contemplated getting 2 hand bash. However, I have a question...<br />
<br />
Does 2 Hand Bash do greater damage then slam if you are an Ogre or a Troll?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Caktis1981</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I maybe wrong, but the dammage from &quot;BASH&quot; is dictated via the AC on your shield. Dammage from &quot;SLAM&quot; is dictated via the AC on your shoulders, for 2H bash i would imagine since there is no shield then it would also revert to the AC calulation for dammage from your shoulders, so 2H bash for ogre/troll would be worthless basically, I very well might be wrong on this though, im just taking a swing at it, anyone confirm / deny my awnser?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>cauchy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">ac on shoulders??  That's a new one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The reason to get 2h bash as an ogre or troll is to allow you to bash while illusioned.  This includes skeleton form and Night's Dark Terror (scarecrow).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>nimic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You have to have magic shoulders to bash most creatures... Maybe he is getting mixed up?  In any case, not really an issue.<br />
<br />
Are the bash AA confirmed to work with illusion?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Which bash AA?  The old ones that just allow you to bash with a 2 handed weapon?  Then yes.<br />
<br />
If you mean the new ones that improve the chances of a stun and add damage, then I'll have to say yes as well because they work on all bashes, whether they be shield based, innate slame, or AA 2 hand bash.<br />
<br />
So, uhm, yes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zakko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have found 2h bash to do from 1-36 Damage, w/o crit's. <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Buurp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">As an ogre SK, I find myself in skelly and woodelf form quite often on raids and LDoN adventures. I got 2-hand bash for just this reason, but was disappointed to find that it doesn't change DMG at all. I was thinking I would be doing sheild bash DMG (upwards of 100), but it's the same DMG as if I was slamming (1-36).<br />
<br />
Then I added Vicious Smash (lvl 1) and watched my high 2-hand bash go from 36 to 42...<br />
<br />
Sad that I have to pay with a large handful of AAs to do some decent 2-hand bashing DMG, but eventually I think it will be worth it.</div></div><hr />
