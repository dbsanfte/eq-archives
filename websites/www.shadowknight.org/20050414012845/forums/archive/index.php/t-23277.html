 Our last attempt we centered all casters with AOE spells at the rocks in its lair, used melees to keep all of the spawns aggroed, and failed...twice. Our problem might be just lack of pure DPS ( we had no wizzies with us) or a fundamental tactics problem.<br />
 We made it to 6th spawn on our last try, but wiped as the Clerics/Healers got aggroed from the AOEs and we probably might have been short on tanks to hold aggro ( I believe we had 3 Warriors, 2 SKs, and a few Rangers ).<br />
 Any information or tactics would be extremely helpful, thanks.<br />

Trying to remember, it's been like 3 years here so i'll do what I can.<br />
<br />
Info about the main burrowerito: Doubles? for 1100, not that high of attack -- nothing like AOW, and actually my guild when we were doing this event (and when I was in it) killed burrower way before AoW. The main PITA of this event besides the adds is THE HIT BOX ON THE BURROWER IS DASDUIOASUDIOSAD RIDICULOUS. Seriously. The worst part about it is the hitbox. It constantly moves around from push, and the hitbox is the size of a firebeetle even though the mob itself is huge. Hitpoints were not bad actually though no estimate.<br />
<br />
The adds though, I can help you there. We never killed them. We tried, and it was so much of a pain we said screw it. At the time I was a monk, and here is what I did - I kited. Everyone goes back to where the burrower spawns (the cave to the left as you head in the room) and the monk runs in circles gathering the adds until they have a train of 381023813203 shitlings behind. The monk (or monks because I can guarentee the first will get tired of it and kill themselves) does this for approx 45 minutes, while you sit on your duff and wait. Then, the big fawk pops, your warrior or SK or druid gets agro, and you kill. <br />
<br />
In short, don't waste everyones time on the adds, you don't need to kill them. Just keep them occupied. IIRC there are 2 sets of 3 waves, so 6 total, but like I said don't quote me, it's been a long long time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>BetrayerofHope</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks Rifk. Info on this mob seems pretty sparse, or its so damn old no one remembers what the fuck they did to kill it.<br />
 Kiting is an interesting tactic, I'll drop the idea on my GL and see if we can give it a shot. Although I think that 3-6 waves are unsnareable, which would make things real interesting to the kiter.<br />
 The only reason the guild is out to kill it, I think, is because it bitch slapped a few of us around when we were shard hunting.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>kuulaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">We kept our casters and healers up on the walls, away from the center, the waves seem to agro those in the middle first, though i cant say for certain on that.<br />
<br />
<br />
The key is knowing how many mobs spawn per wave, I dont remember off the top of my head.  We had our knights warriors and rangers tank the spawns, each one had assigned healer, and some DPS.  As they started to die off we'd just start moving from one to another.<br />
<br />
Keep the tanks up and have enough to handle each spawn.  For us it was mainly a fight for the tanks.  We never failed using that strat.<br />
<br />
<br />
Luclin fights always need a ton of DPS due to the higher HP of those mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lynxal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Rifk is talking about 3 years ago though... my necro can tank the mobs in there now.  They are super trivial....just AE the first few waves (though wizzies obvioulsy help here).  Try the event a couple times....the mobs spawn in the exact same locations so you can have your tanks standing next to the spawn spot waiting to agro for the last set of 3 waves.  These mobs may have lots of Hps but even casual gamers players are doing end game Luclin damage.<br />
<br />
It sounds like you are trying to AE the 6 spawns which is not very efficient with your group.  Just offtank them, a shaman could keep a couple tanks up with just Q.<br />
<br />
Luclin mobs are high AC too, it's all about the DB.  A 2-hander with a 28 delay is great in there.<br />
<br />
Necros are good for the hit box problem on the burrower.<br />
<br />
If the only reason you are trying to kill this is because you got beat up solo and you are failing it....you have serious problems.  If this fight is owning you all his stuff should be an upgrade....he has some nice stuff even now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>cames</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Its been a while since I did this event, but.....<br />
<br />
We always FDed a monk at the center of the event and ran the raid down the tunnel behind the untargetable burrower.  We had FD pullers bring the first 3 waves there and we AEed them.<br />
<br />
For the non-mezzable waves, we put a ring of knights around 1/per mob and assigned them a healer.  The raid assisted one of the knights and then followed him around to kill the rest of the wave.<br />
<br />
For the 2 larger non-mezzables, we had 2 warriors tank them and raid assisted the knight again and burned one and then the other.<br />
<br />
For the final mob, we warrior tanked him and try to hold him relatively still.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rifk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah the mobs probably don't hit as hard as they used to in relation hehe. Fighting the mobs is pretty boring, but so is sitting on your arse.<br />
<br />
One small comment, using a Necro for Ignite bones used to be insanely difficult when the level cap was 60. In fact, a lot of times it caused the necro to get agro, so they gave up. He's super resistant to that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Lynxal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ignite bones lands fairly eaily now...though I think chill bones landed better if I recall.  It's also a billion times nicer now that the spell doesn't make the skeleton form a mexican jumping bean.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>BetrayerofHope</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thanks all. I realize that this is a trivial mob to most, as the content is really old.<br />
 My guild is by no means advanced, we're a family, casual style bunch of morons; none of us is Ele flagged or anything of the sort. Our highest level players are only 67.<br />
 I like the tank as they spawn idea, I'll mention it to my officers, and see if we can give it a shot.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Averse</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">There are 3 waves of 12, 3 waves of 6, 1 wave of 2 and then final beast, as I recall.<br />
<br />
We just freeforall tanked the first 6 waves (anyone can tank the first 3 waves, any hybrids+ can tank next three, and then we had 2 warriors tank each of the 2 spawns with one add tanking while raid killed other one and then finished the add tanks worm.  Finally pop BB and just have MT slowly walk backwards around the circle (doin the donut) while raid pushes the damn thing around in a ring.  The hardest part is not pushing it up the side walls and that's controllable by teaching your pet classes to pull their pets off when it starts to wall and repositioning them on the high side of the mob.  We would do it with about 30ish folks (this is with level/gear appropriate toons for the encounter)</div></div><hr />
