<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mikazu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Using the Search function, I wasn't able to find any posts in the Hunting Grounds that answered this specific question, so I apologize if I'm asking something that's common knowledge 'round here.<br />
<br />
Is it possible to duo in the Plane of Hate with a 57 sk / 57 shaman? I'm assuming if it is possible, only Tier 1 would be viable, so does anybody have an idea how many camp spots would be viable for this level range?<br />
<br />
Also, beyond having to belly cast on the dragons, are there any specific tactics or suggestions for fighting up here? Should I wait until the Shaman is 58 so he can mini-cheal? Anybody know approx. how hard the tier 1 mobs hit for? Are they particularly resistant?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for the help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Arikash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Tier 1 mobs hit for I believe 150ish, not positive though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kaledine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Was just there last night camping epic 1.5 stuff... Tier 1 mobs are failry easy... seen em hit between 100-200 range... <br />
<br />
Tier 2 a little harder.. around the 250-350 range and Tier 3 hit around the 400-650 range<br />
<br />
Just hit 70 last night but was 69 when I was in Hate.. so with your HP/AC obviously lower, I would say you're correct in saying Tier 1 would be for you.. mobs wont hit that hard.. especially when the shaman slowing.. I dont think you'll have a problem</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>kassdax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The major problem you would have at 57/58 is getting adds on pulls due to your level. I know at 65 everything in tier 1/2 can be single pulled but you'll probably get a bunch of adds.<br />
<br />
The other problem you'd have is a way out. Although you can port up from PoK, there isn't a click out stone/book/whatever in PoHate like there is in PoP. Gate potions would probably be your best bet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If regular gate potions are too expensive have a Shaman whip up some potions to gate to FoB, or Innuthule or Everfrost, they cost half what normal gate potions do to make and have a lower trivial.<br />
<br />
OT hammer of course is an option as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Talonmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I came to hate the day my shaman turned 46.  we camped there until she turned 64.  (My hide never dropped in all that time.)  Of course I was 65 then.<br />
<br />
The problem, as was said before, will be social aggro on your pulling.  I'd suggest setting the shammy up at the zone in, and pulling from a good distance away.  Once you know you have it single, bring it back to the shammy.  that's what I did 90% of the time and had very few problems.<br />
<br />
I'd also stay away from the Clerics of Hate and the steps to the right of zone in.  The first will probably run you dry with CH's and the second will probably provide to little room to split out.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Chaosblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I went there with my lvl 66 sk and my 2boxed 47 cleric, had no down time, lots of hps on the tier1 mobs, but their melee skills blow. Got what I was looking for in the first few kills, but stayed longer to try and get my cleric some no drop. As stated above at lvl 58/59 you will get adds which would be bad, I kinda doubt a gate potion will save you. I did this before with a lower lvl char, but since I had a cleric I could just run out away from my cleric and die, then cleric would drag me back and rez me so I did not have a total wipe and have to spend money on more stones.</div></div><hr />
