<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Eudye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok.. I have read the hunting grounds sticky, but it lacks specifics. I have loved soloing the nobles in Highkeep to 55 but they are about done giving me good exp now. I have tried outdoor zones like Burning woods, but the exp lacks, and the danger of adds is fairly high. Where specifically is the BEST solo spot at 55? Is there anything like highpass out there with a nice round of blue mobs? <br />

Eudye 55 sk... Luclin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>yuggoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think the gnolls in JP are still blue... the plateau in Scarlet Desert should be good, several spots in the Grey, Chardok zone-in should be good, PoJ is good for aggrokiting.  Just some places I hunted...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kazral Shadowthirst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The exp kinda sucks in SF but I have never been to JP or SC and I hate PoJ soloing so I don't know how bad those are either.<br />
<br />
The kills can take awhile but it really isn't that bad if you just need to fill in that last yellow or something.<br />
<br />
Just fearkite near the BW zone, usually it is open or there is enough game to hunt.<br />
<br />
Avoid the chromidracs or felia the whatever because they DoT and dispell. If, however, you can manage to find one close to the BW zone and you dont care about kei (if its on) or other buffs go ahead, they have wussy hp (from what i remember).<br />
<br />
Most mobs don't frenzy when you pull but then you can always kite them to fear spot and FD split em. They tend to have a small frenzy radius.<br />
<br />
And go for the named and rare (lava walker, hella hp and hardest mob I soloed there; soul devourer, gimp; wandering wurm, avg; black scar, kinda hard; etc.) because they tend to drop shards for a cleric friend and spells more often (some spells are really gimp but some are upper 50s spells).<br />
<br />
Go after any regular guy but I advise from best to least, mature wurms, wurms, bottomless feaster, bottomless whatevers etc., wyverns and mature ones I don't mess with because of poison when they turn from fear and drakes just dont seem fun to kill but that's just me.<br />
<br />
It isn't better exp than a good group. But a good group is most likely the group that you are not in (murphy's). Either join a guild group or partner somewhere good. Otherwise this place isn't bad for steady but slow exp.<br />
<br />
P.S. I think bottomless gnashers and some drake was light blue to me but the mature stuff and the named should remain good stuff. The named you should look out for the most is the soul devourer and the wandering wurm. The latter drops alot of shards and the first drops spells and immortals for the monk epic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nugaruk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think all the mobs on the Dandolak are still DB at 55.  Katta graveyard maybe as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Deep in the caverns of GF is okay exp and sweet loot, just avoind the casters and wolves (just not worth the effort).  If you're feeling cocksure, zone to AC.  You'll get a bit more agro than you want there at that level, but once you manage that you can get nice loot and descent exp.  Also it's just a hoot.<br />
<br />
Edit: forgot to mention the Hole, you need to get past the ent mobs for good exp, but go up the tower and into the castle part and things get real fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kazral Shadowthirst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I just don't understand why more people don't form groups in GF caverns, its an almost unlimited supply of guys and they are all good exp and loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dkhar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">At 55 I stay in Nadox, the Bruisers on the back steps by the big lava bridge. It's the zoneline to Torgion Mines. Good xp, good drops and a couple named spawn that drop stuff you can sell for a couple hundred $$$. Bling bling! There's a couple posts about it from 6-8 months ago if you search, which I am too lazy to do sorry heh :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Putrid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Nadox or tsete flies in POD</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've spent some time in the GF caverns.  The main problem seems to be all the yahoos that train you going to and from AC.  When it's quiet, it's golden, when it's not, it sucks.  Depends on the traffic.  People like a sure thing.  That's my experience anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kazral Shadowthirst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The grey isnt a bad spot to solo or group. Just pull guys to edge of the zone and fear kite them, probably the larvae traps or someting fearable. If something isnt fearable, it probably drops something good and you can kite it.<br />
<br />
Someone told me that nothing summons in the grey either? Is that true?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Parasite Evie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">No, that's not true. Boulderlings summon. They are triggered from the rock traps and come in numbers.. 3 at a time. They have a long range spell, granite crush, I think, and they summon. As a bard who spent a long time in the Grey, I would just zone these fellas as they just aren't worth the effort. <br />
<br />
Apart from boulderlings, the Grey is a fun zone, except for the neg exp mod.<br />
