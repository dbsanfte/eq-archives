<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>newtank</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">You know who you are...<br />
<br />
I figured I would start a post that you can post in rather than making a troll fest of every single thread that I post in.<br />
<br />
Trend I have noticed:<br />
<br />
SK_01:      Says Something<br />
Newtank:  Says Something<br />
<br />
Idiot_SK01:  If you left KC you wouldn't say that<br />
Idiot_SK02:  Ya and I found an ugly pic of you.<br />
Idiot_SK03:  Ya and you dumb<br />
Idiot_SK04:  Me too Me too I think if you had ever been to BOT you wouldn't say that<br />
Idiot_SK05:  I hate you why do you even post here<br />
Idiot_SK06:  Can someone lock this thread<br />
Newtank:     Guys are you smoking crack?<br />
<br />
Idiot_SK03:  What does that have to do with mitigation?<br />
Idiot_SK05:  I am not going to post on this thread anymore.<br />
Idiot_SK02:  I found another completely differnt ugly picture of you totally destroying my credibility regarding you being in the first pic.<br />
Idiot_SK04:   Look I can search the web for pics too look look.<br />
Idiot_SK05:   Guys dont' post on this thread anymore<br />
Newtank:      Says something<br />
Idiot_SK01:   You get any bronze daggers in kc?<br />
Idiot_SK06:   If I was the mod this thread would be locked allready<br />
Idiot_sk05:    Guys don't even answer him.  Don't post here.<br />
SK_02:           Says something<br />
Newtank:       Says something<br />
Idiot_SK05:    Man you suck so much....Guys dont' post on this thread anymore.<br />
Idiot_SK03     Please someone lock this thread.<br />
Newtank:       Says Something<br />
Idiot_SK05:     New shut up you stay in kc...We all left kc cause it was no fun why can you stay there and thrive you must suck.<br />
Idiot_SK03:     I am leaving.<br />
Idiot_SK04:     Dude look i used image search again.<br />
Newtank:        Guys are you sure you aren't smoking crack cause regen is really good.<br />
Idiot_SK03:     Newtank that isn't mitigation just cause it heals the damage doesn't mean its mitigation.<br />
Newtank         Idiot_SK06 didn't you say you were leaving?<br />
Idiot_SK05      Newtank you are so stupid you just totally don't understand.   Guys lets not post here anymore.<br />
Idiot_SK03     Newtank regen only heals the damge after it happened mitigation stops it from happening.  Can't you see that?  If you have 2300 hp and get hit for 100 with 10% mitigation you would only get hit for 90 and so you would be at 2210 with regen you would be 2200 for a whole 5 seconds before you go to 2230.<br />
Newtank         Idiot_SK03 are you following me?<br />
Idiot_SK03      I sooo have better things to do than follow you around.<br />
Idiot_SK05     Guys lets not post here anymore<br />
SK03:             You might want to level to 59 and then delevel<br />
Newtank:       Thats a tempting idea<br />
Idiot_SK05:    New you will never level in kc you are stupid.<br />
Idiot_SK03:    Ya you will be in kc in a year and you will only have 100 AA<br />
Idiot_SK05:    Guys lets stop posting on this thread.<br />
Idiot_SK01:    Look I started a thread =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>nezzka is bad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">people say that because you always post about yourself being level 55... no one cares you keep talking about it in threads for no reason, if you dont want attention, stop talking about kc, you being 55, your aa rate, you not being able to tank w/o dieing (or thats what i got when i heard you say sks arent tanks there rangers w/o sow) and no one will talk to you/pay attention. i really wish you would stop posting on these forums, for your benefit and all of ours.<br />
<br />
<br />
No I haven't left KC.<br />
<br />
<br />
of course if there is anything that a lvl 55 could you could mention that too......=) <br />
<br />
Hey you are talking about me =) 42 AA now <br />
<br />
Monk and Necro do that fake death thing. we do the real thing <br />
<br />
Those Veksar gobby's soloable at 57?  I can do them at 55 <br />
<br />
see your just asking for it...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nycathis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Uhm But new tank - all you are showing here is that you have set responses - meaningless lamer dumbass useless pre 60 responses....<br />
<br />
At your level maybe regen IS as good as mitigation but as soon as you hit higher mobs you WILL get shredded - no argument - no amount of regen will help.<br />
<br />
You can stay at 55 as long as you like and earn 300+AA but a 0AA 65th level SHD will own you so fast you all you would see of the encounter is LOADING PLEASE WAIT.....<br />
<br />
The Game post 60 is so totally different due to new abilities and spells that your entire bandwidth of posts is meaningless to anyone of that level.<br />
<br />
The mobs are tougher and start to use abilities that are rare at your level, rampage, flurries, irresistable AoE Dots that do hundreds of points of damage per tick, and the like.<br />
<br />
Stop and think- why is it that when you have high level encounters in places like BoT the only thing that will keep the tank alive is the speed of the heals and if the slow has gotten off.<br />
NO amount of regen will help uless you were spamming TOTAL HEALS every few ticks<br />
<br />
The problem everyone has with your posts is that simply they are irrelevant to the majority of the SHD that are on this board.<br />
You views dont ADD anything - you are like a smartass 10yr old trying to hangout with adults and pretending to be oh so mature.<br />
<br />
Im not flaming you or trying to own you - Im stating the simple facts.<br />
<br />
You want to stay at 55th and earn all the AAs under the sun in KC - fine - good luck and I hope you get them.<br />
<br />
Just dont come here to brag about it or offer your game based advise because it is irrelevant.<br />
<br />
Just because you subscribe to a board doesnt mean that you HAVE to post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Baroyonx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My only problem with you is the way you alter the definitions of words and conflate terms.  You're welcome to play the game however you like, I was just trying to avoid further confusion of terms.<br />
<br />
I got friend who play like 5 different characters without focusing on one.  I am not sure if there is any difference between that and what you are doing, because it is just a different approach to the game.<br />
<br />
That and I am thoroughly convinced you are totally closed to any real advice so why should I give a fuck what you do?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">you forgot about you putting spells in augments and counting regen as dps<br />
<br />
edit: more thought didn't want to waste another post- <br />
<br />
You took everything out of context.  You didn't put in anything that you said that lead to those responses.<br />
You claimed to be one of few people who here who starts posts.  So I proved you wrong<br />
You asked for a gear check and the first time someone suggested that you upgrade the Fungi you went off on thei uni-bomber-esque disertation.<br />
<br />
Your putting in effects only and leaving out that you are the cause means you are only 1 of three things<br />
1) A member of the current generation that takes no responsibility for thier own actions and blames the world for thier unhappiness.<br />
2) Legaly Unfit to Stand Trial Due to mental Defect - you do not know right from wrong and you do not understand the consequences of your actions.<br />
3) a common board troll<br />
<br />
No matter which is true this board, myself included, have wasted too much time on you already</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>tyrrax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Want a taste of what the upper planes are like?  Go to Plane of Valor and try tanking something there.  You will get ripped apart like toilet paper.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>derakolwtf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">didnt read the post.... its too long, as i have read other ones you have made I can surely tell you that your opinions are stupid and based on random shit that you make up.... Lets stop and think... Sometimes everyone can tell you that you are wrong and you may still be right. ( THIS IS NOT THE CASE THOUGH) You have been proved wrong over and over again. So fuck off and stop misinforming others that are not smart enough to realize that you have no idea what you are talking about. Simply put, for you... playing a shadowknight is rocket science.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>brian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">oh I found a good link to the rocket science (http://www.tubgirl.com) behind playing a SK at 55...  thought you might enjoy it...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Dkhar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I'm fairly sure he was banned so he has to restart a new account. Therefore negating his 1000 posts in the &quot;hello I am newtard&quot; thread. He obviously was padding his posts by replying to everything in separate posts instead of all in one. Mod said it himself, he was having fun to see how long it went on for, I bet he just banned him for this reason is all.<br />
