Germand Reton is located on one of the lower decks at 135, 112, 99. <br />
<br />
You say, 'Hail, Germand Reton' <br />
<br />
Germand Reton says 'Hello. Not much time to talk. We have a big [problem] on our hands.' <br />
<br />
You say, 'What problem?' <br />
<br />
Germand Reton says 'Before the magical Buoys that produce the protective dome over the city were in place, a large sea creature damaged the bottom of the ship. The problem is we need some wood to repair it. There appears to be no wood on this new continent however. If you could perhaps [find some wood] and bring it to me I could find some sort of reward for you.' <br />
<br />
You say, 'I will find some wood.' <br />
<br />
Germand Reton says 'Very good. Please travel to the Jaggedpine Forest and find Ervonis Leaflow. He supplied us with a lot of the wood during the construction of the Queen of Thorns. Once you find him give him this note.' <br />
<br />
You receive a Note to Ervonis. You can find Ervonis Leaflow at -480, -630, -40 in Jaggedpine Forest. Hand in the note. He doesn't respond to hail. <br />
<br />
Ervonis Leaflow says 'Germand needs some more lumber? Well I would be happy to chop some for you, but unfortunately I [lost] my axe. It was my favorite axe so I will not be chopping any more wood until I get it back.' <br />
You gain experience!! <br />
<br />
You say, 'Lost?' <br />
<br />
Ervonis Leaflow says 'I was washing its fine blade down by the river when those darned potameids attacked me. I ran but left my axe behind out of pure fear. If you could [find] it, I would be grateful and won't even charge you for some wood.' <br />
<br />
You say. 'I will find it.' <br />
<br />
Ervonis Leaflow says 'Great. I would start by checking near the river. Be careful though, those potameids are dangerous!' <br />
<br />
You'll find the axe at -60, -2620, -50, before the queen's room in the tunnels where the potameids live, just under a potameid spawn. The axe looks like a wind-worn axe laying on the ground. Take the Axe back to Ervonis Leaflow. <br />
<br />
Ervonis Leaflow says 'I cannot tell you how thankful I am. Just a moment and I will get you some wood.' Ervonis chops some wood for you and ties it into a neat bundle. 'It is a bit heavy, but I think you can handle it. Thanks again!' <br />
You gain experience!! <br />
<br />
Receive a Bundle of Wood. Take this back to Germand. <br />
<br />
Germand Reton says 'You found some wood! This will really help us with fixing the ship. Take this for your trouble. An enchanter friend of mine makes these little trinkets. Their magic doesn't last long, but it might help you out. You have my thanks and the thanks of the entire Wayfarers Brotherhood.' <br />
You gain experience!! <br />
<br />
