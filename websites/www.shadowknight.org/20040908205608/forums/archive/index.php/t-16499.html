<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>taintedmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey i played EQ 6 or so months ago, but was still in a UO phase and quit EQ. With the Evolution box set coming out and the new expansion I decided to pick it up again. <br />
<br />
When I did play EQ i played a few days as a Necro. So Im a uber nooblet.<br />
<br />
Just want to pick my stats right from the get.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ceptic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Put all 20 into Sta.  All other stats are easy to raise with items.  Race is not relevent, play what ever blows yer skirt up.  Each race is only limited by the person behind the keyboard.  Lame folks in RL make lame SK's in game.  <br />
<br />
Enjoy...Have fun...and don't let other people's bad attitudes effect you.  It's a game... Nothing more</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>GrihmmReapar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Race isnt exactly irrelevant.  Their are a few things to consider.  Trolls and Ogres both get slam, so they dont need a shield, which is nice.  Trolls also get regen, which is nice, but they suffer an xp loss.  I agree witht he 20 into stam.  Also it could be awhile before you get to the point where you can get the gear to make up for the low low str of a Dark elf or a gnome.  These are a few things to consider.  In the end, it doesnt matter what race you are, but getting to the end might take awhile, so think a little on your race.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brainbiter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">20 points into int never hurt my troll sta is easy to max, my int on the other hand reeks!<br />
<br />
Soloing I am waiting on mana to regen never HP! ;p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tumy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I wish that I had put my starting points into INT.  Sta is so easy to raise these days.  The myth that its hard to raise is just that now ... a myth.  <br />
<br />
Int is much harder to raise for a SK that is conscious of AC and HP's.  Sta gear these days is doing well on AC and +hp's.  Int gear is still a bit flimsy and directed toward casters more than SK's.<br />
<br />
This is all Bazaar sold items that im talking about.  If your Elemental+, it dont matter where you put your points.</div></div><hr />
