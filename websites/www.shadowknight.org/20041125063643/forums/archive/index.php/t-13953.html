<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>BrikBludgaard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Proposed Melee balancing plan:<br />
<br />
This plan is designed to change the OPTIONS for melee characters and boost their damage production by a moderate margin.<br />
<br />
<br />
Solutions (General 2H)<br />
-All PoP 2H-only AAXP abilities will now affect any weapon in the primary hand, be it 1H/Shield, Dual Wield, or 2H.<br />
-2H weapons with delay lower than 28 will now have an appropriate 2H damage bonus which is ALWAYS better than the 1H counterparts.<br />
-ALL 2H weapons have had their damage bonus scaled to be better than a 1H weapon of the same damage delay if it should happen to exist.<br />
<br />
Solutions (General 1H)<br />
-1H weapons will now be more plentiful and more varied..  do not be surprised to find slower and higher damage 1H weapons.<br />
-1H weapons will now have an appropriate damage bonus that scales with delay.<br />
-1H weapons will sometimes be PRIMARY only.  These weapons are too unwieldy to be swung in the off-hand.  Weapons with higher delays and damage are more likely to be PRIMARY only.  Most weapons that are wieldable in the off-hand are wieldable in PRIMARY hand as well.<br />
<br />
Solutions (Dual Wield)<br />
-Weapons wielded in the offhand will now have a scaling Damage Bonus that is the standard damage bonus halved (round down) for the offhand.  A weapon that has a 13 damage bonus in the primary hand will have a 6 damage bonus in the offhand.<br />
<br />
Solutions (Shields)<br />
-Shields give an extra roll to both Parry and Riposte when wielded should you fail your first rolls.  Shields allow your FULL parry and riposte rolls to be used against arrows. (riposte cannot hit, but does remove damage)<br />
<br />
Solutions (Archery/Thrown)<br />
-Quivers have had a change made to them.. they are now chargeable items (no longer containers) that are recharged in much the same way that the Minimizing Devices are, except in Fletching kits.  Quivers can be loaded with up to 180 Arrows. (Must be the same type however) Quivers now fit in the AMMO slot.<br />
-Wrist Pouches are now available for the throwing crowd, and serve the same purpose as quivers, except for thrown ammo.  Appropriate new recipes are availble to make pouches that are comparable to tailored quivers.<br />
-Archery now works differently.  The delay on the bow now refers to how long the bow takes to take a shot with it.  Arrows are fired after the aim-time, NOT immediately. <br />
You may begin a shot right after having let the last arrow go.  Archery will now be similar to casting a fast spell and has a chance at being interrupted if you are hit during shooting.<br />
-Archery Line-of-sight is now fixed.  If you can see part of the creature, you can hit it, in addition, the overall ban on archery at close range has been lifted.<br />
-The following issues make archery less likely to hit: You are moving (large hit, and might be interrupted), the target is moving (small hit), the target is within 50 range (medium hit).<br />
-Archery Damage bonus is now similar to 2H weapons and applies to all arrows fired.<br />
-Thrown weapons do not have a minimum range and have no penalty when up close for any class... they DO have penalties for target moving and thrower moving, however.<br />
<br />
Solutions (Aggro)<br />
-Spells and weapon effects that ONLY cause Hate will also cause a 0 second stun<br />
-Enraging Blow and similar spells cause slightly less numerical hate (to balance its new effect)<br />
-Archery/Thrown deals hate as a melee weapon would... but that hate is modified by range...  there is a cap to how much hate can be not looked at by the mob due to range.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Warriors:<br />
-ALL warrior weaponskills now cap at 250, this includes Piercing, Thrown, and Archery.  Warriors are the undisputed master of weapons and their skill with weapons should reflect this.<br />
-Warriors gain a new mitigation table at level 55, level 60 and then again at 65.  These tables reduce average damage by up to 15% at level 65 with NO AAXP.<br />
-New &quot;Greater Disciplines&quot; have been added for Warriors.  These are gained at level 62 (/stance defense) and 64 (/stance offense)  Greater Discplines are PERMANENT until a new stance is chosen.  Defense makes you harder to hit and take less damage, but hit less often and deal less damage.  Offense does the opposite.<br />
-/stance balanced is the default mode and is available at level 62 as well (you would use this to enable the old disciplines)<br />
-The new permanent disciplines can only be changed once a minute.  once in a permanent discipline mode, you must stay there for 1 minute, after which you can choose a new permanent discipline.<br />
-Greater disciplines' timers are separate from old disciplines, but only one discipline can be active at any one time.<br />
-Warriors gain /disc Battlemaster at level 65.  For 20 seconds the warrior is affected by both FURIOUS and MIGHTYSTRIKE<br />
-Warrior KICK now has a moderate hate modifier that applies to every KICK whether it hits or not.  (if someone tried to kick you in the jimmy, you probably wouldn't appreciate them much either)<br />
<br />
<br />
Knights: (PAL/SHD)<br />
-ALL weaponskills and Offense now cap at 235.  (includes archery)<br />
-Knights will gain Thrown skill (caps at 235)<br />
-Knights gain new mitigation tables similar to warriors at levels 60 and 65.  Knights are always one table behind warriors, and will mitigate 10% at level 65.<br />
-Shadowknight Leechcurse (60th discipline) has had its timer reduced.<br />
-Knights gain enhanced versions of their old disciplines as they advance<br />
-Shadowknight gain /disc Defile at level 63... this is an enhanced version of Unholy Aura that affects ALL offensive spells cast by the Shadowknight including Harmtouch by 50%. (doesn't stack with /disc unholyaura)<br />
-Shadowknights gain /disc Bloodbath at level 65... this is an enhanced version of Leechcurse that lasts for 20 seconds and adds auto-riposte to leechcurse's life draining.<br />
-Paladins gain enhanced versions of their disciplines at level 63 and 65.<br />
<br />
Rogues/Monks/Rangers/Beastlords:<br />
-At least ONE of Archery/Thrown are raised to at least 240 so that the class has an offense from range if they have the ammo.<br />
-Rangers penalties to archer moving or target moving are HALVED from the standard. (everyone else has a very small chance to hit if both archer and target are moving, rangers have a decent chance to hit in this situation.<br />
-Rangers ignore the general archery to-hit penalty to target too close.<br />
-Rangers chance to be interrupted if hit while shooting is one-quarter of the standard.<br />
-Rangers double-damage while non-rooted, non-moving, has been removed.<br />
-Ranger now deal double damage at point-blank range.<br />
-Rangers' Endless quiver has been changed to reflect archery's new power.  Endless quiver will no longer shoot infinite rare arrows.  Endless quiver will now summon (in .1 seconds) a LORE NO DROP quiver of the new style that has 200 arrows of a set magical arrow.  This quiver will have haste as good as the best tailorable quiver.  Rangers may use this ability once per 10 seconds.<br />
-Rogues and monks gain two greater disciplines at 62 AND 64 and a combo discipline at 65.<br />
-Rangers and Beastlords gain enhanced hybrid disciplines at 63 and 65.<br />
-Monk/Beastlord Block skill is now applied to all arrows fired at them.<br />
<br />
<br />
What do you think?  I am looking for suggestions and ideas...<br />
for BALANCE...  not making SK or any other class into gods...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Korekil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Cap knight weapon and offence skills at 240, except 2 handed, which caps at 245.<br />
I like the change to Leechcurse and the upgrade with auto-riposte as it would give us a form of deensive mitigation, however something would need to be added for Pallies.<br />
Not sure on warrior changes as the offensive thing might put them on a DPS par with rangers and rogues. I take it you mean with all those changes added, the classes would be balanced against each other?<br />
Some very good ideas, I can only really comment on the SK and warrior ones though as I don't know enough about the other classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>BrikBludgaard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Greater Disciplines would be designed for long-term use...<br />
meaning their bonuses and penalties would even out and not be the huge bonuses meant for the older-style disciplines.<br />
<br />
Warrior would be ABLE to deal melee damage as if they were a ranger, but have to give up much of their defensive abilities to do so. (note they could not use the old /disc defensive while in an aggressive stance until 1 minute had passed)<br />
<br />
The idea here would be to allow the striaght melee classes some more versatility...  at the cost of a little inconvenience somewhere else.<br />
<br />
Warriors would ALWAYS be better at absorbing damage period.<br />
<br />
Knights would be second place guaranteed.<br />
<br />
ALL classes would have some long range punch, but only the ranger would be able to make it into something anywhere near melee damage....  rangers would have to be in the point-blank bubble to get the ultimate in bow damage. (and thus risk) this fixes much of the PvP issues as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
The goal is overall melee changes to make it more fair and more varied for everyone...<br />
<br />
Dual wield, 2H, and 1H+shield should all be viable and have their advantages and disadvantages.<br />
<br />
I am trying to set 1H and 2H on even terms except for their native advanatges/disadvantages....  Rangers have 240 defense, so 235 weaponskills and offense seem to make sense....  <br />
Given the degree of changes for dual wielders, I feel this was necessary for knights to stay in the ballpark...  240? 235? sure...  245 is pushing in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Yep, Paladins, Rangers, Rogues, monks, beastlord all need 61+ disciplines designed for them.  Paladin's discplines probably need to be totally redesigned.<br />

I like the direction you heading, however i think such huge damage/mitigation changes at this point in the game would trivalize too much current content.  <br />
<br />
If a warrior could stack a second defensive type disc on top of defensive, keep agro, and get added parry/rip from shield all at once, sony would have to seriosly beef up most pop mobs to keep things chalenging.<br />
<br />
I do really like the idea of having perm discs like agro/defence for exp situations which is where imo warriors need most help.<br />
<br />
And on a final note, knights/warriors are on the same tank table atm, the only advantage warriors have over us is higher ripo/dodge/parry caps, more hp and discs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Too complicated, needs to be simple.<br />
<br />
Knights - Increase weapon skills to 240.<br />
<br />
Add AA's to increase melee dmg at end game even more (or just increase effect of current AA's).<br />
<br />
Change AA's affecting 2h to affect both 2h and 1h.<br />
<br />
Add dmg bonus to off hand for dual wield.<br />
<br />
Rescale Dmg bonuses so you arent penalized as much for short delay weapons.  Two weapons of the same ratio, should do the same dmg no matter what level you are at.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>synnoira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The weapons and shield stuff sounds fine. Variety is the spice of life and in so far as logic helps immersion in a magical world making shields enhance defensive abilities in some manner makes sense. There was talk of shields giving a block skill of some sort a while back before PoP so the idea has been looked at i think.<br />
<br />
For the archery changes, i'm not sure i like the idea of interrupts when moving. From a purely selfish perspective i use archery to pull and am usually moving when the arrow fires. I guess you're seeing that as a PvP change? I think i'd take the harsh line that it's a PvE game, design for that and patch up any PvP issues later.<br />
<br />
Bringing throwing up to par for monks and rogues seems entirely fair. Why do knights need throwing though? That seems to be unnecessary blurring between classes.<br />
<br />
The aggro changes you have are where i really part company. What's the purpose behind adding a zero second stun to EB weapons? If the problem is one of itemization for low end warriors that solves nothing, and i'm not seeing aggro problems for the high end warriors who have them (and we haven't done RZ either so the guys i see are slumming it with BoC's, etc). It seems to me high end warrior aggro is at the ceiling where any improvement risks trivialising aggro management.<br />
<br />
I think the problem with warriors is that while other classes have become diversified (much to their benefit), warriors remain locked into doing one single job in all situations. Unfortunately a lot of players are still fixed on the idea that &quot;class balance&quot; means that each class has a &quot;class-defining ablility&quot; and must be &quot;king of&quot; something or other. It doesn't work, and particularly doesn't work well in a game where the combat engine asks for one single tank. You could make warriors the most uber tanks and taunters, but if he's not the main tank he's just a spare wheel. They try to solve this problem by throwing adds into every encounter they can, but then you've got sk's/paladins jockeying for those jobs too. And it's no help to the low end warrior who is still damn all use to a group if he's not the main tank. <br />
<br />
The idea of toggling on and off different &quot;stances&quot; has been around for a bit. Hook them up to the stamina bar for a warrior and make it meaningful for them much as mana is for a knight. Additionally basic melee utility skills Forage, Hide, etc should all be available to warriors as trained combatants. Not going to get them groups of course, but i'm fed up hearing blether about &quot;you get to invis&quot;. <br />
<br />
If a warrior isn't tanking what could he do? I think one option is to expand on the concept of Warcry and give some different varieties. Perhaps an extra haste bard-style, different immunities to certain spell types, enhanced avoidance for the group. Make them all available but based on the stamina bar. They'd be things the warrior could bring to the party which would allow him to enhance it's effectiveness, much as say LoH, or HT, or various spell abilities allow a paladin or sk to do even though they may not be the tank. It's my limited understanding that EQOA has pursued this sort of concept.<br />
<br />
The other melee classes are not in as dire need of a retooling if you ask me (begging the pardon of sundry posters at MB and the Safehouse). Rogues could use poisons all being store-bought and i hate the idea of a class which has a tradeskill incorporated into it's design but rogues i know swear by poisons. I'm aware they  may be highly eccentric. The monks i know have kept happily trucking through all the fuss. I think giving those classes range damage as suggested is correct, but beyond that i'm unconvinced they've got anything like the problems some would have you believe. And as things are i don't really see any need for more hybrid disciplines since our spells now generally pick up the slack. Not that i'd turn them down, and it would be very nice if Leechcurse was on a 15 minute timer (as Synd used to have on his list). Paladins are worst off for discs, but i don't see them lacking in what they bring to the party at the moment.<br />
<br />
Overall i'd say like the weapon stuff, etc but rather sceptical of tampering around with aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>lorddaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">while many of your suggestions are good in thought, they do not take the whole scope into play.<br />
<br />
any change to warrior abilities will only trivialize encounters further. period. <br />
<br />
any change to melee that is aimed at warriors to improve DPS will be magnified in the other classes. warriors get the absolute worst weapons. any change to the melee system overall to improve thier skill becomes amplified in the other classes.<br />
<br />
any change in tanking for warriors again trivializes encounters more. <br />
<br />
giving warriors different skills does not help with the problem of the warrior. for example the /shield command they got. it can be usefull, if the warrior and the person he's protecting know what to do (ie, the chanter needs to stay put and not run around so that they stay in range of the warriors shielding). but this does not do anything overall for warriors main job, which is on raids to hit enough to keep aggro, and be able to take the beating.<br />
<br />
sorry. i do like to see people with the gumption to see what they can do to help the system. but i've just beome too jaded over 3 years playing a warrior to see any help for the system soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Drakonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I was actually thinking recently how useful a dodge/parry/riposte disc would be... would really help if you, for example, got a pathing warp (and end up with 10 mobs on your head)... could easily hit a disc key, auto dodge would give an easy few seconds to get a FD off.<br />
<br />
I doubt it will happen, at least any time soon, but I think it'd be a great thing if it did.</div></div><hr />

Note, that I specifically stated that the greater disciplines and old disciplines had separate timers...  but I also mentioned that you could only EVER have one discipline active.  thus if you were using the permanent one, you could NOT be using the old /defensive.<br />
<br />
You can already Parry/Riposte anyways you just get an extra roll if you have a shield readied...  note, since you DO have a shield readied, you are dealing less damage... and thus less taunt...  its a tradeoff.<br />
<br />
We both know mobs in PoP are strong buggers...  We both know its not really an issue.<br />
<br />
I DO see an issue with the innate defense and /defensive....  perhaps a reduction in the effectiveness of the current /disc defensive in trade for the innate changes for warriors. (they could also remove a proportional amount of the offensive penalty to /disc defensive)<br />

I would argue that frankly, the solutions should not require additional AAXP.  I would also rather outline good solutions than give them overly simple ones that result in knee-jerks. (monk debacle, 2H changes STILL not resolved, dual wield phase-out, etc...<br />

We get throwing because of the changes to archery....  you could have archery's functional equivalent by using throwing...  Throwing would have a couple advantages 1) instant 2) point blank with no penalty. (1H damage bonus only, and lower damage than bows however.)  Trade off.<br />
<br />
Aggro changes are to NERF EB.  Warriors are getting an ability that allows the average joe without EB to cause more hate (kick changes)  0 second stun allows some effect that is useful for those that have it above the hate changes.  The idea is to make EB weapons optional for warriors.  0 second stun also gives some &quot;take notice&quot; effect to the +hate stuff....  Just use our hate line and see how terrible Terrors are for attention getting. (great once you have it, but terrible to GET it)  This is an overall nerf for warriors for EB and an improvment for us.  The oevrall effect is warriors taunt better without EB, and EB gets the nerf stick, and our hate line has a use outside taking up spellbook space.<br />

Read the first objection to it...  PoP mobs trivial my patootie... they still eat full elemental equipped warriors in NO time without proper Cheal chains.  In that case, who the heck cares if a warrior is 10-15% better at absorbing damage AVERAGE) than normal.  The CHs can be another .5 second apart! (yay)<br />
<br />
The whole scope is relative mob difficulty as well... they need to add a few mobs here and there for certain encounters... but we both know unit for unit that the mobs are friggin rediculously powerful in comparison to a player characters.<br />
<br />
You are too used to being a wuss compared to the mobs...  put a caster vs a snareable/rootable dark blue mob...  now put a melee against a similar mob....  the melee goes splat...  this is not really fair.<br />
<br />
We aren't talking enormous changes in the balance of mobs vs characters... we are talking a slight shift for the characters.<br />
<br />
In partial elemental gear, I can go back to Luclin and pick a dark blue mob (barely dark blue though) and solo him face to face...  this is only due to my caster side and lifetaps....  have a warrior do the same thing with no outside help...  you will be running.  Im sorry, thats wrong.  Masters of melee combat should be pretty dang tough...  WE shouldn't be pushovers either... (I hate playing necro in PoP dagnabbit.)<br />
<br />
Casters can pick anything they have mana to solo that doesn't summon and is snareable...  why is it melees are so handicapped?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>lorddaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">casters can do that because they have root or snare and can stand off from the mob.<br />
<br />
if you think it's a problem for them to be able to solo in PoP zones (and i do agree on this). make the mobs summon like all 50+ mobs should. that will stop caster soloing quickly.<br />
<br />
but saying that they need to make melee able to stand up to PoP mobs is the wrong way of saying this.</div></div><hr />

Mobs already have insane HP, hit insanely hard, and have numerous ways to cheat.<br />

it isn't too much to ask that solo be POSSIBLE...  it should just be less productive than grouping.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Darko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Brik, i agree with all that u have addressed as far as discs not stacking etc.<br />
<br />
However i honestly dont see a need for warriors or knights to become any better at taking damage, i think we are perfectly fine as is for now.  The reason i dont see a need for tanks to take damage better, is we already have several guild in time, and lots of guilds are in the elemental planes, all of this has ben done with the current tanks, so an upgrade in that department is not needed.<br />
<br />
I do like the idea of warriors to be able to be more versitile through giving up X to gain Y.  IMO warriors are a pretty simple class, and versitility would add to the class, as wel as m ake them much more desireble in exp groups, something they really need.<br />
<br />
As far as solo, I actually like that melees cant solo, i think this is as it should be.  Leme explain why, in a exp group the most important thing is consistant damage, in order to keep up with spawns and a good pull rate which yelieds a good stable rate of exp.  Melee have pretty much constand DPS, Casters on the other hand are burst dps, casters rely on mana.   <br />
<br />
This means 1 thing, in order for casters vs melee to be balanced, casters need to have higher burst damage, and melee will have higher long term damage.<br />
<br />
If the above statement is true, there is almost no reason to have a wizard in a group over a rogue, because with a rogue u gain constant dps, with a wizard, he oly nukes when he has mana.  Due to this melee are gona be much more group friendly, while casters will tend to solo.  This is why casters MUST have a solo advantage, because melees inately have a group advantage.<br />
<br />
SK being both caster and melee, fall in between, we can kinda solo, but are basicly a grouping class.</div></div><hr />

I saw 9 people on my server take out Sontalak, supposedly a level 70 mob. A necro has soloed the real VS. 90% of the game has been trivialized by PoP; the gear available, the AA available, spells available. SoE did this on their own, for whatever reason.  Even 'tougher' encounters like AoW have been greatly simplified by the skills and gear available.<br />
<br />
The only thing they could really could trivialize much at this point is PoP content. EQ as a game needs serious help; in my opinion it is quite beyond help. SoE panders to the desires of their broadest customer base, in effect shooting themselves in the foot. Their choices are revamp old zones, or release new &amp; likely crappy half finished expansions.<br />
<br />
I agree some melee classes have always needed help in the DPS area. Weapon skill caps come to mind; stupidity like knight archery cap makes me want to strangle people.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jobrill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Overall, I like it. The &quot;Innate discs&quot; are something I've been pushing for for a while. I think you might just keep it simple and remove the offensive/defensive discs altogether, and at level 51 give Warriors access to a slider bar, which when set at 0 makes them complete defensive, 100 completely offensive, 50 at &quot;normal.&quot;<br />
<br />
Personally, I dunno if you need to let Shields BOTH Parry and Riposte. I think just giving shields a chance to Block if Parry and Riposte fail (Based off Bash skill) would probably be fine.<br />
<br />
I'm still not quite sure where the reducing off-hand damage bonus thing comes into play, though? Why nerf that? It seems to me that the better thing to do is to make Shields more desirable in terms of mitigating damage, so that it's worth giving up the offhand to wield one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
thats a BUFF for the offhand...  current offhand damage bonus is always 1 right now.<br />
<br />
From my understanding, allowing riposte and Parry re-check is fine as riposte is a child node of parry.... in other words, you likely have to parry before you can riposte.<br />
<br />
Hit PASS<br />
Dodge? FAIL<br />
Parry? PASS<br />
Riposte? PASS<br />
<br />
Mob is riposted<br />
<br />
<br />

Parry? PASS<br />
Riposte? FAIL<br />

<br />
Hit PASS<br />
Dodge? FAIL<br />
Parry? FAIL<br />
Riposte (auto fail)<br />
<br />
mob hits you<br />
<br />
<br />
Either way, its a small bonus to shields, which might make them desireable over 2H and 1H, even with disreable alternatives.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">your rebalancing patch is extremly unbalanced you would overbalance sk's, only thing melees need as far as rebalancing goes is better raid damage (similar to casters needing better exp group damage)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Zulpel Bonstalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Paladins and SK's are Knights Right?<br />
So i believe that as a Knight i should be able to take some punishment. <br />
<br />
<br />
My Idea Is that Knights should some sort of /defensive Disc<br />
Somethin they could use for Exping.<br />
<br />
I see my Level 62 BL friend Using his Evasive Disc all the time<br />
<br />
So here's the Idea<br />
<br />
Level 53 Rolls around, You get a Disc Named Knights Defense<br />
<br />
It Cuts Damage But a certain Percentage be it 1/4 1/3 1/2<br />
<br />
But you also Do that much less damage. i dont know about anyone else but i'm always looking to Last longer as aposed to doing more Damage.<br />
<br />
I dont know warriors to well but i know they get a Disc Similar if not Exactly to the one i am describing, but Sk's get Crappy Disc's for Exping, or get them too late ( Leechcurse )<br />
<br />
I mean What the hell will i be Soloing at level 60?<br />
<br />
lemme know your opinions.......and tell me if i'm flaming so i dont do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Naraz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">wouldn't want a parry disc at all. why?<br />
sk would prob take over the boss positioning ho job rangers currently do. <br />
<br />
anyways keeping i see  <br />
melee side<br />
-knights and wars put on  new tanking tables. wars one step better of coruse.  <br />
-ID aa tad more better<br />
-sk weap and offense cap raised a tad. like 235-240<br />
-more melee aa like spell absorbption, miss less and strike though<br />
<br />
<br />
spell side<br />
-hybrids specialize spell abiliitys at level 55<br />
-blue pet to 65<br />
-int aa<br />
-leech touch on its own timer<br />
-extend buff aa<br />
-voice lines no refresh time</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Drakonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I like that idea of gaining Specialise magic abilities at lvl 60 or 65 or something... good suggestion.<br />
<br />
The problem with a defensive disc for knights is that we'd put warriors out of business... however if there was one with much less effect than the warrior defensive, it would help a lot...<br />
<br />
Something like, give paladins a disc which allows them to Slay Undead on any mob for a 2 min or so duration, while SKs get a 2 min mini defensive disc, not powerful enough to make warriors redundant, but enough to give us a tanking edge when needed.<br />
<br />
Also it would be nice to see both knight classes get a dodge or parry or riposte type disc... always thought of the possibility of having a train of mobs land on you, /disc dodge, cast FD, safe.  Would be useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Rajsy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">That argument about rangers having 240 defense skill so SKs should get 240 weapon skill is not very thought out. It would make SKs way too powerful.<br />
<br />
As it is now Rangers have maybe 1000-1500 less HP than a similarly equipped SK and 100-200AC less. Rangers are also on a different mitigation table meaning we dont mitigate as well as an SK even though we have the same AC.<br />
<br />
Dual wield right now deals maybe 10-20% less damage than a 2hander from the same era making the ranger advantage of dual wield mean nothing at all. Take into account that SKs can deal a bit more spell DPS than rangers and that the pet does about 40dps and you have the reason why SKs shouldnt get any raised skill cap for weapons.<br />
<br />
Anyway you can always dream 8)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Mystina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">My vision of the thing =<br />
** 2H : you do very good damages but your defensive sucks<br />
** 1H/shield : you do below average damages but you gain alot of defensive<br />
**1H dual : you are an aggro machine<br />
<br />
What I would not change:<br />
_2H aa skills remain for 2H only<br />
_1H weapons would keep theire crap damage bonus<br />
<br />
What I'd change:<br />
<br />
_Increase 2H weapon skills cap, piercing would remain as it is<br />
_Totally remove any ac and hp stats on every 2H weapons, reduce resist stats<br />
_On some 2 handers, replace &quot;defensive&quot; procs by offensive procs<br />
_Increase damage stat on every 2H weapons, delay remains as it is, 2H piercing weapons would get a slightly higher bonus<br />
_Increase 2H damage bonus, 2H piercing weapons would get a slightly higher bonus<br />
_Replace fury of the ages by same kind of skill but working only on 2H<br />
<br />
_Greatly increase shields ac, hp, and resist stats; add to some of em some potime-like focuses reducing melee and spell damages<br />
_Give to shields a new diablo-like block stat, that is boosted by high agi and dex<br />
_Add a knight+warrior aa that increases chances to block with shield<br />
_&quot;Maybe&quot; (not sure about it) nerf some 1H weap damages and add to em some taunting procs<br />
<br />
About other classes:<br />
_Increase ac and hp stats on warrior only 1H weapons<br />
_Increase Blade of war's ratio and make it warrior only<br />
_Increase 1H hand weapons aggro, hitting more frequently would give an aggro bonus, but not big enough to make damage stat/ratio useless<br />
<br />
Archery:<br />
_Make auto attack possible with archery<br />
_Raise knights archery cap to a normal value (~200)<br />
_Erase the &quot;bug&quot; thing preventing archery to not work on a mob that is near a wall (IF it is possible, which I doubt :( )<br />
_Maybe some other things for rangers only but I dont know this class well enough to talk about it, they would *maybe* need some melee aas to increase 1H-2H damage and maybe reduce aggro<br />
<br />
ps: it might be overpowered, I've got no time right now to think further about it, but the big line = what is in bold</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Xanathol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Had a long post drawn up, etc, but bottomline, IMO, our attack for 2h_ should max out at the same value as warriors, as well as repoiste, parry, &amp; bash.<br />
<br />
VI / SoE obivously wanted us to use 2hers ( judging from the AAs ) and when I think of a knight, I think of someone skilled and trained in sword play, therefore up repoiste and parry. Bashing seems to fall under these same guideline IMO.<br />
<br />
As far as damage mitigation, I think that besides diciplines, we should still be able to tank as well as Warrirors.<br />
<br />
I have much more detailed reasoning for my opinions, but I am too lazy to type them all. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Xanathol wants the warriors to quit.  :rolleyes:<br />

Defensive or a pet, spells, harmtouch, feign death, harmshield, lifetaps, etc... you choose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Karnij</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I liked briks changes nothing made us shadowknights to overpowered<br />
<br />
<br />
the one thing I have always hated about my sk is our worthless ass disc<br />
<br />
wow I can heal my self for 15 seconds and save my ass for 15 seconds LOL<br />
<br />
or WOW <br />
<br />
BOOM 7200<br />
<br />
now I do crap for dps for the next 40 minutes <br />
<br />
I would like to see the 2hs damage increased for knights we are THE 2hs wielding classes pal/sk<br />
<br />
mitigate a little better new tables for damage etc<br />
<br />
and that BLOODBATH disc is a ingenius idea heal and do damage for 20 seconds for every hit and repost <br />
<br />
maybe use it every hour ?! I dunno seems like a bad ass idea</div></div><hr />
