This will enable you to keep all of the users information, including passwords, post counts, registered dates, etc. All you have to do is overwrite the existing tables.<br />
<br />
Assuming of course, I'm not the horrible person Dregor seems to think I am :)  *groans*<br />
<br />
Regardless, shoot me an email if you want some help with it.<br />

<br />
Xilith, if you want, I can have my sysadmin restore your entire database.. that is why I dumped it for you. Then, all you have to do is point your vBulletin to the database and you have exactly everything as I left it... posts, forums, user info, etc.<br />
<br />
I didn't intend to make this difficult for you all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sunmoon</div><div class="date">03-25-2002, 06:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, I still have the graphics for the headers if you wish.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darksithe</div><div class="date">03-25-2002, 10:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Would be nice to have the graphics;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SoulVoid</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 12:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We had the user info Sunmoon but due to some very promenent legal reasons it was decided that we would not be using it on the public site. The primary difficulty we are having at this point is  figuring out how the databases associate threads with forums etc. Once we get that sorted out it will be just a matter of updating the forum numbers and inserting the data. If you know how it does the associating it would save us some valuable time which we are short on.<br />
<br />
We could tho use a new dump of the last time TKW was active so we don't loose any info. I also ask that you don't distribute that original dump. Xilith deleted it as soon as I told him it. If you want further info on why feel free to contact me on ICQ or PM here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xilith</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 11:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have all the graphics and html / cfm files from TKW.  I'll be putting them up on the main site soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sunmoon</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 12:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Soul, to be honest, I don't know much about tying SQL into the new boards and such. I have a system administrator that did it for me.<br />
<br />
If you want, you can reach him at mark@html.com and tell him Dave sent you. He's a very good guy and can get things going in only minutes.<br />
<br />
The only dump I have is what I gave Xilith. Unfortunately, when my sysadmin backed up my other DB's, the SK one was overwritten. I told Xilith I had rm -R'ed your directory :(<br />
<br />
Once I knew Xilith had the dump, I removed it.. though I'm not sure what legal issues you are talking about. Everything on the board was owned, or created by me except for the little SK logo.<br />
<br />
Also, I put up a redirect where the old forums are, so your users should be able to find you now.<br />
<br />
Best of luck!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sunmoon</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 06:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ahhh.. that makes more sense. Well, in truth, you can restore the boards without knowing what those were. I didn't even think of that problem as I've never looked up passwords.<br />
<br />
I always use different passwords on boards than I do for sensitive things anyway.</div></div><hr />
