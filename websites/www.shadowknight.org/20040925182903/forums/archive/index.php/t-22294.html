<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Leafweir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So my friends tell me, go to Game Stop, pre-order EQ2, you get free j-boots for EQ2 and the character creation program.<br />
<br />
I mess around with the videos and stuff and then finally get into character creation. Naturally I choose Dark Elf Male as my starting point.  While I appreciate the depth of the character creation process, it's missing a few things... Like the button that makes me not look like a fucking girl.<br />
<br />
OMG, who the hell thought up these hairstyles, there are only three that don't look completely homosexual (they're only mostly homosexual). The braided pont tail, bald, and the last one, roguish something. The beards are completely unsalvageable. As a side note Dark Elf female hair isn't much better, any one with any sense of decorum will be choosing Hand Maiden every time, the rest are ridiculous.<br />
<br />
I managed to whip up something that looked halfway decent except for every Dark Elf male being openly gay or at the very least metrosexual. *sigh* Maybe I can die a Barbarian blue and pretend I'm a DE =(<br />
<br />
As bad as we are though, I really feel sorry for Erudites. Apparently they've all been replaced by extras from alien nation. =( I hope this crap ain't the final release, but I fear it is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
btw how do the iksars look?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The Iksar need more color options and more scale patterns, which they have said they will be putting back in once they have them fixed.  Some people hate the appearance of the Iksar, some like it.  I happen to like it, especially the female Iksar's lack of mammalian features.  They get an animated head crest instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I like the selection of gnome glasses.</div></div><hr />

Sorry, there's no troll anymore.<br />
<br />
They have been replaced by gremlins.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Lejina Bloodbath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Btw, there's a ton of EQ2 characters pics on the FoH board.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kahntun Derstand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Holy shit.  Those pics on the FoH board look terrible.  I'm glad I'm not going to play that game.  I'd rather look like the original EQ troll model than look that badly in EQ2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">it is a sad day for erudites and trolls</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I didn't think the troll's were bad.  I mean at least now they look like a race that could get thier green asses handed to them by a bunch of frogs.<br />
<br />
Erudites don't look erudite anymore though.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>synnoira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The character models are weak. Any time i've just about reconciled myself to them i seem to see some direct comparison of the figures to something resembling actual art. <br />
<br />
There was a comparison between the human female model in EQ2 and the new human female models in DAoC that was damning. And another i saw taking the Kerran models to task, turn them sideways and they really do look like a neanderthal man with a light coating of fur. Really put me off my kerra sk idea.<br />
<br />
Although i am only going off what i've seen posted on various boards, since i have solemnly sworn never under any circumstance to pre-order from SOE. The ogres have looked decent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Pestulance</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Those dark elves all look like they're sucking on a sour candy or something...<br />

Nice fucking over of the erudites, too.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Space</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Think im gonna haveta ditch DE - least they cant possibly be as ghey as the dark elves in Lineage 2, i thought i was in some perverted Michael hutchence  homo s&amp;m catalogue</div></div><hr />
