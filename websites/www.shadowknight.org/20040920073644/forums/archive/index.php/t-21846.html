<br />
Q: An soe rep was quoted from eqlive as saying shields rased the ac cap. Is this referring to a softcap, or the obvious raise in AC by adding a higher ac item?<br />
A:&quot;Shields do indeed raise the soft cap by the amount of AC on the shield. We were also looking into the possibility of allowing people who use shields to get a chance to block with them. &quot;<br />
<br />
Q: Is the timeweaver pet nerf intentional?<br />
A: &quot;There was an issue with the NPC's skills related to recent skill changes. It will be fixed for the next Live update.&quot;<br />
<br />
Q: Any updates on augment removal?<br />
A: &quot;The base system will be on Test today. Which features a new window when you click on the Augmentation Sealer world container. The functionality to remove augments using new solvents is in, however you may not be able to get the new solvents just yet. Design is still finalizing that process. In addition to this, the process to delete augments has changed slightly. You don't need a specific solvent and you delete the augment you want by selecting the slot.<br />
<br />
Btw, the augment refund guy will be removed. This won't be a way to get refunds for all your unwanted augments. <br />
<br />
The price for the solvents is going to scale based on the value of the augment. &quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Thats interesting.  Looks like my type 7s will just have to rot with no trade in.  Whats with the scaling cost?  Its a flat out wrong assumption to think that because someone has raid level augs that they have a bigger bank account.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm wondering if the solvents will require adventure points to acquire instead of platinum, and if they do, how that price will compare with just buying a new augmentation stone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Casual players get blasted constantly for &quot;wanting the reward without the time spent&quot;.  I have no problem at all with raiders being forced to put in a little time farming cash in order to recycle their augments.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Fair enuf. :) I am more than willing to trade refunding NPC for the ability to move damn augs around on my gear and still can use them after gear upgrades than losing them entirely. I never used refunding npc anyway. ;) I can't wait to get 10 AC augs back from bank that were stuck with obselete gear that I had before and can't wait to be able to move my damn expensive focus augs around to their right places and be able to move them onto new upgraded gears.  40 hp augs will become INVESTABLE, useful augs once again! Cuz you can keep using same hp augs no matter if your gear is going to get upgraded or not. It is painful to buy 40 hp aug for 1150 pts and put it on a bp only to find out that you got new bp unexpected in 1 month and you are a sucker cuz you wasted 1150 pts for only 1 month usage.. That blows.. With aug removals, you will cherish augs even more and you won't feel &quot;wasted&quot; if you got upgraded gears anymore. :)<br />
<br />
Some people placed augs in wrong places and they regretted for good. Now, with removal, they can finally NOLONGER regret for their placement errors. ;)<br />
<br />
I heard rumors about VP key being able to reward you with NICE aug when VP revamp comes. I was actually too scared to USE it cuz its ONE-time aug offer WITHOUT any way to get it back again after gear upgrade. With aug removal, I would feel much more safer JUST to use damn VP reward aug. ;)</div></div><hr />

Those are cut-n-pastes from the community leader boards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">removing the aug trade in dude kinda sucks... but losing a good aug sucks even more.  Oh well cant have both i guess =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Mystereon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I think we will see the trade in guy back. I think it will be once they decide to let people sell back LDon stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sindian Sanguis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Augments should be simply &quot;Combine/Decombine&quot; when you want how you want, the most painful part should be the walk to the adventure camp to do it.  None of this solvent crap, none of this solvent whose price scales with the &quot;value&quot; of the augment.  Really I don't know why it can't be that simple.  Don't get me wrong, I am very glad they will be removable/reusable.  Just wish it was a simple process instead of wasting time coming up with a new solvent, then trying to determine how thats made or how much value each augment is worth.  Oh well guess we will see how/if retarded the prices will be shortly. Currently slot 1 solvent for example is like 10pp, imo shouldn't be more then that.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">it'd be nice to change in type7 augs for type8 augs tho =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Manslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Apparently around 10.5k to be able to remove type 8 raid level augs.  Makes for a plat sink for those that have nothing really to buy I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">....<br />
<br />
i hope thats not true</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">If it's true I don't mind.  If you expect lower end people to get plat, it's only fair to expect higher end people to as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">ya i guess ill just have to piggy my rogue into elems to loot rotting shit instead of funding new gear myself then , bleh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Plat sinks are good for the economy anyway.  The closer the rate money leaves the economy becomes to the rate it enters it, the better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Khat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Every time I upgraded a slot I would bank the item with the augment, rather than remove it with a solvent.<br />
It was a just-in-case measure if they ever decided to give the ability to swap out augments in the future.<br />
I need all the aug drops I can get cuz my stuff is rather crummy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Space</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I knew there was a reason i never destroyed all my old armor ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">This is ghey that you can't sell the augs back.   I want to upgrade the type 7 to type 8 !</div></div><hr />
