<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">get to level 30 and get feign death. Hope your Abjuration is maxed by using Endure Cold, if not plan on fizzling forever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>gwenwhyvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Work on your divination too, for that very useful spell, Gather Shadows (invis).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaggnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have to second the recommendation to practice your abjuration.   Feign Death is a powerful ally - it allows you to get out of trouble in tight situations, and considering you get no pacify/lull spells for living mobs -- it can become a useful way to split-pull a camp.    It's boring to sit and cast Endure Cold on yourself over and over again, but trust me - you need it.    If you ever make it to 54, you get Banshee Aura too - and if you're abjuration isn't 185 you're not going to be able to reliably cast it.  *don't ask me how I know that, lol*<br />
<br />
Another recommendation is to practice all of your weapon skills, starting with 1HS and 2HS, and if you have time - work piercing, 1HB, and 2HS as well.    Many melees only work on one or two weapons skills because they can take a long time to develop - but when the day comes that you get a nice weapon in a skill you do not possess, you're going to regret having to head out into the field looking for dark blue mobs with a weapon you can't hit a tee-ball with.   *heh*<br />
