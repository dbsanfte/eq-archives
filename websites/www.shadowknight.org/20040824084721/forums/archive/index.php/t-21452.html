Ironically, it was a little more than a year ago when President George W. Bush visited Timken's world headquarters heralding his tax cut and job creation plan. Now this very company's job cuts will be a major blow to the economy in Canton.&quot; <br />

Grim, people would take you a lot more seriously if you actually presented both sides.  Yes these jobs are leaving America because the cost of manufacturing in America is too high, but you also fail to mention that in the last two months over 500,000 jobs have been created (you can't make that shit up).  And the reason that this company is laying off employees is that producing in America is extremely expensive, not because of anything Bush did.  That cost gets passed down to the consumer, and then I'm sure you'd find a way to blame Bush for the higher prices that would result.  Yeah Bush went to that company saying that his tax cuts would create jobs, and that was not a lie.  It just didn't help preserve jobs that are more economically viable in other countries.<br />
Now the 500,000 jobs created still doesn't put us where we were before the recession, but we should wait to see if this trend continues before we speculate.  <br />
<br />
And if you want to discuss the long-term net postive effects of outsourcing high-cost manufacturing jobs or producing overseas, I'd be glad to discuss that with you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Contrary to news reports about a booming job market, there just isn't any evidence of one. We have had some numbers which have suggested that a recovery could be on the way, but we really haven't had jobs numbers that were that solid.<br />
<br />
New jobs from the February totalled 83K. New jobs from the March report totalled 337K. From April, 288K.<br />
<br />
For some perspective, this  handy graph (http://www.musicforamerica.org/node/view/1323) shows us Clinton averaged 242K new jobs every month over his 1st term, and 235K new jobs every month during his 2nd. Bush has had two good months. Let's hope they continue, but all the talk of the massive recovery in the labor market is so far mostly talk.<br />
<br />
Those high oil prices aren't going to help.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, you might be mostly right about that. I'm not sure what prices are for you guys, as I'm not up on my litre-gallon conversions (and don't care to take the time to figure it out), but I just saw a report on this the other day. In Canada (where I live) gas has just gone up to almost $1.00/litre. In Britain, it was something like $2.40/litre(Canadian, all prices here will be in Canadian currency), France was $1.62 or $1.64, then they showed Venezuala(sp?). $0.10/litre. Yeah. Basically free fucking gas. So not EVERYWHERE has more expensive gas than you, but it seems that here in North America we're not doing all that badly yet.<br />
<br />
Edit: Damn Canadian school systems, tehy dedn't teech me to speel veri goot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Chayde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">There is about 4 liters to a gallon<br />
<br />
Here in Southern California, I pay $2.19 a gallon.<br />
Which is something like .55¢  per liter.<br />
<br />
Estimate is off a bit, because it isn't exacty 4 liters to a gallon... Kinda like 3.76 or some weird number.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
Grim, <br />
<br />
Despite your opinions and wishes, the economy is growing at a rapid pace.  Our GDP is growing at about 4.5% per quarter, which is indicative of a growing economy.  This number is expected to jump next quarter as well.  History has shown us that jobs are a lagging indicator, meaning that they are the last thing to improve in a growing economy.  Don't be surprised if we have another month or two of a bad job market.  This cannot continue for very long, however, with our economy growing at its current rate.<br />
<br />
Also, comparing Clinton's job history to Bush's is totally unfair.  It's like comparing apples and oranges.  Bush inherited an economy that was on the tail end of an unprecedented expansion led by the tech industry.  The economy was inflated far beyond what it should have, and everyone was expecting a significant &quot;correction&quot;.  Two months after coming into office that bubble burst, and if you want to say that in two months Bush caused the bubble to burst, then you are being completely irrational and ignorant.  You are also failing to factor in that nine months after Bush took office the heart of our economy was attacked by the worst act of terrorism in history.  Do you think Wall Street's reaction would have been any different if there was a different president in the office?  If so you are not being truthful.  <br />
<br />
The fact of the matter is that a large percentage of the jobs that are currently being lost are manufacturing jobs, and these jobs are not coming back, nor will they in the century.  It is just too expensive to manufacture in America and still be competitive.  Those jobs will not come back to America until the rest of the world's rage rate is comparable to ours.  Now if you want to argue about protectionism, sure, we could do that.  But the higher prices of producing in America would then be passed onto the consumer, and we'd also have to worry about the responses of foreign countries to our protectionism.  In the past when we have tried to protect domestic manufacturing jobs by raising tariffs on foreign goods those countries have responded with similar tariffs, essentially not allowing our companies to sell our products overseas.  The net effect of this is after several years more jobs are lost due to the fact that companies aren't making as much money because they can't sell their products to foreign markets.  There was a great article on the Wall Street Journal's online site about the long-term net positive effects of shipping jobs overseas that I think you would find interesting, but you need to have a subscription to WSJ to access it, and I don't really want to give mine out.  If you do have a subscription, the article was dated March 29, 2004, and titled &quot;Finding Lessons of Outsourcing In 4 Historical Tales.&quot;  <br />
<br />
<br />
You're right that the oil prices are harming the economy, but about a quarter of the price of gas is solely due to the fact that people are worried about what will happen to gas prices in the future.  You can't totally blame the president for the price of gas as American presidents do not really have much influence on the amount OPEC will produce.  In the past when presidents have pressured OPEC to increase production they have responded with decreases in production.  We had high gas prices under Clinton as well.  What you can blame our presidents for is their refusal to invest heavily in alternative sources for fuel.  It pisses me off that we have to buy oil from these countries that despise us while we have the technology to be significantly reduce the amount of oil we need.  That's what you can fault Bush, Clinton, and every other president for.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Grim I'm glad that you're concerned about job loss, but the way you post your concerns makes it seem that you're purely partisan and that you're just using the job situation as another way to bash our president.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Our whole economy is WAAAY more dependant on cheap gas than anywhere else in the world. High oil prices are much worse for us. And a nice chunk of the high cost of gas in forigen countries is due to taxes. <br />

Don't supscribe to WSJ. Their news and investment reporting is spot-on, but their editorial staff and collumnists are freaky right-wing douchebags. <br />
<br />
As for the GDP, &quot;more money&quot; doesn't mean &quot;more money for workers&quot;. From what I've read the GDP is being fucked up by that grand outsourcing you mention. NIPA's have been slowing since 2000 and were FLAT in 2003. Hell the GDI is lagging far behind the GPD since 2001 too. And both are getting worse. <br />
<br />
Here's a quick example of the effects I'm talking about:<br />
http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/03_51/b3863049_mz010.htm<br />
<br />
Simply put - labor got fucked and business made out. That's what happened. Now the &quot;PREDICTION&quot; is that this huge boon to biz will transfer to labor. But that's not happened yet. I hope it does. I do. But yes, until it does I will use this to bash Bush. He's a royal fuckup and he should be fixing it or looking at how to fix it. Instead we get the whole iraq mess. <br />
<br />
It is just too expensive to manufacture in America and still be competitive. Those jobs will not come back to America until the rest of the world's rage rate is comparable to ours.  <br />

NIPA's have been slowing since 2000 and were FLAT in 2003. Hell the GDI is lagging far behind the GPD since 2001 too. And both are getting worse.   <br />
<br />
You're right, more money doesn't mean more money for workers.  But it does mean more money for businesses, which in turn use that money to expand or make new businesses, which in turn will create jobs in the near future.  Increased GDP also means more business being conducted, which is a good sign.  As for the GDP getting worse, that is not true.  Here is the site that lists the past and present GDP in today's dollars:<br />

Yes labor got &quot;fucked&quot; so to speak, but that's the way business is conducted.  While we haven't seen the full effect of the boon to business yet, we are just beginning to see an increase in the job market.  As far as Bush &quot;fixing it&quot;, we are now starting to see the effects of his tax cuts.  The Fed cut interest rates to an all time low, and is now strongly considering raising the rates because they see the direction the economy is heading.  Presidents can only do so much to improve economies.  If you think that the president is the only factor affecting our economy you are not being fair.  I ask you this, what would your solution be?  What is John Kerry's solution?  There is not much more any president could do to help the economy.  <br />

While I believe you when you post this figure, I would still like to see the data to back this up so I can see for myself.   Also, compare what that bottom 25% makes in our country to the bottom 25% in most other countries.  <br />
Regardless, this is a fact we have to deal with in a Capitalist economy.  There are gonna be people making the big bucks, and there are gonna be people making next to nothing.  That's life.  If you want a socialist economic system where everyone earns the same amount or the government redistributes income then come out and say it, otherwise we just have to deal with the economy we have. <br />
And if that is your argument against my statement that it is too expensive to produce in the U.S., that's not a fair rebuttal.  The labororers and union members that are involved with those manufacturing jobs make upwards of $40 per hour regular pay, not including OT/DT.  We can't compete with foreign manufacturers if we have to keep all of those employees and produce here.  We'd end up losing more jobs than we'd save.</div></div><hr />

The &quot;american&quot; system of measurements (originally British) is called the &quot;Customary System&quot; and it's inferior to the metric system.  As an american, I'd consider it a blessing if we'd officially switch to the metric system.  As it is, there are 3 nations in the world (US, Lyberia, and Manmarr [Sp?]) who use the customary system - the rest use the metric system.<br />
<br />
Metric is base 10, making conversions much, much easier.  It's also much, much more precise.  Overall, it's a superior system.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Arikash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">I was told that they are making America into a metric system using country, not immediatly, slowly but surely though.  They are going to start using it with the younger kids, eventually we'll be metric.  <br />
<br />
Back to the topic,<br />

BOOBIES ARE GOOD!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">So have I, but I've seen little evidence of it.  Most educated americans already know the metric system, especially the younger generation.  American products continue to plod along using customary units of measurement, american automobiles continue to use customary size parts, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Arikash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">I was never really taught the metric system(Go go MN public school), and if we switched, I'd have trouble at first, but I'd catch on.  Another issue with using customary, was that probe dealy that landed on mars, or was supposed to in like 2000, and got messed up.  That was a result of an American using customary, and a European or Asian using metric, and the numbers didn't go with eachother I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Metric is very, very easy to use.  You spend a few minutes memorizing the prefixes/suffixes and your good to go - it's base 10, meaning that everything converts in factors of 10.  <br />
<br />
Customary/metric incompatability is often a problem... ever tried to fix a foreign car with customary tools or visa versa?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Arikash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Nope, never tried to fix a car with the wrong tools, can imagine what it would be like though, shitty.  <br />
<br />
And hurray metric system is easy!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Chayde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">Americans probably use more ways to measure something than any other country. <br />
<br />
We measure the length of a race in meters, but the length of the long-jump  in feet and inches. An engine's power in horsepower and its displacement in liters.  Milk in gallons, soda in liters.<br />
<br />
<br />
Becoming metric is not a one-time event that has either happened or not. It is a process that happens over time. <br />
We are slowly in the process of changing our systems to match the rest of the world, but some things take longer than other things.<br />
<br />
And as for kids learning it in school, since I work at the schools, I know that the children can not pass second grade without knowing the metric system. It is on the state standardized test, and on the Star test as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
*Edit: Have you ever read recipes? Sometimes it asks for cups, liters, ounces....ext Most of us do know the metric system, our world would be difficult if we didn't.</div></div><hr />

Aye, my 1986 Mustang was the same way.  I think they manufactured the engine overseas, and shipped to US for assembly.  All the body parts were standard.  I always hated working on that thing....<br />
