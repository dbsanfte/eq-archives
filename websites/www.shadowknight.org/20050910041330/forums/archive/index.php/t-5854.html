Figured I had to complete the experience by giving EQ a spin. I'm a complete  newb to the game mechanics, but like I said, I've been gaming a long time, so I don't expect a lot of trouble picking up game mechanics.<br />
<br />
I haven't even started yet - but the class that best fits my playstyle looks like it's got to be the SK. I'd like to go Iksar as my race.<br />
<br />
Any tips or starting suggestions for this type of SK would be greatly  appreciated.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Korekil</div><div class="date">09-20-2002, 09:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I put 15 points in STA and 5 in INT at start, and never regretted it, you might want to put all 20 in STA though.<br />
Field of Bone is the best newbie zone in the game, once u start outlevelling that go to Kurn's Tower. Its mainly undead there, about level 20 u can go to LOIO, I spent 25-30 soloing the Forest Giants in WW, and doing the Giant fort in FM. <br />
Made 30-40 in Kaesora (its a bring your own group dungeon, and is one way, and also not very forgiving) and OT. 40-45 in DL really, 45+ soloing in DL and doing the entrance to The Hole in a small group.<br />
Do your khukri quests, keeps you interested, and your Dreadscale, though don't expect to see the leggings or a couple of other pieces. Breastplate and gauntles and bracers easy though.<br />
REmember you are KOS (kill on sight) to all the old world and OT and FV on kunark, so avoid them. Once you get Gather Shadows (invisibility) and FEign Death you can travel fairly safely.<br />
YOu'll enjoy the game more if you do the Khurkri and Dreadscale quests, gets you right into the story and history of the Iksar. If you ar eon the Antonius Bayle server, give me a tell - I have a few items that can help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lizarde</div><div class="date">09-21-2002, 10:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The nice thing about Iksar is that you can level to 30 or 40 without being more than two zones away from Cabilis, your home city.  There are three zones with excellent newbie areas, and you can level to 20 in the Field of Bone if you want, though I'd head to Kurn's Tower at level 11 or so with a couple of friends.<br />
<br />
Do the Khukri quests, as Korekil said, they are a fun goal to set for yourself, and most of them are not too hard, though some stages can take a while and get a bit frustrating.  Also, do the Curscale armor quests (assuming you will not be twinking this character).  See the merchant in the Haggle Baron in East Cabilis, he will give you the quest.  You can start it at level 1 by killing the scaled wolf pups, and should have several pieces by the time the pups are green (level 4 or 5 I think).  It's one of the few quests that you'll find where the rewards are level-appropriate, IMO.  In fact, you can get lots of good stuff at low levels in FoB.<br />
<br />
Again, if you are not planning to twink- while you are hunting the pups, keep an eye out for decayed skeletons (and make sure you don't attack a higher level skellie by mistake; sometimes level 9-10 mobs will wander thru the newbie area).  Sometimes they carry a rusty weapon, either a Fer'esch (5/28 or thereabouts) a Sheer Blade (6/32 ?) or a Shan'Tok (8/42).  The Shan'Tok, in particular, is a very nice upgrade at level 2 or 3 (or even level 1!).<br />
<br />
Sometimes you'll also see one with a shield, an Iksar Targ Shield, stats are something like AC 8, WT 7.0.  If you get any extras, they sell for just over 1pp.  But getting one means you can start to use bash once you get level 6.<br />
<br />
And look into the Dreadscale quests, it's pretty good armor if you can get it early enough, lots of STA on many of the pieces.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nexen</div><div class="date">09-27-2002, 09:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Until level 30 it will be a bit rough assuming no one is twinking you.  Also the SK doesnt really come onto its own until the highest levels, so the payoff takes a while.  <br />
<br />
Oh, ignore the whiners of this board complaining that the SK class needs help, they are just babies who want the bubblegum and the lollypop.<br />
<br />
Have fun, EQ is an amazing game.<br />
