<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nartuuk</div><div class="date">03-03-2005, 04:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Being an Ogre, i naturally have the ability to bash while weilding a 2Hander. Now when i bash with a shield, i notice i can and do stun the mob, with a 2Hander, not only is the bash damage less(of course) but ive never seen myself stun a mob. Now, is it possible to stun a mob with 2Hand bash, and does the AA ability help with that, or is it useless to Ogres? Ok hope thats clear enough for someone to answer!</div></div><hr />

That said, not ever having a slam-capable race, I'm not sure about that part.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Croix VorAbaddon</div><div class="date">03-04-2005, 12:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've noticed bashing with a shield seems to hit significantly more often than with a 2hander, and, therefore, seems more likely to stun. Any of our local parse nuts have any numbers?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">window</div><div class="date">03-04-2005, 01:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">your hit rate is based on your offense and weapon skill compared to the mobs stats. whether you're using a 2her or shield to bash, your skill in bash does not change, and your offense does not change, so i doubt your hit rate changes. its possible, but i doubt it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nartuuk</div><div class="date">03-04-2005, 02:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok what about with stuns? Is it possible to stun with a 2hander? And as an ogre is it worth getting the 2hander bash AAs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">window</div><div class="date">03-04-2005, 06:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yes, you can stun using a 2her. i don't know if the rate differs between slam/shield bash/2h bash. i would guess there is no difference between shield bash/2h bash, but don't know if slam is on a different skill check.<br />
<br />
as to whether or not its worth getting, it depends on how often you use lich or another illusion and a 2her. if you're usually using a 1h/shield, or if you usually play without any illusion, its obviously not worth much. if you play liched a lot and only use a 2her, then its value is greater.</div></div><hr />
