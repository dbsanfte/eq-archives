Hi, i'm a 65 Dark Elf Inny-worshipper, I have done nothing with any of my iksar factions except kill a few iksars (one of them being Alchemist Granika, so i'm pretty sure that getting faction is gonna suck), but I am looking to start my Greenmist quest, and was wondering which factions i'm going to need, and if you could list the easiest ways to get those factions, that would be superb. Thanks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wienaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Far and away the easiest way to get all iksar faction is to go to Veksar, solo any mob you see with a weapon, and /ooc about every 20 minutes that you will buy any and all weapons that drop.  Then, once you have about ten sets of 4 (sets have to be of the same weapon), go out and turn them into Syrik Iceblood in LoIO for a great faction hit.  About 25 or so turn ins should get you non kos with all 5 factions (think its merchants that doesn't get affected, can't remember for sure)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Awesome, thanks so much! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">and just to let anyone know that reads this thread, its the necros (Brood of Kotiz) that don't get affected; this quest has the same faction hits as the bonechip quest and the explorer quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nosnorb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You have to kill Iksar bandits manslayers maurader etc etc t get Brood of Kotiz up...only way Ive found.  Warsilk Woods is a good place to kill them the cave is full of them and theres a few huts full of them too.</div></div><hr />
