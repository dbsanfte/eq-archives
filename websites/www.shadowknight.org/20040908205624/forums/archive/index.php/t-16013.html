<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Golzith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK as an iksar what factions do i need to raise and how do i go about raising them in order to do this?  Will potions work?  Any help at all greatly appreciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Silvershadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Epic turnins are based on Truespirit, do seal running or just use invis trick if you wish. I preferred the safer road of getting faction up by seal running, but that's me -_-<br />
<br />
Being non-KoS to some stuff helps but there are ways around it all I guess. Truespirit is for turnins and that's what matters most. And no, potions don't work for that, but might work to get around being KoS to mobs near those quest mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Talonmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I would think the only 2 non truespirit factions worth worrying about (maybe) would be heretics in paineel (a couple turn in mobs are in there and it gets annoying getting wacked by greenies)  and possibly the bloodsabers in Qeynos.  Neither are NEEDED for the quest, but our hand in guys are usually surrounded by them.<br />
<br />
Both factions are easy as hell to fix / boost to non-kos, even for iksar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Golzith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What about truespirit ... do i start off kos to them? and if so how do i get it up enough to start the quests</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>yuggoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Iksars start off apprehensive to truespirit, same as all others. <br />
<br />
As was said, faction is pretty much a non-issue with the epic.  I got Paineel faction mainly because I like killing Erudite pallys, and I wanted a Hole key.  I got bloodsaber faction from killing the fish in Qeynos because it ticked off the pallys.  Both were pretty easy, and neither was necessary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vaelenu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you don't want to lose Erudin faction you can kill Kobalds in the Warrens for faction with both. Named Kobalds give more faction and you can easily do the rounds and clean them all out. Now I can walk into the Erudin library and the foreheads can't do a damn thing about it :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>yuggoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Killing pallys &gt; Erudin faction</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Golzith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks for all the replys and help.  I've never worried about faction, one of the reason i picked iksar was cause i liked the idea of being hated everywhere.  My idea of faction is invis and FD.<br />
