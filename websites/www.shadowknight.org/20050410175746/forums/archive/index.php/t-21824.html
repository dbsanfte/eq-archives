<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Crot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anyone done a LDoN raid succesfully ? Ill try to lead one for my guild in the next weeks but cant find any sound information. <br />
Any info would help :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes but I'm a firm believer in a huge part in the challenge (and fun) of them being the steep learning curve so I'm not inclined to give out too much info.  A good one to start your guild on though would be the easy Tak or MM raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Daerkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I agree with Brael, but just to give some perspective to hard LDON raids, I did a few with my old guild (which at that time was very capable elemental guild, one kill from Time). In 3 LDON raids we succeeded once! (most bitched so much we didnt do many more) Mostly because the average guilds (ours was no exception on this) approach raids in a very laid back fashion, afks and the deaths through idiocy being commonplace - that shit kills you on LDON raids. Basically the dumb asses cost your wins, too many deaths and you fail, and timers are tight until you get used to the layouts. I always thought they were fun, but the loot generally sucked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nambkab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Just out of curiousity, how would a pre-elemental guild handle the easiest of the raids?  We tried a Miragul normal a few months back, and got raped at the zone in (mobs started coming to zone as soon as we aggroed anything, which happened every time we zoned in and we were overwhelmed fast).  I've been looking at trying one again, since I'm now one of the raid leaders.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">As annoying as the LDoN raids can be, they will do more for improving the overall skill of your guild as a unit than any other encounters up to that point. The guilds that did a ton of LDoN raiding were the ones to advance the quickest in Gates.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Crot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My Guild is really smal like 25 - 30 actives. I heard the raids with only 18 ppl would by a lot easier than the ones with 36ppl. We have some decent gear and cuz we are small we must rely on each other. So i hope we will make it</div></div><hr />

What on earth are you talking about? An 18 person LDoN raid just means that you are short 18 people, unless I've missed something completely. There are 18 person raids in this game, but they're all crap like the Hedge in PoN and the Qinimi event for BiC quest...and those are lame and dull...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Every single guild thats Time level should do LDoN raids, each one of them 15+ times preferably, you'll enjoy them (eventually) and they do so much for your guild.  I hope when augs become removeable more people will want to do them.  They're as fun as Inkuta and Uqua (as much as I bitch about that zone and make sure I'm buzzed any time we raid it, I really do like the place).  Absolutely great raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>tanadil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">My guild did a Ldon raid last night.<br />
<br />
To put in perspective we are a medium sized guild, doing lower tier Pop atm. Many equiped uto that level and with some decent Ldon gear all round.<br />
<br />
We chose MM (normal risk).<br />
<br />
We went in with 28 people all lvl 65. We had 4 clerics, 3 tank types(inc me), 1 bard, 1 monk and 3 chanters with the rest made up of DPs types.<br />
<br />
Despite the warnings from most evry forum I read, it actually wasnt too bad at all. <br />
<br />
The trash mobs hit hardish (ldon hard standard) with some of them rampaging!<br />
The mini bosses hit very hard indeed. But a CCH of 3 folks on the tank was OK. However we all reacted too slow to enrage at one point and ended up with a pile of dead people around the foot of the miniboss:P<br />
<br />
The end named's were OK, but there is a nice twist we which we figured too late and ran out of time:) But having worked out the script now, we will go back and complete it soon.<br />
<br />
Loot was non existent.<br />
<br />
However made a different change to the usual raids, and I would agree that its a great training ground for raiding.<br />
