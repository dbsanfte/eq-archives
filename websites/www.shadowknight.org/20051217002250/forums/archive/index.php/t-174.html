She is the one you can beat on and she will not fight back.   What is she for??   I was walking around the Rathe Mount when doing Lifeleech quest and a I saw a bunch of darkelf NPC in a small camp which were amiable to me so I started talking to them.  Well after a bunch of talking I was sent to NRO with a letter for this DE NPC well I gave her the note and nothing happened ((( and could not get anything out of her.  I am figureing and unfinished quest or bug, but was wondering if anyone else has had more luck than I.  I havnt taken the time to do back to RM and try again, maybe soon.   This also happened a few months ago so it could be fixed now.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?</div></div><hr />
