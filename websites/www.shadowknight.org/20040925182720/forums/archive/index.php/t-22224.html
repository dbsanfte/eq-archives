<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Khat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">That is exactly why it should be applied to all classes that have the SCS AA and not specifically one of our Top-10 items.<br />
If it were an SK-specific AA then I would say otherwise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Which really empasizes why it is not a class issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The top 10 lists aren't supposed to be limited to class balance problems - look at some of the things that have been on the lists (some being changed) thus far.  <br />
<br />
With it being on our list, and being discussed/pushed for by other classes (possibly ending up on their lists) it's pretty likely to be changed, probably quickly, as it's not likely a hard change.  <br />
<br />
Giving it a refund may only effect a small number of SK's, but getting it put on a toggle would effect everyone - it would go from being detrimental to useful instantaneously.  The huge outcry regarding it being on our list is because it's taking the place of necro rez anyway, and I think I've done a decent job of illustrating why that's not balanced elsewhere already.  <br />
<br />
Like I've said elsewhere, I don't have SCS and I'd much rather see &quot;Put SCS on a toggle&quot; on our list than &quot;give us necro rez&quot; because the former is reasonably likely to happen, fixes a huge issue for some (those who've purchased it), and a minor issue for the rest of us, whereas necro rez is an unbalanced pipedream.  We need a more well thought out answer to paladins' rez ability.  <br />
<br />

I would have explained a bit further in my original post, but I had to take a shit in a bad way... ended up constipated. :( :( :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">And you would propose getting it fixed how then? If its something that affects us (which it does) then it's a class issue.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Radahsam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I, personally, have no desire to lower my aggro.  I tank and offtank enough that I want to be fairly high up on the aggro list.   SKs have the ability to shed aggro through FD, so it has always been a mute point to me.  I would prefer to see the blasted waste of AA space replaced with something useful like a FD hotkey, necro rez, or whatever.  Even for those that like to go into &quot;burn&quot; mode, have you ever really stopped to think about the paltry DPS boost it gives a raid?  Maybe in a group it would be useful when you're not tanking, but that's about the only value I can see in SCS, and I have no plans to purchase it ever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Skoggel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Just putting SCS on the list only because it's our &quot;only&quot; avenue to communicate with devs is a pretty poor reason to do it. While I agree it's far more potent than other methods, there are other ways to get around to it, especially once enough people get behind the idea.<br />
<br />
Also, assuming it does get onto our SK list, it'd be a shame to see it end up being fixed and then have devs tell us &quot;hey look, we fixed some of the things you wanted, we fixed SCS for you!&quot;<br />
<br />
I'd like SCS to be made togglable for sure, especially for those that have already bought it (of many classes, especially SK though.) I don't think the SK class list is a place it deserves to fall though.<br />
<br />
Hell, tell Sony to add another AA to get a SCS toggle, they'll just be thrilled with that idea. It's the Sony way of fixing things, what more could they ask for?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If you read what I've already posted in three other threads, I'm well aware that rez is a balance problem.  The catch is, giving us rez simply creates another balance problem.  Necro rez isn't the correct fix.  <br />
<br />
If we put it on the list it isn't just a case of &quot;ask for it and maybe we get it, if not, no loss.&quot;  <br />
<br />
If we put it on the list, we might get it, and then we have an overpowered secondary ability leaving us completely fucked for fixing our primary ability.  That's never a good thing.  <br />
<br />
If we don't get it, then we've had something useless in our top 10 for a month by the time we get to replace it, not to mention that asking for overpowered abilities doesn't exactly look good.  If we put it on the list and it gets rejected, we may well lose the opportunity to put a more well thought out ability along the same lines up for consideration at a later date.  Like you said, we do need something to balance the desirability of paladins' rez, and some form of rez/rez-like ability that manages to be useful but not overpowered is probably the best way to achieve this.  We'd do better to come up with a good, balanced possibility and put that on the list than risk closing the door by asking for something we shouldn't have.</div></div><hr />

Despite this arguement of rez/scs; we all have to realize, the main focus for all SKs is getting tanking improvements.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Well, we were reading the shaman boards and we saw them requesting SCS so they can aggro kite better.  We don't really like aggro kiting, but we feel that as this is an archetype AA, to have it function for one class differently from others wouldn't be fair, and we don't want to do anything to further enhance the unintended consequences of a game mechanic like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Or:<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we looked into it and discovered that SCS does not affect the aggro on your Terror line of hate spells, so you have nothing to worry about.  Also, the hate modifier on your level 60+ Voice spells offsets or more than offsets any aggro lost due to SCS, so we see no need for a change at this time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Heh.  The presumption seems to be that this is something obvious that they will endeavour to fix as soon as we bring it to their attention, and that sacrifical rezz is something we probably won't get, but you never know.  SCS has been broken/stupid since Luclin and despite persistent attempts to remind them of this, they have never deigned to fix it.  And if they do agree with the point that 3 rezz-capable classes out of 16 is insufficient for current content, we are the most obvious candidate for receiving a rezz-type ability.  Hell, if bards got Feign Death, that doesn't make SKs getting sacrificial rezz look like any kind of stretch.</div></div><hr />

&quot;SK's are given a line of spells to generate agro that by developer admission does not work as intended, then SK's get an ability to lower said agro even further and the ability is not on a toggle.  This AA is against the vision of our class as implied by an entire line of spells created to generate agro.  For all intents and purposes SK's were shorted an AA when this was put in our AA list&quot;<br />

Then maybe some begging to just refund it and put suspend minion inthere instead.  At least with zoning pets it have more utility.</div></div><hr />

I like it, but I'm not sure it's more likely than a full blown rezz.  What you describe is arguably more powerful than sacrificial rezz, since it allows you to recover from a kill more quickly (less HP/MP to recover and no rezz effect) and it still leaves the door open for the 96% exp cleric rezz that is preferable to a 93% sacrificial rezz or a 90% paladin rezz.  Unless Calll to Corpse has the same or similar effects as a normal rezz, and/or it consumes a pricey reagant, I think Sacrifice/Convergance is something we're just as likely to get, if not moreso.  If we did get it, I also wouldn't be surprised if it shared many of the restrictions of CoH.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Call to corpse is identical to a rez in terms of balance vs. paladin rez - the fact that it's in some ways better makes it all the more unrealistic to ask for ATM.<br />
<br />
We need an answer to the added desirability paladins gain from rez, but rez or a rez substitute isn't it, at least in the form they're being asked for. We need a more well-planned and inventive/creative/whatever solution to the problem.<br />
<br />
Perhaps, for example, we could get a 4hr reuse rez/call to corpse (really doesn't matter - balance wise they're pretty much equivilant), and paladins could get rez on a button that's usable while DA is up. That doesn't meet the well thought out criteria - I just thought of it while writing that last paragraph and figured it'd make a good example, but you get the idea.<br />
<br />
We need parity with paladins' rez, not superiority, and just giving us rez or a rez-substitute gives us superiority by nature of having FD. We don't have to gain our parity from something equivilant to rez either - something similarly useful but different could prove the best answer also, though I don't know what that would be at this point.<br />
<br />
Wuwu for the cut&amp;paste response again... three cheers for laziness.  <br />
<br />
Kharan - Yes, rez is a balance issue.  Paladins have rez and it gives them added desirability over us, while we have nothing to compete.  When a group is looking for a tank and there's an SK and a pally LFG, they think &quot;well, if our cleric takes a dirt nap, the pally can rez him - the SK can sit there FD'ed and go take a shit while the cleric runs back... which do we want?&quot; and the result should be obvious.  <br />
<br />
One thing to keep in mind, however, is that while giving us a parallel to paladin rez is the obvious choice, it's not the only possibility.  Giving us something completely different, but that would add desirability in a similar manner/to a similar extent would be perfectly fine.  It basically boils down to pallys have a big piece of utility that's valuable enough to give them desirability, and we do not.</div></div><hr />

Maybe because it doesn't work as advertised.  It not only reduces aggro from spellcasting, but from melee too.  So therefore, it's &quot;broken&quot; in addition to being effectively worthless at the moment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Maicom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">suggestion to counter pally rez:<br />

Getting necro rez has been justified by many as we should have it for desirability purposes, and having a raid role. If you fix 1 &amp; 3, then we will have desirability and a raid role once again. If you are going to use that as justification, they are linked.</div></div><hr />
