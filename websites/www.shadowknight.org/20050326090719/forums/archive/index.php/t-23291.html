All those message boards he visted to post that shit on and he didn't come here. Probably because he took one look at a post, and decided that he didn't want his obviously lame ass fucking song to be flamed even more.

Well, I'd like to first thank everyone for the overwhelming positive response to the video. The positive has severely outweighed the negative, and most of the negative has been the same old unoriginal &quot;I want those four minutes back&quot; and &quot;I wanted to kill myself because that was so bad *lol*&quot;. That being said we feel pretty encouraged to continue making videos and we hope you will all come back and enjoy our future work as well. <br />
They are getting inspired. Run for your lives.<br />
<br />
Now you have to actually remmember them to avoid them.<br />
<br />
<br />

P.S. BTW, why should you be &quot;original&quot; in saying how bad something is? My &quot;geekness&quot; must be blocking my understanding.</div></div><hr />

Ever heard of a grammatical term called parallelism? probably not since you're gay, I don't like you very much and I think that watching that clip made me even dumberer. &lt;---- wanted to point out that the previous statement was sarcasm since you don't seem to have a solid grasp on things.</div></div><hr />

Yeah and when I posted her avatar, she ninja changed it to a naked fat guy sitting at the computer, because I decided to just steal the bandwidth instead of hosting it myself. Meh, if I was at home, I'd make a Big Willie picture, but that would take too much time.</div></div><hr />

Looking on the board, he ninja edited the quote out, as well as all the stuff on the feedback page. So I guess he was feeling bad about trying to flame, so he decided to cover up the evidence that he ever typed out naughty words.

She's not bad looking now (she's not pretty either, a 3 star on the Tucker Max Female Rating System (http://www.tuckermax.com/femalerating.html) ), but never make the mistake to marry a chick like that.

They should thank us.<br />
<br />
If they have any common sense left, they will follow our advices and stop making such shitty videos. If anything, they wont waste their time with a pointless attempt at a career as comedians and will go straight to McDonalds where they belong, effectively saving years of their lifes and becoming productive members of the society sooner.<br />

The video wasn't the worst in the world, wasn't the greatest either. Didn't make me laugh, the voices were annoying, and that gnome power was used too many times. <br />
<br />
The guy wore too much make up, and the girl should never put those glasses on again. (She was pretty though, he wasn't---and I'm female, I can tell who is pretty and who isn't... girls are allowed to do that.. really.) =o)   The rap was just off, I can't put my finger on it, because I'm not one for rap... but it just didn't seem to flow right. <br />
<br />
It wasn't catchy, here it is about an hour or so after I saw the video, and I can't remember anything from it excpet whiny voices, something about a wizard... and the guy spitting out wrapped candy. <br />
<br />
<br />
Of course I find it remarkably funny that they like to keep their forums all neat and fluffy, erasing any criticism, or flames. Kinda seems like they are making it all one sided. Anyone goes there and sees a ton of people going &quot;ooh ahh funny haha la-ti-da&quot; They are encouraging the lemmings!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Men can do it also.<br />
<br />
Need one of either two things tho :<br />
<br />
Either be gay.<br />
Or be a real man (aka : you have no doubt about your sexual orientation (which can be a whole lot of things actually, but you're aware of it and accept it, which is the key idea here))<br />
<br />
If a guy feels gay when he says something about another guy's look (and first said guy isnt openly gay) then you have some good hint that he still have doubts/fears that saying &quot;gay stuff&quot; could actually turn him gay. Real men dont have those preoccupations.<br />

God damn. I got nothing nice to say, except that they tried at least. That video fucking sucked. I couldn't stand the guys voice, I think his nuts need to drop a little fiurther before he attempts another go at the next video. Or smoke some cigs and pot for 10 more years to get a nice raspy sound to it. Yea, that would do it. The chick, well, she's ok, but not spectacular. She's one of those chicks that has a &quot;good side&quot; and a side she probably won't let you take a pic of. Lights, makeup and such do nice things for girls but hey, not like I give a fuck what a chick looks like, as long as her hole wasn't an outtie a few months ago. One of the best parts is the guy whacked out on an all weekend EQ binge, slamming down candy. The music, I know what's wrong with it. It's not hardcore and it rhymes too much. The &quot;flow&quot; needs to be broken and you can't go with a child rhyming tune. All together it was a piss poor performance but I do have to give it to them for having balls enough to go through with it and throw it on the internet.<br />
