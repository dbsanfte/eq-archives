<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Azudno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">These are entries to a competition asking for a rhyme with the most<br />
romantic first line but least romantic second line.<br />
<br />
Love may be beautiful, love may be bliss<br />
but I only slept with you, cause I was pissed<br />
<br />
Roses are red, violets are blue, sugar is sweet, and so are you.<br />
But the roses are wilting, the violets are dead, the sugar bowl's empty<br />
and so is your head.<br />
<br />
Of loving beauty you float with grace<br />
If only you could hide your face<br />
<br />
I thought that I could love no other<br />
Until, that is, I met your brother<br />
<br />
Kind, intelligent, loving and hot<br />
This describes everything you are not<br />
<br />
I want to feel your sweet embrace<br />
But don't take that paper bag off of your face<br />
<br />
I love your smile, your face, and your eyes-<br />
Damn, I'm good at telling lies!<br />
<br />
Every time I see your face<br />
I wish I were in outer space<br />
<br />
I saw your face as you walked by<br />
but then I saw a better guy<br />
<br />
My darling, my lover, my beautiful wife:<br />
Marrying you screwed up my life<br />
<br />
I see your face when I am dreaming<br />
That's why I always wake up screaming<br />
<br />
My love you take my breath away<br />
What have you stepped in to smell this way<br />
<br />
My feelings for you no words can tell<br />
Except for maybe &quot;go to hell&quot;<br />
<br />
What inspired this amorous rhyme?<br />
Two parts vodka, one part lime</div></div><hr />

<br />

(cant take credit, my friend told me that one)</div></div><hr />
