<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mehatesu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The other day, a buddy of mine emailed me and asked my opinion on buying plat..I was about to hammer him and call all sorts of nasty things but instead I sat back and really thought about it.  Personally Im against it, but if a person really enjoys the game, and consciders it his/her hobby, who am I to say that its wrong, whether its against the EULA or not.  I paint WarHammer figures and sell them on line or just for fun and yeah, it cost me some money to do it, and I dont mind spending the money because its my hobby.. Ive heard all the complaints, on how it blows the economy out of wack, and yeah, if everyone did it for a while it would, but eventually the economy would settle and it would be business as usual..What are you thoughts on that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">People buying plat aren't the ones that fuck up the economy - it's the ones selling it that can screw things up, and the fact that the sellers fuck things up and buying from them = supporting them is why many people are against it.  It also receives opposition because it can be a shortcut for circumventing the need to learning your class/the game.  It's really not needed anyway, any monkey with half a brain can come up with plat either via farming or playing the merchant game.  <br />
<br />
I don't have such a problem with buying the shit itself; the bigger problem lies in that the ones who do it are the ones who need to not do it (I.E. the ones who still need to learn what the fuck is going on).  Someone who's an established quality player buying a bot account or something doesn't bother me.  Someone buying an account to avoid having to level up does.  Buying plat is pretty much the same deal, except that the people who've established themselves as quality players don't really have any reason to do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I bought this gay ass rogue!!!!!!<br />
from my best friend in rl so the account didnt go to waste, and i wanted the rogue to have fun with ;p<br />
<br />
note: that when he decides to stop being a fag and start playing eq again, ill prolly give him the account back for free heh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Odiumar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">More fun and a bigger sense of accomplishment to earn plat yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chayde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It's a game... G-A-M-E<br />
<br />
I wouldn't pay someone to go out and play soccer for me, I wouldn't pay someone to go out and play Zelda for me, I certainly wouldn't pay someone to play EQ for me, and that includes gathering PP to purchase something.<br />
<br />
My game! I play how I want to! And that includes every aspect of the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i agree tho for the most part, and the reason i payed for the rogue was for the time he spent leveling her, and cause hes a good friend of mine and plays lineage 2 and wanted to buy things there... I bought all her gear ( when he was still playing to try to bring the toon up to par to where i was at the time). so i didnt have to pay extra for the buyables etc cause in all reality everything she is wearing were gifts from me  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I wouldn't pay someone to go out and play soccer for me, I wouldn't pay someone to go out and play Zelda for me, I certainly wouldn't pay someone to play EQ for me, and that includes gathering PP to purchase something. <br />
<br />
No, but you would pay someone for the ball. And you would pay someone for shinguards, so you could play better/have a better time playing.<br />
<br />
Zelda is so lame :(<br />
<br />
I agree with Slein here, don't see the big deal with it, not counting the case of retards getting a hold of 65 chars.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dkhar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Paying for plat is gay. Selling it is even gayer. So I guess that makes Yantis the Gay Pimp of Fag Whores.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shurlock</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Personally, I don't buy it, but I won't slam anyone who does.           It's their money; they can do what they want with it.              It's the holier-than-thou pricks who piss me off a lot more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Azudno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Zelda is so lame  <br />
<br />
Heathen !  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Daywalka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">With time and effort, you can get all the Plat you need for free within the game. The sports equipment analogy is flawed because no matter how long you play Soccer, you wont grow a ball or shin guards out of nothing. You need those to play the game, you do not need to pay anyone money to buy fake money in a fake world.<br />
<br />
But with that said, its your money either way. You pay for the account, you pay for the plat. Chances are, you won't get caught. Because common sense would tell you that if the EQ Plat Police were gonna get you, then Yantis/IGE/etc wouldn't even still be in business now. I don't need to buy plat. I make plenty of plat camping stuff/selling LDoN drops with me and my fiance. Just last night I made 24k in the Bazaar, selling stuff we got from Grieg's End duoing. If you want to pay for fake money, go right ahead. But if you think about it, it's really retarded to pay real money for a bunch of electronic fake money.<br />
<br />
And right now, Zelda &gt; EQ... barely. Only because I got into playing Ocarina of Time recently after my friend had it for 2 years.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Nambkab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I've got a friend in better gear than my sk just from buying plat and bazaar equipping, and I've never had anything bad to say about him.  I wouldn't do it myself, but I hold nothing against those that do it...just the ones that do the selling  :p .<br />
<br />
Vinnayeny:  Get that gay ass rogue his epic.  Please.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Chayde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yeah the ball and shin guards thing was poor. I Pay Sony for the game, just like I paid The computer store for the computer, just like I payed Wally-World for the game, just like I would pay Big 5 for the soccer ball. Which in this case, the soccer ball (IS) the game.  The soccer ball is a necessity, as the shin guards might be. (Depends if you are playing with league rules or not) Without it, there would be no game!   Having someone earn your money for you, in a Game, isn't a necessity to play the game. <br />
<br />
I know people who buy plat, and it's fine with me that they do. I am happy they can gear up, and play the game they want to play. I just wouldn't do it, I don't play that way.  I don't have much plat, my higher level toon is under geared, my current main is barely geared, and two of my toons share the same gear.  I have the means to buy plat to better gear myself, but why bother? I am happy playing with what I can get in game by myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Derraj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I encourage people to buy plat, but I won't. not wasting money on virtual money, that will be non existant. its gonna be funny when EQ is just about dead, someone spends 500 dollars on platinum and the EQ dies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Zero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Well, I worded it wrong, but it does have some premise.<br />
<br />
Are shin guards necessary to play soccer? no.<br />
<br />
Is 50k from PA.com at level 50 necessary to play EQ? no.<br />
<br />
Now, I understand the arguement that in time you will make that 50k, or wont need it as you advance; and shin guards aren't going to be aquired by playing more soccer, or playing soccer better.<br />
<br />
However, you could put it as you dont need the 50k, and you dont need the shin guards, and if you stay where you are at (level 50, not real games - and here i'm assuming real games require shin guards...if not, oh well screw me - soccer sucks) that will work fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Pyrthin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Next time I play Monopoly, I'm gonna just buy Boardwalk and Park Place with a hotel on each right away with RL money so I can have a more enjoyable experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Mehatesu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I look at it this way...For many people, EQ is a hobby and something they enjoy.  I enjoy painting minuratures and thus I spend money on buying stuff to enhance my hobby, thus, I imagine its the same for those to whom EQ is a hobby..They want to enhance theyre game play and thus spend money on it..Personally, I dont care how the toon next to me got theyre gear, as long as they do a good job.  I still carry some items due to nostalgic value like my Argent Protector..Its the first sword I ever got from a raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Khat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I'm a firm believer, and rightly so, that everything that goes on in-game is relative to the game's progression from that point on.<br />
Tonight I will be fighting alongside people that have the gear they have.  Tomorrow, one or more of those people may have equipped themselves with items they have purchased with RL money.  It changes the game; regardless of how inconsequential it may seem, it escalates from there.<br />
<br />
If people are too inept at playing this game as it was meant to be played and feel that buying items for RL cash will help them with thier inadequacies, perhaps they should have a special server built for them; a server that allows them to buy their progression.  A server that has no influence on any of the others.  They could have a Loser-tiered payment structure which costs more RL money dependent on their Starting-Point-to-Where-I-Want-To-Be-Right-Now model.  Keep those fuggers together and away from the rest that want to play the game as intended.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Zero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Next time I play Monopoly, I'm gonna just buy Boardwalk and Park Place with a hotel on each right away with RL money so I can have a more enjoyable experience.<br />
<br />
I didn't saying people who bought plat were smart, from a personal view, its completely moronic. But hey - if random_joe wants to blow his cash on 100k from yantis to get his yaya's, what the fuck do I care.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I've been tempted to but plat for Tradeskills.  But even then I want to earn it.<br />
<br />
Fuck me and my Mid-Western Prodestant work ethic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Pumak Deathbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">There was a time I was struggling PP wise and was getting frustrated that I couldn't upgrade my equipment like I really wanted. I stared at that damn form for a hell of a long time debating whether to buy plat but decided in the end that it's just a form of &quot;cheating&quot;. Not cheating the game but cheating myself out of the satisfaction of earning the gear. <br />
<br />
I don't begrudge anyone who buys plat, whatever floats their boat I guess. I just wont do it.<br />
<br />
Besides I'd rather spend the money on beer, family and golf.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">BEER + GOLF = FUN<br />
<br />
Until you get too drunk and drive your cart into the underbrush and can't get it out (also partly because of the drunkenness). Then beer + golf = teh suxx.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Dignitas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">The problem about buying plat is, that it brings a RL component into the game. Without the ability to buy plat, every player is equal in chances with invested time and your personal skill being the only thing that distinguishes a player progression wise.<br />
<br />
With the ability to buy Plat, the IRL rich people get an edge over the poor ones. Someone earning 8.000€/month can deck out his newbie char within weeks with bought platinum while the guy who hardly makes enough money to pay his bills has to farm hill giants in lake rathe for his Fine Steel Armor and has to watch the other capitalist bastard being powerleveled by his Yantis Fungi.<br />
<br />
People should advance by dedication and/or skill, not by the size of their wallet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Toothfairy_TP</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">All of the gear worth having is no drop anyway. After a certain point..money is useless to you..when you are 65 and have all of your spells and raiding constantly what the fuck do you need money for? Stat food? SOW potions? lol<br />
<br />
 But apparantly the dudes just getting rich from it so alot are buying pp.<br />
Its not my business what people wanna do they pay (Monthly fee)  just like me..<br />
As long as the person has a grasp of whats going on and can contribute to the group/guild ...arent thieves/assholes/etc .. I dont care who they are, where they live, where their pp came from..<br />
<br />
 The only thing I have a problem with is it seems to ruin the economy. Also you get assholes that steal nameds..train you...leave charmed hasted badass pets rooted on you while they gate out..<br />
 That gets into infringing on people, thats fucked up. EQ is supposed to be fun, not a way for people to make black market cash..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Specnatz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Here is a scenario for you.  Your in a raiding guild that does GoD only you raid 6 nights a week and you work from 9 - 5 with weekends off.  The armor in GoD cost 11k to make per item.  How do you make the 11k or more per week when you are always raiding?  I dont have that problem as of yet, not sure if I will ever have that problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Apokx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">You have a day off from raiding,which you will likely use to farm platinum for your armor.<br />
<br />
In any case,Im sure someone getting GoD armor that often is going to have at least 200k in the bank.</div></div><hr />
