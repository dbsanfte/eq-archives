<br />
hitting for 1900's, and the warrior i had tanking said jsut doubles.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>PeteBull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">He wiped our group of 8. Nothing landed, slows, nukes, spears, darks, malos.<br />
<br />
He hits for 1900 and he immediately rampaged twice and then enraged.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shintou Shinai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">He whiped 2 parties.<br />
<br />
He seems to be superbuffed now, We had no problems, our war was able to tank him, clerics did fine, but that aoe slow KILLED any chance we had at DPS. The SK we were helping was like &quot;Screw it I'm getting my soul leech&quot;.<br />
<br />
Its just that damn unresistable AoE slow :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>vex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">FYI, don't make the same mistake I did. I only cleared a few mobs that were around him, then realized once we engaged that he CANNOT BE SNARED. <br />
<br />
Heh, he was wandering around the connecting room dragging mobs with him before we finally finished him off.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We tried with 8 earlier and basically ran out of mana by the time he got to 34%.<br />
<br />
He has a lot of hps.<br />
<br />
Captain Varns is not a trivial 1 group fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kyfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">11 people at what progression level? VT, Elem, Time, Qvic?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>The Truth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">tried him today with eight. wiped me, a warrior, clericx2, shaman, rogue, wizard.<br />
next time I try with more ranged dps, as it is key.<br />
<br />
hit me for 1820. yah, only doubles. summons, rampages etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>vex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">He was the easier pre-patch version I did, so I'm sorry, I don't know.</div></div><hr />

<br />
hope the overlord dude in hate hasn't been buffed up, i still need him ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Tried him again, with one group, high ele level.  Me tanking.  We lasted for 8 min 19 secs.  Got him to 75%.  1 cleric, ran out of mana at that point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">5 groups, went down fast and easy.  Noone got close to dying.  But it would not let me loot the flamberge of hatred.  Others have had same problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Avryce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">One grouped him tonight before downtime.  Haven't updated my magelo to reflect new levels/skill caps but gear is the same.  Had about 12k HP and 2400-2500 AC due to Aura of Pain.<br />
<br />
We had two clerics running a rot on me and they did just fine even with the spell slow.  Our chanter wasn't ever able to get im slowed but I don't believe he was getting immune message either.<br />
<br />
Group consisted of 2 clerics, paladin, monk, enchanter, and myself (Sk).  I would suggest 3 clerics really to make it easy both clerics in group ended at 34% and 20% mana cleric at 34% I believe has nearly 9k mana (between 8500 and 9k for sure!).  Max hit on me was 1800 something due to shielding.  Guild is txevu level just HP preventing us from tacvi had ar ecent round of backflagging.<br />
<br />
Hope this information helps you out when you decide to go fight him.  BTW chanter kept charming room mobs and putting them on varn for DPS.<br />
<br />
<br />
To top it all off I got the &quot;you're not allowed to loot this item&quot; message after talking to the lugald twice.  So I'll be doing it again unless the GM's are nice to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Take enough healing to keep the tank up at least 10-15 minutes.<br />
<br />
Take a chanter to charm respawn, and send them in as dps.<br />
<br />
Take a ranger or two for ranged dps.<br />
<br />
Recommended one group setup.<br />
<br />
SK, Cleric, Cleric, Chanter, Ranger, Ranger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Atraxas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">well, they had to doone of two things imo..<br />
<br />
1) upgrade the mob (as they have)<br />
<br />
2) lower the quality of loot he drops (was decent loot of a mob so easy..i did it with 3, 65 sk at time, 65 cleric, 65 rog)<br />
<br />
It should reflect the fact your skipping an entire epic too, most of the old IC weilders no doubt feel the same. Spend months even years on a quest that can now be made redundant in 3 kills...with players lvl 70 and aa's...<br />
<br />
Dont wanna put in that small amount of effort, then you will never complete it anyway as the posts concerning PoG/PoN clearly show it can and will still require patience and dedication.<br />
<br />
Ok thats my soap-box done =)<br />
<br />
BTW is anyone 100% sure yet if sword is MQ'able?<br />
<br />
I have one..before we found out it wasnt needed if have IC.</div></div><hr />

Some of us did invest a ton of time, and didnt complete IC because of rare drops.</div></div><hr />

It's sounding bugged then. I did the Dulak fight pre-vamp, hadn't even hailed Ritald yet. Just invis'd down to Varns, cleared, and whipped him. Looted the body, took the Flamberge.<br />
<br />
And this revamp sounds like absolute hell. Hits for 1900? Sick.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmm... I understand that this is supposed to be a rough pre-quest... but 16 Time/EP geared people too 10 minutes to kill him? It used to be a hard 2 group fight for casuals, lasting about 1-1.5 minutes.... if it actually took 16 Time/EP geared people 10 minutes to kill him...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>grinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">it sounds like a stupid buff up for that part of the quest.<br />
<br />
i did it prepatch with a chanter friend and a cleric i boxed, i was lvl 66, chanter was 66 and cleric 65.<br />
<br />
i was about 6800hp unbuffed and just have chanter/cleric buffs, i had about 2000 ac buffed.<br />
<br />
went without a hitch, even when all the adds respawned as we started the fight, had chanter take care of em with aoe mezz after using the clerics big group heal to get all the adds on her and into a tight group.<br />
<br />
<br />
but now its really way too tough.<br />
would have been fine just to take the chest loot away ..grats SOE</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Nikolaos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Whoever has petitions in on this, can you keep us updated and let us know when it's fixed and actually worth our time to gather people to go kill the guy? :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>trucutu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">i try him with 14 people <br />
<br />
1 sk 68 me<br />
1 pala 69 MT<br />
1 cleric 69 boxed by monk<br />
1wiz 69 boxed by monk <br />
1 chanter 69 boxed by monk<br />

Wiped us at 1% , the AE rampage eat us  so it was the slow , that slow too much, maybe if the wizz wasnt boxed we could have get him.<br />
<br />
Btw this was after revamp him .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Erasmus Hurt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">It appears to just be bugged all around at the moment... Here's my Varns story.<br />
<br />
First off he's a PITA right now. He's way, way, way overpowered. We did Olidan last night in a single Time Geared group (sk, monk, 2 clerics, druid, chanter), was a long fight but wasn't too bad. After that we got cocky so went to try Varns... <br />
<br />
Few things you should know if you want to try him and brave the bug:<br />
<br />
Nightmare Stasis is unresistable, but Radiant Cure seemed to cure it once. Course he just refreshed it again a minute later, and that was that. Nightmare stasis is the melee attack speed slow, casting speed slow and snare. 50% to each I believe. A real PITA.<br />
<br />
He also has a fire based AE does 500 damage and goes off every 30 seconds or so. -300 modifier so pretty hard to resist unless you have a bard and good resists.<br />
<br />
Melee is 1900 as stated earlier, and he AE rampages. The AE rampage can go off pretty often. His hit box isn't big enough to avoid the AE ramp. He has around 500,000 hit points or so, but everyone is going to be doing a lot less damage because of the nightmare stasis. <br />
<br />
Last but not least he is more or less unslowable. We never stuck slow in three fights. We didn't have a chacne to try disease slow with shaman, but enchanter can't stick it.<br />
<br />
Okay here's our story fighting him. First time we tried with the six people listed above...  Couldn't stick slow, DI saved me once (2000 AC 9700 hp level 67 SK), we were ready to wipe and druid evaced. We got him to 93%, with me harm touching to start and in about 90 seconds of meleeing.<br />
<br />
We knew at that point we needed more DPS and probalby a better tank. So tonight we went back again... This time we had 9 Time Geared characters. (2 clerics, 1 druid, 1 bard, 1 monk, 2 sks, 1 paladin, 1 chanter). We also had a much better tank: level 70 uqua geared SK with ~2500 AC 12K HP and 15% shielding... <br />
<br />
First fight we didn't realize he had AE rampage and it kind of disrupted us. His damage output is spikey because he hits relatively hard and sometimes his AE rampage goes off really quickly. He AE ramped like 4 times almost back to back on me at one point and I went ot 6% just from rampage in arond 10 seconds or so. He wiped us at 89% the first time due to a big spike dropping the tank.<br />
<br />
The second time around we made a healing chain that accomodating for hte 15 second cast time on complete heal due to stasis. Druid hammered patches, and paladin did group heals... Still our tank was saved by DI twice during the fight. This same tank has succesfully tanked the Ikkinz trials to give a comparison of the DPS here. Normally his output isn't bad, but if he rampages quickly, gets a good round and then AE goes off, you can have a dead tank quickly. The fight lasted a LONG time. I didn't time it but I'd guess around 15-25 minutes. The entire room respawned and we had the chanter charming respawn and sending htem in to kill Varns. <br />
<br />
In the end he finally dropped, but I coudln't loot. I had already pre-hailed and said dialogue to Ritald, but said I can not loot this lore item. I ran back, re-hailed and did the dialogue again... Still couldn't loot. I tried relogging and coming back. Leaving raid, rejoining raid. Switching groups to the group whose member got the kill blow. Nothign worked. Then we tried letting the other SK (who had not completed the original epic either) loot, and he couldn't loot either. He ran and hailed Ritald, still couldn't loot. <br />
<br />
GMs have not yet responded to me, but I'd guess they won't be able to do anything. For now the event is bugged, and I'd recommend trying it later so you don't waste your time. Hopefully when they fix the bug, they'll also tone him down some too. Because right now he's a real PITA, especially for being so ealry in teh quest.<br />
<br />
On a sidenote the same group of 9 people also did the Enchanters mob in Innovatoin and the Paladins mob in Torment before going there. Encahnters mob was somewhat challengnig, but had no deaths or near deaths. Fight lasted aroudn 5 minutes. The paladins was a joke, lasted about 3 minutes and it barely damaged the tank. So IMO we'll see him tuned eventually.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Rueeliar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Varn is still not letting people loot his piece.<br />
<br />
What other portions of the quest will give the &quot;not allowed to loot this item&quot; message due to missing pre-flags, as I dont appear capable of finishing this portion anytime soon?<br />
<br />
I'd rather not waste people's time doing hits for me that I cant loot because Varn is CBing me, but dont want to loose the chance to do parts when I have assistance.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Nasiir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">They are probably beefing up the mobs more... :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
But Seriously, he is rediculous. Do any other class pre-epic1.5s have mobs remotely as difficult?</div></div><hr />

When I asked about the difficulty of the entire thing (since I only remember him even asking for help once) he said he 2 boxed his entire quest except for his final fight. <br />

So much for them being able to make all the epics the same in difficulty.<br />
<br />
Anyways I just finished my sheath and was hoping to gather a raid force for Varns but it looks like it might be best to wait. I guess I will gather a couple of groups and try to hit Fraga first.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Myth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">I doubt 2 groups are even needed now, if they're EP geared at least. He was pretty much burned down with with no problem with the 12  brought to kill him on the 5th.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Cryptia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">Just took him out last night 10-06-04<br />
<br />
Mostly melee DPS, so it took about 6 minutes to kill. Had two clerics though so it was an easy, drawn out win. I tanked at 10.5k and 2200. Was easier than most mpg trash mobs.<br />
<br />
Would easily be one groupable with caster DPS, cleric/slower and good tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Moardok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">Well i took 3 groups of semi-elemental gear  might have been 3 groups an a ranja in one by himself so 19 people ..mostly dps ..had 1 cleric 2 or 3 pallies an had a 12k tank ,Captain  did his A/E cured once, was back shortly.We didnt exactly burn him down but he was of no real threat once slowed it was just of a matter of beating him down...that slow is nasty an makes a big difference in our DpS...<br />
hehe make sure you go through the text with ritald before going all the way down an trying ot engage him ..have to go through text with ritald before you can hail for the engage ..an yes i learned by example hehe  it sucked but i went back talked to ritald an went back kiked captain's ass an went for fragga next .</div></div><hr />

Your group of 6 is Time geared.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Maniacles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">Oct 19 fight.<br />
16 VT/early elemental geared folk 65-69ish, with a 68 sk tank<br />
hits for 1300<br />
didn't run all the way down to 6%.  HT'd him for 9k at 6% brought him down to 0%, at which point he started running...killed him a few steps later.<br />
<br />
Slow stuck.  Beastlord pet snare proc stuck on him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Eggborn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">Just an update since I hadn't seen it anywhere else, (this thread is getting long).<br />
<br />
Don't try Captain without hailing the NPC to start 1.0 alt quest.  He will not engage in combat if you don't.  Boy was my face red when I had two groups rdy to kill him, and then had to run back to hail before we started again.  I had to hail the Captain before he would attack.<br />
<br />
Took two balanced, some Time geared, some not groups of people no trouble to kill him.  He didn't hit the warrior who tanked him hard at all, but did hit a beastlord who got smacked a few times for 1300.  <br />
<br />
The AE slows Melee, but also slows cast times of spells.  He did run, but slowly.  I HT'd him at 6 percent life and he was down to 2 percent, didn't get far moving.  The adds aren't bad if you are all over 65 at all, so no worries on his running.  Just be sure your healers have a lot of mana cause the fight can take a bit with everyone slowed like that.<br />
<br />
He didn't drop a chest.  We could invis all the way to his room.  Tell everyone to run straight north to the very last room.  Dont smack any adds into the walls, cause you will get stuck too.<br />
<br />
Kelefane bah, it took me nine hours of soloing before I got my hate drop.!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Mriu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">I got Varns down tonight  1/6/05)  with 10 people.  I tanked with a cleric/druid healing and a shaman assisting if needed (he wasn't).  Easy to slow, and minimal riposts.  Hit me for 1300 a couple times, most were around 600ish.<br />
<br />
When I tanked it I was at 9600hp and 1930ac<br />
<br />
Easily one groupable.  Most ppl there were light elementals geared.<br />
<br />
Hope it helps someone.</div></div><hr />
