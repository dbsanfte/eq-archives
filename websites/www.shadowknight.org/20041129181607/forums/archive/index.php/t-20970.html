<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>aress</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">There is no use for it at all.<br />
<br />
From Siilvir's Fanfair report (http://www.shadowknight.org/forums/showthread.php?s=&amp;postid=263416#post263416):<br />
<br />
 No SK res (question was asked twice!).<br />
 No Ancient Tap for SK뭩.<br />
 No fix for SK Terror line. Hate dosesn뭪 work properly at level 65, and it would be more trouble than it is worth to fix this.<br />
 Knight tanking: it뭩 where we want them to be. Content problem, not class problem. No defensive discipline.<br />
 Cloak of Ahkeva will not stack with BSS. Pally version stacks but it shouldn뭪 have; they realize it뭩 not fair, but will not nerf pallies, nor change to help SK뭩.<br />
<br />
There we go.  That's it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No ancient tap isn't a big deal, if you look they did mention looking at our healing in relation to other classes.  To be perfectly honest the heal should be alot easier to obtain than being an ancient when you look at where other classes healing upgrades came from.<br />
<br />
Convergence would be nice, but oh well...<br />
<br />
Terrors can just be fixed with the SOE approach to Warriors then, hate doesn't work properly so just pile on tons more until it does work.<br />
<br />
Knight tanking is a problem in multiple zones and will continue to resurface in every single zone that is put in until the gap is decreased atleast some of the time.  Just have to convince them of that, and nerfing Ikkinz is equilavent to addressing Ranger dps problems with some bow AA's and stonewood bows.<br />
<br />
The thing with AotC is just a good amount of justification for future versions of Aura of Pain.  Hmm... Ancient Aura of Pain</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>aress</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I am glad to see your optimism, Brael, seriously.  I also have tried to be optimistic, but it becomes crystal clear that SOE does not understand our issues at all.<br />
<br />
For months we have been vocal, as have the paladins.  Our issues are true ones, even when some suggested solutions make me cringe (as did the suggestion to give us res).<br />
<br />
They deeply believe that we are balanced as is.<br />
<br />
Not much more we can do.<br />
<br />
I am just saddened by the fact that more and more people are leaving EQ because of the issues.  Our guild may have to go back to recruiting again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>BrikBludgaard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Do not give up...<br />
<br />
They know it to be an issue now...  they tried to pass it off like they did warrior aggro...  but it will grow and grow on them.<br />
<br />
It just plain broken...  and when they try to fix it with nerfing the encounter, every bazaar equipped warrior in the game will be tanking in the trials while Knights are left at home...<br />
<br />
Why take anything less when you can be guaranteed to win with little to no equipment, and a discipline every warrior has??<br />
<br />
This is far from over...  gather your ideas and steel yourself for the battle...<br />
<br />
Its time to stand our ground and fight...  we are few but we are as cranky as they come... and twice as stubborn...  No other class has done as much with so little for so long as the Shadowknight...<br />
<br />
We have a real issue... and an EASILY reproduceable one.<br />
Any dev with 5 minutes can reproduce exactly what we are talking about...<br />
<br />
Take a warrior in pre-elemental gear with defenisve and furious and tank the end mob for trial 6...  make yourself regen rediculous amounts of health and parse the damage taken... both the spikes and the overall...  the warrior will win by a landslide over even the Time/LDoN equipped knight... and that wouldnt be counting the times when the knight would insta-die due to being one-rounded...<br />
<br />
now do the same thing with an ikkinz trial... I would laugh if they STILL died as a knight due to not making the regen insane enough...<br />
<br />
Any dev who can make the numbers even remotely close need only list the equipment on both characters (warrior/knight) that parsed close, and I'll give that the knights are balanced as is...<br />
<br />
I ask only a simple test devs...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kazh The Grim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If I understand what I've heard from the Fan Faire correctly, their plan is to spawn gimped versions of the trials if there is no warrior in the group.<br />
<br />
All I can say is congratulations Sony!  This is about the stupidest fucking idea I've ever heard.  You going to make two versions of every single encounter from here on out???  What's the point anyway if it only gets us to more content that we still won't stand a chance of tanking?<br />
<br />
I don't know about the rest of you guys, but I definitely feel the honor of our class will be restored now that they are going to put in a kiddie version of the trials just for us!  Yippeee!  Do you think we'll get a kiddie version of the loot too or the same as real tanks get???<br />
<br />
Maybe next they can spawn a gimp version for groups with no cleric or a version where mobs are spaced 100 feet apart if you don't have a puller or mezzer... ohhh the possibilities for screwing this up are nearly endless.<br />
<br />
This is nothing but a bunch of wasted effort for what boils down to, you guessed it, a class balance issue.  I think a bunch of trained monkeys could figure that one out, too bad Sony can't.  I guess they are too afraid of pissing off the warrior contingent.<br />
<br />
Wise up morons you are killing this game.  Between your latest piece of trash expansion, your non-existent customer service, and bullshit like this, I don't even know why I play anymore.<br />
<br />
BTW how soon does WoW come out?  Because I'm just about done.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Same here... downright insulted that they would do this, guess every time I do Ikkinz I'm going to have to require dragging a Warrior bot along to just to ensure that im not tanking gimped mobs so my class can feel better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">'retuning' these for knights is a work around for the hack to fix balance that is defensive (that ultimately caused far more problems than it fixed).<br />
<br />
Terrors would be 'fixed' if they put a Stun (0.00 sec/55) in there in addition to the direct hate.<br />
<br />
Pallies get AotC.... get an unfair advantage in hp... but we get a 70 ac edge with aura of pain, which ultimately is a better deal imo.  The only gripe I have about aura of pain is... you can't cast it immediately if your first job is to get aggro (when those first couple seconds before slow are where it is most important)... and a fast hitting mob is likely to interrupt it at 1.5 sec cast.  Make it .5 like spears, and make it last 1/3 1/2 longer than its recast time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Numzaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Wow, looks like someone at SoE discovered the true secret of nerfing finally :D <br />
That's so crazy it's turning funny again lol.<br />
<br />
They should make up their minds, either get rid of defensive and tune ALL boss mobs accordingly (without this intance nerfing nonsense) or add some form of defensive to all potential tanks.<br />
<br />
I guess working with tanks defensive would be the easier way :P<br />
They could then use the def %age to tune the tanks where they want them.<br />
Like 50% def for Warriors, 30% for Knights, 15% for monks/rangers etc. /shrug<br />
They could still make it a &quot;riposte&quot; for the DPS tanks (SK/Rangers) and a plain defensive for Warriors/Pallies if they want to add some flavour to it.<br />
<br />
It's all been said over and over again already /shrug<br />
But like Brik said, no reason to give up just because they had another fan faire :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">A dps class SK's arent, a tank Rangers aren't, neither of those are dps tanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
       Also screw terrors they have never been worth a dam, long as they leave the aggro spells we got alone they can stay shitty.  Ask for a change to the resist check and or the recast on spears if u wanna fight for a spell to get changed. Nuking greens for 60dmg for 300ish mana with a 65spell is pretty lame specially when it has a recast.<br />

<br />
Hmm,<br />
we may be a &quot;low DPS&quot; class but with a warrior around we are definately more &quot;DPS class&quot; than &quot;tank class&quot;?<br />
But you are probably right, we are no tanks :D <br />
<br />
But what is a bow swinging elf who tanks a GoD boss then...<br />

It's all very confusing ;)</div></div><hr />

They said use your riposte disk then  I explained to them that sorry Knights did not have a riposte disk.<br />
<br />
They looked shocked.  Well I died, crashed and couldn't log back on for 6 hours.<br />

Thanks SoE for the fun.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While we may not get immediate changes, there will be a point where we will get adjusted. My prediction is that it will come via the next expansion.<br />
<br />
Looking back, changes for classes seem to come in bursts, rather than many small adjustments over time.<br />
<br />
Keep noting problems. Parse them, document them, compare them, and follow up with solutions. It all helps build the case.<br />
<br />
I ask only a simple test devs... <br />
<br />
This has been done Brik, more than once. They know there is an issue, and that is why it's getting fixed. The rub lies in our perception of a class problem vs. their position that it is content based. <br />
<br />
The rumor I heard is that the instances will be the same, but that certain mobs will hit knights for less. If that's the case, it will eventually become easier to fix the class than continually code two sets of dps parameters.<br />
<br />
I am not a doom and gloomer, I think we have a lot going for us, and if we approach our current short comings intelligently as a community we will eventually be heard.<br />
<br />
Lastly, I LOVE the idea of changing the Terror line to be a 0.0 sec stun. Let's get a separate thread going on that.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Crimson Tears</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">There are only two options that your going to get all 3 tank classes to agree on.<br />
<br />
Give us some sort of auto riposite or auto evade disc equal to all the other hybrid classes save paladins.<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
Remove defensive, and up knights and warriors initiate mitigation % so that it puts us well above and beyond the chain and leather classes.  Warriors will cry, but it makes it so much more simple to balance encounters around the tank classes to make us all viable.  This solution is a gain for all the tank classes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Terrors with a 0 second stun is an easy fix, or just pile tons more hate until they fullfill their purpose.<br />
<br />
I would like to see at least one more upgraded tap, or the spears with the hp recourse that brael suggested, another dot with a low resistance and quick damage like BoH would be nice also.</div></div><hr />

Siilvir, a lot of people are approaching burnout, particularly after your fanfair summary.<br />
<br />
There may not be many left to logically complain soon.  <br />
<br />
I hear what you are saying, but I am not sure that it's a function of the lack of tanking ability that a handful of knights are experiencing in two zones in GoD.<br />
<br />
I am still having fun every day I log on an play, and I try not to let the fact that a designer and I don't see eye to eye on every issue impinge on that fun. The community of the best group of guildies, and my fellow serverwide knights, while at the same time pushing content boundaries is what I love about playing EQ.<br />
<br />
Easier said than done, but try not to get so caught up in a few realtively minor issues, to the point that you no longer enjoy play time.<br />
<br />
Next time you feel underpowered, hit the arena for a few minutes.</div></div><hr />
