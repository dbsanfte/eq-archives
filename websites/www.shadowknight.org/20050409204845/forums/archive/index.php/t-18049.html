<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Noctix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am wondering if people are using Lifetaps in LDoN groups.<br />
<br />
I'm MT for my group and we have both a cleric and a shaman.  Between regrowth, CH, and torpor, we really have plenty of healing power.<br />
<br />
I don't have time to med very much during an adventure so I need to be conservative in my spell casting, usually casting 1-2 spells per mob.  My biggest lifetap (I'm level 56) is 150 hit points, which is like 3% of my total hp when I'm buffed.  Is that even worth casting?<br />
<br />
Everyone always talks about how lifetaps are a main feature of the SK class but I really don't find them very useful.  I use them for gaining health when I'm soloing but I hardly ever solo.<br />
<br />
Is there some group tactic using lifetaps that I'm missing?  Also, do we get any lifetaps later on that are more useful?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">At 57, I've been using Vampiric Curse quite a bit in PoN just to add to my regen.  I duo at the hedge mostly with a shammy friend, and he says he does notice a difference in how often he has to heal me when I'm using it.  <br />
<br />
I've not done any LDoN adventures yet, so I don't know how useful it would be in that situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ramgar SK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">With plenty of healing power, load your spears.<br />
<br />
Grab a kei in pok before you go adventuring in LDoN, or group with a chanter.  Bot9, and spiritual dominance add mana regen too (druid and BL spells).  With all those I have a very tough time using all my mana up unless I use all the big dots.<br />
<br />
Taps are our power because we can make it  a lot easier on the cleric by loading up the tap proc, tapping, and heal over time with Vampiric curse (at 57 or bond of death at 62).  That just gives the healer more flexibility.<br />
<br />
I love doing this and getting a druid in place of a cleric.  Druid/chanter combo &gt; shammy/cleric cobo in LDoN IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wolff-Kishner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I always have Mental Corruption up and only lifetap when I'm full mana or if my health drops down to 20%.  With KEI this keeps me at around 75% mana even if I cast a spear once every fight.  I'll use Vampiric Curse if my group is weak on healing or if I'm soloing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aoninie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">When I'm MT I load spears up, CD, FD, and shrouds, and mental corruption. CD's are fast, MH has you as main target and you can FD if you think the CH won't hit in time then pop right back up and grab agro back from the off tank. In raids or as off tank I will load up a couple taps. They are slow and mana intensive. But since you are not the ML's main target you may need to rely a bit more on yourself if you get some repost dmg or get hit a few times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mynka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I always keep my lifetap up.  I've had too many instances where the healer was AFK unannounced or just not paying attention and chain casting lifetap has kept me alive.  Granted, I'm usually getting hit harder than I can lifetap for, but at my level it does help reduce some of the damage.  I always keep Scream of Death up as well, the 25pt lifetap proc isn't the most uber, but it's free added DPS as well as some free healin. :)<br />
<br />
-M</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grimsouled</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Lifetaps make a big difference for me... with SCF 2, Theft of Life 3 and an ID4 item, I've used Touch of Volatis to heal myself for up to 1284 hit points. Can't wait till I get Touch of Inny and SCF3... figure I'll be able to get exceptional taps for over 2k then :D .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nambkab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If I recall, at that level range I kept a lifetap up, but rarely used it.  I will say that once I got vampiric curse, I made an effort to keep it up most of the time, as 20hp per tic is extra regen.  Until drain soul at 60 though, I found that most lifetaps just aren't worth the mana.  Post 60, I've once again been happy with them though, as ToV makes a noticable jump in my hp bar, especially when I have no buffs but my own.  As a side note, at 60 I was able to use Drain Soul while offtanking the shadowthings in Grieg's room to keep myself alive with no healer while waiting on a slow, so yes lifetaps do have a place.<br />
<br />
At your level though, probably better off just using spears to do more damage at better mana savings and not worry about tapping.  I would keep one loaded for emergencies though :D .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Liabach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">the last 2 lifetaps are really good, before that i never used lifetaps much (just not enough umph tap wise for the long cast time and heavy mana cost) (oh and i never had the 3k to spend on the faster more inefficient quest 51st tap, just skipped it and leveled).  the last 2 lifetaps are much faster to cast (6secs or whatever drops to 1.8 sec with the 65 tap, ie you can get it off in time to be useful), and the very last one has a really large resist mod, ie it lands all the time.<br />
<br />
we also get aa that enhance the lifetaps, ie double damage with scf3, and quad healing if both scf3 and tol3 go off together (very very rare, but a 1k heal is very common).  <br />
<br />
150hp tap with long cast time? i'd suggest letting the healer heal you, and useing a fast cast spear and an extra clinging darkness or 2 instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Boodadar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">normally if i am the MT i don't use any lifetaps, scream of death but not lifedraw. that way i have plenty of slots open for other spells and can help out a little with that proc. <br />
<br />
if i am not the MT i load up my strongest lifetap spell and proc and tell the MH not to heal me unless i'm in danger of dieing. that gives the cleric/druid/shaman more options with how to use their manna. when i'm not the MT its basically like i'm soloing, below 50% i can bind wound, below 70% i can lifetap spells, and i always use the procs<br />
<br />
of course i never use HT unless it looks really bad so i usually have it up, also i'm only level 42 so i haven't the fuller bag of tricks that other posters have</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Paynreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">In LDoN its super rare that my health ever falls below 90%, really. So, i use all DPS spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>shadowblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Can't wait till I get Touch of Inny and SCF3... figure I'll be able to get exceptional taps for over 2k then  . <br />
<br />
yep, you can but its very rare. you will see alot of 1k ones tho especially if you have tol 3 as well.<br />
<br />
I always have touch of innoruuk up. and cast it quite often in xp groups and LDON to spite the cleric who is about to go into a CH<br />
<br />
:p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Blargon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">One time, I was on a normal difficulty assassinate adventure and the the healer (some punk druid) said he was having lag issues and had to cycle his machine.  Well he never returned.   Automatic loss, count your cookies and go home, right?  Wrong.   We killed 30 trash mobs and the end guy with 3 minutes to spare and got full points.  Lifetaps are one of the things that kept me alive, along with a lot of gimp hybrid healing and a slower (had a pally, a bst, and a necro for twitches, also a wizard for dps).  That still is one of my high points ever for LDoN.  The tap I used was Touch of Inny.  Anyway, don't sell those lifetaps short!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Dakkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Noctix, you're not missing anything except the fact that you always group with a secondary healer.<br />
<br />
The rest of us usually have one healer in group, and if he goes LD or oom at the wrong time things get a bit hairy if you don't have a lifetap memmed.<br />
<br />
But in your situation I'd be wondering what the heck the spell was for too :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Yabyab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">lifetaps are good when your healer fell asleep and delays his/her healing spell. You can live longer lifetaping, healing and dealing damage.<br />
<br />
 But I have to admit that all our lifetaps sucks except Touch of Volatis and Touch of Innoruuk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>DConquest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Bond of Death + Goldenrod or Epic can do wonders.   Touch of Inny is pretty mana efficient too if you have max SCF, ToL, and Dmg IV.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kaleyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">What I do, is that I keep life leech mem'd, then I never need to be healed if we have a shaman.  Between AoB and Innate regen 3, shaman/druid regen and the mobs being slowed, don't take that much damage, but when I get below 85% just life leech it back up to the 90% done, next mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Berren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Both Touches, Inny and Voltalis work well, have cast times that with our natural spell haste can be cast with out interupt.  A nice patch when your healer is asleep.  And of course there is always leech curse if you have to stay alive.  With anyluck when the melee mod comes out they will but Unholy aura and Leech curse on different timers.  We can always hope.   I like bond of death, but I find the long cast time makes it difficult when tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Evilangel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Often use Bond of Death in fights where AE's are wear you down, It has a way beter ratio than direct Taps.<br />
<br />
In aburn down situation like on a boss mob, often use Blood of Hate and Touch of Inny, as Spears take too long to recycle and are resisted too often. I aim to be OOM around the end of the fight if possible.<br />
<br />
In terms of raw DPS Lifetaps are good but not so mana efficent.<br />
<br />
Chain Cast Blood of Hate = 26 DPS<br />
Chain Cast Touch of Inny = 35 DPS<br />
Chain Cast Touch of Vol = 26 DPS<br />
Chain Cast Spear of Decay = 13 DPS<br />
Chain Cast Spear of Plague = 9 DPS<br />
Chain Cast Bond of Death = 13 DPS</div></div><hr />
