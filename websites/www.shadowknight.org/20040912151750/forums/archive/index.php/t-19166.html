Anyone who has spent these AA able to testify to this? With Leech Curse and UA on separate timers now it would be nice if Consuption affected Leech Curse.<br />
<br />
Also how much does Leech Touch dmg/heal for? I've been told it was a 1 for 1 ratio based on your HT dmg and I've also been told that Leech Touch only does a 1k HT that heals you for 1k, irregardless of level or HT AA's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">heh i'd actually prefer it to work on leachcurse :) heh already using LC in pvp pretty effectively adding 200 damage to every hit from my wmbs while im hasted would be nice heh :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Duke Malagen Shai'Kar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">CotS does not affect Leech Curse at all. With CotS fully trained it adds 600pts to the base 900pt damage of Leech Touch, so you will be able to fire off a Disease based (with a -150 adjustment) spell called Life Curse which will do 1500pt dmg/heal.<br />
<br />
Leech Touch is -not- affected by our Unholy Aura /disc due to it not being affected by -any- form of Improved Damage. For the first year or so after it went live LT -was- affected by Imp. Dmg items, but then an unannounced nerf went in that made this change:<br />
<br />
06-11 11:12 Removed SHD/1 from Classes <br />
<br />
Which of course made LT not function with Imp. Dmg. item like it had been for so long. I think that change ranks pretty high on my list of Idiotic Things the Dev's Did scale.</div></div><hr />
