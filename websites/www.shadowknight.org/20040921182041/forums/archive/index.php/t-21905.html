<br />
For the record Lhorc was a Red con ( non agro )  when he spawned..<br />
He also procced on every attack he did on me ( I pulled) proc was  500 dmg ( all my saves are over 200  so unlikly it can be resisted). He also ate 2  fully AAed hts , 1 HT with only Improved and 1 other HT (non AAed) and about 5k  dmg from  ranger TS . Not sure if Necromancer  used lifeburn. after all the HTs landed he still had about 20% health..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>sluggas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">since you have did the final fight recently can you post reply or anyone if the final fight included any death touches, i doubt it but just for kicks i read it somewhere hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>SuDanger68</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">the only thing that could be seen as DT is his initial HT. if for some reason the one hailing him (this makese the repop agro) got little hp .....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Feriin Cydovu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There was no DT..<br />
<br />
However I was at about 9k hp when I pulled him. He did drop me to half-life  before I pulled him to the area I wanted him at ( just outside of his room so the ranger could pop off TS).<br />
<br />
He seemed to proc that damn  500 hp heal everytime he hit me, I think thats what dropped my hp. I am pretty sure I resisted his HT.</div></div><hr />
