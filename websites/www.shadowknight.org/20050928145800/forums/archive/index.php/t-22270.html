<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tanadil</div><div class="date">07-30-2004, 05:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I lead a  guild on VS in the UK, full in the main with new EQ players to the planes. We are gathering pace now as we progress the Planes on the way to EP.<br />
<br />
Now this week we have taken the MB, then the 3 HOH trials including the bad arse dragon. We thought we would finish off by an attempt at Agnarr.<br />
<br />
Ok was one hell of a fight, not knowing precisiley what to expect.<br />
<br />
However all 3 floors cleared, Agnarr dead but no Karana!! Not sure if she was up at all, but certainly by the time I got rezzed in and went up stairs to him maybe 5 mins after Agnarr had died, the fella was not there.<br />
<br />
The stupid druid fella was standing there but the big pool where Karana is supposed to be was empty. <br />
<br />
Hailed everything, ran through script. but in the end no flags for anyone:(<br />
<br />
Now is it possible it got ninja hailed and as per other POP flags it despwned?<br />
Is it possible that we simply had too many deaths (aka Ldon raid)<br />
Or maybe there was a script part that we didnt follow?<br />
<br />
The guild is running the risk of turning on themselves as they look to blame someone. As usual the Gm's are slow to respond and if if previous petitons are anything to go on, they may not be much use:(<br />
<br />
<br />
Of course we will be going back soon, but we want to ensure we dont see a repeat event on the flags.<br />
<br />
Anybody had any experrience or any ideas what occured here?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
Tanadil :)</div></div><hr />

Planar Projections and other PoP hail mobs despawn based upon a timer on the mob's death, not the first hail.<br />
<br />
I have atended raids where no one got flags because the leaders believed in this myth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RaevaelDarkstar</div><div class="date">08-03-2004, 12:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I watched a raid have that happen yesterday.  Raid leader believed if noone hailed then it wouldnt despawn.<br />
<br />
Well, noone hailed...it despawned as I watched the raid channel in horror as my warnings went unheeded.  MB down, no flags given.  I kinda felt bad for the people who needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cames</div><div class="date">08-05-2004, 08:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think there may be a couple of PPs that act that way or have a very long up time.  One would be the PP for PoEb.  We have actually run alts to the zone, and rogue dragged them for flag.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">velourea</div><div class="date">08-30-2004, 05:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Agnaar flag is a bit different from most as you have to say a certain phrase to karana. What exactly did you say?<br />
<br />
Also, point of reference: flag mobs stay up 30 mins from spawn or 10 minutes from first hail, whichever comes first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Silku</div><div class="date">08-31-2004, 05:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tossing this out there just in case.   Did you go up the stairs and look for Karana or did you expect him to pop where Agnarr died like a planar projection?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would say yes, Silku.<br />
<br />
I had the same problem before with LMM. My old guild did everything right, and after the fight, there was nothing to hail. Usually, it's a bitch to get the adds killed before the Projection despawned, but oddly enough, we killed LMM quick enough that the adds hadn't respawned yet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Guess I missed that, that's what I get for posting at 6:00 in the morning.   :eek: <br />
<br />
I've not experienced this yet, hopefully we won't.  Would suck to do something and not be able to find a flagging mob, especially since GMs tend to take the stance that you didn't do it right, so you must repeat the process over. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd have to say no to this statement.  I don't have any logs or anything because I've never actually wanted to have people lose flags to test it, but I'm pretty sure many people will agree with me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tanadil</div><div class="date">09-19-2004, 05:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To confirm.<br />
<br />
Agnarr has now been killed again by my guild and flagging completed.<br />
<br />
GM looked into it and for some bizarre reason Karana despawned a few mins (less than 8) after spawning, they confirmed no hails took place at all. Basically they told us we were too slow. <br />
 <br />
Deep joy<br />
<br />
Thanks for replies</div></div><hr />
