You are a sk, you are hated in most good city (even before I camped the guard for sport), and in some evil (cabilis, neriak warrior ... something to do with orc I killed while farming blood from slave in  CB, good place there are both elf AND dwarven blood there). <br />
You are able to take aggro from anybody (but do not want to do it from the war in GOD.... except if the cle is really good believe me), you are a wizard dream (At least they can chain nuke), can be a cleric nightmare (how only 7khp!!! no defensive !!!), a rogue lover (BS BS if he ever turn on you he will be back in a hurry do not be afraid)... <br />
In short when there is not the express need of a warrior (POP named, GOD named , LDON hard named) you are the tank, and even then when he falls you are just behind him in the hate list... and the first to die if cleric is late ;). You can snare ( and do it instaed of ranger because if you take aggro a bit you WILL survive and better if mob run slowly to the slower or stop to hitting you than an unslowed mob).<br />
In short SK RULE.... and OGRE SK rules the world (jobaner said it yesterday and he is the brain in my team so it must be true).</div></div><hr />
