<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>zakius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi guys, just want to say that over the years I have played EQ that this site has been an immense mine of information. And I want to thank you all. <br />
<br />
My question is this, and fogive me if it is naive.<br />
<br />
Do you have to complete all the kukhri quests in order to be able to accept the Greenmist quest? Or can you .. if you have the appropriate faction .. just jump straight to the end? <br />
<br />
Many thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No, you can't just jump straigt to the end, because one of the final combines requires your Lord of Pain's khukri. The closest i think would be to get the 6th(?) khukri and finish the quest, as from what I've heard the 6th one isn't no drop... I forgot to check this myself when I had it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Peztilence Forever</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Interesting. I'll check that tonight. I think I have the 6th. I wonder how much I could sell it if so LOL</div></div><hr />
