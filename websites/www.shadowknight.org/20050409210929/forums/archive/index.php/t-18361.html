<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kilze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I recently hit 60 and realized I haven't been utilizing a majority of my spells that are available for aggro generation. I still use clinging darkness and an occasional spear spell and although it is effective I find myself with nearly full mana most of the time. My question is, what is you higher level shadknights methods of generating aggro? It seems like with all the spells I have, there must be something better than my level 15 snare. I did search but didn't find any posts that addressed the problem I'm having specifically, but that doesn't mean there aren't any out there. Thanks for any suggestions or links.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Other people seem to get good results with festering (or dooming) darkness and heart flutter, but then you lose the quick cast times and instant aggro on incoming mobs that CD and spears give you.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">clinging darkness, clinging darkness, clinging darkness.<br />
it's all you need. i just cast it on inc, and once again after inc, then once again when the mobs at 40-50 to snare. if mob turns, click taunt, cast cd again.<br />
<br />
if you need to produce as much agro as possible, and you have a few seconds to start, i'd guess the very best possible would be festering the mob, asystole, then chain fear/cd/fear/cd/fear/cd/fear/cd/etc while wearing an affliction haste 1 item (makes cd cast in 1.2 seconds), and wielding wind etched mace (procs engulfing darkness) augmented with the 125pt ykesha proc.<br />
<br />
or you can just chain fear/cd/fear/cd and that's good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Elysea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm a Festering fan.  I keep Voice of Terris up and I find that I have no problem whatsoever keeping agro locked with one cast of Festering and one cast of Spear of Decay.  Follow up with Zevfeer's Bite to keep the group happy and melee the rest of the fight.  Using Mental Corruption and Pact of Hate (or better), I find that I a more or less break even on mana.  I try to keep myself around 70-80% mana so that I can break out several Touches of Innoruuk if things get dicey.<br />
<br />
This whole setup puts me in the minority, compared to many other SKs who prefer to use Clinging Darkness and proc Shroud of Chaos, but to each his own.  I do tend to use Clinging if I'm pulling and don't have any opportunities to med, but most of the time I prefer Festering.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Taunt, terror, taunt, festering, call assist and turn attack on - he's mine.<br />
<br />
I still use CD, but only when there is no bard, chanter or necro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In a normal exp group with say, C5 and SD, I tend to use clinging darkness and engulfing darkness, low mana, easy to chain 2 casts on inc.<br />
<br />
In a raid situation with, pot9, c5, SD, Bard song, Paragon, etc. I go for festering and clinging.<br />
<br />
I'm in the minority of SK in that I am a great fan of Bond of Death. Saves the healer some mana, and in LDoN easy mode, can just about do without a healer.<br />

Haven't really experimented with fear, but erm, must get round to it.<br />

<br />
what's the difference between using festering with mez issues or clinging with mez? well.. clinging does wear off faster, has less chance to land, and can be overwritten by another snare, so overall clinging is better than festering if you're worried about mez. anyway, for mez tanking fear is the best agro spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Makkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">search always gives me good aggro generation..<br />
<br />
on 55+ or immune mobs fear is your highest generated aggro spell. its 40 mana vs 20 of cd and slightly longer casting time, but if you cast it on inc of a mob you willl never have a problem.<br />
<br />
hate dd's don't scale and don't generate enough aggro for how much mana they cost<br />
<br />
voice line == a pity cast for war MT's<br />
<br />
cd is pretty good but as mentioned it will break mez, even if the mob is out regenning the dmg it does(don't know how that rumor got started)<br />
<br />
Just remember, for the love of god, aggro generation isn't just for the first round of slows etc. As a knight with usually lower hp/ac/mitigation than a warrior, you are there because you keep aggro. So keep aggro through the whole fight.<br />
<br />
I want a click button that puts a banner over a hybrids name with like &quot;This player sucks at keeping aggro. It is the easiest thing to do, but he sucks at it. Funny, huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
Amazing how many hybrids can't keep aggro for shit, run into a ton of them in ldon, i prefer a warrior MT over a knight that has aggro problems any day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Dredmor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">SCE1. Never-fizzle CD. Then a couple more times maybe. Used fear. slow cast/recast. Don't like it. Breaking mez with CD not an issue. Taunt/CD/attack on. Taunt is up again by time CD kicks in usually if attack hasn't broken mez (I have a /beg line in attack on key.) If I don't have aggro, one more CD will usually pull mez aggro back to me. If you have a tree-hugger, have them ensnare mezzes. Taunt. CD (resisted or won't land). Taunt. CD again. Aggro is yours. Proceed to break mez. (Pretty sure the taunt is the key factor. No way to prove it.) And in mez situations, just make sure the chanter knows you're not going to switch mobs unless absolutely necessary, and have someone be ready to ghetto mez (root) if you must switch and dot is on. More often than not, I'm not the only one that's dotted my target come mez-time, so having CD on it is irrelevant.<br />
As for using the rest of my mana, it's situational. Spears/Zev's/AoH when not DR mobs. I add a Touch for eye candy on crits and so clerics love me -every once in a while- but mana on that is nasty. For DR mobs, figure out what lands, and use it as efficiently as possible. <br />
So stick to CD, you're doing well. Just play with other stuff if your mana pool being full is bothering you. You'll be able to figure out what's best for you. It changes so quickly post-60 anyway, as you get your new spells.</div></div><hr />

Kinda Hard to have agro when your wacking on a mob bards Chain pulling Inc% you Dont see the mob yet But shammie/chanter went poking his/her head into the next room and has is tashed and slowed allready. Ive also grp with a few wizzy that can Chain cast 1k DD's all day long</div></div><hr />

<br />
Try using fear.<br />
<br />
I have no problems with aggro anywhere, and I have had chanters/shammys that simply own at their jobs.<br />
<br />
Though honestly, a truely great chanter will make ANY melee have no problems aggroing a mob off of them. Boggle is a wonderful spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Owndar Ld</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">/sigh  CD is fine for argo i normal mem it over fear Quicker cast less mana quicker refresh. Problem is shammie/chanter slow the mob before i get it target :p which really is not a problem i just feel  Gimp then.  I Hold agro fine With CD all over the place if i get my targeting right and dont get stunned aloti can hold agro one 3 diffrent mobs at once with just Cd . Anyways ill say it again if you are holding argo fine in Ldon it's the rest of the grp doing thier job Not you being 1337357 or all 13371@ND. Or we have diffrent opions of What Fine is My Fine is proable Almost perfect too you. Only time i mem fear is on  diease immune mobs it give me an xtra agro spell when breaking mezz incase taunt wants to fail twice or i was standing alittle out of postion.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Dakkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I have to compensate for poor/overeager players in groups too.<br />
<br />
With a good chain puller I can get aggro before they take more than token hits, well enough for the shaman to slow almost immediately while the DPS classes finish off the previous mob.<br />
<br />
With average players who're unskilled in aggro control you have to get creative, but you can only compensate up to a certain point as Ownar says.<br />
<br />
If they treat a confined dungeon like those Dreadlands-style PoP camps where they can do whatever they like to incoming mobs because the tank will have several CDs on them before they reach camp, you'll spend a lot of your time flailing on the back of the mob waiting for taunt and/or aggro spells to work.<br />
<br />
If they're in great gear it doesn't affect the success of the group that much but I tend to avoid them because it's just annoying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Neylana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Since 60 my two aggro spells are CD and Terror of Terris.  I cast CD on inc then Terror as soon as gems refresh.  The chanter/shaman can debuff and slow on inc and the mob never thinks about them.  Then I will add some terrors in along the way just to maintain the aggro.  I tried fear and I found it to be less aggro than CD.  Festering Darkness is alot more mana and the only time I use it is when I dont have a druid/ranger/wiz in the group or for a tricky pull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Mystina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Mostly festering, some terror, aura of pain, spear, sometimes asystole when theres a crazy shaman slowing before mob is at camp.<br />

i never have trouble getting/keeping agro. if you're doing the best you can, frankly there's nothing anybody will do that will keep agro from you... unless they're extremely stupid and taunt or chain a high agro spell (stun/slow/tash/snare).<br />
<br />
tips:<br />
use clinging darkness and fear. i keep both memmed if there's a mezzer, otherwise i just use clinging darkness. chaining cd &amp; fear is probably the most agro you can produce over time, and its easily maintainable (20 mana for CD, 40 for fear)<br />
<br />
if the mob turns from you, make sure you're close to the mob and click taunt. next attack 80% of the time that alone will put you back on top of the hate list. throw a clinging in after and you again have a nice agro lock.<br />
<br />
if you have a chain puller, switch to the next mob when its incoming regardless of whether the other mob is dead. also if you have mezzed mobs in camp, switch to them before the first mob is dead and taunt -&gt; fear -&gt; taunt -&gt; cd to have an agro lock on it for sure, or just taunt -&gt; cd is sufficient most of the time.<br />
<br />
know your key binds, and use them.. ie use F2, F3, F4, F5, or F6 to target the puller, and press 1 or whatever hotkey is your assist key, or set up a hotkey /target puller, /assist every time you change groups.<br />
<br />
adjust the amount of agro you generate with your groups, IE generally 2-3 CDs is enough for me to have an agro lock for the entire fight, but when someone consistently is agroing above that i add another CD and i'm set.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Yabyab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">From my own experience Fear generate less aggro than CD. But I know that some monsters react differently to some spells. But overall CD &gt; Fear in terms of aggro. Thats more than you want really.<br />
<br />
 Always try to keep the slower as far away from the monster when pulling as you can (at least yuo have to be closer to the monster than the slower when slow lands). Range affects aggro ALOT.<br />
<br />
 For people fighting monsters of less than 10khp and grouping with kickass nukers. You will not keep aggro with CD/Fear(if they not immuned to it) this way. Because Damage Aggro is Scaled towards Total Percentage of Damage. The 6k nuke landing on a 10khp monster will hit 60% of its HP &lt;-- this is a HUGE aggro. While a 6k nuke landing on a 60khp monster is just a 10% damage &lt;-- this is not as bad. The damage done is the same but the aggro is different because damage Percentage is different.<br />
<br />
 I've noticed that CD, and most of other negative-effect spells generate less aggro the less HP your target has. For instance, CDing a Golem in PoV will generate solid aggro. Go to Crush Bone and CD a Legionaire, any wizard nuking for 150damage will overaggro you! thus, Terror line is more useful against Monsters with less HP.<br />
<br />
 Thats what I've observed through my hunting experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">yabyab, there are no 6k nukes, crits don't create more agro than noncrits, resists create more agro that landing however, and the agro from clinging, fear, etc all seem scaled toward the mobs HP as well. clinging/fear is always enough on the average exp mob (with some exceptions), even vs 3k nukes.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Dakkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Plenty of suggestions in this thread other than just CD and fear, which use a lot more mana and give more aggro.  Try them out.<br />
<br />
When I need to hold aggro off someone who's not bothering (or conversely trying to get it off me), I have to be a lot more creative than just spamming CD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Vigormortis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">CD is not nearly enough for most groups I've been in lately. I group with my friends who include a 65 bst, 65 rogue, and 65 monk. Cleric for heals and my girlfriend who's a 61 mage. I have to pound the mob with cd, fear, and often have to throw extras to keep aggro. I suppose this is because we have a 65 bst who is slowing, and aside from that good bst's generate a tremendous amount of aggro. I prefer pulling with darkness, then hitting with asystole on the walk back. This is usally enough to keep the mob pissed at me all day, but even then sometimes I have to throw a spear or fear to keep its attention.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>NorrynNoir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">i'm having the same experience vigor is. i don't know if all my groups simply have overeager players but i've been hitting with CD on the pull and then usually twice more early in the fight.<br />
<br />
this does not guarantee aggro. they kicker is if the snarer in the group is higher lvl than me (i'm 59 now) i can no longer use CD i get 'didn't take hold' message. this sucks if you're trying to get aggro back later in the fight. no other spell works as well - terrors are crap, no better than the actual taunt button, spears do dmg but not much else, perhaps i'll try heart flutter.<br />
<br />
 i wasn't aware of the fear thing i just need to make sure of the lvl of mobs in the pop dungeons - usually the lvl range i'm playing in is 57 - 60 so i'll bet the mobs may not be lvl 55.<br />
<br />
now i touch a lot of time off recently and came back so my gear is definately subpar. but DPS didn't use to matter so much when i was MT'ing before i took a break.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">cd produces just as much or more agro if it doesn't take hold. it produces just as much or more agro if the mob is immune to snare as well. it produces just as much or more agro if the mob resists as well. clinging darkness is all you need, other than fear for mezzed mobs.<br />
<br />
regarding what do with extra mana, you can always cast touch of innoruk. i find maintaining aura's and zevfeer's and throwing in the occasional spear keeps my mana dropping.</div></div><hr />

My usual line up got a few fixed ones, for example, with no KEI I keep pact of hate memmed, together with Mental corruption. Otherwise a typical set of spells would be ToI, aura of hate, festering, aura of pain, death peace and zevfer's - not the greatest line up but it works for aggro, and I don't have to do much switching back and forth. Pact of Hate is the spell i juggle, for a nuke for example, or if fights are taking 1 minute+ blood of hate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If the shammy/chanter is casting before I have a mob targetted, they better expect to tank some.<br />
<br />
In most of my LDoN groups anyways, we're pulling 3's and 4's.... if we don't have CC the shammy usually tanks a couple for a few seconds anyways.  No biggy, they don't hit for shit.<br />
<br />
And if that shammy/chanter/whatever is aggroing off of you that bad, they don't kick ass.  Some people don't realize that while SK's are very strong aggro, we can't lock it in the first half second of the fight.  Oh well, those people get to tank, too.<br />
<br />
Festering is definitely greater aggro than CD.  However, its mana cost is waaay too high to have to recast it more than once per fight.  If someone is nuke happy and pulls a mob off of you too often during the fight, and you gotta cast festering each time to lock aggro down... you're screwed on mana... plus it's a waste of mana as far as dps is concerned.  I'd rather save mana for a few lifetap/spear/blood of hate casts... exp grouping is all about the dps (mobs die faster, you get exp faster).<br />
<br />
I just cast clinging a couple times early, then periodically during a fight.. more often if there's a nuke happy wizard or dot happy shaman.<br />
<br />
I've noticed that recently, warriors with good aggro weaps.... (anger/eb/a nice 2 hander with a yak stun/dd aug) were pullin aggro about half way through a fight if I don't cast clinging a little more often.  Warrior aggro sucks?  pfshaw, find a warrior that knows shit about gear and it doesn't.</div></div><hr />

Depending on the group make up and my role in it my spell line up changes alot..<br />
<br />
General tanking xp group line up tends to be something like this below, assuming I have VOQ. The aura's are usually swapped out depending on the group make up and the kind of mobs im fighting with the other damage spells.  Lots of casters in group shaman slow, ect. I cast these spells whenever I get the oppurtunity and rarely find myself below 50% mana. granted I am a dark elf with a large mana pool ....<br />
<br />
1) Death Peace<br />
2) mental corruption<br />
3) Touch of Innoruuk<br />
4) Zeveer's bite<br />
5) Aura of hate/ Blood of hate<br />
6) aura of pain/scythe of Innoruuk<br />
7) Spear of Decay<br />
8) Clinging darkness<br />
<br />
Remmember damage also helps with agro, and you wont be wasting unnessesary mana on agro that could be used to improve your group and help them kill faster ..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do I have KEI?<br />
<br />
Am I pulling?<br />
Who is pulling?<br />
<br />
Am I MT?<br />
Who is 'trying' to MT?<br />
<br />
Do we have Mez?<br />
Will I have to Agro Kite Adds?<br />
<br />
Is the Wiz/Druid being ballzy?<br />
<br />
-<br />
For when I pull and MT and have Barely any mana regen I use Clinging Darkness on pull (once or twice) - Throw a DoT Lifetap and maybe a spear once I engage the mob.  (its usually slowed by the time it hits camp).<br />
<br />
If we have no snarer - I then throw Festering Dark when I estimate I have just less than the 2 minute timer on the mob.<br />
<br />
If the mob is a caster I will throw an Aura of Darkness instead of a spear when I engage at camp. (so the party gets the recourse)<br />
-<br />
<br />
Seeing that I'm just a troll and have a pidily child's mana pool - I always keep up Mental Corruption and ration out when I can &quot;splurge&quot; on an extra cast for DPS.<br />
-<br />
<br />
Oh, and a pet also helps your agro if you are in Melee range with the mob - the pet also adds very efficient DPS and a little portable damage shield when bad things happen.<br />
<br />
... Like an Add...  from a warrior trying to pull.....<br />

Signa is Correct. CD. nothing more needs to be said.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Vinigan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">I'm only level 20, but I was wondering.. clinging darkness produces more aggro than the terror line? What is the point of the terror line if CD is &gt;?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">i think the terror line was a feable attempt to give us control of agro after they nerfed some other spells enormous agro (disease cloud and shadow vortex?). in actual game play, clinging darkness is still better for pretty much all exp type mobs when you're 65. against lower level mobs, terrors are relatively better because the agro generated by CD scales with mobs hp or level or such.<br />
<br />
the terror lines only good use in reality is for mez tanking when you can't use fear (ie mobs that are fearable). some SKs still use it over cd/fear.... but some SKs are stupid and/or enjoy being inefficient. <br />
<br />
tonight i was holding agro using cd with no mana, fighting mobs with a mana drain proc. kei &amp; ft was giving me enough mana to cast clinging darkness every tick before being hit by the mana drain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">General line up when I am MT (hence needing to keep agro) I dont have any spears memmed.<br />
<br />
Aug of Death<br />
Fear (macroed to go off with Taunt Key)<br />
CD (each mob usually gets 2 of these plus a fear)<br />
ToV (damn you ToI for continuing to evade me)<br />
ZB (FT10, Regen 10 for the group)<br />
AoP (because I like having more then 1700ac)<br />
AoH (extra attack of course for the group)<br />
