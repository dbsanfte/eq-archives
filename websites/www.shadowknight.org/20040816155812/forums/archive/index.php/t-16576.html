<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>gilbegger1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am in the process of completing my bone mail armor. During this process I have collected 4 halfling foot bones. These are used to do the halfling bread quest. This starts in Neriak foreign quarter and acording to Allakhazam's web site, it is started by hailing Carver Cagrek(a troll). I am having trouble finding him. Would anyone know where he is or if anyone else can start this quest? The quest prize is a Fine Antique Poniard.All races can use it and most clases. Shadowknight isnt listed but they have made mistakes before and I thought I might as well try.Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>UnholyWarrior</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Carver Cagrek is in the foreign quater (naturally with all us odder trolls).  Specificially he is tucked away in a back room...<br />
<br />
Building 12 on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eqatlas.com/neriakforeignmap.html&quot;&gt;this map&lt;/a&gt;.  Map is a bit outdated; there is a door in the backof this room (not shown on map).  Carver is in dat room...<br />
<br />
Oh - I think SHD can not use this item; allak is correct (I believe [me just stoopid troll tho])</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>gilbegger1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks for replying Unholywarrior. I thought Id search again while stocking up on stuff when I found him. He is in the building beside the Pig Sticker in the back room. And yes , Shadowknights can use it. Even though shadowknights werent listed on allakazams site as one othe the classes that can. Thanks again.</div></div><hr />
