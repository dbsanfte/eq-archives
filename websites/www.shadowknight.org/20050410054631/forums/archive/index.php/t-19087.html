<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kulka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Maybe this should go under the skills section, but here's the basic question<br />
<br />
Got a lvl 10 troll SK and after reading a lot of info got the idea that it would be best to fight mostly with 2HS. <br />
<br />
So, I have ignored all other wep skills except 2HS, which is maxxed for my lvl. <br />
<br />
But, having looked at a few magelos of other sk's here, I think I may have screwed up and should have trained up my other wep skills. <br />
<br />
I haven't used any of my skill points other than to learn new skills for the first time (lvl 9 spells, etc.) and to learn a new lang as it became avail. Used only one skill point in each area. So, should I use my skill points and spread them around each of the other wep skill to get a base? I just don't want to see my atk drop down to almost nothing since I have no real training in any of the other weps. I'm sure it's been asked before, but I would appreciate any help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Noctix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I didn't use anything other than 1hb and 1hs until level 55 or so.  Then I picked up a junky 2hs for 30pp in the bazaar and I had 2hs maxed in less than a week.<br />
<br />
It is not hard to max out weapon skills, I wouldn't lose any sleep over it.  Just remember you may have a few days where you miss a lot when you first make a switch to a new skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Here is another thread asking a similar question:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Drakonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">At low levels it's pretty much impossible to max all your combat skills, simply because you ding to next level before they're all capped.<br />
<br />
Once you reach about 30 however, it's simple to keep them all maxed, provided you have 1 weapon from each type to rotate between - most groups won't mind you doing that, as long as you keep agro, assuming you're tanking - if you aren't, you don't even need to mention it to them, it's unlikely they'll be parsing everyones damage to make sure they aren't slacking.<br />
<br />
Used to be easier with Hell levels, but it's still doable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You didn't screw up....<br />
At 10 you skill up fast, get some low delay weapons of every type and use them before you hit 30ish...It'll be a bit frustraing but not awful to skill up</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>uaell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">yeah, i wouldn't worry to much about it. my 2HB skill was still at level 0 when i was at 63 because i had never gotten a good 2HB weapon. i bought myself a 2HB weapon and had max skill after just a couple days. it isn't hard.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>appren hightowerr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Only had 2hs maxed until 50 or so, as I had a nice 2hs from level 1, didnt take long to get the others up, so dont worry a second about it</div></div><hr />
