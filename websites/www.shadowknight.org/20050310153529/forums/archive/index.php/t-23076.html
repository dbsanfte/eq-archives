<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shredler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Krushum talks about the 4 sk's in his walkthrough but very briefly. Also other walkthrough shows their spawn points on the maps which also is a valuable info. However i'd like to have some more detailed info on those fights. How hard are they ? Which one is the hardest ? Is one group safe to kill them ? How long all of them take to kill ? How did you do your kills ? Any strat appreciated.<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>VengerMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">killed all 4 today.<br />
<br />
Silithis Sisnta in TD - took him down with a single group.  70 CLR, 69 BRD, 66 RNG, 66 WAR, 70 SHD, 66 SHM.  the poison-based AE dot can become dangerous if you are light on DPS and allow the fight to go on for any length of time.  his melee was not that impressive compared to say mobs in Vxed or MPG.  <br />
<br />
Gubblegrot Smashfist in OoT - nearly identical fight to the first one.  it is not listed on any of the walkthroughs, but he procs an AE dot, this one is a snare called Corpse Rot if memory serves me.  again, good DPS will prevent the dot from becoming a serious factor.<br />
<br />
Skurza Slickutt in SoNH - this was the easiest of the three SKs which i used a group to kill.  the 1500 lifetap is easily resisted with a bard and decent gear.  his melee is identical to the first two.  (all 4 have the exact same melee skills).  he does not use an AE, making him an easy kill if you have a cleric that is sharp to cover the occasional damage spike.<br />
<br />
Giligattabus Igglebix in IC - the gnome was easy, i soloed him w/ just festering + blood.  i used the 68 pet at first, however the gnome has such an insane amount of HP that eventually Boner would do enough damage to gank aggro and get killed.  get a c3, go and solo him.  he never resisted a single festering or blood, it did however take me 30min of kiting to kill him.  i was more concerned with mana management than a fast kill.<br />
<br />
hope this helps you.  i had just over 1800ac and about 9750hp with the buffs from my group.  i am taking down the WW mob tomorrow to finish up.  it's nice to see so much cooperation and information being shared here.  Innoruuk's Voice was solved long before many other epics thanks to that behavior.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>grinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I just completed all the steps from sheath combine to the 6 pallys today.<br />
<br />
did them all with me and a guildy, both of us boxing 1 other toon.<br />
<br />
i was 67 sk 10,000 hp 2000 ac boxing ep geared 65 cleric.<br />
<br />
friend boxed chanter and druid for all except the 1500 life tapper which he logged his 70 pally on for [since we didnt have a bard and he has about 100 more MR then i do] .<br />
<br />
healing wasnt a problem, druid nuked, chanter slowed and nuked and me [sk takned all except the one mentioned above.<br />
<br />
all 4 quad mostly around the 200-500 range on average with a few spikes.<br />
<br />
used DI but it never needed to fire [except when i was pet pulling the pally's it went off once on my pet :P]<br />
<br />
with just the 2 pair of boxed toons it wasn't that hard, but not a walk over either, good fun.<br />
<br />
also use harm shield to pull and you'll avoid their HT's and anyspell they might cast on inc.<br />
<br />
the gnome guy was just root dotted because we could ;)<br />
<br />
oh and they all 4 enrage ..turn your melee off at 11% to be sure.<br />
<br />
the 6 pallys are even more gimp, often 1 or 2 HoTs was enough for each, when they start healing themself move around behind for better hits ;)<br />
<br />
stick virt/DI/RUNE on your pet and he should survive getting stunned on the pull.<br />
<br />
we didnt test mezzing them as pet pull was easy so i dont know if u can mezz em.</div></div><hr />
