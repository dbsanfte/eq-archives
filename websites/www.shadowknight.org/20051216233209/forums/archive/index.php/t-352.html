<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xilith</div><div class="date">04-02-2002, 12:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In an outing in Umbral Planes I looted some Pal/SK Hammer of Hoarfrost or something like that.  Noone really needed it.  It's the first weapon I've played with with a resist-based damage bonus.<br />
<br />
15/20 +5 Cold Damage - so if the cold hits it's effectively 20/20.  The docs I've read say they do a resistance check against the cold resist of the mob to decide to apply the bonus.<br />
<br />
My question is: If a mob has no resistance whatsoever (bonus is always applied) would this weapon outdamage a pure melee 20/20 weapon?  Or would it always be worse, because you get 1 resist check followed by a reduction in damage due to ac mitigation?<br />
<br />
Rephrased: Does AC damage mitigation apply to elemental damage, or does only the resist factor in - and if so would this not be a superior choice vs high ac mobs such as in Ssra temple.</div></div><hr />

So if the mob has no resistance to it you are gonna get the extra 5dmg on top of your hit everytime.<br />
<br />
I can't really say myself if it would be a better weapon on high AC mobs, I would suppose it depends  on what weapon you are currently using. I dont think anything is gonna raise your damage much on something like Arch Lich unless the bonus damage is damn high.</div></div><hr />
