<br />
The cleric has the potential to heal better, and supply the best AC/HP buffs.  <br />
<br />
The shaman can usually slow the mob, plus melee buff (agi, dex, str, sta), haste, heal, and has a pet to add to our pet for a little extra dps.<br />
<br />
The shaman's slow will probably be necessary in the higher levels if you ever want to do tier 2 or better PoP zones.<br />
<br />
Shaman's healing is not the greatest, but with the haste, slow, and buffs, they are usually the favorite melee duo partner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ZilshasisEQ</div><div class="date">03-12-2004, 11:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I box a shaman, and if you don't mind using Storicm and torpor as your main heals till you're level 65 with your shaman and can buy Quicence then they are a decent addon to your box setup. <br />
<br />
However I've reached a point where I'm soo sick of PoInnovation and the shaman cannot yet keep me alive in Tier 2 zones, so I'll have to find a healer to keep me up. I know it will change when my box setup is all 65 and has 65 spells, but there's still awhile till that happens since I'm only 61, the shaman is 57 and the wizard is 59.<br />
<br />
But at your level and for quite some time the shaman is the optimal partner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sesshou</div><div class="date">03-12-2004, 01:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you're tired of Innovation, why not go to Disease or Nightmare?  Or try out Crypt of Decay, though it's probably on par with Valor.  I wouldn't know since I haven't spent a lot of time in Crypt of Decay.  Regardless, can't hurt to try other zones besides Innovation, I remember Innovation being one of the easier Tier 1 zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zenobie</div><div class="date">03-12-2004, 02:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shaman &gt; Cleric IMO. I hydra a 64 shaman most of the time and it is very nice to have this combo. You can buy a virtue for extra hp-ac and the healing power of the shaman is far enough if you manage to slow-cripple before the mob is in the camp (pull with festering). <br />
<br />
I like to duo in PoM : I did the rascals on the wall of the castle but exp slowed so I moved first to the chest room then to the theatre, great exp, decent loot.<br />
<br />
You have the base of a good group too : find a cleric-druid for the healing, any dps and you are all set.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ramgar SK</div><div class="date">03-15-2004, 11:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Enchanter plug.  :)<br />
<br />
I 2box a chanter for slows, CC, haste and mind candy, and I love it.<br />
<br />
I would choose enchanters over clerics for 2 boxing, and Shamans slightly over enchanter, because I cannot duo tier 2 mobs, they just hit too hard and too often even when they are slowed.  Tier one is fine, and places like Droga, Veksar, and CT are fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eansdad</div><div class="date">03-15-2004, 06:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I 2 box with my cleric and when I can sometimes 3 box (on 2 computers) with my bro's chanter. Clerics are good till the low to mid 50's then everything startes to hit way to hard for decent exp. Of course I like to stand toe-to-toe with the mob instead of kiting but thats my preference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Moongarm</div><div class="date">03-16-2004, 05:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can reach a point in gear on both characters where a cleric is a fine partner, even at 65, past teir one in PoP.  I can tank unslowed mobs all day long without draining my clerics mana at all(minus stuff like wing bosses in BoT) up to tactics.  <br />
<br />
Cleric  pros:  Easiest to bot.  Strong versus Undead.  Res, Best HP/AC buffs.  Best healing. Pacify line.<br />
<br />
Cleric cons.  Slow exp rate unless you're fighting undead.  No haste.  Slightly harder to travel with.<br />
<br />
Shaman pros:  Haste, Slow, better DPS all around(v undead it could go to the cleric if they have high enough mana regen).  Easier to travel with.  Good mana regen without purchasing outside buffs.<br />
<br />
Shaman cons: Healing, Buffs and probably the biggest con with a shaman is it requires a whole lot more button mashing to match an effective level of play compared to an actual person playing them.  Canni dance, slowing, Healing and DoTing can wear people out quickly when coupled with a character that needs somewhat frequent attention as well.<br />
<br />
Overall I'd say shaman is the better partner for exp hunting.  But either can work fine if you play out their strengths.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markor</div><div class="date">03-17-2004, 06:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was duoing with my cler with my cler on yard trash in PoFire and was at about 80m after each fight but the cler is partially time geared.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nimic</div><div class="date">03-17-2004, 12:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In a nutshell, shaman will be best most of the time.  POP mobs will tear you up without slows.  I was able to dual box reasonably well in Plane of Nightmare with my shaman and SK in the 50s.  While a cleric would have been able to heal me, the shaman was more efficient on mana (plus they can canniballize if necessary).  Shamans can also add a bit of DPS which you will need with the HP of planar mobs.<br />
<br />
If your looking for a spot to hunt, I highly reccomend the dock area or the hedge area in nightmare.  No wanderers and easy to single pull.<br />
<br />
As a side note, in the planes you will get MUCH better XP in a good grind group rather then dual boxing.  I would not recommend duoing unless absolutely necessary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Reflan</div><div class="date">03-17-2004, 09:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I concur.  Don't duo at all unless you just can't avoid it or are just burnt out and want quiet.  The experience grouping is vastly better.<br />
<br />
I'd take the advice of what to do when time geared as only valuable to time-geared people.  That gear so changes a toon's power, even a little of it, that the toon becomes capable of much different things.<br />
<br />
I have a 65 shaman and SK, and can duo yellow mobs with them wearing bazaar gear.  My SK has never looted a thing besides a sword from hedge maze that he doesn't even use.  He has ornate hands arms and wrists, the rest fulvous hardscale plate made by my shaman.  He does have a white dragon helm  but otherwise nothing special besides utility items he doesn't even wear when fighting.<br />
<br />
I duo yellows with him in Plane of Valor(the guys in suits) to get sacred waters for the aid gimel quest.  He only has 28 AA, and my shaman has about 270, and my SK still manages to get along fairly well, though sometimes it's a close call, against yellows.  That should give you an idea of the power of a shaman/SK duo.  I can also solo zone trash in Plane of Fire, but the mephits in plane of water will wipe me out.<br />
<br />
All in all, it can be quite a fun challenge, and really teach you a lot of tricks about pulling and things like that, to duo, and shaman/SK makes an incredible team.  But...duo'ing is such inferior experience to grouping that it shouldn't be bothered with for most people, most of the time, especially when you get to 65, where you can get in groups that crank out an AA or more an hour.  Not that many people can do that with a shaman/SK duo -- you need good AA and equipment on both toons before you can think of coming anywhere close to that level of experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Josahd</div><div class="date">03-17-2004, 10:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shaman hands down.  2 boxing a chanter?  thought the point of 2 boxing was so you could easily get exp by yourself.  Chanters can't heal.<br />
<br />
And for the SK that can't 2 box with his shammy in tier 2... why the heck not?  I used to 2 box the west wall camp in PoV all day long with just shammy heals.... well before I hit 5k unbuffed.  Of course gear makes it easier, but it's not that hard to stay alive on those guys.  Especially if you can snag a virtue first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rhumba_Kween</div><div class="date">03-18-2004, 11:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I bot a 65 chanter. And it works out great for me. A puller who has a chanter that know exactly what the puller is doing is pretty amazing, once you work things out. I will say that I never solo/duo with just my 2, unless its easy blues (i.e. Kunark and easy Vellious/Luclin). I always group with guildies.<br />
<br />
With that said, if you want to join a different guild, I would think in most cases if they allow 2 boxing, your SK might be more appealing with a Cleric. Less so with a Shammy or Chanter because guilds need fewer of those.<br />
<br />
Anyway thats my 2 cents. If you mainly duo, go Shammy. Otherwise, consider a Cleric or Chanter Bot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kromglon</div><div class="date">03-20-2004, 12:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I duo with my wife Im 55 sk shes 55 sham. Ya we can take alot of shit but its slow. I dont see how you can do PON duo those things got a motherload of hps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ganaith</div><div class="date">03-22-2004, 07:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can duo Bot mobs easy with my sk and shaman. It doesnt even take me any mana at all, fight takes around 5 mins.<br />
<br />
Easy, yet frightfully boring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iamcreapingdeath</div><div class="date">03-26-2004, 06:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I duo with my shaman in Sol Ro Tower.  Those are even cons, just max out your Soul Abrasion and a defensive aa's...pimp out your shaman heals and its no problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dhantes</div><div class="date">03-26-2004, 07:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">5mins is a pretty long time for a fight ganiath. You sure your not doing something wrong there or just overestimating how long it takes :). Think with bst+cleric fights last about 2.5mins when i dou in bot with bst+cleric+sk im thinking around 1-1.5mins depending on if im using mana or conserving.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lorddaeth</div><div class="date">03-26-2004, 02:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">take it one more step, and 3box...<br />
<br />
I use my SK, my SH, and my buddies Mage.<br />
<br />
mage pet keeps focused well on the mob, and the DD helps too.<br />
<br />
that's how i start groups in BoT when i'm grinding AA.</div></div><hr />
