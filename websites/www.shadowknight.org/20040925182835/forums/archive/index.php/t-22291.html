I noticed while I was looking through my log to parse this fight. It looks like he riposted my riposte, I thought that wasn't possible? Or could that just be my attack round coinciding with his, and my riposte would be the line where I crushed him for 98?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shadowsoal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">you swing at him and he swings at you at the same time, you both riposte and both miss, this proudces the illusion that you are ripositing eachother, its been tested with rangers using riposte disc with autoattack off, you/npcs can not riposte a riposte.  Also if your a fencer, you'd know that you'd have to have a few extra arms to riposte an opponents riposte =P<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hachemalum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Iksar can riposte a riposte... as soon a soe acknowleges that our tails are indeed prehensile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Korff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You can riposte a riposte.  Ever played a melee with a riposte discipline and fired  it on a mob that just enraged?  HUGE spam, and great for skillups, both defensive and offensive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Eggborn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Always wondered about this.  I definately been considering putting these AA's dead last, since if I am tanking, I am there to stay alive, not to do so much damage.<br />
<br />
I haven't had a lot of situations where I need to turn my attack off to tank, but sometimes in emergencies I have.  Do a lot of high end sk's turn attack off ever?   What about with crowd control?  Turning my back to a mezzed mob seems to do the trick, but I have no substantial proof it does. I just try and stay clear of it.<br />
<br />
Besides the mez break thing, during tanking things that hit like a truck, if mobs can do that, could adding AA's to your skill be a bad thing?  Just curious if anyone has researched this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I never even turn it on when picking up a mezzable add.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ashrai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Same here, I never turn attack on when I grab a mob on a raid. For a few reasons:<br />
<br />
1) it's mezable and someone wants to mez it for whatever reason<br />
2) minimize any possible riposte, because my healer's attention is elsewhere engaged or I have no healer<br />
<br />
<br />
Don't need to have attack on to hold agro, and that's my job at that moment is to hold the mob until someone decides to do something with it. If I know I can safely play with it without causing undue strain on my healer and no one wants to mez it, I'll start doing some damage to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>RaevaelDarkstar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">On the occasions where I do actually get around to raiding (2 or 3 times a week now) if I end up locking down a add I dont turn on attack.<br />
<br />
I also take it to an extreme with not turning it on.  In hard ldons Im tanking or if sewer farming I dont turn on attack until after mob is slowed.  Until then, its getting enough swings at me - no need for the extra riposte during the unslowed moments.  Can hold agro rather easily without it on.</div></div><hr />
