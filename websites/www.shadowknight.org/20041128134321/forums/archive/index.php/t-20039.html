<br />
oh come on...<br />
<br />
<br />
There is absolutely NO reason this abiity cannot scale as you add points to it.<br />
<br />
Right now it costs 3/6/9/12/15 and gives 3DS per point.<br />
<br />
If it can be 3, it can scale...<br />
NO class is going to complain about it being too powerful, even if it gives 30 or 45 ds at level 5.<br />
<br />
God forbid Cloak of Luclin gives us a 40-55 damage shield after spending 45AA's in it. (the rangers have a combo-self-buff with 34DS for ZERO AAXP sunk in it...)<br />
<br />
Everyone knows this doesn't compare in any way with the 500HP the warriors got.<br />
<br />
Even if it was changed to LIFETAP DS, and scaled to 30DS, it wouldn't be HALF as powerful as the warrior's 500hp boost.<br />
<br />
The rest of the abilities are bland copy-pastes like everyone else got...  could we maybe bring Intense Hatred into the land of &quot;better than increased Charisma? (for DI)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>aress</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">aye, I would have preferred to see a % increase rather than a fixed amount (something like +50% of existing DS)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Blackstone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">This should instead scale up a hate value for each point of DS for each level of Intense Hatred.  In otherwords each hit by a mob adds X hate, just as if you cast Terror of Thule or whatever.<br />
<br />
<br />
1 -- 50% of DS hate value<br />
2 -- 60% of DS hate value<br />
3 -- 75% of DS Hate value<br />
4 -- 95% of DS hate value<br />
5 -- 110% of DS hate value</div></div><hr />
