<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Oagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I posted about this a couple weeks ago.  Since that time, Lax has been improving his version for windowed EQ, and is doing a good job with it.  He is definitely more responsive to patches than JSD.  <br />
<br />
Some features:<br />
<br />
You can tile up to four toons on one computer, if your machine can handle it.  This is a nice feature.  Mouse release is the scroll lock key, instead of multiple keys.<br />
<br />
Those are the main differences, and I'm not using EQ Windows anymore.  Anyway, for those that would like to give it a try, here is the link<br />
<br />
http://teqim.sourceforge.net/?p=news<br />
<br />
The guy quit playing a couple months ago, and basically does this for donations.  So, if you're able, send him a few bucks.  BTW, he's the guy that developed EQ Playnice, if you didn't know.  Suggestion...read the text file after you download, so you know how to set it up and use it properly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fally</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yea but it's still rather buggy / unfinished, isn't it? Last time I checked it was version 0.99 Beta :( <br />
<br />
Let me know when it starts getting real cool :cool:<br />
