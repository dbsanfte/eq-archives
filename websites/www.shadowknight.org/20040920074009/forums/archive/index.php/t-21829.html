<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">&quot;Shadowknights are unholy warriors who use fear, pain and disease to attack all that is good in the world. Shadowknights are primarily a melee class, able to wear plate armor and wield many kinds of weapons.<br />
<br />
Shadowknights are deadly opponents who use evil spells to slow and cripple their enemies. They steal the strength and life from their victims, using this stolen power to strengthen themselves and their allies. When needed, shadowknights use their powerful harm touch ability to greatly damage their opponents.<br />
<br />
Shadowknights can feign the appearance of death, fooling enemies into ignoring them. Combined with spells that degrade an enemy's ability to fight, a shadowknight becomes a fearsome foe.<br />
<br />
Shadowknights can use their dark powers to adventure solo for a time. The shadowknight's lethal abilities are best used, however, with the support of a larger group. Players who like offensive melee fights but want a variety of ways to inflict harm on their opponents will enjoy playing a shadowknight.&quot;<br />

<br />
use evil spells to slow <br />

See, even SOE in their official write-up thinks we can slow mobs. Gimme my Haste/slow tap!  :D</div></div><hr />

No, they were referring to the SK ability to act as a speed bump on the mob's path to the real tank, the warrior.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hehe, nothing wrong for Croaak to push for better solo tool.<br />
 <br />
See the description, &quot;Shadowknights can use their dark powers to adventure solo for a time. &quot; so it applies. :D<br />
<br />
I would like to see some better solo tools myself cuz soloing rocks for those with very limited time frame. Why penalize those subscribers with full price if they only wanted to BE able to solo for maybe 30 minutes then log off? EQ is horrible in this area in high level area.. They only wanted to see SOME progression such as some xp gaining even 1-3 blues a day is BETTER than NOTHING gained within 30 minutes time frame. <br />
<br />
Basically, I would love to see some improvement for raiding, xp grouping, duoing, and soloing tools in every expansion equally. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Valkyria Grymreaper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Slow as a solo tool would be pointless imo. We solo just fine now as it is with the tools we have, as long as it can be snared and don't summon.<br />
<br />
We need more of a defined raid roll then anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Azerinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I also think that they are refering to run speed... but I don't think a haste tap would be only a solo tool IF the recourse gave v3 haste... if it did that... it would be nice... <br />

But I really want to know where all our debuffs are to cripple our enemies.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I hope you die <br />
<br />
I love you too Brael. Yes, we need more tanking abilities, I agree with that. However, I do other things besides raid. I solo, 2 man group, 3 man group.<br />
<br />
You guys have your agenda, I have mine. Plus you have to admit it would be a GOOD thing for those that do solo.<br />
<br />
Besides, it is only the 3rd time. And how many times have you brought up we need a raid role and better tanking abilities Vici?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Straight solo by tanking with this idea would improve our ability to solo. Having a bard, beastlord, or enchanter in the group would make this ability a useless addition. I solo a lot even though a I raid a lot, it would help, but I think we need an addition that has a broader effect, something that helps all SK's not matter on the style of play. Your idea is very situational, and doesn't have a broad effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">For solo slowing we can use a Will Sapper.<br />
<br />
The application I see for this type of spell would not really be a soloing tool. If it were to be implemented, this is how it should go:<br />
<br />
40-50% slow, 1.0-1.5 cast time, 30-45 second recast, high resist modifier, high mana cost, duration of 2 tics, is over-written by any other slow spell. <br />
<br />
How would this be helpful? It would be a very good source of initial non-damage aggro, allowing us to grab the mob's attention and hold it while a real slow/debuff is applied. How it would differ from the Fear line is that it would also allow us to off tank better during the critical first 12 seconds, as well as allowing us to pull more efficiently via better survivability.<br />
<br />
Personally I don't think it will happen, but that is the shape I would like to see it in if it were.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Sounds better than his idea.<br />
<br />
Level 50 = 10% slow / 10% haste <br />
Level 60 = 20% slow / 20% haste<br />
Level 65 = 30% slow / 30% haste<br />
<br />
I'm sure he wanted his haste to last more than 2 ticks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>kharan_zechts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I like the idea.. it is an interesting alternative to paladin stuns. Fear2 is basicly the same thing as a stun. This would make it different. I'd like it for the soloing utility and another agro tool is nice to have.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>scpio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">slow will not balance us. shamen are allready masters of slow and complain that its not nearly as effective as they would like it to be. as it is there are to many classes that can slow far to effectively.<br />
sonys answer to this was to make slow mitgatable by mobs or immune far to often. <br />
<br />
further i could solo as a VT knight and i can solo now as a kodtaz knight. so can anyone. its all about the right place and the right mobs. Though soloing blows for XP no matter where you go.</div></div><hr />

No need for a slower.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Zero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Yes I think of people soloing when I look at these ideas.<br />
<br />
And still, I think...wtf would a 20% haste tap do? The best xp your going to get solo, is going to be done kiting. Unless your very low level, as in 50-.<br />
<br />
But in that case, you probably wouldn't have this spell yet - so it wouldn't matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I'd have disagree on the best solo XP being via kiting.  It's an option, but it's not the only one - there are plenty of places a well geared (and I don't even mean time+ gear necessarily, though it certainly opens up more options) knight can solo toe-to-toe with reasonable effeciency.  Never going to touch grouping XP, but that should be expected.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">It all depends on the gear.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Androsulach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">But what kind of gear were the warriors in when they started going toe-to-toe with the GoD mobs, prior to retune?<br />
<br />
That asked, while I like the idea of a speed tap, the recourse will have to stack with other spell hastes up to the haste cap.<br />
<br />
As far as our tanking goes.  If they don't improve our defensive skill caps, they should at least move us to the melee defense table.  That would go a long way towards separating us from the chain and leather classes and close a major portion of the tanking gap with warriors.  Personally, though, I think we should get the avoidance skill caps raised closer to that of the warriors as well as the move to the melee defense table.  We already have Defense capped where Warriors have it cap at, but Parry, Riposte, Dodge, and Disarm all cap far lower than where the Warrior caps are, add to that the innate mitigation of the melee defense table and that makes for quite a gap.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Maniacles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">If I were to take all the replies at face value,  the slow tap would simultaneously overpower us via giving us an ability that would be useless in practice because so many other classes have it.<br />
<br />
As this describes just about every sk ability we've gotten, these arguments no longer hold any substansive water.  Another overpowering ability that is useless in practice is EXACTLY what we need.  If we get enough of them, we might actually become usefull!<br />
<br />
If zevfeer's bite had been discussed in these forums, it would have gotten the same treatment by those who bitch about being manawhores for other classes, and yet, it's one of my most cherished spells, only leaving my spell set when the mobs are disease immune.  Those who bitch about abilities that help other classes can kiss my lizard arse.<br />
<br />
What would a slow tap have to have to make it worthwhile for us sks?  For one, it would have to be quick casting, that in itself making it a fundamentally different spell than what the other classes have.  For two, it would have to be of different quality.  I.E. different length, different slow percent.   Heck, I'd be interested in a slowtap proc.  On the other hand, I'm not so sure what use the tap portion of the effect is, as increasing my meager melee damage by x% just wouldn't be worth inflicting the pain of coding that crap on the developers.  Might as well just make it a slow proc.  Rangers get it with their epic, we should get it via spells.<br />
<br />
If they could code it, I'd be all for an ability that, rather than give US defensive, causes the MOB to hit as if it's targets had defensive. analagous to the mark of kings spell vs a regular old damage sheild.  The best part?  Warriors couldn't even bitch about it, as it's a fundamentally different ability.<br />
<br />
Shamen who bitch about the ineffectuality of slow are fundamentally incapable of understanding the concept of balance.  Their opinions are baseless meanderings of the mentally challenged.  Want to instantly disqualify yourself from credibility? Say &quot;shamanic slow isn't powerfull enough.&quot;  Alternatively, say &quot;Complete Heal was a well thought out spell.&quot;  At any rate, one could safely ignore the pleats of these fanbois if they didn't poison the water to more reasonable ideas.  As it is difficult to distinguish pleas for increased power whether they come from those who have it vs those who really need it, it is necessary to slam these future darwin award winners' opinions as the worthless drivel they are.<br />

Blah, pearls, swine, why bother.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">so then we get a slow, beastlords get slow, shamans get slow, enchanters get slow, bards get slow.... why not take a warrior/paladin for a group and get a beastlord? or enchanter (even tho most chanters i play with when charming prefer to not slow also).  Us getting a slow or &quot;pre-slow&quot; or haste/slow tap prolly wont sit with me for anything but a solo tool.  it wont help us get groups based on the fact that we have it since better options already do have it.  It wont help us in raids since most beastlords we play with barely slow unless theres more yard trash in camp then a few shaman can handle.  Simply put, if you want to solo hard stuff then gear up, if you want to sit at a confortable 5k then two box a shaman and deal with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Cameela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Okay...dunno how many times its gonna have to be said, but something like this isnt going to help us where we need it the most.<br />
<br />
However, its a decent thought process to follow with regards to our up and coming spells.  Our lower level debuff/buff spells actually DID debuff the mob...I dont think there is anyone here who wouldnt prefer aura of hate/pain to debuff the mob as much as it buffs us rather that a whoping 200 points of damage whoopdeefuckingdo.  Please speak up if ya think otherwise, but fixing our tanking abilities and giving us back half-decent debuffs would only better our overall tanking ability as well as give us something remotely resembling the utility people seem to think we posess.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Ibring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Hi All,<br />
<br />
I have an idea for a group/raid life tap like spell/discipline which allows for a percentage of each hit we take to be mitigated and distributed to the group/raid that we are in (say 30% of the damage, mitigated by a further factor to be assigned).<br />
<br />
I have already mentioned this in another post, but some people really disliked it saying that no guild would have an SK if he he had this ability. Whilst they may be right (I have only recently started playing a SK, my main is a mage), I am still not sure why that would be.<br />
<br />
Assuming a raid of 70 people, each other player would receive 30%/70/mitigation factor  (say 5) of the total damage from each hit, i.e. 0.08% (so if the mob hits for 1000, then each player takes 8 damage). This could be further mitigated by group regen spells. Admittedly this would stack up in the long run (either through the increased use of healing mana, or in terms of raw damage), and would not really be viable for main tanking (where even 1% of the damage could create significant problems for casters), but would give an immediate boost to the SK as an off-tank.<br />
<br />
The aim is to provide a tanking ability (in this case a damage mitigation of 30% as far as the tank is concerned) which scales with the mob and that can make the SK a more desirable off tank in exceptional situations. Furthermore such an ability would be unique (not another stun, or stun-like ability), and would be in line with the SK ethos.<br />
<br />
Yours sincerely,<br />

Seems really easy unless you are a casual player who has a lifestyle that does not allow them the time to raid and may not have the ability to two box which I imagine many casual players like myself do not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
BTW, after reading this thread. It gave me some ideas how to make slow/haste tap more interesting and WORKS well in group...<br />
<br />
Why bards are only one with songs?? Why not broaden it?  Make SK slow/haste tap &quot;song&quot; type that can stack with chanter/shm/bl haste spell AND design a slow code that can stack with their slow spells.<br />
<br />
If that's true then it would rock cuz I could open the pull via haste/slow tap for HUGE aggro (you know how slow aggro is) to pre-slow it maybe 10%-30% then shm can slow it when SK-slowed mob comes into camp to slow it even further that surely would help mob damage to be mitigated BEFORE it even hits me cuz it got pre-slowed just like bards did while pulling. <br />
<br />
There, we have haste/slow tap that can be used in raids, groups and soloing equally cuz we would be ONLY class that can have slow/haste that can stack with rest of class's slow and haste spells. :) I'm aware of haste cap...<br />
<br />
Just a thought. ;) Throw in some ideas or scrap it entirely. I don't care. ;) This idea would probably create an unique role for SK class and SK pulling would get more useful than before.. And it helps to improve SK tankability due to further reduced damage intake due to stackable slow on mob.. Probably equivalent to stun damage reduction.. Because stackable slow on mob is SCALEABILITY so is stuns..</div></div><hr />

Same thing goes the idea for haste/slow tap to mimic song code-wise so they can stack OR just to make slow/haste to be on different stack slot..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">I re-read what you wrote and it still sounds like you wanted us to have a song for a slow/haste effect.

<br />
Would a new 65% slow 3-tick &quot;song-equiv&quot; spell do as 65% dmg mitigation with 12 ticks recast do? That can stack with shm/bst/chanter slow? :) Would it work?? or you prefer out-right disc?<br />
<br />
I understand that spell only work on ONE mob while disc 65% mitigation works on ANY mobs. But would SOE willing to give us disc 65% mitigation compared to spell that would work ONLY on one mob? I think SOE would be more willing to give spell over disc cuz it is more limited. However, spell still has uses cuz we mostly needed good mitigation on tough nameds that are usually JUST one mob at a time. :)<br />
<br />
And leave warriors with their mitigation disc to work on mult-mobs. They still have edge..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">That wouldn't work actually it's stacking with other slows is why.  If you want a slow that stacks, besides the fact that it's going to take up a spell slot which you really can't afford it's going to massively reduce DPS, you would be looking at something more along the lines of 5-10% on a stackable slow, plus thats a lamer way of accomplishing it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">Yeah, it's tough to convince SOE that way. HOWEVER, I think we can convince SOE to make our tankability back in-line with paladins via their stunning power by adding our stacking slow on mob that is equal to stun for dmg mitigation maybe? If I recall,  mob number of buffs are MUCH bigger than our 15 buff restriction? It would afford 1 extra buff for stacked slow? Isn't it? I heard rumors that SOE is thinking about expanding mob limited number of buffs as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Brael's idea is what I had in mind, however I would reduce the mitigation percentage some (to 50%), add in stun immunity, and increase spell channeling by 75%. Increase the reuse timer to three minutes. Make this available for Paladins as well.<br />
<br />
This would replace a &quot;weapon shield&quot; like discipline for us. Let them take away Fearless disc or even Leech Touch (not Leech Curse) if it were AA based. This ability would go along way to helping our off tanking and pulling both.<br />
<br />
Terrors should still be replaced by a Fear2 line, that scales from low end knights to our Ancient spell. Paladin stuns are just too much of an advantage.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>scaledge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">Ok, how about this.<br />
<br />
Sks get a spell at 15,30,49, 55, 65, and 75(?).<br />
<br />
Respectively, they tap 10%,15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35% haste from the mob, give it to the SK.  The slow does not stack with shammie slow, but the haste stacks with all hastes(including bard haste).<br />
<br />
Lasts 1 minute, recast of 1.5 minutes.<br />
<br />
Names:Sap of XXXX, where XXXX is some random SK type name or god of SK type name.(think voice/terror).<br />
<br />
Mana cost would need to be figured out later(I'm not good at mana cost thinking, I never really looked at mana costs).<br />
<br />
So basically 2/3 of the time you would be hasted, stacking with everything.<br />
<br />
Would give SKs some utility no one else has(meaning it stacks with everyone elses, like bards).<br />
<br />
And it only affects the SK, helping with the issue regarding(if its a group buff, we will become buff bitches).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">So it does absolutely nothing to improve our tanking ability and you completly missed the point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">This idea has always been idiotic, it just doesn't fit well into the game or the class, and any realistic implementation of it would be of extremely minimal benefit-- coming at the expense of other improvements.<br />
<br />
It would also be the kind of justification that would enable paladins demand a continuation of their stun lines to affect higher level mobs-- leaving us further up shit creek for tanking and mitigation. I know that the fucktard lobby of SKs is strong, but even gimps shouldn't be this shortsighted.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Agarwaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">giving SKs a slow debuff is not all that silly an idea - if you are hunting in small groups.  Its not a lot different than BSTs.<br />
<br />
However it would do damn all for full grp tanking unless the slow was superior to shammy slow, faster, and had an inate debuff.  Which is ridiculuous from an RP perspective.  How can any hybrid justify being superior, or even par to shamans at this?  Even now in my view bsts push this margin too hard.<br />
<br />
It would certainly mean a few more people could duo, which they cant without a shammy for the most part now.  Pallies can stun, SKs can slow.  <br />
<br />
Absolutely, totally, useless for class balance however.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">So it does absolutely nothing to improve our tanking ability and you completly missed the point. <br />
<br />
Actually Brael, it is you that missed the point. While I agree there are tanking issues, and I understand that those who play/ raid in higher levels having needs for some type of &quot;quick&quot; damage mitigation ability, it is not ALL about the top end game.<br />
<br />
There are many people who solo, many people who hunt with 1 or 2 friends, there are many people who group with unbalanced groups. I know many people who fit into this category. And guess what, we pay our fees to SOE just like you do.<br />
<br />
I want to see improvements to all aspects of the game, not just the high end tanking / raid game.<br />
<br />
EQ is NOT a solo game. If you want to spend your time soloing, go play diablo 2 or something. Asking for solo improvements will either change nothing (the good result) or be a detriment to the class (in which case I will hunt down and murder the person who suggested it). <br />
<br />
Wrong Slein Jinn. EQ is about alot of different things. Why do you think SOE in the description of each class actually states that some classes are better in group settings and some are better as soloists. In fact, it even says Shadowknights can solo to a limited extent. Do you really think SOE would want us to play a game from someone else? Do YOU think all the casual / soloist / small group issues should be ignored so more of the player base leaves.<br />
<br />
I agree that tanking is an issue. I understand that. However, very few of you cannot see outside of your limited &quot;I need a raid role&quot;, &quot;I need tanking help&quot;, I need Defensive&quot; box.<br />
<br />
Nocifer seems to be one of the ones that actually DOES try to see things from the casual players objective AND from the raiders objective. This is one of the reasons that I would NOT want Slein or Brael as a correspondent. You have shown time and time again that if it ain't about the raiding / tanking / offtanking game, you are all against it.<br />
<br />
In case you did not realize, SK's are designed to be multi-faceted. (of course the quality of the design is another discussion). We could use some tweaks t our tanking, we could use some tweaks to our DPS, we could use some tweaks to our spells, we could use some improvements to our raid focus, and we could use some improvements to our small groups and solo abilities.<br />
<br />
If all you want to do is say...tanking, tanking, tanking....perhaps it is YOU that should go make a warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">We don't see out of the raid role box because its the only one we're broken in.  Thats great you want to push the non-raider agenda, but in all honesty we're overpowered already outside of GoD (wonder why all this talk comes up conveniently as guilds push into God?).  The only buff to lower tier SKs that would receive any support from me is an across the board change in innate mitigation to separate classes into tanking tiers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">I've read all the posts but over several days and not in one sitting -- and although I should stay out of it because I don't play the same game as the majority, I do like the idea of a low lvl slow/haste tap and it being useable at several points in the game, not just my low/mid level.<br />
<br />
If used as a pulling or tagging tool and it's not a serverside recourse thingie but an actual debuff, I can't see the harm in it.<br />
<br />
- if playing in a xp group with no slower, it's to our benefit.<br />
<br />
- if it aggros the mob as much a real slow does, it's to our benefit when tanking as an aggro tool.<br />
<br />
- if the suggested slow tap lands while we are pulling/tagging/tanking before the real tash/malo/slow lands, we have a better chance of surviving theoretically until then, don't we?<br />
<br />
I know I'm not seeing something here and it'll undoubtedly be pointed out to me why &quot;it won't fix us&quot; but even though I have read the previous threads, I don't see how it can hurt even at high end or what we'd stand to lose if we get this and lose something else.  On a simple level (coming from a simple fellow) I can't help but seeing it increase our survivability even at high end (of course I can only imagine high end based on what I read, not what I have experienced).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">It wouldn't &quot;hurt&quot; anything directly, but there's simply a limit to how many upgrades/fixes we can get.  There's a limit to how many new spells you get in an expansion.  There's a limit to how far SOE will go when &quot;fixing&quot; a class.  There's the fact that it will be used by other classes to argue against other changes.  <br />
<br />
A slow tap wouldn't hurt anything if you look at it in a vacuum, but it wouldn't help much either.  It's not worthwhile to push for something that's not needed, would help us primarily where our class is already fine, when there are other serious issues.  <br />
<br />
There's no precedent for it anyway - sure it'd be &quot;nice&quot; to have, but can anyone give me a single valid reason why we should?  It'd be nice to have a lot of things, but the list of things we should get is alot more limited.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
Sks need more utility.  That is not ALL they need, no, but they DO need it.  Paladins, warriors, and hell even RANGERS have more utility than an SK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">If we got that, we'd be getting it instead of the needed tanking fix.

<br />
Slowing and pre-slowing is already done by four classes; there is no real reason SK's should be added to that list.  There's no precedent for it in the SK class, it wouldn't be amazingly useful, it's a part of other classes' role - not a role we've got any history of having a share of.  <br />
<br />
SK's who keep insisting we should have a &quot;haste tap&quot; need to follow the SK's who want SK's to tank worse than Paladins off of a bridge.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">Croaak.. I understand what Brael/Slein is in. Anything that is REALLY broken needs to fix FIRST thing before any nice, extra tools come to us. Right now, real broken mechanics for knight is actually in high end area that surely need a fix right away. That's why they are putting off anything that can be useful to most of us to get broken mechanic fixed first so they and some serious gamers can progress good.<br />
<br />
I'm sure that raising cap to 70 would help knight to survive thru GoD trial better but the gap would still get bigger and bigger as pal/warrior hit 70 as well. We just need scalability of spells (Stun is scalability for example) and better defense.<br />
<br />
Slein,  We live in MMORL right now.. There are soooo many people who likes to group, raid (war), solo, etc. There is nothing wrong for some RL people to be very anti-social, YET, they are part of MMORL.. There are murderers, YET, they are part of MMORL. Couch Potatos who watch TV all day/night and screw any friends who are still part of MMORL.  MMORPG isn't any difference. ;) I played 2 other MMORPGs (UO and Gemstone3) and there are plenty of solo opportunities there and they do have better solo system over EQ and they are still CALLED MMORPG and they are older than EQ. <br />
<br />
Remember, NOT everyone have same time frame and duration per day. For example, I can play 4 hours one night and only can play 1 hour next night. I can group up for 4 hours. NP. but next day, only have 1 hour. What do I do? I just solo and grind out some yellows into AA so I can progress myself to keep myself in-shape with others than being left out in the cold. If I'm a cleric, I would be screwed unless I do trade work. Thank god for SK class. ;) LOT of EQ subscribers have ODD schedule and they surely have some need to solo sometimes. Heck, I do like to solo sometimes even for hours just for the enjoyment to kill things on my own just for fun without anyone's help.  I just like to see EQ to improve solo, duo, trio, xp group, small raid force and big raid force mechanics equally good to meet most audience's needs EVERY expansion. That would be a win and a good way to keep player base reeled in instead of appealing to certain section of audience then switch to other certain audience every expansion that only piss off some groups. <br />
<br />
One of reason why I picked SK 5 years ago is that I knew I could solo with SK, due to its description and I looked at its potential future based on its spell line-up, sometimes during my busy RL schedule and I can use EQ to &quot;smoke&quot; and a nice relaxation to my mind from RL busy schedule sometimes and I can keep improving SK class to keep myself in-line with my guildies to spend time with them in xp groups sometimes as well rather than falling behind and hardly group with them anymore cuz I'm too lowbie or whatever. <br />
<br />
BTW, I have seen the push for haste/slow tap for several years by SK community so far. :) Dunno if its a dead horse cuz SOE didn't give it to us long time ago when it was more useful (BST wasn't in existence and bards weren't that good during early stage of EQ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>scpio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">with the recent changes to XP and how its gained solo is all but dead for any class. hel even the druids and necros i know hate to solo now becuase its just not worth it. the only ones who will solo are bards and maybe realy bored ench.<br />
<br />
giving us a &quot;new solo tool&quot; will further our problems not fix them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">Ha, Soloing is not dead. I still grind out 1 AA per 1.4 hours in POTactics (Yeah Im not flagged for PoFire. ;( ) and I think 1 AA per 1.5 hours is still viable cuz if I do LDON, I get about the same AA rate in full group (remember, I'm not in uber guild group for quicker kills for HARD).. <br />
<br />
Even before the change of XP, the nerf is SMALL for 1 person and no change for 2 person set-up (wtg 2boxers). I used to kill Diako warrior for 7% per kill but now about 6% per kill. That nerf wasn't that much for 1 person.. However XP change surely helps full group big time in xp as trade off. That was a great trade-off I believe and encouraged people with enuf time duration to group instead of going solo. Before XP change, people like druid/necro etc used to have long hours per night preferred to solo but now they prefer to group cuz group xp set up is now viable alternative to solo. They still can solo for good xp but they prefer to group instead cuz it offers about the same but a little slower than solo but it's more acceptable for them now. Before the change, solo xp was too much of a benefit for them than group couldn't so they reverted to full soloing. <br />
<br />
Heck, I have heard some people grinding out 1 AA for less than 1.4 hours easy SOLO. I still had seen many people soloing or duoing in EQ when I see them in EQ. Again, Soloing route is not dead. It's just that group xp is now viable alternative way to get xp.</div></div><hr />
