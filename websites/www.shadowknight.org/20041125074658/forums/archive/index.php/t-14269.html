It would be VERY nice if we had that same ability applied to what's in our bank.<br />
<br />
I'm constantly putting stuff in there that I really have no idea what they're for.  After a while the unknown stuff adds up, especially when you have 160 slots with bags.<br />
<br />
Every once in a while I go through the questionable items and look them up one-by-one while playing or write them all down to look up later; to see if they will be kept or destroyed.<br />
<br />
This gets pretty old after awhile and takes a considerable amount of time.  If we had the ability to dump the bank content info to a file, even if it was just the item name, it would be a great time-saver.  For me, anyway; (but I'm sure I'm not alone on this one).</div></div><hr />
