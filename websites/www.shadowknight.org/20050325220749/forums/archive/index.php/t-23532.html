<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Powa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Currently Im looking to spend around $200 CND for a new video card, and im using ATI 9000 atm. Been looking for some and find that 9600xt series might be a good upgrade perhaps? I don't know much about video card so i think i should ask here.<br />
<br />
I've found an Raedon 9600 pro 256mb DDR for $132, here is the link:<br />
http://www.sapphiretech.com/vga/9600pro.asp <br />
<br />
It's made from Sapphire, can anyone tell me what's the difference between Sapphire brand and ATI brand? the cost of it is really charming. <br />
<br />
However, I do consider Nvida GeForce series as well, if anyone know of a good one please gimmie some advice. thx.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The 9600XX series seems to be on the compatible list for most of the upcoming games I'm looking at so that's the way I'm leaning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Culdahl1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You might be able to save a few bucks by going with a cheaper knock-off, but you stand a good chance at getting an inferior product.  Last knock-off I got was horrible and I couldn't get my money back.  I would suggest going with an nvidia card as they tend to be just a bit cheaper, which means you can probably get more bang for your buck.  Also, the last radeon I had (9800pro) overheated constantly so I took the whole PC back and got one with an nvidia.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Arikash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My 9600 128mb radeon card is amazing, never have any troubles with it.

There is a significant difference between the 96xx series and the 9800 series.  9800 blows the rest away.  My 9600 is sitting in a box in my closet.  Need to ebay it already</div></div><hr />

Make sure its the xt or the ultra, and not the reg fx or the pro from ati. Pull up some comparisons between them and youll be happy. I think i got my fx 5700 ultra for 169$ almost a year ago and the damn thing still costs that much, but i would have went with the 96ooxt as it has the new shader on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Oagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">With the amount you're spending, you probably won't encounter this.  However, I recently decided to upgrade my card, and decided that I'd go all-out, and bought a BFG 6800 GT (OC), thinking that it would kick ass.  However, I never got to find out, because my power supply was insufficient to run the damn thing.<br />
<br />
My lesson learned from this is, next computer I will build or have built for me.  Proprietary components suck, when you try to upgrade.  Plus, you will save a ton of money.</div></div><hr />

Alot of people think just cause it has 256 mb its ok, but just pull up some frame-rates on some games like halo and max payne and compare them to the fx 5700 ultra or 9600xt and look at what a difference there is. Alot of people buy the pros because it the only thing offered at places like wal-mart or bestbuy, and they charge about 100$ extra, its such a rip off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Naubi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">look at the 9600xt or the fx 5700 ultra. <br />
<br />
isn't the 5700 a better card than the 9600 radeon (I always heard the 9600 radeon was pretty poor).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Assazzin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">correct. <br />
<br />
The 5700 is better than the 9600, but they both suck to be honest. The Ultra part and the xt are the most important aspect of the cards. The Ultra part is the overclocking of the card, plus a other features like shader and such, same with the xt.  Im not an expert, but this is my understanding.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Assazzin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">9600XT (128Mb Version):<br />

<br />
Some will say core speed &gt; pipes( like myself) but others say Pipes&gt; core speed, so id go with the best price you could find.  I would add that saving cash now might be a good choice because comming this spring the PCI express cards will lead to alot of graphic changes in games comming out and youll just have to upgrade again. The card you buy now will likely last you into the fall or maybe winter of 05, but thats about it for new gmes comming out. A PCI express card will likely last for 3 years. IMO Good luck either way=D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Arikash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Or you could go all out and get the 800X one or whatever</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Oagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Maximum PC mag just used the x800 as the card in their &quot;money doesn't matter build your own PC&quot;.  Mid-range used the 6800 Ultra.  Price is the same for both, but it appears that the x800 is the top card out there right now. Bang for the buck, I think ATI puts out a better product for the money.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Culdahl1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Well the nvidia recently got the nighest benchmark for 3DMark5 link (http://www.xbitlabs.com/news/mainboards/display/20041027142512.html) but buying a good vid card isn't the only step to making a game run smoothly...you need the best drivers and other equall high end hardware like ram, MOBO, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Arikash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">1024mb of ram, and you should be set for a bit I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Culdahl1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">To be honest, there is no machine out there capable of running EQ2 lag free....EQ2 leaks ram at an insane rate and no machine can run it wide open without lag.  I recently upgraded my vid card from an nvidia 5200 to an nvidia 6800GT (O/C BFG)....sure the quality is far better now, but the performance boost was minimal at best.  I still get lag in most zones and queynos is lag hell....now, my PC isn't top-o-the-line, but it's up there (AMD 3500+, with 1024 3200 RAM, 600FSB, 6800GT vid card, with latest MOBO + vid card drivers).  1gig of ram will help if you're running around 512 or less, but going over 1 gig won't do much....A better vid card will help the quality a bunch (the way the game looks), but it won't help performance much.  Best suggestion - upgrade just enough to run the game and wait a year or so for the hardware to catch up with the software before making any huge improvements.<br />
<br />
edit - if you do decide to go with a high end vid card, go with the 6800GT...you can overclock it to be almost equal to a 6800 ultra (and X800) but at a much lower price.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>nezzka is sexy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">read some reviews on halflife 2, and the 9800 would NOT run it like a comic book, people are running it with a geforce4 ti, and getting decent frame rates, 9800 pro would run it fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Arikash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">HL2 runs amazing with my 9600xt, only just after I zone, or blow up an entire wall of barrels.  I think the settings are on high also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Culdahl1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I think EQ2 is probably worse then HL2....of course HL2 is more graphics intensive, but EQ2 uses an insane amount of virtual memory.  I've had low virtual memory warnings several times running EQ2 at med-high settings and I have 1024 RAM....though I have upped the amount of virtual RAM space on the HD to help correct this problem.  I'm getting around 5100 benchmarks on 3dmark5 which is about twice what you can get from a 9800pro and I still get insane lag at times with EQ2.</div></div><hr />

Listen to Culdahl1, he knows what he is talking about. I run a computer company myself, so I sell the stuff, and I know a bit too.<br />
<br />
Bottom line is this ...<br />
<br />
If decide ATI is for you ... go with X700 for mid range card, around $200US or go high end and get an X800.<br />
<br />
If you decide Nvidia is for you ... got 6600 for mid range, around $200US or go high end and get a 6800 at the least or 6800 GT if you can afford.<br />
<br />
Don't even consider any older generation cards ...<br />
<br />
Nvidia 5xxx = They all suck now based on performance you get for the cost (at least half the speed of the new cards or slower)<br />
<br />
ATI 9xxx = They all suck too. (at least half the speed of the new cards or slower. I know the 9800 &quot;used&quot; to be good, but the new cards I listed above are WAAAAAAY so much better, for the price)<br />

<br />
That should be your guide!!!<br />
<br />
If you want my opinion ... I just bought an Nvidia Geforce 6800. No, not the GT, but I bet I will be able to overclock my 6800 more than your GT Culdahl1!!!<br />
<br />
Plus the Nvidia card drivers are just better than ATI's and Nvidia supports Linux, and ATI doesn't. I would love to buy from a Canadian company, since I am Canadian, but ATI just doesn't do it for me, for technical reasons!<br />
<br />
Hey Culdahl1, how about a AMD 4000 with a SLI Nvidia 6800GT in January?That should solve your lag issues in EQ2!!!!!<br />
<br />
Good luck in your purchase!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Culdahl1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Nafarious,<br />
<br />
I've actually played around with this issue a bit more and have found that more RAM may be greater then anything else in improving the performance of EQ2 (I know I said previously that this wasn't the case, but whatcha gonna do:-).  It seems EQ2 is leaking RAM every time you zone and not refreshing the RAM it has already used, which causes the amount of RAM used to grow the longer you play.  I tested this by turning off my virtual memory and got much better performance out of the game (well until I ran out of RAM and the game shut down:-)....Once the RAM starts to get used up, the PC turns to virtual memory which is god awful slow cause it's reading from the hard drive.  Only way I can think to improve this is to get a seperate high speed HD (10K) and dedicate the VM to it alone or put about 2+ gigs of RAM in your system, shut off VM and hope you don't use up all the RAM.  BTW, I ctrl+alt+del'd to task manager in game to check my memory usage (when the game started running poorly) and found that I was using 900,000 physical memory and 1,800,000 virtual memory, which is utterly insane....but when I first log in, I use 300,000 physical and 300,000 VM (for EQ2 alone that is).<br />
<br />
So, a new vid card probably isn't going to fix performance issues unless you upgrade all your hardware, but a good vid card makes this game look far better and, IMO, is worth the $.<br />
<br />
Edit - I O/C'd my vid card to about where a 6800 ultra would be (410mhz 1100mem) and only got about 200 extra on my benchmark and minimal, if any, difference in game and since I have only the 2 stock fans on the 6800GT, I decided to stick with 370mhz 'cause I don't want to piss away $350, especially considering BFG offers the best warranty in the business(lifetime unless o/c'd):-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Sounds like EQ2 is a buggy piece of shit in that case (surprise, surprise), and I won't consider even thinking about it until they fix that garbage.<br />
<br />
5700 Ultra/9600xt are decent cards for the money, but 6600 GT or 6800 series, or the new ATI lines are better (and the 6600 GT ain't that expensive either).  6800's require a good power supply (350+ watt recommended, although I'm doing ok with a 300, mileage may vary) and it's own molex power connector.... be aware of that before you buy.</div></div><hr />
