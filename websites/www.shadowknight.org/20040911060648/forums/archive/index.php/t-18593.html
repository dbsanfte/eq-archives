<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hudroponik_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, i cought a lot of crap later on for still not completing my epic at 65 .. alot of &quot;its crap why finish?&quot; or &quot;the epic sucks, your wasting your time and effert , theres way better out there&quot; ..... ahhh .. yeah ok<br />
<br />
One thing to remember is this epic is very time consuming.  Anyone still doing it past 60 , KEEP GOING !  Any shadowknight that gives any of the above reasons for not doing the epic is a slacker.  Even if they were to start it after 60 (start from step 1) it would take 1/2 the time it would have taken to get to the end , atleast they can solo most of it in one or 2 days.<br />
<br />
I finally finished and all i get is &quot;holy shit, link that epic bro&quot; on mith marr cause the SK epic is 1 in a million these days, im sorry to the slackers that its not sold in bazaar ... /grin.  <br />
<br />
This post is a little flame on those that dont want to do it.. fine dont do it, no one cares, but leave those alone that want to actually finiah something in everquest.  I know when i started my SK i was all about the epic, and i know you (you as in those that think epic isnt worth getting) wanted it to.<br />
<br />
to sum it up :  <br />
anyone still trying, dont give up. let those that talk crap about it run to the bazaar and wield thier Argent Protecters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Oberyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">....I haven't had any desire to invest the time (in short supply), or the effort (unguilded, therefore a pain organizing the people), in the epic.  At this point in MY game, it would sit in my backpack, or come out for bragging rights only.  I've got enough shit in my packs atm, thx.<br />
<br />
HOWEVER, that said, I would never hack on someone for wanting to finish theirs, and understand it.  Kudos for those with the time, friends, and patience to complete it.<br />

I have been working on my epic for over a year now and FINALLY got it the other day. Right after I get it someone tells me that it sucks because it doesnt have +100 hp on it. FUCK HIM!!!! I love this fricken sword. I dont care what anyone says. The proc is so great, with Boon and shammy buffs it procs a TON and I dont have to get healed as much! Not to mention I had like 50 people ask me when I was walking in PoK to stop and let them wak off to the sword! :D <br />
Well, thats my opinion, and if ya cant take, Ill just jam Innoruuks unholy blade up yer ass! Laters<br />

BTW: I could only play on weekends and holidays, that didnt stop me though! Got the hide on second Hate raid. Soul Leech/Blade of Abrogation for MQed with me, (nice SKs *snicker), and everything else I raided for. Final fight was done with 4 65s from Club Fu, and me. Cleric, Shaman, SK, Warrior. We kicked his ass.</div></div><hr />

Your name is &quot;Hudroponik&quot; and you have the audacity to call other people slackers?<br />

Jeebus, you really are high.  <br />

Oh, and when your hippie friends find out you support the corporate machine that is big imperialist japanese business AND that you're trying to supress people's right to free speech, they are so not taking you to the commune with them....<br />

It is crap compared to what I'm using.  For me it is a waste of time and effort.  <br />

<br />
Riiight.  I can understand you want people not giving up, but piss on you if you call me a slacker =P.<br />
<br />
Reasons not to do my epic<br />
1) its not an upgrade (41/31 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;40/45)<br />
2) forcing guildies and friends to farm old content is annoying<br />
3) dont want to live in hate<br />
<br />
Reasons to do my epic<br />
1) it looks really friggin cool<br />
<br />
/shrug <br />
<br />
Im already working on flagging, spirit wracked cords, coldain ring and shawl, secret of the planes and getting all my trade skills to at least 200.  Ive done emp key, vt key, and the eyepatch of plunder.  Yup im a slacker -_-<br />
<br />
But grats on youre epic, it is pretty sweet looking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ganaith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Its status. I still occasionally use the epic ust because it looks cool. also makes for a nice group entry, dark knight wielding the Ic. <br />
<br />
Of course, right after that entry, i bag it and use my GSH. but anyways..<br />
<br />
<br />
It was worth every minute of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>yuggoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I wield my epic as a service to all those who have not seen an IC before....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shintou Shinai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">All RP stuff aside.<br />
<br />
I use it because I like being different. I'm not in an Uber Raiding PoT guild, nor do I want to be in one. The sword is good enought for the content I'll probably see in EQ, I dont have this burning spike up my ass telling me to &quot;GET UBER, DO IT NOW&quot;. I play for different reasons. That, and it looks damn cool, it also happened to be an Upgrade for my Gimpy ass as well.<br />
<br />
..that all aside, I still think Epics should have a slot 5 augment space to go along with the slot 4.<br />
<br />
As for content and stuff, most of the Epic can be done with one party. If you are about level 55ish or something and you want a break from sitting at the zoneline in the Plane of XPPharming, take your group out and acually go on a Quest for some of this stuff. I mean you're still getting EXP so what is the big deal.</div></div><hr />

I spent 4k at bazaar got 26 dam 22 delay weapon<br />
then spent my time getting eyepatch 20% extra haste<br />
Chardok ring 25 pts DS (5 20 min charges rechargable)<br />
earring of solstice FT1 (5k)<br />
Almost spirit wracked cords AOB<br />
The 50 pt life tap aug from ldon<br />
<br />
All in less time and much less fuss for my friends At lvl 54 .<br />
<br />
But it is a novel concept that the person that assembles more power in less effort is a slacker =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Aelali</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I don't think I would call anyone that isn't working on their epic a slacker... I personally hate when people tell others what they should or shouldn't have gear wise... suggestions are ok, but when you do the &quot;You're crap because you don't have item_03&quot; I find it very offensive. <br />
<br />
Now, that said, I would never tell anyone to get thier epic, that's always a chioce of the person playing, if you want to go to the bazaar and buy a windblade, that's cool, but personally I would take Inny's Curse over most 2hsers I've seen, not all, but many especially ones you can buy, but that's my preferance. Yeah, the /tell &quot;Damn dude, wtf is that sword, link it plz&quot; is cool... the sword is badass looking and most people agree that it's one of the, if not the coolest looking epic, but all in all, it's better than what many people think. Ussually when people ask if me if they should do it I'm honest and say that it's long, and many SKs don't complete it, but if you want to, go for it.<br />
<br />
Yeah, it's a 40/45 weapon, but when you factor in the proc, and haste, not to mention the stats that are on it it's much better than weapons that are &quot;upgrades.&quot; I recently added a lifetap proc augment to my epic that's the 50 point life tap, and combined with the aug, the normal epic proc, and Shroud of Choas I combat heal pretty well. It would take something really good to get me to drop Inny's curse into a bag... probably uber Elemental or Time lvl 2hser to do so, and I'm not sure I would overly get the chance to get one of those weapons.<br />
<br />
<br />
Honestly though, I think they need to fixed the SK epic, there is no reason that the Hate drop should be so hard, the rest is fine (or at least not too overly bad), it has a good storyline IMO, but they either need to A: up the drop rate of the hide wuite a bit, or B: add a named drake that spawns in Hate similiar to the Hand of the MAestro that has a specific spawn time, always drops the hide and takes 2+ groups to kill (make the spawn times something like 3days -&gt; 1 week or so) which I would think would be the prefered way to fix it, as well as get other people interested in our epics, maybe adding some other loot that it drops too. There is a big lack of &quot;this mob is up, I need help killing it&quot; type events (you know, like klling VS, or the broken golem) in the SK epic, most of it is being on a raid for someone else and hoping that while you're there the piece you need drops.<br />
<br />
On another personal note, I think epics should be imroved in some way to make it more worth using in general, have them the only non-LDoN stuff with multiple aug slots... make epic only sugments slots that you can quest epic specific (and epic only) augments... etc It would definitly be great too see Inny's Curse and the Greenmist with a type 4 slot, a type 5 slot and maybe a type 3 slot (or if that's too overpowering a type 1 or type 7 slot)<br />
<br />
For those of you that are working on Inny's Curse, kep going, no feeling in the world is better when you do that last turn in and you start at the epic for the first time in your inv saying to your self &quot;Holy shit, I actually got it.&quot; For those of you that don't go after it because of various reasons, do what works for you, that's what it's all about.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Nycathis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Now I may be seeing the world through Rose coloured skulls, but there is something Id like to say concerning the epic:<br />
<br />
Im finding it the BEST weapon that I have in my arsenal bar none!!!<br />
<br />
I have a Great Staff of the 4 Winds and a Greater Storm Watchers Horn and frankly Im finding that the epic owns them for DPS. The secret is that the speed is JUST right for casting spells between swings plus you can add a bit more DPS by bashing.<br />
<br />
The Proc goes off on adverage at least twice during a fight and thats me at 178 Dex - much more often at 280 (my current max)<br />
<br />
Initially when I turned up at a number of mini raids I was told nice toy put it away but after them people had no problem with my wielding the Kunark era epic in PoP content.<br />
<br />
So if you can do this quest - DO IT - you wont regret it!!!<br />
<br />
( this is a unpaid political advertisment put forward by the &quot;you are a Slaka if you think you dont need your Epic&quot; )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Yaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I just completed my epic finally after starting to collect darkforge so long ago in the Feerrott at level 36, not to mention the Amstaf Scroll I got at lvl 20.  I had been working on this thing for quite some time.  I'm going to weild this thing all over the place for all to see.  I lost all my Corrupt Ghoulbane pieces to a bad Soul Leech MQ a while back so I was distrought and I KILLED Duriek for doing that to me.  I came back again though and got it done. (see sig)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Fedarov</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I have my epic, It took me an age to complete and i did it with no MQs and i am proud of that......BUT.....<br />
<br />
remember this, different people want different things from EQ if they dont want there epic, they dont want it thats fine by me. My reason for getting epic is that for me it was in the game to be gotten, the storyline was cool, and it is a good wepon that was attainable by me while PoP content was out of my reach. I actualy thought i would replace it quite quikly with something else but here i am still weilding it. <br />
<br />
Young one, you cannot fathom how long it has been since I breathed air and felt flesh on my bones. I told you i would show you a weapon that would make you the most powerfull of your kind. I said nothing of giving it to you. Feast your eyes on innoruuk's curse mortal, Thank you fo your service.<br />

Sick sick sick thing to do. The above text earned lhranc a Butt whooping of monumental proportion, 48 people turned out to see fed get his epic and it almost brought a tear to his one good eye :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Avixious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I had the luck to see the epic on a GM before anyone had one. My god it looked sweet back then, still does.</div></div><hr />
