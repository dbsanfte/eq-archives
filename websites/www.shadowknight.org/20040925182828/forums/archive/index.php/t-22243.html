no need for tricks to beat it really.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ugh. How about not being such a pompus ass? I'll go way out on a limb here and guess that you've beat that event in all its incarnations and have now deemed it to be &quot;gimp&quot;, thus minimizing the accomplishment of anyone else doing it after you?  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lovamoor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You are quite right Malagen. <br />
That's the price payed by the first guilds beating events. We get (too) proud of what we manage to beat and get frustrated when the events are retuned (generaly down) for the &quot;masses&quot;, enabling them to progress with less dedication to the game. <br />
Call us what you want but those who beat the first versions of most events are entitled to get more self-estim and pride. Well, that's my point of view. <br />
We beat a hard event = we are proud of ourselves. Sorry for this natural human reaction of egocentrism. <br />
It doesn't make us better than the others, it just shows our dedication to &quot;beating the game&quot;.</div></div><hr />

maybe im fucked up or something, but intuka and killing hp in txevu is some of the most fun ive had playing eq in quite awhile. <br />
<br />
Note: the clearing portion of that zone can kiss my ass, i hate that shit</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">How can you be asking for spoilers in inkuta?  Funnest zone you'll find in GoD enjoy what you can out of it (too bad they nerfed Noquifel :/).</div></div><hr />

<br />
shucks, I was wrong about you all along</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Rueeliar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">How'd they nerf Noq?  I took a break so probably didn't get to see him until after the nerf.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">A Msha could kick his ass</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The reason people get flamed for asking for specific spoiler information here on SK.org is that for a lot of people figuring out events is the most fun part of the game. By posting a spoiler, it can potentially ruin an encounter for someone who has yet to do it. <br />
<br />
It's not about preventing other guilds from progressing.<br />
<br />
The question is silly anyway, with a small amount of experimentation the poster can answer his own query.<br />
<br />
As far as Noq goes, he is still no pushover.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Rueeliar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Oh, so his melee didn't used to be a total joke like it is, now?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>vex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">All I asked if people thought being FD in the room made the event not consider you as one of the 5. I don't know really how that's a spoiler, but oh well. <br />
<br />
If you consider that asking a spoiler question, then how about weapons, noobs, spells, or just any questions in general.<br />
<br />
I can't believe the egos from people in guilds that are only one or two ZONES ahead of us. Big deal, so you beat Inkuta 2 weeks ago or whenever. The only thing that means is enough people liked GoD enough to log the fuck on.<br />
<br />
I better not answer any questions about Kelek. I'm way too good for that. BETTER NOT ASK HOW THE NOQ EVENT WAS CHANGED! WHAT ARE YOU THINKING??<br />
<br />
*quote* As far as Noq goes, he is still no pushover  <br />
<br />
SPOILER INFO THERE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Noq's easy for us :/ bet hes doable with 30</div></div><hr />

this amuses me so much.</div></div><hr />

it won't if you 'd be part of such hard working / dedicated guild</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Grumoor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Being egotistical about your &quot;accomplishments&quot; in a video game is pretty damn pathetic.  Unless of course you're being sarcastic...then it's kind of funny.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Considering how many people play EQ (what was it?  400k active accounts?) and how social it is, to be in the top 1% to beat/finish a particular point of progression warrents a bit of pride.  So what if its a video game.  Can you say you never felt good or a sense of accomplishment doing something in EQ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Zero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">It doesn't make us better than the others, <br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah it does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Qoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Uber Guild SK#1 says &quot; damn if i let know u too much..u might get over me and i would have nothing to show off in future &quot;<br />
Uber Guild SK#2 says &quot; they are easy ..u dont even need to think&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
basically u get all the kind of ****  remarks from people who throw alot and invests alot into this game..and for the stuffs they have and if u were to own em with half the committment of time u threw in , u gonna get flame badly<br />
<br />
Ego has conquered everything that these people trying to deem as fun but are goals which we lower or mid end guild trying to accomplish..</div></div><hr />

I am so beneath you being only in Inktuta.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">There are plenty of people that would have helped you in a private way with information if you are really stuck on the event, but this site has had an unwritten rule since its beginnings that new content is not spoiled here. <br />
<br />
And yes, even what you have written is spoiler info and should be edited out.<br />
<br />
It's not about preventing you from progression, it's about not ruining events for people that have yet to try them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Eatpeople</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">this site has had an unwritten rule since its beginnings that new content is not spoiled here. <br />
<br />
/em uses search feature to find section of unwritten rules.<br />
<br />
/em comes up with nothing<br />
<br />
/em finds it ironic that a &quot;no spoiler rule&quot; is on a site owned by Yantis.<br />
<br />
/em goes back to sleep.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Krudler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">If you're looking for a section of unwritten rules, I'm sure it's right next to the section of unspoken truths.  Unwritten rules are exactly that...not written.<br />

Here is an example of someone else being flamed for asking for &quot;spoiler&quot; information:<br />

Though you're right, it is pretty ironic that a &quot;no spoiler&quot; rule is on a site owned by Yantis</div></div><hr />

<br />
Made me laugh though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Mazzic D'Vainn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">It's a simple concept..you can ask someone about an event.  Maybe you're stuck and need a fresh perspective.  That can be given in a PM or somthing without spoiling the entire event.  Also, it can be done in PM as not to tip people off to what they are going to be encountering in the future.  Because, believe it or not, there are people that like going head long into new content not knowing what they are in for.<br />
<br />
<br />
Lastly, just because the site is owned by Yantis doesn't automatically make all the people that frequent the board scum bags or Sell Outs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>nezzka is bad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">haha your only at inktu'ta, wow. o_O you need to cancel your account because that shit was nerfed to fucking shit and you have no pride if you try to get spoilers so just leave this site now, seriously.</div></div><hr />

Vex asked a very specific question, that could have been answered with a simple &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; by anyone who knew the answer.<br />
<br />
<br />
Instead people choose to wave their mighty virtual dicks and mention how proud of it you are because its sooooo enormous!<br />
<br />
Pafuckinthetic... :(</div></div><hr />

Hey.. I mean. RZ was pullable out of his pit at first... and the time wasn't capped at 15 minutes then either :p And there are other examples where content has been patched more difficult after some time, not easier. :D<br />

And Vex: New sig is sweet ;)</div></div><hr />
