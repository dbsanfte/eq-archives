<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>smoses799</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">okie, its been awhile since I completed the 1.5 epic.  I was wondering if anyone could list the steps from the completion of 1.5 to the end of 2.0 for me.  I dont need something extremely indepth atm, just good enough to use as a checklist.<br />
<br />
thanks for any help anyone can provide</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>smoses799</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">ive seen that one... its not compete.  I was hopin that someone would post the rest of the 2.0 quest</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Darktide</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Turn the orb and anchor into Filligno the Slayer.  This spawns a while con Minion of Lhranc, kill it and it spawns another.  Kill 3 total after the third Lhranc spawns.  Loot the essence and turn that along with IV into Filligno the Slayer to receive 2.0.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>smoses799</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">nice, thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thenger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Is that all that their is to epic 2.0?  Seems pretty straight forward to the 1.5 epic part.  <br />
<br />
Is their any other information that is needed on this part?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Xilerate</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">That hasn't been already posted yah.  Just the City of Mist fight, collecting the 3 pieces to make the Anchor, getting the orb from Anguish and the turn in inside RCoD to spawn Lhranc, turn the drop in with 1.5 and that's it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Szazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Has anyone handed in an IV with augs in it? Was curious as to what happens to the augments..or if he wouldnt recognize IV with the augs in it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">He'd recognize it, but you wouldn't get the augs back.  Plan ahead a bit and remove the augs before the fight.<br />
<br />
-Bolas</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I removed my augs before doing the final fight in RCoD. If it was like the NPC in PoK that gave you a permanent title (before they changed him), the augs have to be removed before you hand it in or they are lost.<br />
<br />
The final fight is a complete joke btw.</div></div><hr />
