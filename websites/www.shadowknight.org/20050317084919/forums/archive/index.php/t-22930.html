<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Deathfighter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am tired of joining and raid an going LFG for 15 minutes following the raid around. /GU SK LFG in raid pls. Sending tells to friends asking who in the raid has room for one more?? <br />
<br />
So after 10-15 minutes of LFG, Naturally I send a /tell to Raid Leader. Leader invite please. (this serves two functions: One is so that I can see who has room and send the group leader a tell. Two: It allows me to make a new group myself. <br />
<br />
Okay 80% of the time I find myself allow picking up others that are having troubles too. <br />
<br />
Example of why I get pissed: So now I have a group with a Shadowknight, Necro, Bard, Pally and a Warrior comming to join my group. 15 minutes later a Cleric friend of mine logs in and sends me a tell. I say YEAH I got room. Think to myself how perfect this has worked out for us. He gets COH to camp and joins me. Then he tells me the MA wants him to join there group. I think, Well we need you too. So the Warrior blows a gasket and starts /tell Guildleader to look. He don't have a cleric and he is the MA (This raid started an hour before I arrived and he didnt have a problem with the other 5 Clerics not joining him) He wanted my Cleric because he felt it would have the least impact on the raid make-up.<br />
<br />
Now the Warrior (MA) starts sending tells to the officers and asks the raidleader to move the cleric out of my group. Next thing I know the Bard has dropped. Before engage on our target was called I was left with a Necro and myself. <br />
<br />
I know I need to get out the KY and take it like a Shadowknight, But when people start calling other people names I have to get a bit disturbed. <br />
<br />
The Warrior isn't even a full time player yet he can get piss-assed about something and have it his way.<br />
<br />
I know damn SOE made the game focus around Warriors and Clerics but DAMN, it don't make the frustration any less.<br />
<br />
Ah well, Feels good to rant. Thanks for making this channel  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not a group of friends. Just know the Cleric. Does that make it right to let the MA (who isn't even the MT) take the class from my group.<br />
<br />
Also, If the MOB was so gimp that it was single Melee - I wouldn't we worried about a healer. But in this case it was not.<br />
<br />
/Sigh Its one of those things you would have had to been there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>kharan_zechts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Tanks need to be grouped with clerics on raids so they get healed quicker. Quit crying. Most of us go thru long raids with no healers at all sometimes.</div></div><hr />

So the MOb wasn't gimp and you didn't want the MA to have a healer?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Chayde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Why would you need a cleric, wouldn't they be in a CH-chain on the main tank anyway? And if they weren't, and each cleric was responsible for their own group, then if the other clerics were any good, they would have the raid window open, and click on the other people in groups without healers, and see who needs a quick heal.<br />
<br />
It happens, I have been the only cleric on a 5 group raid, and it didn't matter what group I was in, the main tank and main assist were always healed first, then when I saw things were going smoothly, I offered heals to the other groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Deathfighter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">So the MOb wasn't gimp and you didn't want the MA to have a healer?<br />

Ever been MA? You don't have to have a cleric in the group to keep you up.<br />

<br />
That's more of a healer than a lot of us get on raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Oberyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">...take it as a compliment.  Self-sufficiency is a GOOD thing.<br />
<br />
A prima donna warrior NEEDs a healer or ten.  You can survive.  <br />
<br />
Know what?  There's this little thing called &quot;tells&quot;.  You can still talk too...<br />
<br />
Best SK quote ever ----&gt;  &quot;I'm harder to kill than a cockroach&quot; <br />
<br />
Take it to heart.<br />
<br />
Oberyn</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Culdahl1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Two things from that post- 1) you're an SK and shouldn't need a healer unless you're a designated OT or MT...ever heard of LT's and/or leechcurse? 2) It seems that the newer raiding guilds tend to make the mistake of putting all the CH's into the MT's group.....the MT group needs one cleric to function for reasons already mentioned here, but it does a raid no good if all the DPS is dead due to AoE's because there was no one there to spot heal, not to mention if the CC dies as well....but, all in all, I would say that post was retarded.<br />
<br />
P.S. - Quit bitching about not getting picked up for raids fast enough either...you know how many raids I've had to sit an hour or more with LFG on to not get picked up because there are 90 people looking for 72 spots?  You're an SK that adds almost nothing to a raid if you're not part of the tanking rotation, be glad they LET you come, because any DPS class would be better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ashrai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Not getting into the raid immediately is nothing to do with your class and just everything to do with the fact that many of those 72 people are unable to keep up with scrolling chat, cybering the new wood elf druid app, and the wailing baby in the background that hasn't had its diaper changed since Kunark.<br />
<br />
Also, Ever Yelled in Raid or Guild - HEAL ME NOW !! - and waited?<br />
during an AE fight?<br />
<br />
Yes.   Now go to the rogue boards and complain about not getting heals during AE fights. Make sure you get a head start before they ram your many lifetap options up your ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Lejina Bloodbath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">First, if it's not done already, set a SK channel within your guild. Add in the paladins if you have very few SKs.<br />
<br />
When you log on a raid, ask in this channel which group leaders still have room. Those guys will obviously understand your situation and will point you who have room. You then can harass in tells the leaders who have open spots in their group.<br />
<br />
Second, start becoming friend with the druids and the paladins. For the last 5 years those classes have been the more likely to heal a SK in a non tanking role on a raid.<br />
<br />
From my experience, groups made exclusively of SKs and Paladins will survive trough just about anything, they are also a blast to play in and the constant bitching from the other groups when such group is formed is a nice plus too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ashrai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">What Lejina said. <br />
<br />
Our pallies and SKs all hang out in the same chat (with an honorary druid as well). When we arrive we ask who has room, they tell us, we send a tell to that group leader. Less headache for the raid leader. With the new function they can toss you in any group once you are in the raid. But at least getting into the raid means you can see necessary communication and such.<br />
<br />
It's rare you're going to see a cleric &quot;assigned&quot; to you and you alone unless you are the MA. 90% of the time when I'm saved from a purpleclub it's a druid that's kept me up. I spent over a year playing one in raid situations and I know from first hand experience in healer channels that the clerics have &quot;their&quot; Warriors that they keep an eye on. If a warrior asks for a specific cleric and that cleric alone there is a reason. They've spent so long working together that the cleric knows the Warrior's style and vice versa. <br />
<br />
Druids (and shaman) have come up from years of /assist healing and are perfect healers for tankmezzers and offtankers. I love having a druid in my group if at all possible. There's no fear they are in CH rot, and their heals are more nicely suited to the lower HPs of a knight. And when they do slap that fast heal on you, your superior agro ensures they live. Druids and SKs tend to naturally gravitate towards each other in this &quot;symbiotic&quot; type raid relationship.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Hemlocc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">thats deep /agree</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Deris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Yes, make friends with the other &quot;outcasts&quot;....<br />
<br />
Normally, I try to make my own group and always end up getting a pal or two, rogues and druids in my group and typically we survive every single AE fight (Paladins are &lt;3 on raids!!!)... extra bards are awesome too :).<br />
<br />
Stick together and you'll have one of the best raid groups ;P PAL/DRU are sublime on raids, screw clerics. Paladins also belong in chat with SK, since alot of the duties that we pull are similar, so you can coordinate between. Sometimes you can even make an OT channel, invite enc (unless you know which mobs cannot be mezzed) and go to town...<br />
<br />
Just invite whoever you got, and make the most of it... hell ive survived quarm fights on ranger heals alone. :&lt;</div></div><hr />

I always thought about having 6 SKS do a ldon together. Would be interesting and fun. Specially if each can double up the spells.</div></div><hr />

This made me laugh, because that's what I'd been thinking from the start....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Feriin Cydovu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Not sure about OoW content but on everything else if you can't get by in a raid without a group or without buffs you are doing something wrong.<br />
<br />
Yeah it's more likly you will die without buffs, but just try it once you might be surprised.<br />
<br />
P.S. semi-retired OoW took care of my addiction temporarily (I need to buy a new vid card at the least).</div></div><hr />
