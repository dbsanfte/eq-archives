<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Darko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So I picked up one of these bad boys last friday, and let me tell you, i hit like truck :D but the graphics on this weapopn is just pathetic.  <br />
<br />
The sword looks like a 1hander, and is totally unorginal looking, its really anoying that for 2 expansion snow sk/pal get shafted on their prime 2hander looks, and what i mean is GR in luclin, and now GoC in pop.  GR looked like a freakin coat hanger, and GoC is a butterknife, and btw the pallies agree http://pub148.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm13.showMessage?topicID=2283.topic<br />
<br />
So basicly to make this rant short, if a dev reads this please change the sword to look like something uber, all i ask is that its look reflects the stats.  And for all the other sk /feedback the f00k out of SoE plz.<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />

People will complain about anything...unreal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Drakonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It is a point of complaint no matter which way you look at it... that sword is a very damn rare drop (at least on VS), and for someone to get one after most likely waiting a very long time in hope, it would completely suck ass to equip it and find it looks like a cheesy 1hander that drops off Agnarr, who isn't even an elem god ...<br />
<br />
It's not like it's asking a lot for them to upgrade the graphic to something decent... Mith Marr sword or Seru Sword or something...</div></div><hr />

Dude, you got the best weapon in the game for your class, <br />
 <br />
<br />
Exactly, and all i ask is that its looks reflect that, rather than have it look like some peice of crap even a n00b like yourself can get it.<br />
<br />
And regarding its rarety, its the 1st GoC Valon has gotten so far, and we have been farming Time for a while now.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Drakonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Bertoxx far as I know, though I can't back that up with proof.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Darko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Dropped of bert.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nehvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Drops off Bert.  I whored one last night $<br />
<br />
I'm going to agree with Darko.  This weapon is the pinnicle of two-handers for paladins and shadowknights.  (not to mention rare as heck...1 in 10-15 Bertox kills...and he's a 5-day spawn)  As such, it should look special.  It should not look like some newbie's one-hander.  <br />
<br />
I think the graphic used for Seru's 'Sword of Truth' would fit the weapon perfectly.  I know that the reason the SoT graphic wasn't put on a melee weapon during Luclin was because it exceeded the acceptable poly count.  Too many of them in one place would cause frame lag.  But we're now at the end of PoP.  People generally have better machines and considering how rare the weapon is, there really isn't a problem of too many in one location eating the graphics power of lesser cards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i got to see one in game the other day, and yeah it does look stupid.<br />
Look at the 2hb from terris thule, it looks 300x's cooler then the GoC does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kaynin Shadowwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">So he gets the best weapon and complains? What the fuck!<br />

You can talk when you've put in the time and effort required to get one =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Drakonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">You'd be pissed too if you got the best weapon and anyone who looked at you thinks you're wielding some crappy 1 hander with no shield up...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The top weapons have always had the graphics of newbie weapons (the thing it looks like is off a sol ro mini btw not agnarr), anyways every expansion the old stuff gets an upgrade, you cant keep making stuff look better really, should the look on sword of rile reflect its stats? at one time it was the best weapon i nthe game... now i bet 90% of the people in eq wouldnt even use it it should have a great graphic to then, the same for those ntov 2h, etc... the graphics a bit small but oh well, take a vanazir if you dont like the look the two weapons are equal anyways</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Darko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">So just because in the past ppl have been screwed by the lazynes of SoE/VI developers doesnt mean the trend should continue.  And since particle weapons have become so common i dont see a reason why the best sk/pal weapon shouldnt have particles.  <br />
<br />
What it comes down to is, the look has to reflect the stats, it doesnt even have to be a new weapon graphic, use a sword thats already in game, just make sure the sword is 2handed and wikkid looking, i mean there are plenty of neat looking weapons out there, that black and red pally only scimitar (would have to be made bigger ofcurse its 1h atm), the 2h of Aerin'dar, emp sword, phf, rz axe, seru sword, mm sword, any one of the epic sword, etc.<br />
<br />
Not to mention that the 2hb animation is still f00ked so vanzir is out of the questions (plus no way in hell i am spending dkp on a vanzir when i alrdy got a GoC, also plenty of peeps in the guild could still use it as a big upgrade)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">And what model for it would you suggest?  Epic weapons and seru graphics are out since they wont use them, as are any weapon models god's use</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Darko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I named a couple in my earlier post :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Emp sword is the same as a level 55 pally quest weapon, people will bitch about that if it was changed to that, dont remember what aerin dar 2h looks like... but the graphic of a tier 2 mob, atleast sol ro is tier 3! thats a step down by the logic people use so... ya, nothing you suggested would work either</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">A'D 2 hander looks exactly the the Split Blade of Destruction from Glykus Helmir in Tactics, as I recall. You know, the one that all the warriors buy in the bazaar then sell because DPS is mediocre aggro for them?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Karnij</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">you know what brael your right choosing something that would make it look unreal is out of range <br />
<br />
<br />
how about this though why not make it have the same design except be alot freaking bigger, make it look like its a REAL sword 2hander worthy of time =\<br />
<br />
we have had 2 goc drop so far awsome sword looks arn't bad its just too damn small looks like a 1hs <br />
<br />
<br />
I would even prefer it to look like sews except black or something <br />
<br />
<br />
I dunno anything but wut it is currently<br />
<br />
peace guys</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Ya, I agree thats it's problem I think, it looks like a 1h, but for whatever reason they cant just enlarge the model...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">The pally sword is truths defender (tunare only) btw ;p<br />
Dreamers despair is really impressive looking,  i remember when my friend from our servers time enabled guild ran past me weilding it i thought &quot;whoa cool&quot; <br />
<br />
ive always really liked the graphic of the knight sword from tunare that im not even gonna try to spell cause im tired and at work.  it would be cool if it looked more like that maybe with a different color or changed the color of the gem on the hilt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Drakonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">the thing it looks like is off a sol ro mini btw not agnarr<br />
<br />
Same graphic as Double Edged Stormblade from Agnarr if I'm not mistaken... its a dual-weilder only 1hs.<br />
<br />
Either way, it wouldn't be so hard for them to put a little extra effort into a supposed &quot;ultimate&quot; weapon... they did in Kunark with epics, did they lose that spark of imagination some time between then and now?  Or are they just slowing caring less and less about EQ and more about EQ2?<br />
<br />
What about the other class &quot;ulimate&quot; weapons too?  Jagged Timeforged Blade has a unique look.  Darkblade I haven't seen so can't comment.  Cudgel/Hopebringer are copies of other graphics.  Time's Antithesis looks unique enough, only 1 other weapon with that look... etc etc.<br />
<br />
Maybe all their 3D Model artists quit?  Would explain why Time is full of mobs / gods using old graphics (Quarm being the only unique looking mob in the zone).  A revamp on all time weapon graphics (hell, armor graphics could look more unique too if they really tried) would be welcomed by all classes I bet...<br />
<br />
... But I guess they're too busy dumbing down the level 1-10 game to bother.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Bah, I just want some sort of uber sword that looks like a Dark Reaver.  Nice and simple, and evil.  Not to mention, it actually looks like a sword that could be used, as opposed to some weapons that are just completely unrealistic.  I know, it's a game, but I still like a little bit of realism to my weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Thats the thing about ultimate weapons, as soon as the next expansion hits they're not longer ultimate weapons... jtfb is the only weapon in time with a unique graphic i think, songblade is ifir, darkblade is bow, etc...<br />
<br />
Anyways, mob's in time looking the same actually makes sense if you pay attention to the story</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Drakonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">So they can't be imaginative enough to come up with new and bigger/better looks for the next line of Ultimate weapons in the next expansion?<br />
<br />
And I know the story makes sense that they mobs look the same, but if they wanted to spice it up some they could have made them look like they were more powerful than the older versions (considering they're powered up before giving all their power to the bond on Zeb when you fight them in Time).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Darkreapyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">should be like half pally/sk epic sk handle with fear bubbles and a red flame for the blade <br />

That would be the ugliest weapon in game.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sorry,I'd wear a helm like &quot;Choda Boy&quot; if it had nice stats (Not to mention his helmet fucking rocks) But only if the dildo swayed like a particle effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Drynnious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">it should be a big katana. Kind of like sephiroth's blade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>BrikBludgaard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I don't care if it looks like the &quot;biggest and &quot;baddest&quot; I would just like it to look &quot;unique&quot; or at least &quot;pretty cool&quot; and &quot;in character&quot; for that expansion.<br />
<br />
The fact it looks like a 1H sword and its name is GREATBLADE kind of bugs me.  The blade on the current model is anything but the implied...  the blade is a short 1H weapon even on a medium-size character for a 2H weapon.<br />
<br />
Suggestions:<br />
<br />
1) Keep the current model and scale it up to look like a 2H weapon.  The SEWS model also has a 1H look and a dagger look...  why does the Greatblade of Chaos look like a 1H?<br />
<br />
2) Drop the current model and use the 2H model of the Ornate Greatsword or hopebringer (the HB is a 1H version.. use the 2H version)<br />
<br />
3) Use ANY other model that looks pretty nice, and make it the 2H version.<br />
<br />
<br />
its all about style...  I don't think ANY other class would really care about what it looks like except the paladins who agree with us!<br />
<br />
Brik</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">sews was designed as a 2h then model shrunk to 1h size (and it looks stupid in 1h), 1h's you cant grow to 2h size really...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Darko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Brael,<br />
<br />
Your whole point for not chainging the graphic on the goc is that if the next &quot;best&quot; weapon comes out the GoC loses its title so it doesnt matter that it looks like crap now, but by that same tokken why do we ever get new graphics for anything? <br />
<br />
Hell we could all just have the default human male with no armor model for our chars, we could all wield fine steel swords, i mean the stats would stay the same but who cares about looks, when the next expansion comes out we gona get new weapons anyways.  All the mobs could be changed to 1 nps model too like orc panws, just make them vary in size, quarm would be a really big orc pawn, and moss snakes could be tiny etc.<br />
<br />
See the point is all that other extra artsy crap is nice, and its nice having a char that looks bad ass, and its nice to show off that bad ass sword you got after all that hard work.  And its also nice to get a game that despite good content looks cool after all we do pay them :D <br />
<br />
BTW last patch they changed the graphic of the bard dust ring 1hb, and they have made several changed to the cornirav hammer graphic as well, so i dont see how this request is not legitmate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Oh, it's legitimate... like I said though find a good graphic first</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Darko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Personaly id be happy with phf/emp sword/sword of truth/aering'dar sword but i am sure others may disagree, so maybe a new graphic is in order, after all monks/rogues/chanters/bst got new graphics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">They got PoP graphics which were reserved for time, I doubt theyll design a new graphic and put it in the game for GoC</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">maybe they could add a particle effect that looks like a stick of butter flying at the GoC and being cut in half</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">you see, it's flying into the blade.... although i suppose flying through the back and into the enemies faces would work, the butter is instead passing onto your bread or toast or whatever.<br />

i think cutting one stick of butter in half at a time is sufficient.<br />
i did that between two ldon missions. hehe.</div></div><hr />

It is plain and looks like a 1Her, very sad for a weapon called Greatblade of Chaos ...<br />
<br />
I hope some Devs happen to stop by and see this thread and realize it's not just a couple SK that don't like it's look, but alot of SK and Paladins also, and it's not like we are asking for alot (this time =P) ...<br />

&quot;Fine... You guys need a PAL/SHD time weapon that meets these specs... *grumbles* you got it, now what to make it look like... Ahhhhh, (insert evil laughter here)&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
The doublebladed sword model would work, I'd have no objection to that.<br />
<br />
The Ornate Greatblade model would work,  espically if they made it bigger.<br />
<br />
The Hopebringer model would work *if* they made it bigger.<br />
<br />
Even the current model would work *IF* they made it *MUCH* bigger.<br />
<br />
The biggest problem with this greatblade is there is nothing looks great about it.  I encountered another SK while wasting time in Veksar, he was talking to me and eventually did a /guildstat.  He said &quot;Why would a DH use a Luclin sword still....?&quot;...Ugh.<br />
