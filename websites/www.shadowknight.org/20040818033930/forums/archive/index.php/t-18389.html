<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>FreddyJones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm getting ready to start the quest for the Life Leech spell. Takes more than a few pp and tons of time. I was wanting to know if the good 'ol folks on SK.org had any thoughts. Is it worth it? If they have it do they like it? Alternatives to spell and ANY advice or tips. I've gotten the quest from Allakazam (sp?) so the HOW is down.... just not the other info.<br />

advice? hitch a ride on a vox raid to get the prickly pear.<br />
buy the white gold necklace in the baz.<br />
dont risk your gem on a masterjeweler with an gemcutter.<br />
The final battle is not hard in any way shape or form with just a couple of 65's to help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>FreddyJones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">That about summed it up.... <br />
<br />
Thanks for the advice. I have a few guildies lined up for this weekend. Should be 50 and actually be ABLE to get it later on tonight. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>XebarisTP</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It's well worth it. It has a permanent spot in my spell list even at 60, because of the faster cast time. If you need another lifetapped memmed, you or your group is doing something wrong.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>FreddyJones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I got the spell last week an i msut say i do love it....  Makes soloing easier.. less down time. Long refresh time, but goes by quickly. I almost use it more for the dmg.. lol   <br />
<br />
I so would recommend that you get this spell...  IF you can afford to go get it. <br />
<br />
Thank you all for your responses.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ravenar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Personally I have not used it except in Arnea battles since our Spear line came out; however, before then I used it quite often.  I never solo and my wife plays a cleric so maybe I am a bit spoiled in that faction.<br />
<br />
Worth it?  Sure.  Very few of our spells do I not use in some way or another.  In fact, I guess I had missed the fact that somewher down the line they added Cure Disease to our line up.  Interesting fact though was that this Diseaese cured some of the hardest planar diseases to cure.  *shrugs*  I am not complaining.</div></div><hr />

                 I spent the plat.I do a lot of dungeon crawling and soloing by myself.I did the quest at 51.The delf wont speak to you below that.I did the quest and bought all the items in the bazaar excepth the nodrop items in the quest.I got the pear everfrost with the help of a 65 mage in there screwing  around.I also killed the skeleton with the help of a 45 SK and a 65 BL.The mob conned yellow to me at 51 and BL held all of the aggro no probs.Make a long story short it is a nice spell,when mana permits and you are soloing,killing a lvl 7 mob for your HP is nice,and as long as you have KEI.The worst part of the deal was the plat,but looking back,well worth it.<br />
:D</div></div><hr />

<br />
i did it this way, and it eats the gemcutter. i payed the person i &quot;borrowed&quot; the gemcutter from the 1k. what a waste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Nugaruk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Is it worth it? If they have it do they like it? <br />
Yes, great spell, you'll love it.  Keep it memmed almost all the time still at 59.  Biggest tap for me still, and way faster casting than the others.  <br />
At the level I got it (think I was 52 maybe) I was soloing a lot and it made things way easier.<br />
<br />
Alternatives to spell and ANY advice or tips.<br />
Everything went smoothly for me until the last fight.  Was thinking...Rathe Mountains, how hard can this be...wrong.  One dead 57 mage and one 65 warrior chased out of zone later, I was laying there FD when luckily a 65 ranger with his wizzie bot came rolling thru, got aggro from the quest mob and beat it down for me.  (he stays up for a while, this was a good 20 minutes elapsed)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Aoninie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I think it may be good if you get it early. I didn't get it till about lvl 55. Didin't use it enough to make it worth the plat. I don't like to solo so I only had it memed if I had a crappy healer or if I was secondary tanking to do my own heals if I got hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ganodoar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Personally I think Life Leech is worth it but only if you get it at 50 (or 49 if you get a 50+ friend to get the spell for you). The quest is really fun and it's neat to go back to old school zones like Lower Guk, Sol B, and Permafrost. If you are a troll or iksar too it feels good to bash frogloks while camping the froglok noble in guk. 3k is a lot but beleive me you will come to a point in the game where 3k isn't too hard to make if you really try. Farming Hill Giants is a great way to make 3k, but only in the mornings if you can due to less competition. <br />

Life Leech will last you about 10-11 levels before Drain Soul takes over. Even then life leech can still cut it since Drain Soul has a long cast time. However, I find myself using leech less now but it is still in my spell book. It could have its uses perhaps until touch of volatis and inny come. <br />
<br />
As it has been pointed out life leech can be a life saver. There have been a few instances where Life Leech has saved my life. I do agree the recast time is annoying but 2 minutes goes by fast when you think about it. With KEI too you get the mana you lose back relatively quickly. <br />
<br />
Do the quest and you will realize how much fun it is. More fun to actually camp the stuff yourself though I can see why people wouldn't break down and buy the droppable pieces in the bazaar. Besides the quest NPC reminds me of Kurron Ni. Both send you out on a quest and end up backstabbing you in the end. So you could say Kazzel prepares you for the beginning of the epic (if you don't run seals that is).<br />
