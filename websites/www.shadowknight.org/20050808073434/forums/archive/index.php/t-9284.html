<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darklung</div><div class="date">12-14-2002, 11:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Quick simple question.. is this spell really worth the 15k+ that I see it going for on the Xev server? Have seen like 5 copies of it selling for anywhere between 15k and 18k, and finally saw ONE copy of Terror of Terris and it was selling for 2k.. doesn't make a lot of sense to me if rarity is the issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Groobash</div><div class="date">12-14-2002, 01:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think I've seen about equal numbers of the two spells drop. There's always some dope trying to sell stuff for more than its worth in bazaar...be patient. They seem to go for 1-2k on the Trib. There's not a lot of 60+ SKs, and these aren't butt rare spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darklung</div><div class="date">12-14-2002, 03:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thx good to know. I got Deathly Temptation for like half what these guys are asking for Voice of Terris... so I'll wait til I see a sane price.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trysbrina67</div><div class="date">12-14-2002, 03:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Voice of Terris is a good spell, you or the MA you cast it on will notice that it does help.  On raids im always keeping it up on our MA (not that they need much help with EB weapons but every little bit helps).  Pay no more than 3k for this spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dzenith</div><div class="date">12-14-2002, 05:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I memmed it when it first came out, but after some trials with it on raids, I realized that our tanks really had no issues holding agro in 99% of the encounters, so they never asked for it.  Since PoP I have actually had good spells to put in that spell gem so it hasn't been memmed, and so far the only time it has been asked for is to stealth buff someone in the guild for being a putz.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Groobash</div><div class="date">12-15-2002, 01:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I toss it on the main tanks pretty religiously now during big fights. Most of them remind me if I forget, so I guess they feel it makes a difference. It certainly doesn't hurt. <br />
<br />
The recast time sucks, but I'll cough up one spell slot if it means the difference between winning, or losing cuz some shmuck wizzie overburns.<br />
<br />
For yucks I also try to sneak it on various chanters/shammies/necros/whatever when we're clearing yard trash and stuff...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darklung</div><div class="date">12-21-2002, 11:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">3 copies for sale now on Xev, cheapest is 17k. Started out with one retard listing it at 20k, I don't think the others had any idea what to charge so just just went with 18k and 17k in order to undercut eachother. Either way, they're all going to have to wait a long long time before anyone I know will fork over that kind of money.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Esclava_Detristeza</div><div class="date">12-21-2002, 07:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Eventhough all the warriors in my guild have EB weapons, they still request VoT. So, I keep it mem'd at all times on raids in case I get asked for it. I'm hoping to get a copy of Voice of Thule for when I am level 65.</div></div><hr />
