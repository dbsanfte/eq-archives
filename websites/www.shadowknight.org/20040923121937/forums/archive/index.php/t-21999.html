<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kuvak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I searched but couldn't find this question answered, so I will ask. I know there is an NPC somewhere in the game that takes bags and gives you back a token, which you can then sell via the bazaar, then the buyer can go give him the token and get the same bag. Where is this NPC (what zone and where in that zone) and what is his name? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.<br />

She is located outside of the vendor area between the SH and Nexus side banks in the Bazaar zone.  Just hail her and you will know if you got the right person or not, as her text will tell you what to do.</div></div><hr />
