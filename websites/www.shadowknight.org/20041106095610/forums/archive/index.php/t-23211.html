Steve Harvey Revokes Eminem's 'Ghetto Pass,' Video Pulled From BET<br />
By Latisha Simmons<br />
Date: 10/12/2004 2:37 pm<br />
<br />
Michael Jackson called in on Los Angeles radio station 100.3 this morning (October 12th) to voice his disapproval of the new Eminem video for his song &quot;Just Lose It.”<br />
<br />
In the video, Eminem plays the characters of Jackson, Madonna &amp; MC Hammer and others.<br />
<br />
The video shows scenes of Eminem dressed as Jackson sitting on a bed with children jumping around him.<br />
<br />
With Jackson's recent troubles, the scenes are hitting a little too close to home for the King of Pop.<br />
<br />
&quot;I never had a problem with Eminem,” Jackson said during The Steve Harvey Morning Show.<br />
<br />
Harvey also voiced his disgust with the rapper.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eminem has lost his ghetto pass,” Harvey declared. “We want the pass back.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harvey said that he was displeased at the way Eminem chose to depict the black community.<br />
<br />
He added that rappers who are afraid to say something because they don’t want to jeopardize their own careers are &quot;cowards.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You [Eminem] apologized about the comments you made before about us being ni**ers and calling black women b**ches but we don't want your apology now&quot;, Harvey fumed.<br />
<br />
In a bombshell revelation, Harvey stated that Bob Johnson, Founder and CEO of BET has decided to pull the video from BET’s rotation and will not be playing it again.<br />
<br />
Johnson also called The Steve Harvey morning show and confirmed the video has been pulled from the BET airwaves.<br />
<br />
Johnson is expected to release a statement later today about this issue.<br />
<br />
Harvey also stated that MTV and VH1 should follow suit and pull the video as well. <br />
<br />
 I doubt MTV and VH1 will remove the video, but it would suck if they do.</div></div><hr />

I saw the video, and I've seen a lot of better parodies of Michael Jackson elsewhere. And it's not like Eminem's videos are very funny. It's the sort of funny that makes me wonder if he's trying to be a serious artist, or Weird Al with cuss words.<br />
<br />
Seriously, anyone who thinks Eminem is a good artist should hang themselves. Or better yet, pay some crazy Muslim guys to chop off their head on the Internet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have to disagree.  While Jackson is certainly fucked up and needs to be shot, the parents pimping out their own children seems much, much worse.  Jackson can use the excuse &quot;I have a mental problem.&quot;  The parents only excuse is greed.<br />
<br />
And even further off the topic:  Brael, everytime you do that it makes God cry.  :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, there goes everyone's head in the Rap/Hip Hop industry who still believe Eminem to be the best artist in their genre.  Not to mention the umpteen million's of people who bought his albums...wait gotta add in D12's as well...not to mention his next album due out in the first week of November, which will be #1.  That's a lot of people.  And his new album won't be popish...He does that shit to gain attention, to reel people in to buy his album.  For instance, with his band D12 they renamed their Purple Pills song to Purple Hills (and edited it) so they could play it on MTV, BET, hell I saw it on VH1, and also so it could be played on the radio.  Devil's Night then went on to the #1 spot on the billboard when the cd came out and was not popish at all.<br />
<br />
You may not think he is a good artist in terms of music in general but he is, and the best, at his genre and he's also a smart one.  Sorry but I have to stick up for him, like I had to do with the Pistons, who got no respect whatsoever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Arikash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Wrong, just because he makes a lot of money and has a lot of media attention does not make him the best in his genre, Blink 182 is not a better band than Dreamtheater, just because Blink 182 makes more money/ gets more media attention doesn't make him a better rapper than say Snoop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Cameela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Eminem has the game figured out. He makes fun of people, gets paid exorbitant amounts of money in the process, and is more well known that anyone here. I personally get quite a kick out of some of the stuff he does, its incredibly entertaining. And thats what he is, an entertainer. Say whatever you want about the guy, but just remember while you do so he can probably write a check this minute for more than any of us will likely see in our lives.  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
He's a media whore, and some people consider him a sellout, especially after &quot;Purple Rain.. But With Rap&quot; or as most people call it, &quot;8 Mile&quot;. If he made a CD without the first single being him making fun of people and/or acting like a dumbass, then it probably wouldn't sell as much. As the little kids wouldn't get it. <br />
<br />
Without total media attention via controversy, Eminem would be nothing. The whole Michael Jackson thing will do nothing more than boost sales of his lame album. Even more mindless kids will buy it like it's the best music on Earth. But I will give him credit, he does know how to milk every last cent out of things.</div></div><hr />

Yes, let us bow down to the almighty rich. They have more money then we'll ever see, ergo, they are better people then us and we should pay them homage by buying their products.</div></div><hr />

I'm going by a show I saw on MTV2 where all the rappers that appeared on the show stated that Eminem was the best rapper in the world right now, Snoop wasn't even mentioned...Second, I believe, was was 50 cent, who Eminem signed himself...</div></div><hr />

Is he a good rapper? That depends on what you consider to be 'rap'.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Arguements about musical talent or lack therof are fairly pointless since there is no 'fact' associated with the debate, its all opinion.  <br />
<br />
Personally I dont think Eminem is the most controversial or the most talented rapper, but he has a great balance of those plus Dr Dre in his corner, and I do think Dre is the best producer Rap has yet seen.<br />
<br />
Two Live Crew caused MUCH more of an uproar than ole Slim Shady did.<br />
<br />
What I am really fucking sick of is hearing about the word nigger or nigga being racist anymore.  When every other word out of any black comedian's mouth is my nigga yo nigger we all niggas, its JUST A FUCKIN WORD now folks.  Now, in this instance we have Eminem, who when he was like, 15 or some shit, after just being dumped by his black girlfriend, callin her a nigger while freestyle rapping in his friends basement.  The fact that this tape turned up 15 years later to haunt him is laughable.  He doesnt EVER use the word nigga, or nigger, in ANY of his songs, as he says its for respect.  Ole Steve Harvey ignores all the 'faggots' and 'fuck my mother in her ass' statements and 'cut my wife's head off' rhymes and 'screw the 15 year old after you drug her at a rave' lines, and focuses on some shit from when Eminem was a KID, and decides to revoke a ghetto pass?  Nigga, please.<br />
<br />
Steve Harvey.  How the fuck does he get his hair that straight across his head?  Michael Jackson making a public statement about being offended by anything is laughable.  Now, I dont think he is fucking little boys, I think hes mentally a kid, and tries to act like one, not understanding hes freaking everyone the fuck out.  Hes an idiot savant folks, he can sing and dance but hes a mental midget.  With a bad plastic surgeon.<br />
<br />
All this energy being expended against some white boy who grew up in the ghetto would be much more wisely focused on REAL ISSUES like starving children or say, when are we gonna get a decent fucking presidential candidate.  Is anyone voting FOR someone or is everyone just voting AGAINST someone at this point?<br />
<br />
I reiterate.  nigga please. bitch. faggot.  ghey-homo.  Honky.  Redneck. Gook.  Wetback.  Spic.  Yank.  Hilbilly. WASP. Fucknut.  Kraut.  Candyassfrench.   WHO CARES.<br />
<br />

i really dont like eminem or marilyn manson, but do you have enough talent to do what they do? to write songs or raps and have people that are actually interested in what you have to say? or the drive to work hard enough to eventually be signed?....</div></div><hr />

BTW, as far as me having the drive to do something, no, I'm not a musician, and am not more talented they either of them.  However, I did have the drive and talent to become a paramedic, and have saved hundreds of lives over the past 6 years.  I know both life and death better then most.

I'll listen to what I listen to becuase I like it, not becuase its on MTV, or if its trendy.
