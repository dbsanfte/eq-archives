<br />
I've been looking for - but unable to find - a series of guides to the various raiding encounters, especially the lower end GoD or LDoN raids.  I'm not talking about just my role as an SK in them - I found pleanty of info on that using search - but a breakdown of the entire how-to that a raid leader can use to read up.<br />
<br />
We're a young guild, smallish in size, but with very competent and intelligent players.  We've just never raided before; mostly professional people who don't have the time for the raiding guilds.<br />
<br />
Any/all info is greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Honestly though, learn the encounters yourself.  Aside from the fact that each guild has a different style, and the method one used to kill a mob may not be best for another, reading spoilers and not trying anything on your own just takes half the point of raiding out of the game anyway.  Where's the challenge (I.E. fun) in having everything spoon fed to you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dohn</div><div class="date">01-23-2005, 03:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">While I can understand the attitude against using them, it's a case of a group of people who enjoy playing the game - but really only have time for one, or a max of two, raid attempts per month.  When 6-8 hours of playtime per week is your entire schedule, having that spent on a wiped raid for the 'fun' of discovering which tactics are wrong can be a bit disheartening.<br />
<br />
Thanks anyway, though, for the concern.</div></div><hr />

First off, always look WHEN they were written. Someone writing about how easy, say.. Rallos Zek is after OoW is released is a lot different than a person doing so from the original perspective. <br />
<br />
And especialyl keep in mind that any strat/spoiler that does not include the gear/progression level of the number doing the strat should be taken with a grain of salt. A Qvic guild writing a start to Sir Elmonius Falmont, for example, is NOT going to be the same as one from an EP level.</div></div><hr />
