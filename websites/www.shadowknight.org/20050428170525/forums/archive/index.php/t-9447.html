<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ximplicity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Not sure if you have money to spend on this or not, but some good stuff to get at lower levels is the Crusty armor (crustacean shell). This is good for all SKs, not just gnomes. But since Gnomes have much higher int than the stupid trolls and ogres, you don't need to worry about getting +int gear.<br />
<br />
Other items you can look into is Enchanted Dwarven armor. You should be able to find this in the bazaar. Not sure what the prices are on your server, but the BP is usually about 1500-3000 on Bristlebane.<br />
<br />
That's just a few items, not sure what your plat situation is. :)<br />
<br />
As for a name, just go with what you like. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lizarde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah, crustacean shell armor is good, since you have decent AGI/DEX/INT, so the extra STR/STA comes in handy.<br />
<br />
As for a name, how about Tryme Imtasty? :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gnax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">being a 3 month old gnome sk, i can say Ximplicity hit the nail on the head.  buy all the enchanted dwarven plate you can.  also remember to get a MOSS &amp; a Clay Guardian Shield ... you're set until the higher levels.<br />
<br />
at 52, i'm still wearing much of the sentient / enchanted dwarven that I bought (thx to a donation from a friend) when I started.<br />
<br />
after armor, hunt/beg/borrow/buy all the weight reduction backpacks you can.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ojisan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The clockwork stuff is pretty nice too.  Can pick up a bunch of utility buffs like +30str on gaunts, slowish SoW on legs, and 40% haste on the arms.  Only problem with the stuff is that it takes batteries so you're looking at ~50pp per 10 charges used, which can be kind of tough to make up at lower levels, but shouldn't be too bad once you get up higher.<br />

<br />
But /agree<br />
<br />
Dwarven Plate is great stuffs, good ac, str and sta, and cheap.<br />
<br />
Look at some magelos to get some ideas of what works and just start building.<br />
<br />
A lot of bazaar hunting/camping and you should be able to get some nice stuffs for fairly cheap.</div></div><hr />

These boards came about when there weren't any bitesized bastages running around pretending to be evil.  If you don't like being hated, go away.</div></div><hr />

Then I see her skelly pet walk by...WTF!?! the words cute and shadow knight should never be used in the same sentince.  Also: Sks should invoke fear..a knob headed lil' goober does not invoke fear. Gnome sks are one more way SOE sticks it in our asses. *sigh*<br />
As to the argument gnomes can ne necros, why not sks? I never, EVER thought gnomes should be necros either! Bah!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I in RL am very ugly so I would be a perfect SK ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Bunnyslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Evil is all in attitude. My nome SK is dang cute, but she rules. She's like a tiny condensed package of villiany, much like a man eating oompa loompa.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Vistol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">If you'd like to use the argument on how gnomes aren't evil enough to be SKs, then how about we use the argument that trolls and ogres aren't smart enough to be SKs?  I have freaking toe jam that's smarter than some of you morons.<br />
<br />
At least gnomes can be the parent classes of warrior and necromancer.  It looks to me like trolls and ogres were the races that were &quot;thrown a freaking bone&quot; and allowed to be SKs.<br />
<br />
Why don't you give up on your l33t pwrgamerz attitude and have a little style for once.  It's getting a little boring to see the few ogre/troll SKs around on my server all looking the same..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Adikt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Not sure that argument works anymore Vistol.... Last time i checked the SK population on my server there were allot more gnomes then there were ogres or trolls. Sure the gnomes were mostly lower level and they may not stick around but it looks like gnome SK's are rapidly becoming a dime a dozen</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>nnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">a guy comes here looking for race info. he gets people giving him shit. <br />

so what? it was funny! :D<br />

lighten up, play your gnome, enjoy EQ and don't worry about whether people like you or not.<br />

oh yeah, and die.  :p</div></div><hr />

Any race that lets INNORUUK'S CURSE look like Innoruuk's Dagger (tm) is no SK in my eyes.<br />

I think we can agree then that Humans are the best sks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Grimbad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Yep, Crusty/Dwarven, Death, become food, etc.  They all right.  Wear the armor though, makes it more fun to crack gnome out of a shell (kinda like lobster) than to scrape it off your axe.<br />
<br />
Seriously though, Crusty is da bomb on a budget, your name's not bad, and all the rest of us just have Gnomish Haste Vambraces Envy.<br />
<br />
Still can't decide whether gnome is better with brown, tomato, or chocolate sauce, though...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes it is a game, so please, let them hate us, who really cares.  I am sure they do not.<br />
<br />
Actually though, gnome sk's are still fairly rare on Drinal.  I do /w all gnome shad all the time and maybe see 5 on at most.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Kronicblu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Belive it or not some of us long time SK's play gnomes.  Not all gnomes are n00b twinks.  Yes i have been playing sence Beta i was first a human SK then a DE sk Now a Gnome SK!  Gnomes are by far the best looking SK.  you want a SK race to hate go pick on the gay lookin leezards :D <br />
and no i didn't twink out my gnome sk or PL him to 65 in 3 weeks im lvl'n him the oldschool non twinked or using my 60th druid to do it way.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Grizabelle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I really like being a gnome SK too.  I am currently 41 and rapidly approaching 42.  I picked gnome because there are just waaaay too many DE SKs and the stats are very very similiar, humans are too.... well.... average comes to mind,  Iksars are cool but they are a pain when it comes to dealing with their armor early on and the innate ac just doesn't seem worth it, and the other races (you know who you are)... are just plain old dumb.  Why the heck would I want an SK that I have to worry about pumping intel into (in the amounts that you have to pump to get their intel comparable) so that I can use my class spells?  IMHO, ogres and trolls... well, they are actually warriors (they sure don't have enough mana to be much in the way of casters without gearing up for it) but people didn't think they could role play them well enough to show their evil side so they decided to class them as SKs cuz everyone knows SKs are evil (tell me I'm too cute to be evil will you?).<br />
<br />
You also get the added bonus of being KoS to fewer places (I'm all for being an evil wench but being KoS in the nearest place with a bank is just a pain) and I can go to both the bank in OT AND the bank in Kelethin at 1st level (just stay away from the dorfs  /shudder).<br />
<br />
I can say that on Veeshan there are maybe about 20 gnomish SKs (I keep doing the /who shad gnome, too).  Usually no more than 7 or 8 on at a time, mostly either high end or lowbies, maybe 4 of us in the 20 to 55 range. <br />
<br />
I am having a blast.  I look entirely too cute and cuddly but those that get to know my business side will be quick to straighten out those that refuse to heed my warnings before I stomp them into a pulp  (very amusing to role-play in my guild chat as my prior &quot;main&quot; is a 51 goody two shoes woody ranger :D ).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Skellos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Gnome Shadowknights Rock!!<br />
<br />
I'm having a blast with mine, the most fun I've had of all the Shadowknight races. My melee performance feels the same as my Ogre/Troll/Iksar characters that I ended up deleting. I learn my skills much more quickly and ease of getting around faction takes a lot of strain off me and my guild. I would definitely recommend either Crustacean Shell armor or if you can afford it Enchanted Dwarven armor which is what I wear. Check out my Magelo profile, you'll see that my gear rounds out my stats quite nicely, if you can afford it of course.</div></div><hr />

If a class is able to be a Warrior or a Necromancer.. they can be a Shadow Knight.<br />
<br />
I mean like, an Erudite has no fighting skills (unless your an Erudite Wizard meleeing... all the time)<br />
<br />
A Gnome can be a Necromancer and a Warrior... basically, a Shadow Knight is a Necromancer and a Warrior (like you didn't know that)<br />
<br />
So just let it be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Soulstar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">and gnomes can be warriors because...?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Jobrill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Gnomes are Grubby, Disgusting, Annoying, Unholy Hole Diggers. They live in thier pits, plotting to spew forth from Ak'anon with thier unholy minions of steam and metal, and take over all of Norrath. They must be destroyed, they and thier soulless machine king. <br />
<br />
For the Love of Thule, they use CLOCKWORK TORTURERS. That just ain't right.<br />
<br />
Anyone who cares about the fine art of torture knows true torture can only be administered by a well-honed master of flesh and blood.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Itzena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">That's because we leave the base thuggery involved in mindless combat without the graceful use of the Art to those races more fit for it, namely the less enlightened ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Akeikyl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Nah the only conculsion that can be drawn is that since Erudites can not be warrior's is that they are the true abombinations and defy all conventional logic.  Atleast Gnome's can be warriors and though tiny in stature they don't swing their swords like a limp wristed Erudite. While still being able to wiggle their finger's with style due to their high intelligence.  Kinda funny I'm defending Gnomes but it's sunday so what the heck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Jobrill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">You may let members of your race waste thier brains by turning into a mindless mass of expendable muscle. We Erudites chose not to do that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Akeikyl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">The body and mind are all but part of the same instrument to neglect one is to be out of balance. Since you Erudite's with your puny muscle's obviously don't realize this you are thus vastly inferior to all other SK races even trolls.</div></div><hr />
