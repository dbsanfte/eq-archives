<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zentalas Soultrapper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i am a lvl 51 sk and i am really excited to see the world of Norrath open its arms up and see what it has to offer. My question is this. When should i start for Inny's curse. i have done some simple things like collect my darkforge and the ghoulbane but when can i accually attempt this quest and succeed? any info would help thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Stugein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">That all depends on your supporting cast and the time you have to put into it.  At 52 I've completed all but the 3 planar drops and the Glohnor kill.  It's been solo or 1 grouped up to now.  I still have all the toughest parts to go, obviously, but this should give you an idea.  You can easily do most of the quest at 51 with a solid group.  If you have a group/guild that is experienced enough to do Fear, Hate, and Sky then there is no reason you can't do the rest of it either.<br />
<br />
Keep gaining levels to make it easier on yourself, but really you are at a level where you could pull it off if you want to.  Again, it depends on your supporting cast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>yuggoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I got my first epic drop on a guild Hole raid at 45....<br />
<br />
At least start hitting the planes (old world) as often as possible starting at level 46.  You can't start the actual quest till 50 or 51, but you can start collecting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Definitely the first time you set foot in Hate/Fear, and you can do that at 46.   All the other stuff is hoops to jump through after getting the drake hide and soulleech.<br />
<br />
BoA can be had off the first island with one group of 50's.<br />
Hole stuff can be done on any of the dozen raids you'll do there for enchanter/shaman epics.<br />
<br />
Since almost all the epic can be done incidentally during what an epic-level guild normally does, know what parts can be done in what order.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>AkumaShreddies</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I am at 53 and also would like to start. Could someone that piecemealed it up until the really hard parts post where they went that is doable at 53?<br />
<br />
TIA</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sabrosia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I didn't start until I was 60, but I wasn't really interested...  <br />
<br />
I probably could have done so earlier, but I didn't feel it was worth it at the time...  Then I started collecting odds and ends here, and next thing I know I was half way done with my epic...  So I finished it (and did so last night)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>yuggoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Tag along on Hole raids, join people going to Hate, since that is now 1-groupable.  I found that going along on other people's epic raids often helped me get my stuff - i.e. if they are doing the ranger guy in the Hole, they often don't mind killing a few chests for a cell key on the way.  Lots of the epic drops occur in the same zones.  The only raid I called for my epic was to do Lhranc, everything else was done in conjunction with other peoples needs.<br />
<br />
BUT...<br />
<br />
make sure you know the epic inside and out so that you KNOW where the mobs are, how the react, etc. etc.  This is the right place for that, search is your friend, it has all been asked and answered.</div></div><hr />
