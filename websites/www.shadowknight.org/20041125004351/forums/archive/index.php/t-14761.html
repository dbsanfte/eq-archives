<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Karrotine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok I noticed last night that after Doting a mob and FDing that the mob will no longer attack us SK's versus the previous way where the mob will come at you if you had DoTed it. I was DoTing 3-4 HG's in RM yesterday and FDing wait till HGs HP drops to 20% and whack away,  this is a good thing for us SK's since they broke our Greenmist and Inny's Curse.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Old method....<br />
<br />
You DoT mob, it aggros.  You FD, assuming you don't fall or leave attack on or something, it deaggros.<br />
- You stand before DoT wears off... mob reaggros on next tick of the DoT or immediately if FD didn't wipe aggro.<br />
- You stand after DoT wears off... mob reaggros only if FD didn't wipe aggro.<br />

Note, there's no difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lejina Bloodbath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Actually, Karrotine is right.<br />
DoT agro when FD has been changed exacly like he described.<br />
<br />
Only thing, he noticed the change 3 years after it has been introduced. Better late than never i guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Krazaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Let's do the Timewarp again!!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Soulstar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">most mobs regen hella fast when they're not aggro on anyone to the point that they'll outregen any of our dot's by far</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Karrotine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I meant that <br />
<br />
-after FDing successfully assuming you didnt &quot;Fall on the Ground&quot; or Leave the Auto Attack on-<br />
<br />
 when the dot takes effect which mean that it damages the mob once tick initiates damage it will turn around attack you cuz the DoT kinda tells the mob youre still alive but I just got back from Iraq about a week ago and its the second thing Ive noticed besides the Bugged weapons</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lejina Bloodbath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">We understood correctly what you meant with your first post.<br />
<br />
