<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Skardd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My cousin and I each 2-box.  Our &quot;dark&quot; group consists of DE cleric, DE sk, Ogre bst and DE wizard.  We created this group to kill goody NPCs.<br />
<br />
When can we kill those druids around the druid ring in North Karana or the NPCs around the druid ring in West Commons?  Are there paladins anywhere we can kill?<br />
<br />
We are looking for your suggestions on a level progression of goody guards and other NPCs to kill for this group?</div></div><hr />

As to your question, it all depends on what factions you want to lose...I.E who will eventually attack you on sight. Killing druids hurts druid factions, killing good city guards hurts that city's factions and so on. If you're never going to use the old-school druid rings, or enjoy being attacked when you port into certain places, go right ahead. Just make sure there are no quests involved with the factions you're destroying, so you dont have to go thru a tedious process of building them back up. Have fun roleplaying while you can...most of us have left it behind, except for a Mayor Gubbin kill once in a while when we feel like slaughtering halflings :D</div></div><hr />

Try the Freeport guards.  There are even paladin's to fight too.  Try sneaking in through the sewers.  I did this when questing my darkforge in my early 30's.<br />
<br />
I have also heard there are Erudin guards that are not too hard to take out, but I've never tried it.  These will also build faction in Paineel (not sure how dark elves are there).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hemlocc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">hmm dark elfs and an ogre...you're going to be kos is just about any town you come to so i wouldn't worry too much about faction...besides what kinda uber de sk quest could be completed in felwithe? speaking of felwithe you should slay guards there...not sure on the lvl but i hear its pretty good cash.</div></div><hr />
