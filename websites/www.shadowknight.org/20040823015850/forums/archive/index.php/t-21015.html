<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mutton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Slein Jein, sorry, you are the biggest drama queen this board has seen over the last 2 or so days since this whole Yantis thing went down.  You created a thread entitled &quot;Fuck you all.&quot; for the mere purpose of slamming individuals who decided to leave for whatever the reason.  Every single post someone makes on the subject is surely followed by a response from you calling them a &quot;doomsayer&quot; a &quot;chicken little&quot; or a &quot;drama queen&quot;.   You got all hissy when someone took some public domain information from this site, properly cited you as the author, and reposted it on another site.  This hissiness included a ponderence of whether or not you could take some form of action to rectify the &quot;purpetrators&quot;.  Nocifier resigns his post as moderator, and you feel the need to suck him off, even though the reason for his resignation has been cited by countless others as a morality/philosophy issue.  This not only makes you a drama queen, but a hypocrite as well.  <br />
<br />
In the end, the most staggering evidence is that if you open up any (well almost any) single thread pertaining to the recent selling of SK.org, you are sure to find a slew of emotionally filled rants and raves defending the actions of some and slamming the actions of others accompanied by your signature.  You, sir are the text book definition of &quot;Drama Queen&quot;.  I understand your emotions are running high, but I felt the need to cue you in on the extremely important and clear fact that you are the epitome of what you claim others to be.<br />

I don't feel the need to 'suck anyone off'.  Some people handled their goodbuys in a manner in which I respect, some didn't.  My responses varied accordingly.  I respected nocifer's post because he didn't have any theories of how the board was going to go down in flames or any accusations of how SV is involved in some conspiracy to steal 'our' board or some nonsense.  He simply stated that he didn't want to take part in a yantis-affiliated board, gave SV due props that as far as I can tell were heartfelt rather than a token gesture, and that was that.  Jobrill and several others have done the same - so be it; I wish them the best.  <br />
<br />
I asked if there was any action I could take simply as an indicator of how I felt.  It was more than simply taking my information.  I think I did a decent job of making it explicitly clear that my biggest beef was with the putting an extra burden on the person who was kind enough to host the stuff for me without so much as a word of it.  Brael is the one who took issue with the transfer of information in general.  Groff took down the hosted part and offered to work with me on the issue, I told him I'd get back with him in a few days (and I intend to) and that's settled - no hard feelings.  <br />
<br />
I'm not the only one who feels the way I do - you'll find plenty of posts by like-minded individuals - I'm just the one who's the most vocal about it.  I am an argumentative, vocal, opinionated son of a bitch - most people know that.  Get over it.  I treat people fairly.  <br />
<br />
My thread entitled &quot;Fuck You All&quot; wasn't &quot;slamming individuals who decided to leave for whatever the reason&quot; - my beef with people has nothing to do with leaving or staying.  I was &quot;slamming&quot; people who were prophecizing the cataclysmic end of this board, crying foul at soulvoid, etc.</div></div><hr />
