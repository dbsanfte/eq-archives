<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Stugein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Went down to The Hole last night to do the Kyrenna portion of Inny's Curse.  Caradon was not up, unfortunately.  We still went down to the city and got the Cell Key so that when Caradon does show back up in his cell I don't have to do it all at once.  So, key acquired.  Still waiting on Caradon.<br />
<br />
For what it is worth I'm skipping the 'faction' portion of the quest (Kurron Ni, Dusty Tome, Cough Elixir, etc.) and just using the Hide method for all my turn-ins.<br />
<br />
I have two questions for the class:<br />
<br />
1.  Is Caradon on Truespirit faction like the rest of the turn-in NPCs? (A more direct question would be &quot;Should I use the Hide method to give him the cell key or can I just hand it to him straight-up?&quot;)<br />
<br />
2.  Are you still &quot;invisible&quot; after you do a turn-in while hidden or does it break the hide?  Depending on the answer here I see a few possibilities:<br />
<br />
      A. Hit trade button.  Hide breaks, Kyrenna spawns and she and Caradon proceed to attack as normal.<br />
<br />
      B. Hit trade button.  Hide doesn't break and I remain &quot;invisible&quot; for all intents and purposes.  Kyrenna spawns but she and Caradon just stand there doing nothing until I make a move that breaks my invis.<br />
<br />
     C. Hit trade button.  Invis doesn't break and for some wacky reason Kyrenna doesn't spawn because I'm &quot;not there&quot;.<br />
<br />
      D. Other.<br />
<br />
So which is it?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any information.  I just want to make sure that I have all my ducks in a row before I drag folks down there to do this fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Covi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I did this part with the hide trick....as soon as the chick spawns, she and her brother are instantly aggro on you. <br />
<br />
So, your options are to FD and /q out to clear aggro, or you wax em on the spot.  If you have a mezzer there keep her brother mezzed, kill her, loot your stuff and leave him up so another sk can repeat that part of the quest. <br />
<br />
If they wipe your group she won't despawn for sometime, and they will both be non-aggro on the second try.<br />
<br />
Other than that make sure you have atleast 2 healers, cause these 2 bastages can cause some trouble.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aoninie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you are on the Zeb server I had to kill Caradon on Sunday as I couldn't split them. Group of around 18 killed bothe easily (avg lvl around 60).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Drakang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">When they both aggro you run back up the stairs and out the door into the hall.  Then FD.  Wait till Caradon wanders away and then have the group pull Kryenna.  You can either /q out and come back or wait a bit stand up and see if caradon forgot you.  Killing Caradon is 1 a waste of time. 2 costs other SK's the chance to do him.<br />
<br />
Have done 3 Kryenna fights in a row by FDing off Caradon.  He always goes back to the cell. Kryenna has no home so stays at your body.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Stugein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for the information, folks.  I did the key turn-in last night, sucessfully split Kyrenna from Caradon and walked out with her heart and blood.<br />
<br />
Combined the heart in the soulcase for the Heart of the Innocent and was going to go back down to The Hole for Glohnor, but unfortunately Marl wasn't up in Kerra for me to get the shroud from.  I'll check back on him another time.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for the tips.  Much appreciated.</div></div><hr />
