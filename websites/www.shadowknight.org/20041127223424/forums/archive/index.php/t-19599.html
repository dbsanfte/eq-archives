<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Once again I've gotta bring this up.  This needs changed to an activated ability, out of every class that gets it (int casters, sk's, bards) not a single one of them doesn't wish they didn't have the skill at times.  It helps Wizards when aggro kiting, Mages dislike it when aggro kiting with pets, Enchanters dislike it when pl'ing their alts and have a harder time keeping aggro on themselves when using the rune/tank pl'ing method, Necromancers dislike it when aggro kiting, and tanking to name a few situations, Bards sometimes need to be able to generate aggro and this prevents them from doing it, and most of all SK's our job is to get aggro yet this aa is directly opposite from that, reducing not only our spell aggro but melee aggro as well since it affects all aggro mods we have.<br />
<br />
This aa currently as a break even aa at best, giving SK's ~3% more dps in raids in exchange for being 20% worse in exp groups and theres no way to turn it off when you don't want it on.  This just isn't right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tukka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">What you say makes complete and total sense.  I really don't understand why this hasn't been addressed.  I can't think of any other passive ability in the game that can reduce your effectiveness in this manner.  It is simply without precadent.<br />
<br />
The only possible reason I can think of that Sony hasn't bothered to address this is perhaps that they are stubbornly maintaining a philosophy that nobody should ever want to gain aggro by casting spells, and that aggro should only be gained the &quot;honest way&quot;: with a taunt hotkey and melee.<br />
<br />
But they must have thrown that philosophy (if they ever held it) right out the window when they gave us two spell lines exclusively devoted to increasing aggro, right?<br />
<br />
So what's the deal?</div></div><hr />

Or maybe they just want the player to  have to decide to make a tradeoff when getting this AA?  Less Raid/group aggro or the same aggro for tanking/kiting.  Although I'm not sure if there are other AA's where buying it makes you better in some situations and worse in others (rather than just the same, like SU on live mobs for example).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Oagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's a decent aa for wizards, but it sucks for us, that's for sure.  It's an ability that no one is going to go out and say, &quot;Hey, I want that ability right away.&quot;  <br />
<br />
There are so many others for any class that has this in their archtype that take priority over it that it's wasted.  However, I see Sony doing little about it.  They'd rather add to the list than fix what's wrong with the current ones, unless it creates an unfair advantage or exploit.</div></div><hr />

Maybe... but, right... like I said... the way SCS works is without precadent (at least to my knowledge).  If there were other AAs (or class skills like Offense, Dodge, Meditate, ect.) that worked like this, I could perhaps accept that logic, but why SCS should be the only passive AA/skill that you can't shut off that reduces your effectiveness in a very serious way, I don't understand.<br />
<br />
The only skill that even comes close to being comparable to the SCS AA is Specialization*, which is explicitly designed to force you to make some kind of &quot;choice&quot;.  But specialization doesn't reduce your character's effectiveness in any way from what it is before you get the skill... it just makes you choose which skill you want to improve most (if my understanding of specialization is correct, it does in fact marginally improve even the spell skills you don't specialize in).  And unlike the SCS AA, you can undo your spell specialization if you decide you made a mistake and want to change your mind.<br />
<br />
* Or I guess the tradeskill specialization thing, but I can't see that as being a serious issue with the availability of New Tanaan and mules.<br />
<br />
So if Sony is trying to &quot;force a choice&quot; with the SCS AA, it seems a pretty arbitrary and ill-conceived way of implementing such a choice.<br />
<br />
Now I could be completely off the mark here, but I think the real reason they won't give us the option to turn off SCS is stubbornness and a degree of what you might call shame.  They don't like the aggro kiting tactic, they don't like the way Shadow Knights use Clinging Darkness/Fear instead of their tailor-made aggro spells, but they can't figure out a balanced way to fix it.  I think they consider the fact these things are done signs that they've failed in some aspect of game design, but can't really figure out what to do about it.  So they put in a skill that gimps these tactics, that most of the classes that tend to want to avoid aggro will bite the bullet and learn, and that the classes that are &quot;tanks&quot;/aggro masters will just decide not to learn.  They don't want to nerf us, but they will let us nerf ourselves closer to what their idea of our supposed roles/talents should be.<br />
<br />
In any event, every line of reasoning I can imagine for them designing the skill this way demonstrates itself as being at the least, very weird, and at worst, very stupid.  They could fix the skill and it would not have any serious effect on game balance either way, and it would make players happier.<br />
<br />
It could just be that they're too lazy to do it, I guess, or that they have other priorities.  But come on, we've had the ability for almost 3 expansions now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Malucchi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My version of SCS is called Death Peace. I wouldent train that AA if you paid me!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i agree with brael.  itd be nice to have that edge on raids when im not tanking.  however i do tank groups.  id think the versatility of our class alone would speak for itself on why this should be the way he mentioned it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Lets agree with Brael even more and not bump month old threads.  You both have been around long enough to know better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>aress</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I still fail to see the benefit for SKs.  At time-level, the MT has so much aggro capability that I can happily burn and never pull aggro, particularly with an occasional FD in between.<br />
<br />
When tanking, it is a detrimental AA.<br />
<br />
So, if anything, I would propose to remove it from our AA list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kirhouk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thats why I haven't, nor will I ever put aa's into the ability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Anyone wanna bet that there will be an advanced SBS w/ the option to turn it off but you need SCS first?</div></div><hr />
