<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>VykusSoulsdrinker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello, I was wondering does anyone have any tips on soloing for a level 52 SK..I have all spells up to level 52 except lifeleech, and have nice gear. My AC is 1280, and I have about 3500 HPs. I was lucky enuff to have a couple friends with me and we all leveled to the early 50s together, but now my Bard friend is into Kiting for himself, and my Monk friend is doing his own thing. I do have access to a level 49 Cleric for 2 boxing. I know about Snare, fear, pet, DOT, typ of Kiting, but was unsure how to really put it all together, and where to best do this. Would appreciate any advice and also, nice to meet all of you, my first post and im looking forward to throwing around ideas amd advice. Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zulpel Bonstalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">With that much Hp and AC you may want to try Kiting Shrine Bruisers in Nadox. they're on the Torgiran ( sp? ) Mines Side of the zone. they give ok exp, and ok loot. you probably wouldnt need the cleric although it would be REALLY nice to have him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wolff-Kishner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">With those stats, go tank in PoI, PoD, or PoN.  Exp will come in a  lot quicker then soloing because you can kill so many more mobs with a group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Duke Xerro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thats almost as much ac as I have at lvl 65 :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lyrith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">PoM with easy entrance in GD no question at all , get a slower and boom your golden, witht hat ac hell you might be able to do w/o slows</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Reflan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">That's only 100 or so less hitpoints than I have at level 59 with 3 pieces of ornate, the rest all cazic thule cultural(sta/hitpoint is their strong suit), white dragon helm, and good weapons, and more AC.  Sheesh, nice.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dester</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">the Hole (ruins of paineel). you won't be able to single most of them yet, but with your hps and AC you can take 2 at a time easy with a cleric 2 boxed to heal.  Just make sure that you snare everything or you can get lots of adds real fast.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>lorddaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i'm wearing all fulvous since i could put it on. and my magelo says i'm only at 3717 at level 62, and around 1300 AC with my taps. and i put as many points into Stam as i could when creating me.<br />
<br />
i wanna see your magelo like the rest to see how you did that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>VykusSoulsdrinker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Ok, before you all start calling me a liar, to clarify, the stats I posted are with Temperance, sice I have it at all times, because of my cleric alt. Sorry for any misleading info :(</div></div><hr />
