<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Reculpine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I chose a gnome to be my race for my Shadowknight. Why? Well even as a elf sized race  I always asked for shrinks becauseI love bein small, I also love gnomes (I played a gnome when I played D&amp;D). So I decided to make one for roleplay reasons, i just love em, Anyways my question is why would anyone pick a dark elf? In basic SK stas, gnomes only have 1 less int and 10 less agi, nothing major at all, while gnomes have 5 more stamina, and 10 more dex (all in comparison to dark elves). So what would make anyone pick a dark elf because the only reason i've seen so far is non-large size and nice int. But since a gnome has both of those plus a few better i can't quite figure it it out. I know that gnomes weren't always a choice, and that accounts for some of the Dark elves, but other than roleplay reasons, is there any real reason to pick a dark elf over a gnomes, like some racial bonus orsomething? i know its prolly a simple answer, it just has eluded me thus far, and input would help me greatly, thanks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Burek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Stats don't matter much in the end game, just about every item out there has crazy stats.  People play different races because they like the way they look, or have inherent abilities (regen for troll/iksar, or no stun from the front for ogre).  Play what you like....others will play what they like.  =)  This game is about what makes you happy, not what makes others happy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kromglon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I went ogre, just because well I wanted to be an ogre.  No stun from the front is nice. I pay an xp penalty. Does it matter? No Im having fun and never go &quot;holy crap my xp penalty&quot; I do notice it when my wifes shaman slowly gets levels faster than me. However one session without her playing and its all even again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Drakonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Personally I started out as an erudite... (was playing shaman as main around that time, when he reached 53 I got bored and played SK alt more and more)...<br />
<br />
When my Erud got to around 34, he was getting killed a *lot*.  I was fear kiting / grouping in Overthere at the time.  I remember a few occasions I LD'd kiting a tigress with it at around 10% hp and me around 90% ... and when I came back I was dead (I know there's other reasons such as trains / adds, but I didn't know that then).<br />
<br />
After talking it over with a friend, I decided to re-roll as a darkelf... at the time there were quite a lot of high end Darkelf SKs on that server, so I figured it was a good choice.  This was pre-luclin... if i'd known how evil Iksar's would look in Luclin I'd have gone with lizard =p<br />
<br />
By the time Drakonn was the same level as my erud SK he had around 200hp 100ac more with only a few better items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kahrn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You like gnomes for the same reason I like elves. There are alot of Dark elf sk's out there. The rpg element of being a little guy that hate's everyone is kinda cool plus elves rock.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Araden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I re rolled from human SK to DE SK for my alt.  Decided I'd prefer being a little guy with nightvision and not worrying about gear or spells or shrinks for vision / size.  Plus I liked having nice starting INT and gear makes the melee stats easy to raise,  think at lvl 50 I have 192 stamina with zero cultural, and 155int.  Have room for improvements to.  Personally I think go with whatever makes ya happy, don't sweat whatever race ya pick, and have fun with it. Gear that's available makes all races quite viable, even iksar :p   I thought about leezard but I just can't get into the scales n tails thing :p  Too many of my leezard guildmates have suffered jokes about handbags etc from me... I'd never hear the end of it if I made an iksar :p<br />

BTW gnome,  go to kael and run up n down the ice steps near the EW zone.. you will appreciate being short very much then  /grin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Oberyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">.....I dislike large races, they take up too much room in tight areas, and staying illusioned or shrunk is a pain in the ass.  Also, unless they have killer gear (not an option for me) their manapool is pretty slim.  Hell, mine as a DE is barely adequate a lot of the time.<br />
<br />
.....Gnomes weren't around, and frankly, had they been, I still wouldn't pick one.  How can people respect and FEAR a bald twerp the height of your knees? Also my friend plays a gnome and I can't count the number of times he has been stuck somewhere due to his lack of height.<br />
<br />
.....Erudites and Humans are night blind, and though there are items and spells to change this, they take up a buff slot, or an inventory slot for a weak item.  A good item with truesight or the like is not available to a low or mid level unguilded char, without loads of plat.  I like to SEE, call me strange.  A Human SK was a close call, but the vision tipped me towards DE. <br />
<br />
.....Iksar... good choice.  It was a hard choice between DE and these.  The lack of good plate armor at the time I made my SK swung my choice. I think it may be better now.  Also, there's a lot of REALLY annoying Iksar players on my server *shrug*  may have had something to do with it.<br />
<br />
.....Dark elf has the manapool, the middle size, the vision, the gear choice, and they actually look half decent - like they might be smart and evil.  The STR disadvantage is annoying, but STR is the easiest stat to get as the gear comes in, and through buffs.  Hide from day one comes in handy as well.  <br />
<br />
This subject comes up all the time, and I dunno how many times its been said:  ALL RACES WORK, if you are a half ass decent player.   Its just a personal choice depending on what a person likes and values.  Those were my criteria......so sue me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>krayzii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Other than the fact that erudites blow when it comes to vision...etc  they have the int but i still didnt pick one lol i went as a DE only because like Oberyn said they got the mana and they arent to big and the jus look tight as hell i mean like he said the whole looking smart and evil thing that is actually true... but when i got to about 52 i was bored and needed a change of pace so i re-rolled as an ikky  im telling you they dont look as uber as DE's but the ikky regen makes up for that (in my opinion) But also It is  a game no matter what you choose YOU are the person playing the character not your frien down the street trust me my RL frined ha me create a cleric and i was at like level 38 and quit cause t got boring just healing and shit so shoose suntin you like and could play for a while It is a GAME  <br />

<br />
Well, Gnomes are better in a sandwich than Dark Elves...  Gnomes make better footballs than Dark Elves...  Gnomes make GREAT footstools...  I guess if you look at it like that Gnomes ARE better than Dark Elves...<br />
