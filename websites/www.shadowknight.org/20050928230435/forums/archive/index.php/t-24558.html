<br />
Never heard of /doability? (or just /do for short)<br />
<br />
1-6 are the &quot;regular&quot; skills assignment buttons, 7-10 are the &quot;combat&quot; skills assignment buttons. In what order the actual skills are for you is up to how you assigned them yourself.</div></div><hr />

Try this it works for me ... <br />
<br />
line 1 - /doability 7 ( taunt )<br />
line 2 - /pause 5, /doability 9 (disarm) <br />
line 3 - /pause 5, /doability 10 (bash) <br />
<br />
<br />
I just got the BB with FB VII and needed aaway to work it into my rotation.<br />
<br />
Let me know how it works for you.  I don't always see the animation but I still get the FB VII when it procs.</div></div><hr />

He is so quick to accuse ... this is an &quot;OH SHIT&quot; setup that allows me to grap aggro with the least effort when it is stolen by an overzealous caster.  For those that would like to use this as a regular key to mash periodically ... remove the taunt line and shift everything up a few. <br />
<br />
I do not claim to be all knowing but I am willing to share what I have gathered in my short existence.  If you have something more creative to share, then share it ole' zen master ... <br />
<br />
I am but a student of the game looking for ways to improve ... any help is appreciative.<br />
<br />
PS ... Some of us aren't to lazy to click on the spell gem that contains ToD every now and then ...</div></div><hr />

Still going to need a seperate key for those situations.<br />
<br />
I don't use disarm anymore, but I don't see a reason why not to have bash and disarm on the same line, unless they have incompatible reuse times.  I like to see when a button is down and up, personally, and don't use /doability or alt activates on hotkeys unless necessary.</div></div><hr />

advice: don't respond with bad advice to dumb newbie questions in month old threads by a character who has &quot;retired&quot; in their sig.</div></div><hr />
