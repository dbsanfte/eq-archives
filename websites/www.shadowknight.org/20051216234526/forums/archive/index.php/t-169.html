You can get Blood Ember boots for about 1K... These should hold ya right through to Thurg boots (tho BE is arguably better) or further on to SS boots or Black Ice .... Otherwise get Crusty or sentient boots to hold ya til then..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Go to Icewell, find a group hunting those damn dwarves, and loot some no drop Royal Velium?  19ac and 5svm (I think on the save), the only problem being of course that they're teal. :)  Then again, you're an Ogre...how worried about fashion can you be?  LOL</div></div><hr />

He was looking for good boots, and they are, and pretty darn inexpensive.  For a level 35 there's not a lot of better options.<br />
<br />
Sorry to offend your sensibilities, but they're a realistic option.  Step back, man.<br />
<br />
You got a better idea for a level 35?  Lemme guess....bronze, right?  Since he can camp it and all, that would be the &quot;right&quot; thing to do.  :mad:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Groobash</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 11:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">wtf is it with all these posts lately suggesting people go beg for stuff? RVF, SoP, SoG. Is that what this board has finally come to? That's the best advice we can give? <br />
<br />
Jeebus, go earn your own stuff...it'll mean a lot more to you if you earn it yourself.<br />
<br />
Have you raided Icewell, Fezz? The moment you take a raid in there, the vultures come out in force, to the point they're in your way while you're trying to pull and split mobs. mmm nothing quite like running out of the keep with half a dozen mean dorfs on your ass and OOPS you're stuck at the end of the bridge cuz a bunch of naked ogres are standing there blocking your path drooling over armor that hasn't dropped yet and too stupid to get out of the way. That's ok, it's only my xp bar that's affected when the dorfs kick my ass.<br />
<br />
I insist on leading any raids we do in Icewell now, just so I can rot the stuff. ME is another place I purposely rot stuff. Beggars suck.<br />
<br />
I know getting gear is tough, I sympathize. My stuff is laughably bad for level 60. But begging and vulturing is not the answer.<br />
<br />
How about suggesting he join a group at the orc fort in EW and try for some RyGorr? How about suggesting he lead a group of level 35-40 people into Skyshrine and try for some Sentry/Guardian. Or how about suggesting he (gasp) quest his Darkforge boots? Want more suggestions? Just ask...<br />
<br />
p.s. All three options would be more *fun* than standing around begging like a dog under the dinner table.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fezzika</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 12:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Indeed I have done many raids in Icewell (my last name's not Dworfbashur for nothing), and I have encountered people looking to loot the no drop armor.  You know what?  I've never had a problem with it.  God knows that this game is hard enough, why make it harder on people by intentionally letting things rot?<br />
<br />
Sorry, that's just sad.  It doesn't hurt you at all, yet it could definitely help someone else out.  But NOPE, it might inconvenience you so screw them, eh?  If they're in your way, ask em to move or get lost.  If I'm grouped with someone with that attitude, I'm leaving.  <br />
<br />
That's not roleplaying a SK...that's just being a jerk.<br />
<br />
Sorry to hijack the thread, Ghob...good luck on your boot search.  If you're on Sol Ro and I'm in Icewell, feel free to come see me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaiyn</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 12:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would go for the Darkforge quest boots, or the Royal Velium Frosted if I were you. Just make sure to ask to loot the boots if they are rotting. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Utterance Unholy</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 12:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the problem is not people looting stuff that rots, the problem is it becoming a chariacture and turing into Vulturing, as you put it.<br />
<br />
If once and a while a person hung out, politely, non-spammingly, and came down to loot rotting stuff, I don't think anyone would care.<br />
<br />
If one person a day came to ME, and shoulted, infrequently, &quot;hey drop a line when a no-drop drops, and I will come get it. Thanks&quot;, and they go to get it, fully responsible for their own safety, not interfering with game play, who cares?<br />
<br />
But, when it turns into a zone where more people are shouting to loot then fighting, or when people expect you to protect them, or when people expect you to stop killing stuff, so they can get items, then its a problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lejina Bloodbath</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 12:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One individual asking for rotting loot and not interfering with the group/raid, i dont have any problem with it.<br />
<br />
One, or multiple peoples, being annoying and/or interfering with the group/raid, i do have a problem with it. And no, if im there to hunt something, i wont leave the zone because of the beggers, ill destroy the loot so they lose any interest for being in the zone and have them to stop interfering with me/my group/my raid.<br />
<br />
You dont owe anything to any begger. If you feel like giving them something, thats kind from you. If they are annoying, giving them stuff is only encouraging them to stay there, to keep annoying you and likely to spread the word to other annoying beggers who will eventually come asking you for more stuff.<br />
<br />
Bottom line, begged items may be nice. Items you got by yourself may be good also. Begging wont make you a better sk, questing and working for your gears will.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thenger</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 01:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just have to agree, beggers have an annoying part in the game.  The see so many people walking around in better items that they want them.  God, doing the quest for Dark Forged.  What an idea?!  Waste time outside CT so I can do Dark Forged quest!  How noobish an idea! <br />
<br />
Okay now that the saracasim is done with, the items you get yourself just feel so much better even if they not as good as the &quot;uber&quot; loot you see peps walking around in.  Take the time to learn the zones, do the quests.  In the long run it will make you a better player once you relize what you &quot;can&quot; and &quot;can't&quot; do at your level.  Enjoy the game, and take the time to learn the ins and outs of being a SK.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To the original poster, lots of good ideas. Rygor fort, DF, SS, all good places to hit up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">camal</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 01:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A good item for the SK at 35 could be the new DArkened Knight's armour. The boots and other peices of armour are good for this level. actually perfect for this level.  They are quest items but would need to be in a group to obtian items.  Also Don't feel bad about auctioning for the itmes needed to obtain the boots.  Offering to buy something is the same as getting it. You still had to earn to the money somehow whether it is from a main of high level or a alt of mid level.  I also heard that the twilight armour items are hard to find so buying is the only option at this point till a detailed guide for it is posted.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ianthe</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 02:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Remember having all the vultures around when we leveled in Freeport (before there were such things as expansions).  The ones that politely asked got to loot the items, the ones that were pure vulture got to see items destroyed in front of their eyes.<br />
<br />
Newbs asking for equiptment to this day still bothers me.  I have yet to give out a single item to people who bug me for it.  I have however outfitted some of them as I see them walking by enjoying the game in level equivalent armor.<br />
<br />
As for the boot situation, BE would probably be the best best (if you have the cash, I know I didn't have that much cash back then).  Doing your darkforge quest is viable.  <br />
<br />
Course I can't say too much... L57 and I finally got an upgrade to my umbral boots.  Now only if I can get the guild to do the Lhranc battle /sigh</div></div><hr />

I wore bronze until 35, DF until 50, and Umbral until 55 when i went and killed to get my RFV which I still wear today at 59 for lack of a better pair.  I would alsy agree w/ going out and doing the DF quest so that you cna learn the zones, and the exp from doing the qeust helps also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Emnity</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 04:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just got a pair of Darkforge boots and they are okay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ghob Owar</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 06:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow... didn't know this would turn like this. Thanks to everyone for the advice, I think I'll see if I can get some Ry'Gorr or a pair of the Blood Ember (save up a bit o'cash).<br />
<br />
I have a few pieces of stuff for Darkforge (from when Cazic was doable by 30s), but I'm not too keen on questing either. (Just as an FYI... I've been playing this game for almost 3 years now as an Enchanter. I've done enough bloody quests. ;) ). I have the cash for high-end stuff... but I'm trying to have fun again, and that doesn't involve twinking. (Too much anyway...).<br />
<br />
I'm still curious as to CoS tactics. So not to break the unwritten rule #1 (never talk about pre-nerfs), I'm interested to learn everything I can from the experienced via email. I can already bank anywhere I want... what a rush in NFP (where my fat butt can barely squeeze thru the door).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Garila</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 08:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What difference does it make if you loot RFV boots?  they are GOOD boots . .  sure darkforge is &quot;viable&quot; if you have a group that wants to go hang out in Feerot . . . but most likely you wont . . . RFV are far better than darkforge . . . if the boots are going to rot and they are a good upgrade then go for it.  Some people don't have the time to round up a group to go to SS or camp darkforge pieces or they might not have the money to buy sentient or BE.  If you want to sit on a high white horse and tell everyone what and how to EARN something then maybe you should play &lt;gasp&gt; a paladin :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nathus</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 10:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If someone ask me, or my groups if they can loot some of the stuff that would rot, and aren't a pest about it, as long as no one needs it, or has an alt there that needs it, we usually don't care if they loot it. Its just the damn packs of vulture newbies (6 or 7 level 3-4 chars at once) demanding that we give them stuff, because its their rights to get it, because they want it, and its better than what they have. Have had cases where we were hunting with multiple groups, and newbies would ninja loot stuff before people in the non-xp group who were supposed to get it could loot it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trysbrina67</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 11:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">if someone is being a pest then ya destroy the item right in front of their faces.  Pests / beggars, especially ones who dont make any attempt at trying to better themselves do not deserve your time.  However, if some no drop item is on a corpse and no one in your group needs, why not let someone have it?  SoPs drop all the time and i make a point to try and get sks down into LK and have them loot it as long as they dont train us.  I see nothing wrong with that, most of us do need some help in our day to day quests on this game.  Nicest thing i ever saw was a raid that had killed Dread and discovered he had soul leech (and of course no sks present lol) and got an sk there to loot the sword.  They could have been jerks and let a warrior have it or looted it and MQd it for massive pp, but they decided to help someone out.  what a novel idea, to help someone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Verflixt Darkart</div><div class="date">03-29-2002, 12:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with the people annoyed with the vultures. One option to your normal vulture would be to see if any friends are going to be raiding an area that drops nice no-drop boots and see if they would mind if you stuck around until a pair drops... being SK over 30 you are pretty self sufficient anyways, and shouldn't cause anyone any trouble.... this is what I would consider feasable vulturing. My friend told me I should go to DL and shout for the no-drops when I was about 18. I only did it once... and didn't spam. only did 2 shouts as I ran through from the spires to FM zone. You know what? I didn't get anything. Oh well, not gonna go camp for rots.<br />
<br />
Anyways, yeah... might see if any of your friends will let you tag along sometime, otherwise buy the BE or Rygorr  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Attyla</div><div class="date">03-29-2002, 12:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would advise getting the Royal frosted boots.  If you have some friends, you guys can do the 2 sentries at the entry to Icewell.  Those boots and gauntlets (very nice too) drop pretty regularly.  The sentries are lvl 44, but fight more like a 47.  Bring lots of melee.  One group of 35-39 with a cleric can do one sentry.<br />
<br />
When we did it, we had quite a few casters, and didn't know just how resistant those buggers are.  Get damage shields and lots of healing.  Also use Fire or poison based spells.  You CAN do it at your level, but you'd probably need 2 groups to work the pair of them over.<br />
<br />
You CAN split them but when they start to flee, it will probably make it to the other one (Even at my level, snares rarely stick).  So you'll have to expect to do both of them in succession.  The spawn time on them is (was) about 15-20 mins.<br />
<br />
At low levels, I wouldn't suggest setting camp past the entry wall.  If you are low/mid 40s, the best place to set up is on the ice to the right of the bridge (against the wall about midway between the entry ramparts and the keep itself).  As an SK, you can aggro mobs from inside the fort, and go halfway down the keep bridge then jump onto the ice and FD.  The mobs will path to either end of the bridge to get down to the ice.  So you can get an FD off.  Beware the sentinels though.  Man they are tough as hell.  I believe the higher leveled ones can summon.<br />
<br />
The nice thing, is that those entry sentry dwarves drop alot of components and Velious spells.  As well as alot of sellable weaponry.  The loot actually is very good, and at your level, very manageable.<br />
<br />
I can't tell you how satisfied I was to get my own pair.  Even though it's assumed you scavenged them (which I don't really have a problem with personally).  Still, I've had these boots for over 10 levels now, and the list of stuff I can replace it with in the near future is pretty thin.  The resists on em are actually quite good for the slot too.  Mine will probably stay in my resist pack for some time.<br />
<br />
EDIT:  You can also &quot;pay&quot; your way by offering to sell the items a raiding group pops for them.  I tried that with a group doing sentinels/named once as a very young SK.</div></div><hr />
