I've come up with a list of zones that you need keys/flags for and was hoping people could double check it for me.<br />
<br />
Old World:  The Hole, Sky (requires port), Hate (requires port, can buy now via NPC)<br />
Kunark:  Seb., HS, VP<br />
Velious:  ST, CS key via Skyshrine<br />
Luclin:  VT, Intrazone keys for Seru, Ssra, &amp; Acrylia<br />
PoP:  flags req. for EP &amp; Time<br />
LoY:  None?<br />
Gates:  flags req. for KT &amp; beyond</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cames</div><div class="date">06-26-2004, 11:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Acrylia key gone a long time ago.<br />
<br />
Flags were originally required in all PoP zones other than PoI, PoJ, PoN and PoD.<br />
<br />
Hole does not require a key for an SK.  Just Harmshield and take a header.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dyrkk</div><div class="date">06-27-2004, 03:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Doesn't access to Lower Acrylia still require some sort of key? I did VT shards there a while ago and I'm not sure if I could have gotten to the area where we farmed those without the keyed person in my group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dyrkk</div><div class="date">06-27-2004, 03:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh, also there are a ton of missing keys on that list.<br />
<br />
Tower of Frozen Shadow keys and master key.<br />
<br />
PoI factory 'key'/flag<br />
<br />
Other PoP keys that are tied to progression there, like CoDB/PoNB/Torment Saryrn Key/Aerrin Dar Key/HoHB/BoT Tower &amp; Agnarr/EarthB...and so on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I got there perfectly well when farming my shard solo, without a key.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, the Hole does have a keyed entrance.  You can get in the way Cames said, just be certain you have a gate potion/hammer on you to get back out.<br />
<br />
Add Paineel and Befallen to the list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bushido32</div><div class="date">06-28-2004, 04:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Can't seem to update my original post, so here's what I have for an updated list.  Thanks for the responses.<br />
<br />
Old World: The Hole, Sky (requires port), Hate (requires port, can buy now via NPC), Paineel, Intrazone keys for Befallen<br />
Kunark: Seb., HS, VP<br />
Velious: ST, CS key via Skyshrine, Intrazone keys for TOFS<br />
Luclin: VT, Intrazone keys for Seru &amp; Ssra<br />
PoP: flags req. for EP &amp; Time, plus Intrazone and regular PoP flag progression (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/maps/Planes_of_Power_flags_1_13.gif)<br />
LoY: None<br />
Gates: flags req. for KT &amp; beyond (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/maps/god_progression.jpg)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cames</div><div class="date">06-29-2004, 08:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well there are 3 keyed areas of Vex Thal as well (castle, north wing, north tower).<br />
<br />
We left off Sol Ro's Tower for flag and Sol Ro's Room for a flag as well.  BoT Tower Keys and Agnarr Key.<br />
<br />
Najena has keyed areas.<br />
<br />
There are some normal rogue spots that might have keys I believe (CoM, Howling Stones Wings - pretty sure on these, Seb Crypt - unsure).<br />
<br />
Jaled Dar's room in Dragon Necropolis has a key.<br />
<br />
On a historical note, it used to be required to pick up a tooth at the portals in GD, WL, and CS to be able to be ported there.<br />
<br />
Sorry, every time I look at the thread I think of somewhere else.</div></div><hr />

It's not as if that key is hard to get, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NorrynNoir</div><div class="date">07-24-2004, 09:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">regarding pop , Plane of Tactics hasn't been mentioned, but that &amp; Sol Ro Tower still require flags to enter. there is also a key needed (acquired via flag) to get the the lower part of CoD where Bertox is.</div></div><hr />
