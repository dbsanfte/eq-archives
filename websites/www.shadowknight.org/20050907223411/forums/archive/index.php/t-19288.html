<br />
Friend of mine is taking a break from EQ and gave me access to his account with a 56 Enc Main. Plan is to get Enc to 60 fast dual boxing with my 64 SK while getting some AAs for SK (when I'm not raiding or LFG).<br />
Where would be the best xp/aas spot for this duo? I was thinking maybe flyes in PoD...<br />
<br />
Thx for help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cames</div><div class="date">01-06-2004, 08:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I sat back and thought about this and ask myself...where would this make any sense?  I think you should consider grouping with the enchanter and not 2 boxing.  I have 2 boxed my enchanter and my cleric.  2 boxing my enchanter with my sk would not make a whole lot of difference.  <br />
<br />
My guess is you would aggro kite and the enchanter would drop his 2 dots.   I guess you could straight up tank, but that would be a bit risky as time went on.  The flies in the front of PoD are often DCable (meaning level 46) and thus won't be great xp at 56 (and horrible xp at 59) unless you are going to do a lot of them.<br />
<br />
SO.....perhaps a better idea would be to aggro kite where the xp was better.   For example PoV outside the caves or maybe in PoS (although lots of stuff there summons).<br />

<br />
Set up the enchanter with hotkeys for assist and tash, mez, root, debuff(I use 2), and slow - to make your life easier.  Be ready on your sk to steal aggro (like we do so well) just in case.<br />
<br />
I found the flies in PoD cake.  At your level, straight up tank them, they are whimps.  You won't get much exp, but the enchanter will do fine.  If you can get both the front (safe rock) and back island (Verti Fly), there are plenty of flies there to keep you busy.  All should come single at 64.  Watch for Rats in the water.  Expect them to add when you are lom.  :)  Do NOT pull A Diseased Malarian.  They summon and are nasty casters, necro I think. <br />
<br />
If you aren't worried about getting exp, just PL'ing the enchanter, go to Velks and try for all the spiders you can.  You shoud be able to rip through them no problem.<br />
<br />
If you want blues (to your sk) for better exp, try PoN or go to Torgiran Mines, or even Nadox.  TM by the Nadox zone is my favorite spot right now.  Ok exp and good cash drops.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ramgar SK</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 11:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use my enchanter to assist and tash on pull, quickly followed by slow as soon as  the spell gems refresh.  Once the mob is at about 90% I cripple and Grasping Embrace.  You could throw weakness in too, but I like to nuke instead.<br />
<br />
I also keep a slot with Boon in it, so MC procs a lot.  Then I can zeefers a lot to keep enchanters mana full.<br />
<br />
GE (and that line) doesn't stack with Asystole last time I checked.  So I use Ignight Blood instead.  I also tap their ac and attack.</div></div><hr />
