<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wyrmwood B'Dynn</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 07:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Kael version was the one with the not matching colors it is now fixed. Even tho it still has 2 ac less than pal/cleric/bard helms from kael. mainly due to they never upgraded the helm stats when they did the armor upgrades and changed the color which is why it was still the wrong color.  Anyways here is the quest its real simple. The helm drops in ToV HoT section. The gems in Velkator,DN,SG,Icewell Keep under the keep down through the well.<br />

&quot;Onerind Fe`Dhar promises to make you a helm if you bring him an unadorned plate helmet and three pieces of crushed coral&quot;</div></div><hr />

Your question was already answered.. Blood Lords armor was never messed up graphic wise. <br />
<br />
My question was 2-part:<br />
1) Was it &quot;fixed&quot;<br />
<br />
Yes, this was answered.  However, I should point out that the situation, pre-Luclin, was different in this regard (see below).<br />
<br />
2) Does it match the rest of the suit.<br />
<br />
No, this was not answered specificly.  But I would assume that from &quot;it was never messed up&quot; that it does indeed match.  However, during at least one point in the game, all Vellious custom helms were identical; insofar as regardless of which (of the 3; namely Thurg, Skyshrine and Kael) custom helm you had, you had the same look as anyone else of your race in a custom helm.  I.E. a DE wearing custom Dark Runed Crown looked the same (tint, etc.) as someone wearing a custom Blood Lord's crown.</div></div><hr />

With them off, its still the same silver color as the rest of the velious custom helms.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xanyia</div><div class="date">03-27-2002, 08:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have luclin models on the rest of the armor is a dark purplish blue, the helm is silver.. <br />
Maybe it depends by the race? I know Erudite females are not new to having problems with helm graphic.  <br />
I wish there was a way to un-customize it.<br />
I dreaded the pink hood look! the helm doesn't match the armor and what's worse the visor is almost opaque, making it hard to see my face.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Xanyia, do you have loadvelliousarmor (that may not be it precisely, but you'll know it when you see it) set to TRUE?  That's caused me no end of wierdness.  I had it loaded because without it, my non-Luclin iksar looks like he's wearing leather rather than the nice kelp...but I finally had to switch it off because it was just too annoying to watch everyone waling around wearing swords and shields instead of armor (although the nude models were something different).</div></div><hr />
