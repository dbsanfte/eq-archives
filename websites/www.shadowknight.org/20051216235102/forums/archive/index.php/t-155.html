<br />
a few thousand Outcast Iksar killed for Necro faction (Which I believe MUST be aimiable for some of the later Kukhris)<br />
<br />
This is of course an at the least thing, you may also have to do a the curscale quest from Klok Mugruk a few times too.</div></div><hr />

Im a TSK and my faction with Cabilis is rather good overall. Even non KOS to the Necros already.<br />
I originally only went for Lizard faction to have a city in Kunark and to hunt in HS :)<br />
But this gives the packpacks of bones a completely new value :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Numzaz</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 07:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aeh before I get to excited, the Greenmist is flagged &quot;Iksar&quot; on Allakhazams equipment list.<br />
Can someone confirm if it is useable by other races, namely Troll?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cryptogenic</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 07:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Definitely want to get one of these when my gnome gets high enough.  I still have bad memories with my troll shadow knight farming bone chips for hours in Kurn's and still being scowling with the Iksar shadow knights though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ronoh</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 10:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Numzaz, I can emphaticly state that it is useable by ALL races of Shadow Knights.  I finished the quest about a week ago and triple checked the stats and who can use, including Gnomes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nysalor</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 02:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, the Greenmist is not only usable by non-iksar, but the necessary faction can be attained by dark elves.  Whether or not the necessary faction can be attained by other races, I can't say for certain, but I have read that some race/deity combinations can not get above indifferent with the necessary factions, so they can not complete the quest unless these faction caps are changed.<br />
<br />
I posted quite a lot of information regarding this quest (for non-iksar) on the Greenmist forum on this website.  Check it out.  I had submitted a screenshot of me with the sword on the Knight Watch, but it didn't make it over to the new boards.  I'll try to post it later today.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lexar Venomous</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 04:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sword was originially Iksar only, was changed fairly recently to being useable by others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xarshaaz Dreadbones</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 04:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anyone know why Hero's khukri became tradeable at that same moment they chance quest to all races? Was pretty shocked when I saw it...found out a tunnel rat in EC couldve bought this item I had put a weeks worth of playing into =) Ah well, now it is on to the lord of pains khukri, altho I am pretty fed up with all the scroll camps...Anyone else from TT doing the quests?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mnayar</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 05:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hero's Khukri has always been tradeable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Numzaz</div><div class="date">03-29-2002, 02:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the confirmation /bow<br />
<br />
Luckyly I did the bone farming last year in Paineel, they changed the pathing of the triple spawn since so Kurns is probably the best place for bones now /shudder.<br />
Really nice that all this work might pay off eventually, raising faction is really a test of will and endurance :P<br />
And I had it easy, being a Cazic follower uff<br />
<br />
However, Cabilis is a great city to have faction with anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rabdos</div><div class="date">03-29-2002, 01:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Are the different Khukris usable by other races too? I tried an Iksar SK for about a week after Kunark came out, but I haven't looked at them lately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taelnia</div><div class="date">03-29-2002, 01:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, all the khukri's are usuable by all races that can be sk's .The same thing with shaman cudgels(neighbor is an iksar shaman) and i'm guessing monk shackles(don't know any iksar monks so i can't verify).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Garila</div><div class="date">03-29-2002, 02:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah the monk shackles were changed to human useable AND the final result of the quest is a weapon . . . not near as good as khukuri though 12 20 h2h skill lots of stats / resists and right click jonathons whistling warsong (haste doesnt stack with epic +20 str and 12 AC)</div></div><hr />
