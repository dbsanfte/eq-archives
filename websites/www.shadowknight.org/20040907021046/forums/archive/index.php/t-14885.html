<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Skazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone have any links to good Iksar Lore info?<br />
<br />
I've not chosen a surname for a while now and wanted to pick something very Iksar Shadowknightish.  I'm not one to really roleplay - but it would be nice to avoid the less thoughtfilled surnames such as &quot;Deathstryke&quot; and &quot;Ownzurmomma&quot;.<br />
<br />
Figured maybe I could do some reading on Iksar lore and come up with something appropriate.<br />

Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Calamity_Daemon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You can try AllaKhazam's and go to Links and then Everquest then Races and see what you get...But as far as I know Iksars were slaves (They believe because they wern't devout to Cazic-Thule) But by some luck they became...unslaves...I'm rusty on my EQ history ) Anyway so they make a HUGE empire right and they even challenge the dragons and they lose to a number of things and now only have their one city in New S...Sebilis...? I can't remember but anyway they are all devout to Cazic-Thule because they belive that if they had spread terror enough that they wouldnt have fallen or something...They do not view themselves as evil and they HATE it when their names are pronounced wrong...usually consisting of many hisses and sliths they eat anything like bugs and anything they can shove in their mouths similar to trolls...funny how you see sameness in children...anyway they are very proficient with their hands and such even the warriors and such...Well...I hope that helps a bit...O yeah and common Iksarian names are as follows: Cabkoris Chasartiz and Jantiz...some of the few they are very self assured and none posses anything of virtue and love or anything...their socioty is very...sorta communist in our world very regulated and those that break the rules are executed or exiled...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jobrill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Go around Cabilis and buy all the books there. Theres quite a few books of Iksar Lore sold by people, Including the Forbidden Scribe in the sewers, and the Court Chronicler in the Court of Pain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>synnoira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The undead iksar slaves in Ssra mines have surnames based on the ancient iksar tribe they belonged too. Kunzar, Obulus, Kylong, Nathsar and Jarsath if i recall correctly offhand. If you look at the Bestiary at Alla's (i usually just go through eqatlas for that sort of thing) of Cabilis and various zones you'll see NPC names listed to give you some ideas.<br />
<br />
Edit: Of course you could just use the surname &quot;Sathir&quot; though you wouldn't be the first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Yinaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">go to www.planeteq.com and check out the &quot;RP dictionary&quot; under the features section on the left. I forget the Iksar Shadowknight faction offhand, but look for it and other related things you find and you can read some semi-interesting stuff.....<br />
<br />
I think it would be Shissar (yes im right on that one) and the entry under that entitled Green mist that might explain who the iksar had been enslaved to. Also try reading Sarnak, it tells you who created them hehe<br />
<br />
Just read through and think of stuff like faction names, or the 5 ancient tribes Synnoira mentioned, you might find something you like to place as a surname.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mekik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Here are a couple of links to the Skathris Ven'Sho guild of Firiona Vie, the only Iksar-only guild that I have ever seen. Long surviving, and proud of the Iksar nation. The second link contains some information from in-game, and some from members imaginations. Enjoy.<br />
