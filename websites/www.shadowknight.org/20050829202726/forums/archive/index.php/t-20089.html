<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dkhar</div><div class="date">02-17-2004, 03:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK. My wifes chanter finally hit 45 and we can now group for xp. I took her over to Nadox and I kited the bruisers and let her nuke em. Efficiency was very nice considering she levelled a little fast and her nuke skills were sub par but overall I doubled the amount of bruisers I can kite before the front spot spawns. Now, the question is, she is getting 1% xp from each kill. They are yellow-red to her. Is this right ? Do I suck up that much experience or is this 1% per mob set in stone due to the level difference ? <br />
<br />
Does anyone have any suggestions on a better kiting spot ? Maybe one where she can participate a little more ? Possible spot with a mob she can charm (preferably one that won't kill her in one round if charm breaks please hehe). Also if there is a better xp modifier for her somewhere. <br />
<br />
We did rockhoppers in DL when she was 39-41 I think. She charmed some guy at a camp nearby and he frickin wiped out the whole tunnel (I trained mobs into her pet) but that soon got boring and the xp stopped for her. It was pretty nifty, I like the sk/chanter duo. Just need some more tips on hunting grounds.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dkhar</div><div class="date">02-18-2004, 03:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">About 1% per kill for AA. I can kite 7-8 before respawn in front. XP kinda blows though solo, I get 1% every 3 kills I'd say on average. With my wife there though I get like no xp, 6-7 kills per 1% but 1/2% AA per kill.<br />
<br />
I like the spot though, mobs drop 2-9pp each, weapons that sell for 6pp, scroll that sells for 100pp, eyepatchs that sell for 25pp, various lowend gems 20-60pp and of course the named that drop some stuff you can sell for up to 1k. The best part is noone is ever there to bother you or train you and you can kite at your own pace.<br />
<br />
I hate PoJ on Prexus server, every level 46+ twink and their level 65 shammy sits there. There is usually a group on either side of the exit, both training each other and fighting over a few rooms. Bleh, I'd rather punch myself in the face 20 times before I go back there. I think the xp is shit too. I dunno. I've been thinking it might be best to xp her to 48 in Nadox and then take her on adventures, her being the lowest in group is sure to net her a lot of xp.</div></div><hr />

You should also try Torgiran Mines.  Zone in from Nadox where you are now.  Should be plenty of room to fear kite them from the zone.  Use pacify to ensure you get singles each pull.  More named here, and better exp.  I'm not 100%, but everything should be fearable.  If your weapon is good, you should be fine.<br />
<br />
I think at that level I was in the back of Solb, at the Sola zone, doing bats and some bugs.<br />
<br />
You could also try Velks.<br />
<br />
The entrance to Veksar too.<br />
<br />
Get your HS key and go there.<br />
<br />
Try fear kiting the flies in PoD.<br />
<br />
Group exp rocks.  Much better than duo'ing.  Add a rogue, druid, or a wizard and you will see a big difference in speed of kills.</div></div><hr />

They said no they had another 46 necro comming, anyways the necros were mana dumping the other necros, no lie. and one necro kept darknessing and then nuking rite on inc and kept dieing. what a bad group i feel sorry for him. shitty poj <br />

I tried PoD flies and wtf the xp sucks ?? I really thought it would have been better than Nadox but it's not. <br />
<br />
Veksar sounds good, will try that out this weekened with another guildie who knows the area better than me.<br />
<br />
Does HS ruin my OT faction ?<br />
<br />
Torgian Mines sounds great, I heard from another SK Fuug who solo's there I might be able to kite there at 56, though the named need to be agro kited, which should not be hard with my snare/dots and a chanter nuke and stuff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is an exp bonus<br />
The mobs don't hit to hard think 70 - 90 max.  <br />
Being an old world zone basicly the mobs don't have vary many hps either.<br />
Should be so so exp for you, but really sweet exp for your wife.<br />
