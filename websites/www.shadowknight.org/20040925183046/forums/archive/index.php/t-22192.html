<br />
HIGH-END SKs feel free to comment and or create your own top 10 list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I find it odd that SOE and we focused alot on spells for OOW lately while I heard NOTHING about AA for each class so far. We know AA way before GoD's launch. OOW launch is so close now but, yet, we don't know anything about AA.. Are they falling behind in schedule for OOW launch?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>cames</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, on my login you can no longer pre-order OoW (it also says I own 7 of 7 expansions).  My take is that they decided to dramatically delay OoW by at least 3 months to take care of the issues that came up out of the DX9 upgrade and the Dev Meeting.  If it was August before, now its November.  I suspect a whole lot more of the staff is working on non-OoW stuff.  Finally, I think that they are not publicizing OoW until they have a lot of this done for PR reasons with the customer base.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My guess is that because of the recent change to the AA back-end system in the last major patch, that they put off adding new aa skills in (since, the reason for the change was because it was not a data driven system blah blah blah... and that all of them would have to be ready before new ones went in).<br />
<br />
Previously, as we know, we could read a string file in our local directories to get a preview of what aa's were coming and then speculate what classes they were for, and whatnot.  In addition, we could try typing in /alt activate xxx and see what shows up and speculate on the results of that.<br />
<br />
However, now that the aa's are on a new system, I would guess that although the /alt activate thing would still work, it may or may not use the string files it used to for descriptions.  I'm not a techie or programmer so I don't really know but I suspect they have put off adding in new skills, and would guess they might go in soon once they catch the current crop of aa bugs which resulted from the changeover.</div></div><hr />

Instand cast terror would actually come close to being useful.  An extra 1200 hate, on demand, that can't be interrupted and doesn't use up a spell slot?  I would have a hard time saying no to that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>AoWtho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I always said Terror and Voice line should've had AA versions of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Paynreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I might as well post this here -<br />
<br />
Brael, if you DO end up in a position to talk with someone who can actually make shit happen, please inform them that they should take their damn time and really create great expansions and content instead of this shitty expansion every 6 months bullcrap. I cannot speak for everyone, but I know I sure as hell would wait very patiently for a long time to get a great expansion that really showed polish and care.<br />
<br />
Not to mention I'd be more than happy to have them push off OoW indefinately until they fucking fix their game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Xanathol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I'd change that list somewhat ( still in no order )<br />
<br />
1. Sturdiness (350 hp version)<br />
2. Suspend Minion<br />
3. Fury of Magic &amp; Fury of Magic Mastery<br />
4. Improved Theft of Life<br />
5. Innate improved lifetap ( antithesis of the healing focus AAs  )<br />
6. FD Hotkey AA<br />
7. Improved Channeling Focus<br />
8. bump weapon skill caps<br />
9. further lower HT timer<br />
10. hotkey invis and ivu ( I sympathize for those without a CoS )<br />
<br />
Most of these just catch us up; don't think we need to explicitly list whatever new ones come out. Also grouped common items together. HT can get lowered to 36 minutes now...I figure even if HT is upped, furious will eventually out do it, due to weapon damage and mob delay, as well as wizzies, for single blast, however, if we could lower the timer, it would add a small amount of DPS over time, yet give us higher DPS burst wise, more frequently. Heck, 10k over 12 minutes is 14 DPS, but on the mob you use it on, it could really add to a fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">HT AA timer reduction is what I would go for ONLY if /disc unholy aura becomes innate. <br />
<br />
Why hotkey IVU if we could ask for innate IVU AA that will serve the same purpose ALOT easier and we still can inv ourselves that stacks with innate IVU then we would become more rogue-like to sneak thru? I sure want AA innate IVU myself. ;)<br />
<br />
I want to see upgrade AA from Archtype and class AA for OOW such as 4th to 6th level beyond basic archtype etc and some upgrades from POP.<br />
<br />
Why expect OOW list that has small amount of AA skills? POP had huge AA for us and it raises level cap and new spells in one expansion. I would assume that OOW is POP v2.0 in terms of amount of new AA,spells and level. And throw in some brand-new AA such as suspend minion that lot of SK wished for and hotkey FD (still a problem for programmers I guess) and sturdiness, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Instand cast terror would actually come close to being useful.  An extra 1200 hate, on demand, that can't be interrupted and doesn't use up a spell slot?  I would have a hard time saying no to that.<br />
<br />
Atleast someone understands the value of it, I was thinking 1500 every 10 sec personally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ghismonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">1. Sturdiness (slightly lower HP version is fine)<br />
2. Stalwart Endurance<br />
3. Improved Channeling Focus<br />
4. Stonewall<br />
5. Fury of Magic<br />
6. Lifetap Adept (increases the base amount a lifetap spell or proc will heal us for, similar to Healing Adept)<br />
7. Improved ToL<br />
8. Fury of Magic Mastery<br />
<br />
Ideas for an AA feign death or AA terror or AA voice would be nice, and all get a lot of use, but I personally find those top 8 to be the most important.<br />
<br />
I would also like to stress to devs that we would like something unique.  Thus far, all of our AA are shared with other classes (except for harmtouch) and all of our requested AA come from, or are based on, other classes as well.  A little bit of creativity toward eeking out a raid niche would go a long way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Stonewall AA is kinda lame, anyways we need an upgrade to Deathpeace right?  Much rather see Deathpeace with a similar effect to stonewall built in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Askeer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">That number 10 on the list...thats a joke right?<br />
<br />
its not a joke. instant cast, mana free, buff slot free, aggro would just own.</div></div><hr />

<br />
6. FD Hotkey AA<br />
<br />
coming from a ex-monk main... I gotta say WTF! to that one.  This isn't insta cast or dosen't anyone know how to make a hotbutton /cast 2 or move a spell gem?  Really this would piss monks off to no end.<br />
<br />
An extra 1200 hate, on demand, that can't be interrupted and doesn't use up a spell slot? I would have a hard time saying no to that.<br />
<br />
I sure as hell have an easy time lol :P  Just takes any of the &quot;skill&quot; out of keeping aggro.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Okay replace skill with fun?  Just seems like another dumbing down of the game is all - like 200 sense heading.  But /shrug yer right this is an AA so by the time in the game that one would get this, if ya are a sk loosing aggro there is something wrong with ya</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Skill out of keeping aggro?  What the hell are you talking about?  You cast spell and/or turn attack on, grats aggro.<br />
<br />
Not to mention that a hotkeyed FD is different than making something to /cast #.  It's an FD that doesnt take a spell slot</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Arikash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">How would it be hard to program an FD hotkey, rangers, and maybe druids (don't know) have snare on a hotkey, wouldn't all they need to do is copy + paste, then change it so it's FD instead of snare?<br />
<br />
Yeah, there is very little skill involed in keeping aggro, when I told my WIZZIE bro what buttons did what, he kept aggro just as well as me, so unless you're a complete fucking retard, I don't see how keeping aggro is a &quot;Skill&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Ghismonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Stonewall AA is kinda lame, anyways we need an upgrade to Deathpeace right?  Much rather see Deathpeace with a similar effect to stonewall built in.<br />
<br />
I'd like the opportunity have FD not get broken by a spell.  If it's in an upgraded Feign Death spell or AA, that's fine.  In fact, I agree that it would be preferrable, though likely overpowered.  And so far, I've seen no announcement of such a spell.<br />
<br />
Dress it up, give it extra stuff, call it something different, make it innate at level 70,... whatever.  If none of that is going to happen, I want Stonewall.  This thread is about AA, Stonewall is an AA already in the game, so we've put it on our lists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Envoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">i like alot of the ideas brael has, but would like to see stonewall in there somewhere.  i enjoy pulling alot, and that would be damn handy to get.  franky im kinda pissed off that wasnt included in our GoD aa listings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>nezzka is bad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">terror on a hotkey or a snare hotkey would be hot</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Space</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">My top priority Stalwart endurance followed by fd not being interrupted by spells would be extremely useful.  HP aa's would be nice and an Incite style combat ability like a insta button Terror spell mentioned further up.<br />
Don't know about anyone else but I still see lack of dps as a problem in general although id give it all up for better base tanking ability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Gobgob frum Grobb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">terror on a hotkey or a snare hotkey would be hot <br />
<br />
TERRORS DON'T FUCKING WORK, - QUIT ASKING FOR MORE SHIT THAT IS BROKEN !!!<br />
<br />
<br />
6. FD Hotkey AA<br />
coming from a ex-monk main... I gotta say WTF! to that one. This isn't insta cast or dosen't anyone know how to make a hotbutton /cast 2 or move a spell gem? Really this would piss monks off to no end.<br />
<br />
Having FD made a insta-cast hotkey AA that is spell/AE immune, and sticking a frikkin spell gem onto a hotkey bar are two entirely different things. Fuck off back to your monk board you whining little bitch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">terrors work, they just don't work well in their current form.<br />
lets just keep this between you and me... but instant cast pure hate from a hotkey is basically not a terror at all... ssshhhhh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Gobgob frum Grobb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">terror on a hotkey or a snare hotkey would be hot <br />
<br />
If an insta-aggro hotkey is what Nezzka mean't then kewl - but associating an AA insta-aggro hotkey solution with those PIECE OF SHIT BROKEN ABORTION OF A SPELL LINE called terror spells, is just asking for us to be quapped up the ass for the umpteenth time.<br />
<br />
Terror spells are shit, infact they are worse than shit, shit might actually stick and have a chance pissing a mob off  - unlike a terror spell.<br />
A Kyv veinsplitter tells you &quot;Yo, boy, what you be throwing yo faeces aroun' at people fo' boy ? ... I gonna come over there an' fuck yo shid up fo' that !&quot;<br />
<br />
I know I may sound a bit over the top - but honestly the devs are thick as pigshit and know nothing about SK's as it is, ... if people start confusing the issue by involving the terror line of spells when talking about an AA aggro hotkey we are just setting ourselves up to stand in line for another paddling.</div></div><hr />

I like your list Breal. Only thing I would like to see included would be a self imbued proc affinity similar to the weapon affinity available. I think I would take out the Instant cast Terror (but I do like the idea of an instant cast terror).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Gaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">After having access to the top geared Warrior on SZ and after playing him on many occasions/raids, I have to say this:<br />
<br />
Give SKs the AA: Tactical Mastery<br />
<br />
You would not believe how much this helps landing hits, dps, and helps with melee agro while tanking.   We are tanks still right?  &lt;--sarcasm!!!<br />
<br />
Make sure Tactical Mastery is on the list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Valkyria Grymreaper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">If they fixed terror line to work better then it does now, then I'd be more inclined to spend aa points for an instant cast ability. Right now, I would'nt support this at all in its current state.<br />
<br />
Make terrors work as good as fear and that would be the first AA I would buy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>nytemyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Its not that terrors don't work they just don't produce enough hate by themselves. When i'm bored i'll go to a newbie zone and help them out with some of the harder mobs. Load up thule and terror and i never lose aggro with my back turned to the mob. I've tried this on harder mobs with nukers and i can still hold aggro. They should up the hate in the next spell to like 2000. Same mana/recast as CD and a cast time of .5 seconds.Or even better make it in AA hotkey. That will make us the indisputed aggro kings again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Gaxx, why would you want a dps upgrade while tanking?  It has no effect on aggro</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Terrors work perfectly, the problem with them is the scaling.<br />
Terror of Darkness=28.57 hate/sec<br />
Terror of Shadows=57.14 hate/sec<br />
Terror of Death=60 hate/sec<br />
Terror of Terris=68 hate/sec<br />
Terror of Thule=80 hate/sec<br />
<br />
If you look at that it's pretty obvious where the problem with them is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">1) death peace upgrade hotkeyed, 0.5 second cast time.<br />
2) fury of magic mastery.<br />
3) suspend minion.<br />
4) healing adept equivalent for lifetap healing portions.<br />
5) advanced theft of life.<br />
6) pestilence aura. 3 levels. decreases resist check on SK disease based spells by 10, 20, 40. (IE spears would check against neg 40 with pestilence aura 3, aura of pain would check against neg 90).<br />
7) increase spell haste cap from 50 to 65% in 5% increments (3 levels)<br />
8) hotkeyed instant cast 2000 hate, appropriate refresh (maybe every 3 minutes)<br />
9) hotkeyed 1100pt lifetap, 1 or 0.5 second cast time, 500 mana, 15 min reuse. no focus effects would alter it, so it has to be high base damage with a decent damage:mana ratio<br />
10) stun resistance (10, 20, 30% innate stun resistance)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">2000 hate every 3 min... blows, if we get a hotkeyed aggro ability it should be something we can use very often (just like paladins can use divine stun extremly often)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Gaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">My reasoning for asking for Tactical Mastery is thus:<br />
<br />
We still melee right? Granted we dont have Flurry or innate triple attack but, with SotK 3 we do have a chance for a triple attack. Tactical Mastery is an AA that focuses on our melee dps and agro (although its effect is not huge, it is something).<br />
<br />
With all these spells suggestions and such I for one would like some upgrades to our MELEE side of the coin. I highly doubt I am the only one craving some form of  a melee upgrade (be it innate or AA)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Again, how does it focus on our aggro?  Melee upgrades are fine but our melee has never been offensively oriented.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Reduced version of Sturdiness makes sense to me.  In Luclin, we all got ND to increase our hp, in PoP we got PD, and then out of the blue (GoD) Wars got Sturdiness, and we got nuffin'.  Not to mention that all melee got PE which was knight-only on Luclin release.<br />
<br />
I'd like a hotkeyed insta-lifetap too, except... we already have a 1900 hitpoint insta-cast, zero-mana, 34 minute reuse aa lifetap w/chance to crit and exe heal.  However, I wouldn't mind seeing it unlinked with IHT and HT -- that should make most of us happy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">2000 hate instantly every few mobs would be quite nice. make it one minute refresh even. i don't think it should be an AA that completely eliminates our need for other agro generation.<br />
<br />
divine stun has a 1.5 second casting time. a 1.5 second casting time on a hotkeyed terror would suck bad... so i doubt we're going to get the paladin equivalent refresh rate on instant terror.</div></div><hr />

If your going to fucking nit pick my choice of words change: &quot;focuses&quot; to &quot;Assists&quot; or any other synonym.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">gaxx,<br />
whether you hit or miss the mob makes no difference in how much agro you generate by swinging your weapon at it.<br />
tactical mastery would increase our damage output, but it would not increase our agro generation at all.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Shapiro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Never had much of a problem with aggro, but still hotkeyed Terror would be cool. I really would like to see zero to low exp rez, but that probably should be a spell. Instant FD or upgraded Death Peace would be the shyt. Id spend a phuck-load of AA's to get instant FD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Parasite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">Sorry but my 2cp about the rezz n all is:<br />
I wanna offtank in raids, I want to contribute and continue doing my job on the raids as an offtank, not as a sissy thats useless and waiting for the moment to FD to rescue my raid.. Necros have it. thats enough imo..<br />
Or what would you prefer? seeing an add taking out your clerics and chanters and being uselessstanding or FDing until your raid is wiped so you can rezz em, or being able to prevent that wipe by offtanking them? I go with option #2..<br />
<br />
Soo... Personally I go with Inferna on sturdiness, more levels of ND, ID, and LR.<br />
I wanna tank,not rezz. period.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Visvires</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">Thats noble and all, but I cant think of many situations where a SK having offtanked a mob saved the raid.<br />
<br />
Having a rez would be great for a multitude of reasons, to me it really shines in one group content.<br />
<br />
0 exp rez is a crappy idea though, because then its like<br />
<br />
&quot;no ill just run back&quot;<br />
<br />
I really liked idea suggested which was somewhere along the lines of 93% rez, hotkeyed (no component) 24 hour reuse. Thats spiffy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Skoggel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">Any rez we'd get would have to be high exp return, or yeah people aren't gonna wanna take it. At least 85% or so. Can you imagine have some problem wiping on a mob with an AE or whatever, I dunno maybe a low necro turn-out day.. something where having a necro FD to rez afterwards isn't trivial. Then you wind up having to rez clerics with a 0% exp rez or something really low? Clerics would reeeeally not like that one. :p<br />
<br />
% to resist stun would be good, even if it's just from the front. I get stunned so much when a mob first gets to camp, right when it's important for me to establish aggro. Usually it's not a problem, but bad channeling luck afterwards can make it iffy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">Can't a corpse receive a higher % exp rez after a low % one?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">No, you only get 1 exp return.<br />
<br />
Also something with res... it's actually counter productive to tanking for us.  Most raid leaders would place SK's out of a fight FD'ed incase of a wipe so they can res, I know I would... the other leaders/officers in guilds I spoke to would as well.  So that ability would actually cost us tanking in raids.  In groups I could see the merit however.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">This whole rez idea would be alot more interesting if we could get FD improved first with a hotkey and spell resistance...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">...but at that point it would also be an overpowered combination. FDing an SK as an insurance policy against raid wipeouts doesn't sound like a fun deal for us...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">While necro rez would certainly be a very nice ability to have, it's questionable in terms of balance. The justification for giving us necro rez would be to parallel paladins' rez spell, which is potentially an important asset to a group. The problem is that giving us a rez spell would then swing the pendulum too far the other direction - we would be superior to paladins, as we have the tools to survive a wipe and they do not. For it to be balanced, they'd then need something like Escape or the like, and then you start a chain-reaction balance nightmare.<br />
<br />
It's really a sticky situation, and something should be done, as paladins' rez ability gives them an advantage over us (aside from that granted by stuns and such). The problem is that balancing it is far from cut and dry. Giving us necro rez would be equivilant to the warrior upgrades from the melee balancing - taking something from too weak to too powerful. I havn't really decided what my opinion on the necro rez situation is yet, but it's definately not as cut-and-dry as alot of you are trying to make it out to be.<br />
<br />
Lets go for four times... wuwu.<br />
<br />
I'll comment on AA's later - time to go out to dinner ATM.</div></div><hr />
