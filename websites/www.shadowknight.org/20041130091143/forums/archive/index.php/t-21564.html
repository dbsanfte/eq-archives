<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zakko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ATM our Terror spell line is close to useless, compared to our lvl 15 Fear spell :(<br />
<br />
If a spell-stun component where add'd, this spell would not only generate the aggro intented, but would also make a very usefull spell for the SK to allways have memed.<br />
<br />
0.0 sec stun, max lvl 65 or 68, im not greedy, the thing i really want is the aggro, the stun would just be a bonus on 1 group hunts.<br />
<br />
Feedback it, and lets get a kewl spell :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">a level 55 0.0 sec stun would work just as well, you still get the aggro from it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">We'd get alot of aggro from the paladins also, just on principle, I imagine...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If they'd go ape over a 0 second stun, they can go fuck themselves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zakko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">True, making it max lvl 55 would work too, for me. <br />
Having a stun to stop those anoying dispells, and gate's would just be nice too, but that is not the intention with this spell i guess.<br />
<br />
I just cant help wanting a cap so high when i see the effects around, from time there are 3 effects with spell stun in it, and with max lvl 68.<br />
The Warriors time weapon is even neg400 to resist ! Hell change Terror line from unresistable to neg400 magic, and have it stun as high as 68, and im happy :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The spells should remain as pure hate, if they provide anything else the justification to make them the absolute best taunt spells in the game disappears.  The problem is they don't scale correctly, theres a bigger gap in raw hate generation between the level 34 and 44 Terrors as there is between the 44 and 63 Terrors.  Even if they scaled in static amounts (which they shouldn't) and never gained efficency (which they don't and they should) to have something similar to proper scaling it would have to be worth 1071 hate per cast with 107 mana cost at 1.5 cast and 6 recast.  Thule isn't even worth 60% of that right now, the problem isn't with the spells themselves it's with the absolutely horrible scaling of them.<br />
<br />
The spells need to be this:<br />
Terror of Darkness: 231 hate, 23 mana<br />
Terror of Shadows: 485 hate, 44 mana<br />
Terror of Death: 765 hate, 63 mana<br />
Terror of Terris: 1073 hate, 80 mana<br />
Terror of Thule: 1410 hate, 97 mana<br />
OoW Terror Spell: 1782 hate, 111 mana<br />
1 cast 6 recast on each</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zakko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I dont agree, for me the Terror line seems bugged.<br />
<br />
If i pull with Terror of Thule, and a Rogue (what ever) attack's, the Rogue gets aggro right away. This doesn't happen if i start out by casting a lvl 15 Fear spell.<br />
<br />
If i use arrow to pull with, and then after the rogue attack's, and perhaps gets aggro, the Terror spell will give me my aggro back.<br />
<br />
This is where the spell fail's, cause where i need it the most, is for &quot;Dry Tanking&quot; aka, holding a mob with out doing damage.<br />
<br />
See if i cast Terror on the mob, to hold it untill the Enchanter / Bard get's it mezzed, i will not be successfull. <br />
1st spell Mezzer cast (would usualy be a tash or a resisted mezz) they get aggro off me. Even worse, the healer trying to keep me alive while holding for Mezzer to mezz, dies on 1st heal, because of the no good Terror spell.<br />
<br />
So Terror needs a direct hate component, not just more &quot;aggro&quot;. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Raw hate + a 1 tick, no damage, 5% snare  or 0 sec, low lvl limit stun wouldn't exactly be much of a justification for them to not be the best taunt either.  Well, at least no moreso than warriors whining about how uber diamondskin and resist cold are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The terror line isn't bugged and I've proven it before.  Fear for all purposes seems to exceed the initial aggro cap (hi bug).  What I said is direct hate components what you're asking for is what causes the spells aggro to be variable based on the mob (and they would still be less hate than what I suggested btw).<br />
<br />
Slein, what would having 0 sec stuns do?  Hi spell interrupts for under 55 SK's.  A 5% snare would actually be useful to considering it's unresistable, don't know about you but I can actually think of a use for that even at a 1 tick duration.<br />
<br />
Top end Warriors generate about 15000 hate per minute right now.  Look at what these spells would generate on a per minute basis (8.57 casts/min).<br />
<br />
Also, since 1 sec cast spells do have problems on occasion espically if you were chain casting them, which these spells have definite potential to have done at times heres the spells moved from 7 sec per use to 7.5 sec (1.5 cast 6 recast) plus 5% more aggro to compensate for lost melee.<br />
<br />
Terror of Darkness: 259 hate, 25 mana<br />
Terror of Shadows: 543 hate, 47 mana<br />
Terror of Death: 857 hate, 67 mana<br />
Terror of Terris: 1202 hate, 86 mana<br />
Terror of Thule: 1579 hate, 104 mana<br />
OoW Terror Spell: 1996 hate, 119 mana<br />
<br />
Those spells would be the best source of aggro in the game hands down.  With how aggro is in the game right now they would be more efficent too when combined with our melee (which we would be able to use for aggro also as our focus wouldn't have to be on chain casting) also unlike our current spells when using them we would be able to hold mobs for mezzing much better than we can now.  If you wan't to add something else to these spells let them bypass intial aggro caps naturally (not as a result of a bug) just to further cement them being the best aggro source in the game.  Possibly allow &quot;to all&quot; focus to affect them also, not sure on that idea but it's to compete with the hate gap still shrinking in comparison to Warrior aggro and would be targeted correctly since the same point where Warrior aggro takes a huge jump we get access to lots of focus items which would work in this case.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Put a level limit well below the SK's level on each one - the 34 terror could have a lvl 20 limit for example.  Whatever - you can make the stun basically irrelivant.  It'll give the aggro just the same.  <br />
<br />
As for the snare, it wouldn't be anything game breaking... at least if your thinking of what I think your thinking of.  It's impact wouldn't be huge, and keep in mind that it still wouldn't land on snare-immune mobs.  <br />
<br />
That said, the point is simply that piling on the raw hate isn't the only option... though I'm not saying that they couldn't work as pure hate either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Raw hate isn't the only solution but it is the best one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'm not necessarily convinced, but in all honestly, it'd likely prove 6 of one, half a dozen of the other.  Either way the terror's get fixed, fixing them will have essentially the same effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">One of them scales by the mob providing more aggro on some places and less in others.  The other always gives the exact same amount and can be tuned around other classes hate generation much easier.  Also they're far easier to improve on, you simply add hate and improve the ratio, stuns all give the same aggro unless you add something else to the spell to, they're entirely dependant upon the mob for how the hate changes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Well according to Rytan (in charge of spells), the way these spells work at level 65 is broken. He said that in order to fix them, it would require a tremendous amount of work, so it's not happening.<br />
<br />
The only SKs that mem Terrors are the uninformed or the stupid. 99% of us don't.<br />
<br />
These provide poor initial aggro, and virtually no snap aggro, and in my opinion the pure hate should be scrapped for something that works.<br />
<br />
I like the 0.0 second stun idea, and frankly the level of effect could scale with the level of the spell and it would still not be over powering. Even a no damage snare is fine as an alternative.<br />
<br />
Cast time needs to be fast, recast time needs to be very fast. Recast is more important, six seconds is too long. Three is more appropriate. Wasting two spell slots on Terrors is a joke.<br />
<br />
Brael you mention in several other threads that due to stun spells, pallies out tank us in experience groups. One of the best suggestions that I have heard you say is for SKs to get a Fear2 line of spells. Why not replace Terrors with them?<br />
<br />
If they don't fix these spells, or make them a viable choice with fast cast and recast times, fine. I will continue to use the Fear and Darkness lines. But for god sakes, don't waste an Omens spell continuing a spell line we KNOW is not doing what it was intended to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">They could do that for us, but if they're going to remain as taunt spells they should be pure hate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Or if you wanted to have the aggro generated be able to scale, start with a base 0.0 second stun, and add a pure hate component to it as higher level versions of the spells are introduced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I tend to agree with Siilvir on this one...<br />
<br />
The fact that the hate on stun/snare/etc. effects scales to the content could be viewed as a positive also.  <br />
<br />
As for scaling the spells, I already mentioned using such an effect + raw hate.  Increasing the amount of raw hate, perhapse decreasing cast time or recast time, etc. would make additions to the spell line useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Positive until you're in GoD and realise spell aggro here is generally lower than pure hate (with the exception of Fear in a handful of zones... grats bug!).<br />
<br />
I really don't see how the spells are broken at 65, if anything whats wrong with them is that they don't scale up to higher aggro output as melee advance further.  The spells themselves generate the amount of hate they're supposed to as far as tests have shown.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>spanky4458</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">correct me if I am wrong, but is the only real problem with the terror line that the hate is not scaled high enough.  Or is it something more complicated than that?  Why is it necesary to add a stun component insted of just increaseing the amount of hate?<br />
<br />
At lvl 51 the terror lines seem to work ok for me.  I mainly use them when darkness is resisted and I have to taunt.  After a succesful taunt I cast 2 or 3 between swings in order to give me enough time to cast another darkness.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Those Terror line spells are actually at their most effective at the lower levels, they end up losing efficiency later on.<br />
<br />
Also, Spanky, you might be making the mistake of trying to use your Dooming Darkness for aggro (or you may not be). If you try out using the lowest one, Clinging Darkness, for aggro you'd end up saving alot of mana. Resisted or &quot;does not take hold&quot; messages shouldn't discourage you, the SK snare spells still generate a large amount of aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>spanky4458</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I only use my top level darkness when I have kei in which case mana isnt a problem for me.  And Ive noticed that when it gets resisted ill get agro and lose it pretty quick.  Anyways, if they loose there efectiveness as you get higher in level then why dont they just scale up the higher spells?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Yes Rytan said they were not working at 65 the way they should be. <br />
<br />
We can debate whether or not they create the amount of hate they are supposed to, but the bottom line is that they are utterly uneffective for creating fast aggro, relative to other methods. <br />
<br />
Either fix them or discontinue the spell line.</div></div><hr />
