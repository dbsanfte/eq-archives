<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, since we did not get a lot of the AA’s that were suggested, I am thinking we should start a thread early in preparation of the next expansion! Many people brought up some great ideas on how they would like to improve the shadowknight class, and if we have a good thread (no flaming please) perhaps we can get the ear of the developers for the next release.<br />
<br />
I am wondering if this is a waste of time or am I just wasting time while at work, but here goes my top 10 (in no specific order)<br />
<br />
1) Knights Advantage 2 – for 5 AA points Knights Advantage will work for 1 or 2 hand weapons<br />
<br />
2)Speed of the Knight 2 – for 5 AA points Speed of the knight will work for 1 or 2 hand weapons<br />
<br />
3)Knights specialty – 5 levels, 5 AA per level…choose one weapon type (but only one weapon type)…+5 to skill per level. If you choose a 1 hand weapon type you also get a +5 to bash skill<br />
<br />
4)Shield Spikes – 5 levels, 2 AA per level…shield must be equipped…+2 to bash damage, +2 to damage shield, +2 to AC per level<br />
<br />
5)Speed of the Vampire -10 AA - Upgrades Torrent of Hate to also include Haste debuff (25%)/ group buff (25%)…haste recourse goes into bard song area<br />
<br />
6)Strengthened Shadows – 3 Levels, 2/4/6 AA – Upgrades diamondskin by 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0x<br />
<br />
7)Shroud Research – 10 AA – through years of research you learn to combine shroud of chaos and mental corruption into one application (you get a new spell here), Mental Chaos…50 <br />
damage, 50 mana recourse, 50 health recourse<br />
<br />
8)Improved Leechcurse (Note: leechcurse, not leechtouch) – 3 levels 2/4/6 AA…increase length of duration and reduce timer by 10%, 25%, and 50%<br />
<br />
9)Strengthened Bones – 20 AA – the ability to summon a pet 5 levels greater then your current pet.<br />
<br />
10)Reckless banshee – 3 Levels 3/6/9 – improve Banshee Aura damage and duration by 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0<br />
<br />
Now that would be a good AA lineup in my opinion. I do not want more spells, I just want to improve what we already have. Also, I think these goes well with us being a offensive based knight or plate class.<br />
<br />
Thoughts? Comments?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">an update...<br />
<br />
I just got spell casting fury last night, and while it was nice to see my taps and spears going off on occasion for double damage, my thoughts to myself were <br />
<br />
&quot;damn, for 12 AA points in total, I had hoped to get more crits then this!&quot;<br />
<br />
Based upon that statement, I am understanding while people are wishing for more AA's to advance our spell casting fury and / or our Theft of life (only have ToL 2 atm).<br />
<br />
just my 2cp and hoping (why, I don't know) that a developer will read this thread. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">After seeing what they did to us in GoD I am getting the impression that they do not want us to improve.  THis is their way to take Knights out of the tanking role.<br />
<br />
Notice the lack of spells and aa in GoD that have anything to do with improving our tanking ability.<br />
<br />
So if anything we need to focus on impoving DPS more then anything and our pulling ability.<br />
<br />
I would like some of the monk pulling ability's like harmony and stonewall myself.<br />
<br />
If I can't tank anymore let me pull then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Androsulach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, would it be too much to ask that they give us an improved undead mez after Rest The Dead.  Necros get Rest The Dead at 24.  They get Death's Silence at 63, which effects undead 59 and under.  I don't know, but I'd think we should get a lesser version or something to augment our pulling ability.  After all, Clerics and Paladins get Pacify which tends to be used quite a bit in pulling.  Makes pulling a lot easier and a bit less likely to attract adds.<br />
<br />
<br />
If not a spell.  An aa that allows us a chance to paralyze a mob in terror.  Not something to make the mob run, just something to lock them into their own terror and not notice what's happening.<br />
<br />
<br />
I like the ideas on the extensions to Knight's Advantage and Speed of the Knight.  I like the added AC of 1h and shield.<br />
<br />
As far as the Shield Spikes.  I guess we'll need to see how much of an effect the two bash AA's and our DS AA have on our tanking ability, before we start wanting upgrades to them.<br />
<br />
Besides, have they added in what they've been talking about doing with shields to make their use more common?  I haven't seen anything about it in the last 3 months or so.  I think it got pushed back as they got GoD put together as well as the melee upgrades and it'll probably be after the engine upgrade before they get around to putting anything on Test.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">After seeing monks get a lull, its clear we need at least an upgrade to the undead lull line we already have, even tho undead lull is only marginally useful. And... Necro rez would really up our utility in things like GoD trials, where if you can rez the cleric after a rough pull, you've saved the group from wiping essentially. Since its clear SoE doesn't want us doing our primary role of tanking except as a distant second fiddle, we better load up on utility spells :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">ok, a couple other ideas<br />
<br />
Stabilizing Auras...15 AA, one level....with this AA your aura of pain and aura of hate will not reduce in value over time. The time limit is the same, but the effect does not decay.<br />
<br />
Group Aura...15 AA...need stabilizing aura completed...your aura of pain and aura of hate become group recourse buffs<br />
<br />
Raid Aura...15 AA...need Stabilizing aura and group aura for this...your aura of pain and aura of hate become recouse buffs to all raid members<br />
<br />
This would make us a wanted member in raids and groups and help both our tanking and DPS! Too bad I don't work for SOE! :p <br />
<br />
How about these ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Raids love recourse buffs they can't click off...<br />
<br />
You have an instinct towards a raid roll that actually marginalizes SKs more than it helps them. MGB debuff/power tap buffs? That isnt much more usefull than MGB BSS...and with 3-5 SKs the redundancy implied is senseless.<br />
<br />
Think about this also: gith our group AE recourses, the range is fairly limited to begin with. In most raids, healers in the chain are trying to heal the tank from maximum range. With a '100 range and given the highly mobile nature of raiding as a SK (pulling, aggro management, kiting, rampage tanking)...the fit isnt terrific.<br />
<br />
Becoming a utility buff whore on raids isn't fun or cool...think of how BSTs are treated...&quot;wow, awesome mana regen MGB...who's fucking pet is that!?!!&quot;<br />
<br />
It is the things that we are good at that merit the most attention, not marginally usefull new areas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">KA or SotK whichever affects double attacks, works on 1h weapons already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">you sure?...the AA reads two handed weapons. Is our AA sticky thread out of date? <br />
<br />
(I am at work so cannot look it up)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Radahsam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Since when does Knight's Advantage work with 1-handers?  This is news to me.  The AA description within the game itself states that it is for 2-handers.  Of course, the description could be wrong, but I have not yet gotten KA because I'm currently wielding a 1-hander and will probably do so for a good bit longer.  If they would ever give us our rumored shield mitigation, I would probably stay with the 1h setup, since I value my tanking ability more than my melee DPS ability.<br />
<br />
My wish list is simple:<br />
<br />
EE rez<br />
Limited abilty to FD through spells, including AEs<br />
Better mitigation<br />
Combined mana/hp proc buff<br />
<br />
And if they insist on requiring defensive for 1-group encounters, we have got to have some form of defensive as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>aress</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">who will be left by the next expansion? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Xanathol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">/agree aress :)<br />
<br />
Just give us a form of defensive ( whether its something like the 'mana' idea thread, disc, whatever ). It can be on a 2 hour reuse timer, and if that's all we got, I'd still be happy.<br />
<br />
If not the above, I would like:<br />
1. AA to Hotkey FD ( I still dream the dream )<br />
2. suspend minion<br />
3. undead lull with same level restrictions as 'monk lull'<br />
4. The original 'Black Shroud' definition that was on test when first introduced, and actually make it accessable to non-Time SKs.<br />
<br />
All this and I might be a happy customer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Apothos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I like alot of those ideas, but perhaps this one would not be bad added on:<br />
<br />
Along with Knight Specialization: for 2h weapon only<br />
<br />
Shield equip with 2 hand weapon. <br />
<br />
It adds AC, bashing ability, and could have the full effect of a 2hs. Let's face it, one wears a shield tied to the forearm, not carried within the hand. There for the use of this skill has merit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kanigit007</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">25% Defenisive would be nice.<br />
Duration 2:00 Minutes<br />
Reuse 20 Minutes<br />
(I rather the Pally's get that.)<br />
<br />
Or<br />
<br />
An AA that makes Leechcurse more effective<br />
1.5x, 2x or 2.5x Crit Healing per hit would put us on par.<br />
<br />
I can see myself land a Cripple for 750, and with the disc heal myself 1725 - and take myself outa low hitpoint status (I can't really call it berzerker frenzy because we dont get the strength buff).<br />
<br />
-- <br />
<br />
Of course give us an AA that would give us straight up Htps.<br />
Maybe 300.<br />
<br />
<br />
Any other off beat suggestions?<br />
<br />
-K</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Lejina Bloodbath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Knight's Avantage always worked with 1handers.<br />
<br />
Been know for almost a year, only took a few month after the release of PoP to know this. Since the paladins are more shield happy than the shadowknights in general, this find made more sound on their board than ours. I believe a post has been made on sk.org back then and has been just about ignored.<br />
<br />
KA simply increase your chance of a successful double attack check, regardless of the weapon equiped, while Speed of the Knight seems to actually require a 2handed weapon to be equiped.</div></div><hr />
