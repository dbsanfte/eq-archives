How fucking pathetic is this.  This is something that should have been coded in for free long ago.  I cannot beleive that this is one of the main points to purchase SOE's new expansion for EQ.  I don't want to have to pay for 16 bank slots.  I don't have an issue paying for a new race complete with starting city.  I don't have an issue paying for new zones from level 35-60 (the question is how many will there be and of what quality).  New spells are always fun to get so I don't mind paying for those.  Dye for armor should have been put in for free long ago as well but I am willing to even pay for that.  However, having to purchase an expansion for fucking bank slots screams &quot;Our new expansion is going to suck so bad that THIS is one of its high points!&quot;.  Anyway I feel better</div></div><hr />

Yep, never said that.  I said I would not mind paying for most of the expansion.  I said why pay for something that should have been changed already.  Players have wanted more bank slots since pre-kunark yet they have not done the minor coding changes it requires to offer them until now?  I think SOE makes a considerable profit and I have no problem paying for new content.  This is something that should not require an expansion to have.  It is sad when they have to use expansions to fix the limits of their game instead of using them to offer completely new content.</div></div><hr />

Ah, so I take it you are very well versed in the EQ Engine and Code and know exactly which few lines they needed to change to double our bank space.</div></div><hr />

Actually the better comparison is:<br />
DAoC already has larger bank storage, a better looking for group method, and player dyed armor.  SOE obviously &quot;borrowed&quot; these tools from its competitor and is implementing them as &quot;new&quot; content in its expansion.  The Diablo games do not compare to the depth or continued fun either EQ of DAoC offer.  At least compare apples to apples instead of shit to apples.</div></div><hr />

No, actually you pay 12.95 a month to SUBSCRIBE  to their network, for them to have that network available to you, and for you to get the minimal customer service. <br />
<br />
If you want new stuff pay for it. That is the way it always has been.</div></div><hr />

Warrens<br />
Stonebrunt Mountains<br />
Paineel<br />
The Hole<br />
Plane of Fear<br />
Plane of Hate<br />
MP3 Player<br />
And more that I have forgotten<br />
<br />
Those are &quot;new stuff&quot; we didn't pay for,  part of our subscription fee is for the game to be enhanced and SOE has even said so.<br />
<br />
And as Aaoogaa said, the improvment of current game features are covered by our monthly fee and we shouldn't need to pay for them.<br />
<br />
Getting a bunch of new things added like a race: yes we should pay for wich we do. The expantion (extention) can stand on its own with the Frogs, bunch of new zones and new spells and the other features should be offered up free for all subscribers.<br />
<br />
Ive allready pre ordered LoY so either way I will get the updated features but SOE should really remember what the hell it tells players before making themselves look like assholes.</div></div><hr />

And perhaps you'd like to dig up these mystical epistles of Gordon which say <br />
<br />
&quot;and the great Absor didst appear among his people and say, yea, truly I say unto you, We shalt never charge thee for changes in the game engines and databases, e'en tho they take much time and much energy and much slaving over code to produce, for these shalt be covered by thy monthly tithe, and I send you this rainbow as a sign of the covenant, that you shalt not pay more than the monthly tithe. So let it be written, so let it be done. Amen, Amen, Amen.&quot; First Verant Chapter 2, Verses 3-4</div></div><hr />

Though I'm not at liberty to give a cent by cent breakdown on where your $9.89 a month goes, suffice it to say that after rent, customer service, ISP charges, equipment costs, utilities, operations personnel, and continued development, our profit margin is less than an ISP with a similar number of subscribers. <br />
<br />
&quot;Continued development&quot; covers things such as maintainence, and content additions to the game. <br />

BTW try reading the entire thread, I never did say the expantion should be free you fucking moron.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jobrill</div><div class="date">01-26-2003, 04:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You did however say the expanded bank slots should be free, and you still have not produced anything which undoubtedly says that. <br />
<br />
The fact is, Adding those 8 extra slots may very well have taken some slaving over some very complicated and messy code, as well as maybe even purchasing of new hardware to hold the extra data needed, Overtime on the part of some coders to get the stuff figured out, and Thule knows what else. The very fact that they have said more bank slots would be &quot;impossible&quot; seems to speak to this. Impossible with computers and/or games usually means &quot;too time-consuming and hard to code,&quot; not &quot;not doable at all ever.&quot; A Small One-time charge to cover the coding seems not to be too much to ask.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rezzbagg</div><div class="date">01-26-2003, 04:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The thing here is you don't HAVE to buy anything. If you have gotten this far without the extra room, and they offer you the option to upgrade, you have a choice if you wish to do so. They are fully within their right to include whatever they want for free, or as an expansion. <br />
<br />
It's funny that there was so much speculatiion about what was going to be in the new expansion, and no one ever mentioned bank slots. Yet they decide to include something as a bonus, which there wasn't a huge demand for, and now people are crying about it. Get over it, pay for it or keep your ten slots, either way you aren't OWED a damn thing. They could have just as easily not upgraded them at all.<br />
<br />
Recently they have released many new features FOR FREE, window mode, cd player, eqim. They also have released features that you have to pay for, new levels, planar aa's, easier travel, epic 2.0 :p . So you get some for free and they ask you to pay for some, big deal.<br />
<br />
Yes I know the reasoning for window mode may not be as altruistic as SOE would like you to believe, but who gives a shit, it was free.<br />
<br />
Bottom line, you pay a monthly fee for the product as it is now. SOE is expected to provide the product you paid for and to maintain it reasonably. Regardless if one dev said that upgrades are included. I gaurantee you the dev team knows exactly jack shit about the accounting aspects of their company.<br />
<br />
So if you feel that you are being ripped off, you have a few choices, speak with your wallet, cancel your subscription, and be done with EQ, or play the same game you have been playing, don't buy the expansion, and you neither lose or gain anything and pay no extra money, or buy the expansion and shut the fuck up. Actually no matter what you choose you should still shut the fuck up.</div></div><hr />
