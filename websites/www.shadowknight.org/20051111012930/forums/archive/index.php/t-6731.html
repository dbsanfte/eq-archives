<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TaurusL</div><div class="date">10-11-2002, 03:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Use a shroud at max spell range on one of the first two guardians, will come solo that way about 95% of the time.  After those first are dead,  either go right or left, aggro something and then run like a bitch back to the top.  (Make sure you are aware you need to jump to a corner and then up top to get back up)  Watch for a roamer and always pull from the first door you see.  Not the Wurm at the end of the hall, usually brings alot of adds if not cleared to him first.   FD is best usually at the top of the stairs.  Have a tagger/MT you have worked with quite a bit and it works seamlessly.<br />

Experiment, Die.  Basically take your first two trips as learning experience on what you can and can't do then work from there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Countic</div><div class="date">10-11-2002, 03:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Expect a lot of death in learning.  The way I prefer to break the &quot;pit&quot; where the two guardians are is to do what the other person stated-pull one at max range with a non damage spell.  It *should* come single if you are 60-although certainly expect that both may aggro.  Also there are two wanderers that wander by the pit, make sure they aren't near when you try to pull the guardians.  When you cast on the 1st guardian make sure you watch to see if the other one is coming.  If it is, feign till they return, and try again.  If your guild can handle both AEers at the same time then dont worry about it and just bring both.  However, where I differ from the last post is that once the 2 guardians are dead I suggest you have your guild move into the pit.  Trying to jump back up onto the ledge can be tedious and cause many deaths (which would bring about the two guardians respawning again, and do it all over).  If you move into the pit you will have at most 2 wanderers/adds.  Neither of these will be AE'ing mobs (or at least the AE is petty, not some 300dd like guardians).  Once the pit is clear you can begin to pull from the halls.  *note* do NOT ever open the door to dozekar's room, and make it widely known in your guild not to-you dont want him to add if he is up.  To pull from the halls I suggest you have harmshield and death peace up.  If you arent 60 and are using regular feign death i would suggest having a pair of blood ember leggings in order to rapid feign as needed.  Harmshield makes for great damage reduction when pulling *already* successful singles back to camp (especially those guardians that deal a ton of damage to you as you go back).  As for finding mobs in HoT and trying to split them apart: Take note of what mobs move faster than others-you can often split them by rapid feigning to eventually get them far enough apart so someone else can tag one.  Aggro range is huge in HoT, make sure you have lots of room for tagging and make sure the mobs are very far apart.  Always make QUICK peers around each corner.  Often times there are mobs right around the corner that will add if you dont watch where you are going.  If you take quick glances or use bird's eye viewing you can often see around the corner to see whats there before it adds.  Lots of mobs wander in HoT.  If you see 2 or 3 mobs together then you can probably wait 30 seconds and end up with 1 seperating from the other 2 for an easy single.  Never train camp.  Ask your raid leaders how many mobs are *at max* acceptable for pulling into camp ahead of time (note that guardians are mouch tougher than normal mobs because of the AE so if you can only handle 3 normal mobs you probably cannot handle 2 guardian wurms).  If you end up with more than that number of acceptable pulls into camp then dont train camp, die somewhere outside of camp and out of aggro range-but easy for a corpse retrieval if possible.  If you are in a guild thats just starting out in HoT then always ask the clerics how their mana is-suggested you do this in tells to the cleric leader so as to not hog /gu space.  If your guild has done HoT many many times and its trivial then you probably don't need to ask after each pull but instead just wait for the clerics or raid leaders to say they need some med time.  Hope this helps bud.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Venr</div><div class="date">10-11-2002, 10:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">simple guide to single pulling the pit wurms.. <br />
<br />
1. stand just outside the aggro range of one wurm, while being out of line of sight of teh second wurm.<br />
2. pull with spell, arrow or whatever, both will come.<br />
3. fd and let them reset.<br />
4. get up and pull the same wurm again, it will come solo everytime<br />
<br />
for some reason, when you let them reset, they sit slightly further apart than they do when they spawn, this allows you to use line of sight of pull them single. just make sure the roamers that path through the pit aren't in the pit when you pull..<br />
<br />
edit: be warned, wurms warp instead of walking normally which means you tank em for most of teh pull, DA is very benificial for the long wurm pulls.. Wish i had the spell back when i pulled HoT =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dalmoth</div><div class="date">10-15-2002, 02:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Simpler advice.<br />
<br />
Split the first two mobs in the pit.<br />
<br />
Kill the roamers as they appear.<br />
<br />
Move into the halls, no more pulling, move into to position, MT pulls the mob with a short range bow shot, kill it, then move to the next mob.<br />
<br />
More entertaining, more kills over time, less deaths on the puller no realy problems as long as you know where the wanderers can be and when.</div></div><hr />

I pulled with an arrow after creeping forward to about 3 tiles back from start of the stairs on the inner wall (out of LOS of the other mob). Shot the guardian and got both, FDed where i stood (RDed first time oh well), when i repeated that only the one mob came and it was easy meat once we had people doing their positioning properly. <br />
After we cleared both i had a little practise on that jump up from the pit to the stairs. Very Lara Croft it was.<br />
There is a very detailed guide at Monkly Business with a nice map too...<br />

We got a plate bp first kill. Not that i won it, but still goes to show.</div></div><hr />
