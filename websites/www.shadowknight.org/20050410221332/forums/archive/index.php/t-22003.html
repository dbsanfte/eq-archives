<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Silku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Alright, is there anyway to tell if the real grieg is up without going all the way up to his room?  I mean its annoying as hell to find him on track, and then see hie's not up even if he should be date wise. <br />
<br />
Any info?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">since the revamp there are no &quot;fake&quot; griegs... track works fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Silku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hrm that's odd.  Last night we fought all the way in, and Grieg was standing there. Targetable and all.  But he wouldn't aggro, he would attack for a few seconds and then boom stop attacking and just stand there.  We assumed he was the fake one since pets wouldn't attack him at all, but if fake was removed during revamp something else is oging on .. anyone else got any similar experiences recenlty?  :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ninaelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">did you kill all the shadow masters? my understanding is if some of the shadow masters are still alive then grieg is not fully aware of his surroundings and he will not agro unless you get extremely close.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gordrach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'd say that having him attack you is getting close enough to get aggro.  Any update on Grieg's situation?  Is this a bug?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nambkab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Back when we were farming him, we would use track, and if he was up on track, he was up when we got there.  Not sure on the shadow master thing, we just always killed them all before engaging him.  The ones circling him have linked aggro though, so be warned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Silku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">We pulled all of his shadow masters, and could actually walk all the way into him.  He was physically there, targetable etc.  however, he would not aggro and when you tried to cast on him it would say you cannot affect this target.  It would also not allow me to send in pet to aggro.  One of our main tanks said this was because it was the illusion, but if the illusion has been removed... then it is something else.   Waiting for us to be up for that rot again to see if I can find more info.</div></div><hr />
