We were the only exp penalized races in the group. Everyone was ranting and raving about the exp they were getting while we mowed stuff down in PoD. Most were 61 including myself and Herbie (hey herb!) the other troll in the group. I got 2% exp in 60mins. Others in the group got 5-6% in the same period of time.<br />
<br />
Any other trolls/iksars notice painfully slow exp in 61?</div></div><hr />

That has the feel of class xp penalty added in to boot...</div></div><hr />

Its almost like we are back to the old system of double class/race penalties.  This needs to be looked at.  I remember it took me 3 months to get 51 done back in the old days of xp hell.   I am getting under 1 blue xp an hour doing Juggs, Pop Zones, etc for xp.  Most classes cant solo now for xp post 60, so I can see Troll/Iksar SK taking months to gain a level.  While we are still 62 the rest of you will be 64 or 65.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I grabbed a group and ran into PoD last night, killing rats and mosquitoes.<br />
<br />
I went in with 0 % exp showing in 61, though I know I had a decent amount there, since I'd died at least 7 times since dinging Tuesday and regained 61 every time with 96% rez.  Yes...I was getting a little experience between each death, but I was on a PoSky raid from Monday through Wednesday, so the exp wasn't rolling in.<br />
<br />
Anyway, in about 30 minutes of fighting in the Plane of Disease, I was up to 2% regular exp.  I may well have been at the &quot;top&quot; of where 0% goes to 1%, so that may still validate your findings.<br />
<br />
The other members were talking about how much exp they were getting, and I'd heard bad things about 61, so figured it was  supposed to be going that slow...but I failed to double-check with the other two 61's there about how many percentage points/blue bubbles they'd received.  It wasn't perfect, though.  The other 61's were a Troll Shaman and Human Paladin...it wouldn't have been a good &quot;baseline&quot; comparison, as one would still have a racial penalty and the other is a hybrid, but those samples still could have been used to compare and contrast.<br />
<br />
I'll see if I can do some controlled studies tonight with some fellow 61's.<br />
<br />
One other thing.  There was a patch today.  It's possible that it's already been fixed and we'll never get any word from VI...err...Sony on it.  So you people who like to jump on people for paranoia might want to not rip into people here for being crazy if you log in tonight and you can't find anything to support this theory.<br />
<br />
Out.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaotix</div><div class="date">10-25-2002, 02:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I solo the dk blue katta guards with KEI, 58 pet up (always strengthen death buffed), Standard self buffs, iky bp, Argent Protecter, 2hs maxed, ~220 str, ~1000 atk, and 22% haste (schw). No FT or Focus items.<br />
<br />
I get a blue to a blue and a half  of regular xp per kei (not extra extended version).<br />
<br />
I never have down time for heals or mana with kei - so this is constant pulls.<br />
<br />
I am doing constant sword atk and chanelling thru on snare with dooming and fears with invoke.  I throw in the 400dmg spear spell as soon as it refreshes.  I life tap only when needed, but that isnt too often.  If I tap too much just for dps, then Im down to med.<br />
<br />
Most solo classes I talk to tell me 1 to 1.5 blue per kei sucks :/<br />
<br />
What is xp like off katta guards for you non penalized peeps?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Treznor</div><div class="date">10-25-2002, 02:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The penalty is aweful and i dont see why its still applies to 61+ originally it was because our regen made a difference and it did levelling up from 1 to 60 where you could exp of blues who did not hit to hard, put on a fungi and you could have very little down time.<br />
<br />
Now however mobs hit alot harder negating any benefit we get from our regen, and also regen from items is capped at 30, making races who have extra regen really dont have any benefit at all.  I've  grouped with the same bunch of ppl everyday, they are all now 65 and i'm still 64, me and a troll shaman had to duo for several hours while they slept to catch up.<br />
<br />
I've not ran any numbers to confirm this but roughly if your a troll by the time you get 64, if you were another race without a penalty you would be 65, which fits in with 20%.  Kinda annoying when someone in the group had to leave for a few hours and they are behind only to catch you and pass you up when they have been back for a few hours.  There is absolutely no reason why this racial penalty still exists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eatbugs</div><div class="date">10-25-2002, 02:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">*shrug* I haven't noticed a larger penalty on either my Beastlord or SK, (both trolls) in PoP or out of it. <br />
<br />

<br />
Um, Troll and Iksar regen goes way up in the upper 50's. Things hitting you harder doesn't negate your regen, you still regain health faster than other races.  (18 hp per tick sitting, at 60 - and I suspect it jumps again after that) Aside from that, we get bash using a two-handed weapon without paying AA's for it.  I knew what I was paying that penalty for when I started both characters.  I don't regret it now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Groobash</div><div class="date">10-25-2002, 02:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Was in PoD group today...full group of 57-61. Only two 60s were me and a high elf wiz.<br />
<br />
I remembered this thread so I asked her how her xp was going and found that I had got 9% of 60, while she got 14%. Same kills, no deaths, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rukog DethBryngr</div><div class="date">10-25-2002, 03:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe my math is a little off...but that 9% to 14% seems to reflect about a 20-25% racial penalty. (Used to be 25% for Trolls, but was rolled back to 20%??)<br />
<br />
Had you been a Human SK telling me the same thing, I'd be worried.<br />
<br />
Actually, I just pulled out the calculator, and ran some numbers.<br />
<br />
If 14% is the &quot;baseline&quot;, then 75% (25% troll penalty) of that would be 10.5 %.<br />
<br />
80% of that (if it's 20% troll penalty) would be 11.2%.<br />
<br />
Remember, those percentages are pretty rough figures...not giving the ACTUAL exp in the bar.  It's quite possible that your 9% was just 1 or 2 real exp points away from &quot;ticking it over&quot; to 10%, and the High Elf's 14% was reflecting JUST getting into 14%.<br />
<br />
When you're dealing with millions of hitpoints and not seeing decimal places, 1% of the total can encompass a WIDE range of points.<br />
<br />
(Edit):  And I don't know if anyone knows at what point the percentages &quot;roll&quot; to the next point...if you were 10.49% through, would it round down and still show as 10%?  Would 10.5% actual calculation round UP to 11%?  Does it defy logic and wait until you actually CROSS the point where the 11% range starts, so 10.99% actual would still show up as 10%?  *shrug*</div></div><hr />

While I definitely agree with Treznor's post, I think it's all worth it in the end.  We have to work a little harder, but we're still the best race of the best class in the game.<br />
<br />
Uh oh, the drugs are wearing off.... lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Herbert Dalovebug</div><div class="date">10-25-2002, 05:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Before you start readin', no, none of these numbers were pulled outta the blue. :p<br />
<br />
So I tried soloing in FG today, for an hour with KEI.  6 mobs from my patch, 2-3 from another patch, then back to my patch and repeat.  I netted 3% of exp in 61, went from 11 to 14%.  Steady non-stop kills. (Edit, wrote the wrong number)<br />
<br />
Started talkin' in guild, and I found a rogue in PoD killing the same mobs I was killing last night.  He got 10% Exp in 61, and 17% on his AA (He was splitting his exp) for 2 hours of exping.  I had gotten a total of 6% in the same time spent.  Steady, nonstop kills, mind you.<br />
<br />
So I'm getting 3% an hour, solo in FG with KEI, or grouped in PoD.  It's not enough fuckin' incentive to level when you hear ranting and raving from others who are making oodles more than you, expecially at this portion of the game (read: treznor's post, I agree with it)<br />
<br />
I tried going to AA's for an hour in PoD, and THAT exp was 'normal' with 18% of my AA in an hour.<br />
<br />
Something's gotta be wrong.  Wavern and I (Hey Wavey!) had pretty much the same gain in exp, so it has to relate to troll SKs elsewhere also.  <br />
<br />
Or maybe the Troll SK exp formula is miscalc'd by VI.  *shrug* I'd love to know more, and get some definate numbers on this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Attyla</div><div class="date">10-25-2002, 05:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have noticed the same thing now for quite some time.  For most of September, I'd noticed that our regular cleric was outpacing me quite a bit and I'd assumed it was due to the relative con being higher to him (and the fact I was 54 and he was 53).  You never know just how &quot;fixed&quot; hell levels are relative to other levels.<br />
<br />
Finally my cleric got to the same level I am 3 weeks ago (so same xp split level wise).  In Kunark (Burning Woods and Skyfire), SoL (ME and UP) and Velious (Kael/Wakening) I am consistently getting 1/3 of his xp gain as a DE cleric.<br />
<br />
It's almost as if they've turned on the class penalty again by accident.  The discrepancy is WAY beyond a mere 20%.  I've been consistently getting about 1/3 of the relative xp that he has been receiving.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rukog DethBryngr</div><div class="date">10-25-2002, 06:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Remember folks...I can dig up the thread, but there was a lengthy discussion about class penalties and bonuses as they relate to AA/Regular exp splits.<br />
<br />
The basic point it came down to was:  If you are a RACE with a penalty, you are throwing exp away by having your bars set to ANYTHING other than 100%.  Go one way or the other, even changing them kill-to-kill if needed, but under no circumstances should you split them.<br />
<br />
Races with a BONUS (Asslings), seem to get BONUS exp from out of nowhere if they split their exp.  They actually get more TOTAL exp from splitting than if they were to go 100% exp.<br />
<br />
It has something to do with the apparent calculation of exp bonuses and penalties BEFORE it is split into AA and Regular, if it is split.<br />
<br />
They were right when they said a long while back that AA Exp doesn't have racial penalties...it seems...but only in the strict sense.  There doesn't seem to be a penalty (or bonus) if you go 100% AAExp.  Split it in any way with regular exp., and the game seems to calculate the exp modifiers first.<br />
<br />
My point?  Maybe some people are seeing some discrepancies when comparing their exp because of these racial penalties and bonuses.<br />
<br />
Or maybe they just snuck Class penalties back in on us, and we need to collect cold, hard data that shows VI how screwed up it is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Being in a very small guild, we have been xping/raiding together since PoP came out solely in PoP zones and yesterday people started hitting 62. People that have xpd much less than me had equal to or more xp than I did (I'm running 100% reg xp) and the only conclusion I can arrive at is that I've indeed still got a hefty penalty that I'm toting around. I noticed this the first day PoP came out but chalked it up to other factors. After several more days I'm convinced. There is very very little Iksar regen contributes in this expansion and I can't even see a 5% penalty being acceptable post 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SkulzSZ</div><div class="date">10-25-2002, 10:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As an Ogre with No regen, I think our racial penalty is worse than iksar or troll exp, not because of the percentage, but because of the downtime between solo fights.  My exp penalty isn't so bad in a group, but when I solo, it is painful, because the abilities I am getting the exp penalty for do not help me solo that much.  Soloing as a SK, you mainly need a healthy mana supply, and regen, to shorten the downtime between fights.  All ogres get are more hp to sit and try to recover, or try to tap back.<br />
<br />
Still like being an oggie though, but not likin how on every raid people want to &quot;shrink the fatties&quot;.  I like bein big.  Shrunk I hab trouble seein anything )</div></div><hr />

I too have noticed getting less xp often but never bothered to track it, figured it was just my imagination or dealing with someone stupid who couldn't read their xp bars or something. I will start keeping track when possible tho and see what happens.</div></div><hr />

just look at the poor coding of HT (adds 10 at 61) and see that some old things were overlooked<br />
