We are not tasty<br />
<br />
We are not cute<br />
<br />
We are not evil/good<br />
<br />
We do not smell bad<br />
<br />
We are not horny.<br />
<br />
     In regards of not being tasty. I dont believe any, and I mean any race truly believes in devouring a creature that lives undergrounds and is frequently coverd in tinker grease and clockwork oil is a very good appetizer.<br />
<br />
     The reason why many of our gnome ancestors live in Ak'anon is because they are the most horrible things you have laid eyes on. The only reason why you would see gnomes such as myself travel outside our own city and land is because we ARE much more atractive then the bunch, or we THINK we are.<br />
<br />
     Neutral is what we lie upon. If we were truly evil then the Dark Reflection would send a force of its army to destroy gem cutters and what ever name the paladin guild is in Ak'anon. If we were truly good then we would actually kill kobolds and rogue clockworks outside our city and participate in the oh so many quest to raise faction with the inhabitants of Ak'anon.<br />
<br />
     Just because we live underground, and are always constantly seen in our platemail, chainmail, and or robes does not mean we dont wash daily by the nearest Oasis to get rid of that body odor, and that tinkers grease, and clockwork oil.<br />
<br />
     And last but not least, we are not the deprived sex driven fiends we are portrayed as. At times we can get a little fiesty, but with a little R &amp; R, the gnome can prove to be very polite and well mannerd when it comes to relationships, and *dun dun dun* intercourse.<br />
<br />
     I also like to add that in the near future I have talked to my fellow Gnomes and we do plan to invade the following places...<br />
<br />
Grobb<br />
<br />
That is all. Well see now how it feels when your shoved between meat pies!</div></div><hr />

Flaming Gnome Pudding anyone?</div></div><hr />

Erm, have you ever taken a gander at the normal diet of a troll or iksar?<br />
<br />
Gnomes would actually classify as something of a delicacy.  Batter-fried cockatrice nuggets get mighty boring after a while, let me tell you!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Azieru Xionhart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I like my gnome with butter, a side order of Salad, and French fries or just Gnome Sushi will do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Groobash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It was a long time ago so I don't remember where I saw it - but there was a video that showed a live monkey clamped into a table with his head sticking up thru a hole in the middle of it, and the diners bonked him on the head until his skull cracked open then they ate his brain.<br />
<br />
That is how I prefer my gnome, given a choice.<br />
<br />
Asslings are ok too, but they scream loud and squirm a lot when you insert the rotisserie rod.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Cerena Gloomheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">He's talking about BICYCLE grease, not deep fried yum yum batter on a stick grease!<br />
<br />
I'd much rather eat a halfling than a gnome.  Much more plump, wouldn't you say?<br />
<br />
-Edit-  And BTW Groo, I think that was the first Faces of Death with that monkey bashing thing.</div></div><hr />

What is that? The Revenge of the Killer Snacks?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Faces of Death, most disturbing movie ever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Lunaticfringesk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Close...<br />
<br />
Faces of Death, Part IV is far more disturbing than the original could ever be...<br />
<br />
If you havent seen it, I challenge any of you to make it all the way through without getting ill.  It is that bad, as most of the deaths are filmed &quot;in action,&quot; rather than after the fact.<br />
<br />
Lunatic</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jobrill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">&quot;We are not tasty&quot;<br />
<br />
That I agree with. Gnomes, like all sentient races, are not nessisarily tasty. Although my Ogre and Troll bretheren insist on Gnome Kabobs, I prefer a good steak and a goblet of Paineelian Bloodwine any day. Although I must admit I do partake of a bit of blackened Tier'dal now and then as a guilty pleasure.<br />
<br />
&quot;We are not cute.&quot;<br />
<br />
I can agree with that too. You pot-bellied, pug-nose, short-limbed, gnarl-fingered miscreants. You must have been created by Bristlebane, because I can only imagine someone making you look like that as a sad, malicious joke.<br />
<br />
&quot;We are not evil/good&quot;<br />
<br />
Neutrals are just evil people with enough of a conciense to be bothered by thier bad actions but not enough of a conciense to admit them and overcome them. ALL Gnomes are evil, however. Hanging around in thier caves and tinkering with misshappen Golems, and appointing a machine to rule you is Unnatural. And the very thought of clockwork torturers sends chills down my spine. Everyone knows only the experienced hand of a warm flesh and blood person is good enough to administer proper torture.<br />
<br />
&quot;We do not smell bad&quot;<br />
<br />
Aye, I agree. You don't smell bad, perse, as much as you smell HORRIBLE.<br />
<br />
&quot;We are not horny.&quot;<br />
<br />
No comment there. I do remember encountering a rather hyper gnome mage while hunting in the Karanas one day who loved to draw happy faces on my breastplate, and I swear was inching toward my leg a couple times.<br />
<br />
I believe I saw a smile on the mandibles of that Crag Spider as it gulped him down.<br />
<br />
The amassing of clockworks, even to the point of a Clockwork King and Torturer, speaks that you are a threat to the Dark Truth and to Darkness. I have talked with my fellow Thulians, and I hope to amass a campaign against Ak'anon very soon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Speak for yourself! I'm all that and a bag of chips too! <br />
<br />
Er... not literally, of course, but there's at least one dwarf who thinks I'm a tasty little dish. :D<br />
<br />
I'm adorable. Everyone says so.<br />
<br />
I AM EVIL... I was voted Most Likely To Infect All of Felwithe With A Virulent Disease when I was a senior at Ak'Anon High.<br />
<br />
The bad smell is unavoidable when you are up to your shoulders in dragon guts.<br />
<br />
And, for that last one... see my first comment.<br />
<br />
P.S. -- If you must eat gnomes, eat a paladin. They are Brelliciously beer flavored, and they won't give you a bad case of Bertoxxulous' Revenge.</div></div><hr />
