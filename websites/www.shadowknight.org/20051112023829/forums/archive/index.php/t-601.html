<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimskayle</div><div class="date">04-10-2002, 02:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I am sure this question has been asked many times. Here are my choices for 1h upgrade, Noctivant, Sword of pain, Ebon mace. There stats are all similar but which is truly worth working for??? I have camped the sword of pain myself, and after 13 hours nothing :( So lets here those opinions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mordeth</div><div class="date">04-10-2002, 09:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Out of the 3 SoP is without a doubt the best... Noct is over rated, but looks damn cool.... SoP is one higher delay than ebon mace, has 10ac, grim aura effect and some mana(or is it hps)...<br />
<br />
In every way the superior weapon</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Garila</div><div class="date">04-10-2002, 10:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I may just be wierd but I really like the intelligence and dex on Noct Blade, plus its one of the few cool looking 1hers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BrindalayShadowlace</div><div class="date">04-10-2002, 09:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How the heck can the noct be overrated??  It's got more int than the necro's thurg robe,  and 10 dex to boot.  Plus it's only 0.4wt for DE's that wear too much plate armor and carry all their loot around.   :_)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Soulforge</div><div class="date">04-11-2002, 01:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Even at 60 i carry the Sword of Pain in my bags.  Good quick junk click for those mobs with a debuff, just swap it in, right click, swap regular weapon back in, and wait for the next debuff.  Since it works indoors unlike jboots it's fairly nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimskayle</div><div class="date">04-11-2002, 01:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I have camped the SoP many many times and never gotten it :( It is very frustrating, especially those asses yelling at me to go back to KC and acting like i am asking to loot a freakin primal weapon or something. everyone says it rots all the time, guess i am just very unlucky</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Soulforge</div><div class="date">04-11-2002, 01:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Any of those weapons will do you just fine for quite awhile. And there's quite a few other insta click items for crap buffs so SoP isn't that much ahead of the rest.  Just do the one you think you like the most.  Remember, just have fun</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wrowin</div><div class="date">04-11-2002, 09:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the shard of night off the queen in chardok  is sweeter than all the above    21/24  Str: +5 Int: +5 Poison Resist: +5 Disease Resist: +5 Mana: +25  <br />
...since it drops off a mob for warrior epic guilds actually get it a lot. I like it for tanking but prefer AP when on a raid with chanter haste</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitch</div><div class="date">04-11-2002, 01:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the sword of pain is nice for its clicky and decent dmg/dly, the noct personally i think was made for those trolls/ogre sks with low int/dex it also is decent .. i personally say just get a Massive DragonClaw Shard and get it over with though :-P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nephtu</div><div class="date">04-11-2002, 06:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are only two weapons in your list - the Noct blade is a comic opera prop, little better than a MotSS, and groosly overprice.  <br />
<br />
Sword of Pain and Ebon mace are essentially a wash - has Gregendek been a no-show or just cheap?  I got mine in a relatively short camp of Lower Dogs, sounds like you're just not having any luck.  Brogg isn't terribly hard, either, but he's USUALLY quite a lot rarer.  Of course, you could pop by the library and get an Ebon Mace in 5 minutes, or spend 100 hours in LD and get hosed - it's all random.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimskayle</div><div class="date">04-12-2002, 01:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I got a NOct for 1500 plus my Moss, so for now I am happy, but i will still camp for SoP as much as i can :)) I am in the process of finishing my lord of pain khukri qeuest. Need one more CoM scroll and 2 keys and I am set, then i can work on greenmist.</div></div><hr />
