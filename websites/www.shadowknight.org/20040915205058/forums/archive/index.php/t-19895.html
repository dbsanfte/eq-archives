<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What's the cost per level for Intense Hatred?  Does it go up every level?  I know it's 3 aa for the first level, but dunno after that.<br />
<br />
What's the benefit of Intense Hatred?  Is it a fixed amount, a fixed percent, or does it go up every level?  I've heard +3 ds, +10% ds, +15% ds... which is it?  Or is it something else?<br />
<br />
-Bolas</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Naubi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sounds really weak if that's all it's going to be (+10% or so).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Like Bolas, this AA interests me the most out of our GoD AA's (for what they are worth, hehe).<br />
<br />
Percentage or set number of DS points per level?  Scales linearly per level (like Arch AA Mental Clarity) or scales based on cost (like Arch AA Spell Casting Fury)?<br />
<br />
I'm thinking the MINIMUM I would go for this would be 3 DS/lvl (so 15 pts for 45 aa) or 5% of current DS.  Even at that minimum, it would mean I would never take it beyond level 3 because it'd be too costly for the small benefit.  Anything more than 3 DS or 5% would mean I would take it to level 3 on day one of GoD and to level 5 some time later.... waaaayyyy later.<br />
<br />
I hope it's not 2 DS/lvl but the Tak Shield of Pain II earring and South Ro Shield of Pain II augs have me worried for Intense Hatred (I haven't seen any I's or III's in the game but never really looked either).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Szork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Bought the first rank today.<br />
<br />
I can confirm, it is 3 DS added to existing DS.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I got the first one too but does the next one scale up to like 6pts if its all 3 pts thats not a lot of DS impovement for the cost</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I bought Intense Hatred 1 &amp; 2, each level gives 3 pts DS... so it's like Mental Clarity, doesn't scale to points spent.</div></div><hr />

I can confirm, it is 3 DS added to existing DS. <br />
Just to clear up any confusion... is it an always-on damage shield, or is it just 3 extra ds per rank whenever you have a damage shield spell on?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Manslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You have to have an existing DS on you otherwise it won't do anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>cames</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Does this damage shield being on mean Banshee Aura or Cloak of Luclin?  Do other folks DS's (Mage/Druid) count?  How bout my old friend the 8th Coldain Ring?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Any of the above.  I usually have CoL, 8th ring, and druid DS on (58 pts total), but last night had to forego druid DS and used Banshee Aura instead (30 pts total).  The 6 pts of AA DS (levels 1 and 2) went right on top of that, for 64 ttl and 36 ttl, respectively.<br />
<br />
I don't regret getting levels 1 &amp; 2 of Intense Hatred, but think I will move getting additional levels of it down the list of aa's to get until later.<br />
<br />
I don't think I can recall ever being without ANY sort of DS on... usually I have at minimum, CoA and now CoL and 8th ring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>cames</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The reason I ask gets into some rather diverse issues.  I like you live a lot on DS.  I two box my cleric a lot and DS adds tons of DPS (I also have the Cursed Range item which has an additional 4 point DS that stacks with CoL, 8th Ring and Banshee Aura - Add in Mark of Retribution and you are talking about a 49 point DS).  <br />
<br />
However there are other circumstances that I am in.  For example, raiding with a Paladin, may choose Brells over CoL for the HPs.  Generally when raiding, I can not afford the buff slot for Banshee Aura.  8th ring is my insta clicky so its generally in slot 1.  So, I am curious in that regard.<br />
<br />
My guild (amazingly) has a lot of mages for our size.  So, I am curious if Intense Hatred stacks off Banshee Aura or any DS.  In that mode, I generally have CoL up so that is an alternative self-only DS.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gnost</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">In beta, it was +3 per level.<br />
<br />
If you have no damage shield on, it won't apply.  So if you just died, and a moss snake bites you, it won't take any damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ravenar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Just to clairfy:  <br />
<br />
The first level costs 3 and the 2nd level costs 6?  So I assume the third tier would be nine and so on?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>aress</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I am terrribly disappointed that they gave us a fixed number.  It would have been so much nicer and not unbalancing to give us a % unstead.  Max at 50% more.</div></div><hr />
