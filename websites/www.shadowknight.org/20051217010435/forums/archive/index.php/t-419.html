<br />
Im only lvl 45 but I have a 56 monk, 54 shammy, 52 warrior and a 54 enchanter to help me.  Is it possible to get one with that group?  I heard you need someone with pick lock, or is there a key?</div></div><hr />

That group would not be enough.  Reaver raids happen all the time, just tag along and ask if you can have the MoSS.  They only fetch about 1k on my server, so they might be willing.  That, or join a guild, or buy one.</div></div><hr />

With that in mind you will probably need to have another healer (preferable cleric for Complete Heals) to take him on.  If you are lucky, he could pop first time and your group could handle, but you really need to prepare for worst case.<br />
<br />
In my experience, Lord Ghiosk pops from the Black Reaver just outside the castle, so a rogue should not be necessary.  I may be wrong here, so it wouldn't hurt to have one on standby.</div></div><hr />

There is a way to G-Flux up to one of them, but I have no Idea how that is done.  It is an all melee battle, since not many spells hit them.  So have some good melee there, shaman buffer, enchanter, and clerics.  Depending on levels, you can do it with one group.   <br />
<br />
I was bored the other night, so I gathered up my favorite Oracle, (buffs) and a 55 enchanter, (haste) and a  55 cleric and went to town.  Basicly they sat there and watched while I slashed away at them, although the shammie would try to stab him with his epic poker.  It took forever, but I had a blast.  Most I had to deal with was four, then the ghost.  Since it took so long we would get a few adds on the top level reavers, and the chanter would mez them and line them up for me to kill after.  They will blind you, so I sat there staring at a black screen most of the fight.  However, since I play the cleric on the other comp, I was able to keep positioned to keep attacking.<br />

Sorry for rambling, but the server is down for maintance and I am bored.</div></div><hr />

Use the spell Wave of Enfeeblement right next to the door.  The spell you'll see a resist on.  Thats when you run away and FD and probably 4 reavers will come out.  I can pull all the reavers this way except of course for the reavers on the top of the city.<br />
<br />
Its fun, and if you've never really pulled them, its a horrifying surprise ).</div></div><hr />
