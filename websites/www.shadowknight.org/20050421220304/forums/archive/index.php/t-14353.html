<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zzketza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Guildmate of mine just posted the developer's comment thing about the new patch next thursday.  In it was mentioned that at least on Legends, Droga and Nurga were being revamped - and Droga was becoming a level 50-60 zone.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know any details about this?  And if it were to move to normal servers, how it would affect the Lord of Pain Khukri camp?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jobrill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">We have no idea at this point. They may or may not change the way to get the Stupendous Tome. They have not announced anything in regards to what they will do with old quests taking place in Droga and Nurga.<br />
<br />
Personally, I'd go farm the tome now just to be safe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jabbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">How much you wanna bet SoE just forgets entirely there's a very long and irritating quest who's culmination is in the depths of droga...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Talonmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'd be more concerned that they decide that since the Greenmist is a 50+ weapon, there is no problem with an integral piece coming from a 50+ zone.<br />
<br />
You think its a bitch now, wait till you need to take a full group down there to do it.<br />
<br />
Glad I have mine now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jabbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Agreed.  That collecting the key crap down there was boring as hell, but also relatively irritating to do solo even against greens.  I can only imagine what it would be like to try to get a group of 60ish down that far and keep them interested enough, long enough to get all 3 keys.<br />
<br />
/shudder</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fantim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">sad to say but greenmist is a 50-55 weapon max.  After that point you should be wielding a 2hander.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Bah!  1hs and 2hs are situational weapons, i use both it just all depends on my role grouped and the style im fighting Solo.  As for Droga im bustin my ass to get down there as soon as possible from what i hear Droga is NOW a BITCH on legends.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>boedicia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Can anyone on Stormhammer confirm if Argest is still down in the jail ?<br />
Even for SOE it would still be pretty sucky to leave this part of the quest as is, and up the mobs you need to kill by 20+ levels...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tukka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well, the Droga changes are live on all servers, so hopefully someone will have an answer for us soon.<br />
<br />
Personally I wouldn't mind too terribly if they simply bumped up the difficulty of the dungeon, and made the drops a lot more common.  It would make the Lord of Pain's Khukri impossible to complete at the level at which THAT weapon is intended for, but realistically we know that anybody would just use a MoSS or something better anyway, so in effect, it's only important as a portion of the Greenmist quest.<br />
<br />
So I'd think it'd be fair if they counterbalanced the increased difficulty of the quest by removing some of the tedium, and made it so the keys always dropped off their respective NPCs, and make the NPCs themselves a bit more common.  That way, chances are it would be an hour camp, if that, which could be a fun little excursion, and improve the quest from where it was before.<br />
<br />
It's possible of course that they just forgot about the quest, and broke it, and the required drops and NPCs are no longer in the game.  Or it's possible they'll leave the needed NPC spawn/drop rates in place, while increasing the NPC levels as they have.  Either of those options would, obviously, suck... but if someone raises a fuss, I'm sure they'd fix it.  But considering the fact that even the Greenmist Khukri is looking less and less appealing from this far-from-uber Shadow Knight, I have to wonder if anybody even would.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ashrai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Have just recently started this quest and was worried about the Droga changes and what they might mean to :<br />
<br />
-difficulty in getting to the spot<br />
-possibility of being broken altogether (though hopefully it's become more like a AC shard situation where it's actulally made it easier since revamp with regards to drops)<br />
<br />
Will be checking out the zone hopefully later this week with my main in tow just in case. Did this part of the quest for a friend's SK a while ago so will be interesting to see how it's changed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The Droga/Nurga changes went live on all servers already?  When did this happen?<br />
<br />
I didn't see a patch message today, and I know for a fact that they weren't live on Sunday, as a Shaman friend went to kill the Iksar slave for his cudgel quest and the mobs in Jail area were all green still...<br />
<br />
Damn it, so much for farming Chardok faction before the changes went live if that information is correct.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Spylmann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'm farming faction in Droga/Nurga as we speak. The only problem is that I'm taking damage when greenmist procs. It procs on the last hit, and my hp drops 240 before the next fight. So much for helping my farm..<br />
<br />
Anyway, they haven't changed on all servers yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">revamped Droga IS NOT live yet,  i went down there last night owned the place and finish the Lords pain in the ass khukri.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ashrai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Going to run down there tonite then if I can. Had heard the changes were live on our server but that person might not have explored much. Thanks for the heads up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Spylmann, <br />
<br />
Is that Greenmist proc thing still happening?  I was using mine in The Grey last night against Revs and golems and didn't notice it eating at me, though the proc would only go off on golems.  Thought maybe it had been fixed already or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Spylmann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I thought I was going crazy when I first noticed it, but I sat there watching my hp drop about 20 each tick yesterday. I haven't had a chance to check today, but I'm doing Fear in an hour (SL plz kthxla~) so I'll mess around with some spectres before it starts.<br />
<br />
edit: Yeah it's still doing 20/tick to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">As far as i can tell groff mine is still bugged on Fennin Ro.  Just get down there and farm the keys.  I dont think Droga or Nurga will be revamped anytime soon.  But just take precaution and finish the keys now.<br />
<br />
Did i read up there someone saying MoSS is better then Greenmist LOL if you think that you should go back to playing your ranger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Darknyss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">i think he meant the MoSS is better than the LoP Khukri...<br />
<br />
however, with the changes to Droga being a 50-65 dungeon were implemented in the patch message this morning as of July 10th, 2003.<br />
<br />
once I'm done with the City of Mist scrolls and the Kaesora scroll, the keys were my next objective... any info on what is happening in Droga would be well appreciated...<br />
<br />
as I had found that Iksar were no longer amiable to the lizards in Cazic Thule 2.0 the hard way... and would like some research before jumping into the zone...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Furiousgeorge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">/cry either I am a huge moron or my Keys are not working to get in to jail area anymore(maybe both are true). I got all of the keys before patch but now the stinkin door wont open.... <br />
<br />
<br />
%^$%@$@$</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Dude go down with a shaman and have him shrink your fat ass and hand the keys in, itsssss that easy :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Furiousgeorge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I dont have the faction to do turn in yet..... otherwise I would have done it before the patch. I just hope that the turn in guy still wants my old keys and not some new one...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Jabbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Or just buy a handfull of shink potions.  You won't need any keys at all down there.<br />
<br />
As for greenmist- it's no longer doing damage to YOU when it procs, but the proc is also not doing damage to the MOB.  The proc hits the mob, rather than showing up as a 'buff' on you, but it doesn't do anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Tylorik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Logged off in the jail the night before the patch (I don't keep good enough tabs on the patches)..logged in trapped and helpless.  The old keys do not work, the mobs are no where to be seen (not even the iksar slaves, enslaved iksar, or the other more violent iksar).  At 55th level, the goblin janitor in the interrogator room was dark blue and the goblin dust hoodlum in the penmaster's place was red (didn't see invis though).  I have searched the only other place I could see them moving the iksar slaves (w/i Droga--the &quot;cells&quot; on the way out to FM), only to find them all filled with yellow and red cons.  I even went and explored a little in Nurga with a group (the goblins there were lt. blue and dark blue to a 62)...and came up empty.  Near as I can tell, the LoP Khukri quest is now broken.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Furiousgeorge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">See dats what i was hoping wouldnt happen :/ not being impeded by the bars.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Spylmann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Mobs were moved to Frontier Mountains to the (former) Burynai Caves west of the bind spot. There is a fork, the jail mobs are to the right and the traitor/angry are to the left. Been camping the stupid angry for freakin ever and I finally found him, with a group prepping next to him..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Talonmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I was in Droga last night and the traitor was still in the same place he always was.  <br />
<br />
I was happy to notice nothing saw through invis.<br />
<br />
Has anyone gotten any drops from here that compare to things other than jack or shit?</div></div><hr />
