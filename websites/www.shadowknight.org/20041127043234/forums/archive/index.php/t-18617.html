<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>petras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can anyone tell me if faction hits on the following will hurt in the long run?<br />
<br />
Factions: <br />
King Tormax<br />
Kromrif<br />
Kromzek<br />
 <br />
Opposing Factions: <br />
Claws of Veeshan<br />
Coldain<br />
 <br />
I really need to know because I'm koping on killing the giants, if giants are a bad choice because of faction, what should I be killing in the wakening lands?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Both can be good.  Just depends on what your goals are at the moment and both can be repaired.  Kill giants if you want to hunt in HoT. If you later want to be on giant faction you can repair you faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Oagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's a matter of choice.  Thurg/Dorfs have some nice quests, and easier armor to quest in Kael.  Although, Kael seems almost empty nowdays.  <br />
<br />
Giant faction gives you some nice loot when you start killing dragons in WW (Frostbringers, Barbed Dragonscale Boots, etc are quested in Kael).  You can go into Icewell and get some lesser armor pieces that are semi-decent or backup.  <br />
<br />
I have toons on both factions.  My SK is giant faction, because I made him RZ alligned to do the 4th shawl quest with my wiz and find the hidden dorf at the entrance to Kael in EW.  He's ally Kromzek and Kromriff, but I'm still working on Tormax, and not in the mood to kill greenies to get heads.<br />
<br />
As a non-gating class, you may choose to go with dorf faction, because you can repeat the 4th shawl quest over and over for a gate potion to Thurgudin.  Not a bad idea, since it saves you 160pp on a shaman gate potion.  The components are easily gotten in Velks, and you only need a pottery skill of about 140 to do it successfully without a fear of failure.<br />
<br />
Choice is up to you.  Although, not many are bothering with Velious zones much nowdays (at least on TM), which isn't bad, because WW is usually open for lesser dragons, and is a nice loot pharm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sithanator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">As someone who choose Kael when they were level for RP reasons, Got the faction up to ally/ally/dub. Then to turn in my upper 40's to low 50's and have my guild start hitting kael regularly for armor. It sucked, fixing coldain faction and then months down the line getting ally to CoV. I learned an important lession about progression through content. Assuming you don't skip part of velious content, here is what will probably happen, you will start hitting Kael for thurg armor. Once you grow bigger then you will start hitting HoT and SS armor. Once you finish farming you will probably move on to ST key farming or into NToV. At this point faction only matter if you a kings head in your bag or quest armor pice that would upgrade you. Even then you find yourself killing statue/AoW/KT every chance you get. Farming thos spawn will probably go on past NToV.<br />
<br />
Best advise I could give you is go thurg or ignore the faction until you react where they come into play, there no point to raising one of these faction unless you know have a greater chance getting item return from them.(note while doing velious content above kael and below NToV, your guild will probably want you non kos to CoV)<br />
