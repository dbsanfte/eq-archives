But more importantly, is the greenmist soloable by a 45 sk and 63 shaman boxing, and..is it worth it?  Currently Im using the vegefull diamond blade, which isnt to bad and Argent Protector, forgive the spelling...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mehatesu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ive never played a lizard, but I do remember getting ambushed by some lizard patroling out near field of bone way back when.. Is faction going to be an issue starting this quest?..Id hate to think i had to spend hours and hours trying to get this done just to start the quest.</div></div><hr />

Mehatsu ~ With that Duo, I think so...just be careful in Dalnir, Mobs tend to be social there. Yes, there are better weapons from Elemental Planes and Gates of Discord, this Quest (as told by other Shadow Knights and I now agree) is to weed out the Players from the eBay'ers. Takes a lot of focused effort to get it. Faction is very important as well as setting up for it. What I did was worked on my Warrior Faction first, doing the Bone and Knives Quest. Then slaughter lots of Bandits for Necromanacer Faction. I would suggest doing the Bandit Quest now, at your level the Faction raise will go quicker than for me at 65. After you get Faction, I went and acquired as many pieces of the Quest as possible before talking to any Quest Mobs. It will take up lots of room in your bank, but if you do it that way...then you can sit and do the turn-ins with the exception of Glowing Golem and Drachnid Spy Khukri's. All-in-all, took me 45 minutes after I talked to first Quest NPC to Greenmist. Acquiring the parts before hand took me about 36 hours total. Faction ~sigh~ that took me months. Good luck with Quest if you decide to do it. For me, the pleasure was in doing and acquiring (see post in Why you did it?).  :)</div></div><hr />
