<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Akeikyl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I dont like the current setup for graveyards. I feel this would be a better way to handle how they function. Usually when your corpse is to far out of range for you to summon it, it gives you a message that the corpse is to far away to summon it. Now this is what I would do to graveyards I would increase the time before the graveyard summons your corpse for you but allow that if you got to the graveyard prior to it summoning you you could simply type /corpse to summon your corpse to the graveyard.  This would only work in the graveyard area;s and allow you to get your corpse there faster if your there. And allow your raid or party more time to rez you at your corpse's current location without fear of having to beat the clock.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kizzestra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It would be great if everyone could type /corpse and just have it appear anywhere but it isn't going to happen the graveyards work just fine, be happy with what you got for once. They are one of the few truly &quot;Good&quot; things SOE has come up with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rezzbagg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think that when you die, you should just automatically reappear right where you died. You should also have a full yellow bub more of experience than when you died, the mob that killed you should be dead at your feet, and everything on it's loot table should be on it's corpse.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Drakonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Graveyards work ok apart from ONE thing I'd like to see changed...<br />
<br />
After the GY summons your corpse, ALLOW IT TO BE DRAGGED BACK OUT!!!<br />
<br />
Its so annoying to be on a CR in any situation and find your corpse ends up at zin and you cant move it anywhere for a rez, instead you have to wait for someone to come along to zin and rez it instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>dupliciti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I happen to agree. I believe that the GY's are one of SoE's better ideas. <br />
<br />
One problem I've found thou. In HoH B, the mobs are right up and all over the GY and if your guild or you are attempting a CR, forget it. The corpses pop right up under those zone mobs which are static and right there on top of you. And of course you can barely drag to a safe spot, corpse pops right back under the zone mobs. <br />
<br />
CR in HoH b is complete hell and can take a couple of hours to get an entire guild finally rez'd and the heck outta there. You accept the rez box, and promptly get eaten.  Would be good if SoE would move those mobs back some, or give more overall room for that GY and CR's there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Keyan Aubaine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">GYs are an improvement in about every concievable way other than not allowing to drag corpses back out...<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if they can even fix that part, as all corpses with a timer inferior to the zone limit (ie past the GY moving point) and that are not within the GY locs automatically get moved back there with every tick.<br />
I don't know how doable it would be to add a trigger to each corpse to know if it has been brought to the GY once already... if it's like the rest of their database, it's sure as hell not going to happen, but i'm not familiar with that part and there might be room.<br />
Of course then there is the issue of people skipping content using corpses when CoH is disabled, and i'm guessing this is the real reason why SoE did it that way.<br />

/agree about HoHb mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Naraz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">corpses fall under world sometimes even after poping. nightmareB good examble, usally falls under world and you need to petition for gm to drag it out</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>SorishMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">GYs are nothing more then a hack to handle how they programmed the &quot;encounters&quot; that lock an area of the zone in PoP.  They 'spun' it so that everyone thinks it was designed with the players in mind.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think GYs are a bad thing for the social contract of the game (loosening the bonds between players, making it more difficult for the community to police itself with regards to griefers).  Before, if you died, you had to interact with someone in order to get your corpse summoned.  This means that if you had a bad reputation, you're gonna have a tough time getting that corpse summoned.  Yes, it sucked when there was nobody around to SC, and it was expensive, but it also functioned as a control mechanism in the community.<br />
<br />
But then, I think PoP portals were a bad idea as well with regards to breaking down some of the tools that the community had to police itself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jobrill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yeah. I think they should remove Teleports altogether, and put us back to using boats to get everywhere. Also, remove Soulbinders. And make Corpses Unsummonable until thier Rez Timer has run out.<br />
<br />
THEN we'll see some Community, By Golly!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>SorishMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It's all a trade-off... I'm just stating that there are fewer legal (according to GMs) tools that the community has to deter griefers from living a life free from consequences.  Because you know that you're never gonna get a GM there in time to catch the griefer in the act (the GM will only show up once you've stooped to the griefer's level).  Unfortunately, while removing these self-policing options, they've not given their official police force additional manpower or rules to allow them to catch the miscreants.  Those time-sinks were what made for effective self-policing.  If you didn't play by the social rules, you got stuck using the various time-sinks (long CRs, boats).  <br />
<br />
Graveyards mean that you can be a griefer in the planes and not have to then beg in OOC for 30 minutes (60 minutes if the folks in the zone have a long memory) for a SC.<br />
<br />
Yes, I use PoP portals, soul binders, grave yards - but I also look down that road and wonder what the game will be like once you have rez-in-a-potion (or a Soul Reuniter that you simply hail) that you can buy for cheap (or free if you follow the route that PoP portals and soul binders have taken us).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zakton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yeah books are just a waste, click and you're there!   And those boats and scions, just too fast!  30 mins for a boat ride, 15 for a portal.   I would much rather swim the Ocean of Tears or Timorous for 45 mins to an hour to get between continents and we should have to run through every zone when we want to get somewhere. <br />
<br />
=P<br />
<br />
And what zones are you talking about losing your corpse in without getting a friendly summon?  Most non PoP dungeons are empty and you need to bring your own group anyway.  As for the GY's being in PoP they are a great addition.  Try cleaning up a raid wipeout at the back of Hate sometime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bunnyslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Two things...<br />
<br />
1. Graveyard timers are the anti-zerg. If you could just /corpse to get your corpse back it would be terribly imbalancing. Everyone just /corpse and get your gear and run back in to zerg some named mob like RZ for example. The timers on graveyards pervent that kind of abuse.<br />
<br />
2. The HoHb graveyard SUCKS! OMG it's awful. You have 6 lvl 66+ mobs that are right in the graveyard. Its absolutely lame. They need to remove those mobs from the zone. Make the zone in safe so that people can CR. This place is a total screw up by some programmer.</div></div><hr />
