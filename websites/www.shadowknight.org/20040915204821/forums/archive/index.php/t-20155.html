<br />
Dude for 45 aa you get a 15 point increase to existing DS buff currently active only.<br />
<br />
This in NO fucking way makes us a better tank. <br />
<br />
GoD SK AA are so fucking sad I wont go into it.</div></div><hr />

Are you serious? It's only that few?  <br />
Yes, it is only 15 points at level 5, not that it being higher would cause your point to be any more valid.<br />
each hit on us from a mob is like having our own automatic riposte disc, cept we take damage of course<br />
You realize how little sense that makes, right?  What makes people with riposte discs &quot;viable tanks&quot;, as per your subject header, is the complete absence of damage dealt while under discipline(albeit for a very short term).  If you're still getting pounded on with each hit, it affects your viability as a tank in no way at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>The Zenogias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I was under the impression that it would do a 3% increase to all DS that you had on, and with the over 100 damage DS's that exist now, that would be alot of damage...but....if it's only 15 then it's a piece of shit</div></div><hr />

I was under the impression that it would do a 3% increase to all DS that you had on, and with the over 100 damage DS's that exist now, that would be alot of damage...but....if it's only 15 then it's a piece of shit  <br />
....<br />
<br />
If you had a 100pt damage shield on, a 3% increase would be an extra 3pts on top of what you had.   How would three extra points of damage shield be &quot;a lot of damage&quot;?  And how can you call 15 a &quot;piece of shit&quot; if you were only expecting 3?<br />
<br />
And I still don't get what having extra damage shield has to do with our tanking viability, considering it affects our ability to tank in absolutely no manner at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>The Zenogias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Sorry, I meant a 3% multiplyer, where the actually total effect of a damage shield would be multiplied by 3, not added on by 3</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ravenar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">100 * 3% = 3</div></div><hr />

<br />
So in other words you expected a 300% Multiplier.<br />
<br />
Which still wouldn't amount to much in the grand scheme of things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Rueeliar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Having a 500 point DS would enable some retarded dps on unslowable mobs that quad, especially if they flurry.  Adding an extra 1.5k dps against RZ in Time, for instance.  It would mean soloing Flurry Drakes with ease.<br />
<br />
However, yes.  This AA is trash.</div></div><hr />
