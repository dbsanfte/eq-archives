<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tumurbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know there are a ton of posts about this subject, but I can't seem to truly make anything out of them that seems to fit.  So, I am trying to figure out what would be best for me and my playing style.  I enjoy tanking even tho I don't get to do it as much as I want to.  So, when I don't get to tank I want to do damage and lots of it.  Of course, these two things don't really mix, so I am sure I will have to picj one way or the other.  So, with all that said, maybe I could get some suggestions from the people here as to which way would be best to go currently.<br />
<br />
To let you know a little about my character, I have all the flags up to getting into Fire.  I knwo the gear I have (See magelo) isn't the best and I am currently trying to improve it.  My stats aren't really the best either, but I feel I am pretty well-rounded.  Since I like to group, my stats get up there fairly well.  With all that in mind, I thank you for your suggestions and ideas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lynxal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would get CS1, SCF 1-3, then finish your tanking AAs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">SCF3 is a great AA that impacts a fuckton of different things for an SK.  Other than that, make your magelo into a link (url=yourmageloaddy)Magelo(/url) with brackets instead of parenthese and I'll comment further... I don't like fucking up my address bar with random peoples' magelo's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tumurbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I apologize for the link not being a link.  I thought it would be.  I am fairly new to this whole posting issue.  I think I have it fixed so that it is a link now.  At least I hope so.  Thanks for the comments so far.  It sounds like I might want to go ahead and buy up SCF so far.  Maybe after looking at my Magelo you might get some other ideas.  Thanks again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">scf3 unholy touch 1 combat stability 3.<br />
check 2nd post in AA guide for more info</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vaelenu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">From your position, if you enjoy tanking I would complete the following AAs in this order as soon as possible: <br />
<br />
Planar Durability 3 (HPs &gt; all)<br />
Combat Stability 3<br />
Innate Defense 3<br />
Planar Power 3 (assuming your stats are capping with buffs)<br />
<br />
Then pick up the following to improve your dps via casting. Most of these will also improve your tanking ability.<br />
<br />
Mental Clarity 1 (for 2 AAs it's a bargain)<br />
Spell Casting Fury 3<br />
Soul Abrasion 3<br />
Theft of Life 3 (maybe look at getting 1 level of this earlier)<br />
Unholy Touch 3<br />
<br />
Then melee and 2 hander dps increasers:<br />
<br />
Combat Fury 3<br />
and (in any order)<br />
Knight's Advantage 3<br />
Speed of the Knight 3<br />
2 Hand Bash<br />
<br />
After that I would pick up these in any order:<br />
<br />
Pet Discipline<br />
Mental Clarity 3<br />
Touch of the Wicked 1 (to synchronise your IHT with your disc)<br />
Spell Casting Expertise (impossible to fizzle Fear and CD)<br />
Channeling Focus 3<br />
<br />
I haven't included any GoD AAs in my recommendations. While some of these are useful I feel unless you are gaining AAs super quick they just aren't worthwhile compared to other stuff you can get. If closer to the OoW release date you find you have a few saved up and can't decide where to spend them, consider hanging on to them till you see what OoW brings out, there might be some nice new ones although I doubt they will be cheap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Menon Lifeblight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You are never going to do lots of damage as an SK.  Focus on making yourself a viable tank, at least in xp situations.  I can't imagine you are tanking real well in the EPs with your gear and AAs, though I'm sure a good group could carry you along.  Get these AAs immediately:<br />
<br />
CS3<br />
SCF3<br />
ID5<br />
ToL3<br />
UT3<br />
PD3 (HP is not &gt; all, ignore the idiots who say so)<br />
<br />
That should keep you busy for a week or two.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hard to give too specific a list, as it's really a personal thing, but here's a rough idea of an AA path...<br />
<br />
1) Ignore Vaelenu entirely<br />
<br />
2) CS3<br />
<br />
3) SCF3, UT1<br />
<br />
4) Pet Discipline (Move this higher up on the list if you pull much.)<br />
<br />
5) Swfit Journey 2, especially if you do any GoD and/or if you pull much.<br />
<br />
6) ID5/LR5<br />
<br />
7) PD3<br />
<br />
8) Put Unholy Steed in the mix somewhere - it's not a boost to your raw &quot;power&quot; but it's something you'll definately be glad you have.  <br />
<br />
9) ToL1 is nice cheap eye-candy if that's your thing, and ToL3 isn't a bad deal for the points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grarg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The difference between tankin in the ep's with defensive aa's and without is very very pronounced.<br />
<br />
If you are averagely geared the problem you will have is you wont be able to tank two until things are bought under control, meaning you wont move far from the safety of the zone line, and you will get boored.<br />
<br />
Without defensive aa's you limit on effective tanking is really bot.<br />
<br />
By effective tanking i mean being able to group with a druid and a sham not needing two clerics to go anywhere.<br />
<br />
Concequently I would say that the dmg mitigation aa's will probably bring you your best bang for fun buck at this stage.<br />
<br />
You could grind these out in the crematorium in GoD. Instanced, solro level xp and hit a little lighter than solro stuff. Its a good yardstick.<br />
<br />
Solro is good too, if you need cash, those ornate drops are still popular if infrequent.<br />
<br />
Laters</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Vaelenu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Wow thanks for heaping shit on me with such a compelling argument, next time I won't waste any of my life creating suggestions. I'm glad that things like Pet Hold, running faster and a big HT work really well for your tanking strategy. I find taking less damgage and having more hit points to soak it up with work quite well for mine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grarg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Opinions are always welcome, how do we achieve insight without some poor helpless bastard to beat it out of?<br />
<br />
Tis the way of the knight!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Pet Discipline is a hugely valuable AA - if you can't see why, I'm not sure what to say.  It may not be a tanking AA, but as the original post indicates, his play style isn't as tanking-oriented as most.  For anyone who ever does anything other than /assist the puller and tank for XP groups, pet discipline is one of the most valuable AA's we have; it revolutionizes pet pulling and makes our pet usable in situations it otherwise wouldn't be - that's definately significant.  <br />
<br />
Window and I suggested UT1 because, when you have SCF3 which is one of our best AA's anyway due to the huge range of abilities it augments, you more than double your HT damage for a mere 2 AA's.  It's impact may not be huge, but it's certainly a great value.  <br />
<br />
That you suggest such things as Combat Fury and 2h Bash before a staple AA like Pet Discipline, or that you claim that HP &gt; All, when the mitigation/avoidance AA's are certainly better, discredits your entire post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Vaelenu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Then I guess we interpreted his request differently. I read<br />
<br />
I enjoy tanking even tho I don't get to do it as much as I want to. So, when I don't get to tank I want to do damage and lots of it. Of course, these two things don't really mix, so I am sure I will have to picj one way or the other. So, with all that said, maybe I could get some suggestions from the people here as to which way would be best to go currently.<br />
<br />
to mean he enjoyed both tanking and dps and if he couldn't have both he would like suggestions on which way to go. As my preference for play style is tanking, my suggestions emphasised that.<br />
<br />
I don't dispute that Pet hold is a useful AA but it does not contribute directly to tanking. Pulling yes. I didn't see in Tumurbok's request where he said he urgently wanted to be a better puller.<br />
<br />
As for HP &gt; all, I'll concede that for tanking there is better value with avoidance and mitigation than PD provides. However I suggested PD as a priority because of it's value in both a tanking and (survivability in) DPS role; and also because of it's wank value: When deciding whether to use me to tank I have occassionally had people ask me my hit points, less commonly (albiet more intelligently) what tanking AAs I have - I have yet to have anyone enquire whether I had Pet hold when considering me as a tank. If you enjoy tanking, having more hitpoints is going to get you into more groups and MA situations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">If a group decides whether or not to accept you based solely on your response to &quot;what's your HP?&quot; then you don't want to be in that group anyway, so no loss there.  <br />
<br />
Pet Discipline isn't directly a tanking AA, but it is a general performance AA.  It enables you to use your pet in situations where you otherwise wouldn't be able to.  It's significance for pet pulling is also a big deal, and one that most people underestimate before aquiring it.  Virtually regardless of your play style, it's definately more worthwhile than CF3 or 2hbash or the like - that's for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">the reason i suggest SCF3 and UT1 is he already has improved harm touch according to his magelo, which is basically a waste of AA until you have SCF3 and UT1.<br />
SCF3 is also one of the best AA we get anyway, and ut1 is cheap for the improvement especially when improved harm touch and SCF3 are already done.<br />
<br />
<br />
pet discipline is probably one of the best AA we get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Pet Discipline is one of those AA's you put off getting and put off getting thinking &quot;but I need this more!&quot; and then one day you finally get around to getting it and think &quot;how the fuck did I live without that?&quot;  It's probably the most unerestimated AA ever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Goddamn, that post was barely coherant... 4 &quot;get&quot; or variants thereof in one bloody sentence.  I'm ashamed.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I'm most impressed with aa's that reduce the amount of mana your healer will use to keep you alive.  In that category:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Tanking AA's are definately great and should be high on anyone's list of priorities, but certain AA's have an effect on you that simply reducing the damage you take cannot.  Pet Discipline is one such AA; Unholy Steed is another.  The increase in &quot;raw power&quot; or whatever may not be there, but the impact on your gaming experience, so to speak, is.  Once you have AA's like Unholy Steed or Pet Discipline, you never know how you managed without them before.  <br />
<br />
Tanking AA's, DPS AA's, all that stuff just makes the numbers a little better on what you already do - while that's certainly important, it's very different from granting you something new and different (and for those too dense to figure it out: Unholy Steed is something new and different even from a 100k or dropped horse).  I don't mean to sound like I'm trying to downplay the importance of tanking AA's - they're vital to being successful in your role - they're hard to compare to things like Pet Discipline though.  It's hard to say which is ultimately &quot;better&quot; but you'll certainly appreciate Pet Discipline more once you have it.  <br />
<br />
Everyone's AA path differs based on their needs and play styles.  An aweful lot of people put off getting AA's like Pet Discipline and Unholy Steed, though, and when they do get around to buying them, they smack themselves and wonder how they managed to get by.  It's kinda like owning a CoS or HEB...<br />
<br />
I'm not trying to say that everyone should dump 12 AA's in archetype and go straight to Pet Discipline and Unholy Steed... I'm just saying don't underestimate them (particularly the former) as so many do...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Tumurbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Wow...Thanks all.  This has been really enlightening.  Now I know the sort fo things I should look at in the next few weeks.  Once again thanks all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I have never questioned anyone that got Unholy Steed as their very first &quot;class&quot; aa.  Horses make travel so much nicer.  Instacast soulbound horses make corpse runs better.  Anything that makes the agony of a long corpse run even a little better is a good thing in my book. ;)<br />
<br />
And I got pet discipline this month, I like it, but I'm still figuring out all the subtleties of it at the moment.<br />
<br />
-Bolas</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Just a side ancedote, as opposed to advice.<br />
<br />
When Luclin and AA's first came out, the thing I wanted the most from reading the skill descriptions on the AA screen was Unholy Steed.  As I got past my General and Arch to the point where I could now get it, something else always seemed to be more important or desireable.  I ended up not getting the hossie until after the ~250 mark.<br />
<br />
To be honest, I rarely use it.  I play on a blue server, generally always group or 2/3 box; most other friends/guildies have either the slow horse or drogmor and I'd have to wait for them anyways hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">If your boxing, it can be a pain, but otherwise it's great to have.  Even if you generally do stuff with &quot;friends/guildies [who] have either the slow horse or drogmor&quot; that doesn't mean you walk around with them and such - it's a great tool for travel, CR's, etc.  It doesn't really make you &quot;more powerful&quot; but it's a huge convenience.  Being able to cast while medding is nice too... gives the old velious clicky healing BP's a use.  Instant cast means that you can stop on a dime, unlike other horses because you can just dismount and pop it up again when it's time to move, etc. (make a hotbutton that's line 1 /alt activate [forget the number] line 2 /dismount and it'll work like a toggle)<br />
<br />
I use mine many times each day... while it doesn't really make me a &quot;better SK&quot; per say, it brings a level of convenience that I certainly miss when I play another character.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">By far the most useful thing I've found with my horse is the fact that you can swap spells while fighting mobs you normally couldn't. Even on a slowed mob, swapping a spell means waiting until just after the mob hit you to swap, and then hoping to hell that you mem it in time before the next round comes, otherwise you'll get hit for max damage (from sitting) and your spell mem will be inturrupted. With the horse, you just jump on and mem at will. Granted, a landing hit will still inturrupt your memorization, but you can still be missed when they swing at you, and when they connect it won't be for full. It doesn't happen a lot that I need a new spell memmed in the middle of fighting, but when I do, it's nice; especially when fighting an unslowed or fast-hitting mob that I normally couldn't swap spells at all against.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Krushum Gudended</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">heh, my aa path was run3 regen 3 nd3 horse, and I have never regretted it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Vaelenu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I got the horse early and it was definitely good value. Even if all you do is pop it out and take screenies :) Certainly in PoP you'll find yourself running between Time/EPs/ GoD/bind point/LDoNs and it saves a lot of time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Nikl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I held off getting my horse. I was glad when I got it, sure. But I guess if you decide to get the horse before your tanking AA's it would make it just that much easier to run your ass back to your corpse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Lynxal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">The single greatest use of the horse has been to get me unstuck since the first round of collison fixes went in.  At least a dozen times it has gotten me out of trees and doors.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's really a stretch... (and calling it a stretch is probably an understatement.)<br />
<br />
Defensive AA's are a big deal, nobody'll argue that, but 6AA's worth of defensive AA's is hardly a deal-breaker.</div></div><hr />
