Hes a 75 mob in Doomfire, the Burning Lands.  Is he the hardest / highest level mob in game? If not who is?</div></div><hr />

Fennin?   wtf?</div></div><hr />

Either you cheat or you play on an Emusever, where it wouldnt be cheating.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>petras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">what do these mobs hit for when their like 70++ anyways? also in a raid, would you chain CH to keep the main tank alive? hrm..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Last I saw thwe nexus scions was immune to melee, not sure about arrows. Also immune to all spells but those that are unresistable. The Scion summon at 96%. Acouple friends and I night were goofing off attacking it, my DS did damage. it was all fun and good until the wizzy mana burned the scion and it started summoning us.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Salaam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Im curious, has the Iksar monk GM been killed? (Grand Master Gloxx, or whatever his name is).<br />
<br />
On a related subject, I've never seen the Cabilis guards camped. Is there a reason for this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jaggnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Salaam - WTF does that have to do with the topic? <br />
<br />
Cabilis guards aren't camped cause they're crappy XP, drop bad loot, and are undercons for their level.    Not sure why anybody would want to kill the ikky GM monk unless it's just for fun.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Androsulach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I think he's also been known to try to solo Faydedar, as I recall.  He's not very stuck where he ought to be, so I've heard.   I've never managed to be on any time my guild has done Faydedar.</div></div><hr />
