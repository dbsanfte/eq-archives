<br />
I am assuming you can get this, seeing as you already have som Dark Runed :)<br />
<br />
Ear - Ivandyr's Hoop  +6 AC +6 Wis +6 Int +6 HP - you can quest it if you raise enough pp for the rubies(has taken me a maximum of 8 rubies everytime! :p ), or buy it from a player.<br />
<br />
Neck - Shrouded Medallion  +12 AC +5 Str +15 vsMg +5 vsFire +5 vsCold +25 Mana - With a solid group in the low 50's you can go to Maiden's and kill the &quot;Xi&quot;  if you kill &quot;Four arms&quot; as well you could get lucky and get this: <br />
<br />
Waist - Axgoreth's Belt of Defense  +20 AC +15 Str +15 Wis <br />
<br />
Face - Validus Custodus Plate Visor  +8 AC +4 Str -2 Agi +4 HP - These are easy to get for little pp, ask someone you know that hunts guards in Katta if they want to sell, otherwise just auction for it. :)<br />
<br />
Shoulder - Tattered Mantle  +12 AC +10 vsDis +20 HP - From Gullerback in BW - Gullerback is a strong gorilla so bring a group :)<br />
<br />
The rest you can get in Kael raids, Dark Runed, Black bear pelt cloak etc etc. If not, a Spider fur cloak is very easy to come by. <br />
<br />
I hope it helps!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">velourea</div><div class="date">04-04-2002, 03:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">first off, you need a haste item! get a fbss or something (yeah, its gonna hurt your ac). <br />
<br />
earrings: i dont really care for those cougar claw, i have black sapphire electrum 2ac 35hp 25mana and really like them. <br />
<br />
rings: are ok, but see if you can sell them and get 6/65 ones.<br />
<br />
bracer: try for blood ember (getting really cheap nowadays) or get another dark runed.<br />
<br />
weapon: id really get a good 2 hander for damage but the noct/sbs is good for tanking<br />
<br />
range: try to get a gorgana idol 8ac 3dex 3sta 20hp. ac &gt; most stats (cept a good amount of hp)<br />
<br />
cloak: spider fur for now, group in kael later to try for cloak of maelstrom or black bear pelt<br />
<br />
face: crystal spider eyes 8ac 35hp 35mana<br />
<br />
your armor is ok for now, get no drop planes or dark runed stuff to upgrade.</div></div><hr />

So i'm a bit short on the plat right now.<br />
Also lookin' for any new places to hunt now that i just hit 48 that would give good xp and some plat to go along with it.</div></div><hr />
