I know many have had there way of training AA's according to which is better here and which is better there...<br />
All i wanted to get was the jist of what we should be starting at and continuing on.<br />
for instance i only have 3 AA's and i dropped them into Regen.<br />
with items Augs fungi so on so forth i figured it couldnt hurt much.<br />
but from there iam clueless.<br />
I know i need run..maybe stam.<br />
But can someone give me a run down of what might be an all around AA run top shoot for?<br />
crit wise damage wise stooof like that.<br />
<br />
I know there are probably  threads out there but using the  search i couldnt bring up one that could benifit the quesstion im asking. so if there is a thread pls link that as well <br />
thnks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I know there are threads, I'm too lazy to go looking for them though. Basically in General, you NEED TO GET RUN3. Then most people either get regen3 (like you did) or metabolism3 (very nice if you like stat food.) After that, it depends on what you like to do. If you're regularily in XP groups tanking, I'd suggest mostly tanking AAs and maybe get ToL1/2, then after the archetype tanking AAs (CA, CS, ND) go for what you want. If you're trying to get into a high-level guild, you'll need all your tanking AAs (CA, CS, ND, LR, ID, PE, PD) and IHT. After that I'd probably get UT3 + SCF3 (for the 9k HT), then go for things like the horse, SA, etc. If you want pure DPS, then I'm not sure what is the best order to do things in, you'd have to look around, I know window posted the best way to go about these things on a per-point basis a while ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kroolhand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Some guilds have required AA's for X class. Finding out what those are for a SK in a respected guild on you server will help in two ways:<br />
<br />
   1&gt; It gives you an idea of what a &quot;local&quot; organization has possibly tested and/or needs requires from it's Knights.<br />
<br />
    2&gt; Working towards achieving those AA's  ( and leveling, and getting pre-requ flags ) may help to land you in said guild, thus extending your eq experience in areas that you might not otherwise have gotten to experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dakkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My suggestion would be follow Kroolhand's advice, but failing that one way of doing them would be:<br />
<br />
Run3<br />
Regen3<br />
Spell casting expertise 1 so CD and fear never fizzle, then Luclin tanking AAs:<br />
<br />
Combat agility 3<br />
Combat stability 3<br />
Natural durability 3<br />
(Fashions change from month to month as to what order you should do CA/CS/ND in)<br />
Physical enhancement then for pulling:<br />
<br />
Pet discipline.  Then HT AAs:<br />
<br />
Improved harm touch<br />
Spell casting fury 3<br />
Unholy touch 3<br />
Touch of the wicked 1 (so you can IHT every time disc refreshes) then back to PoP tanking AAs:<br />
<br />
Lightning reflexes 5<br />
Innate defense 5<br />
Planar durability 3 then it's a bit less standard but maybe melee DPS AAs:<br />
<br />
Knight's advantage 3<br />
Speed of the knight 3<br />
Combat fury 3<br />
Fury of the ages 3<br />
<br />
And then after this, barring whatever I've completely forgotten or totally messed up (probably a fair few things) it gets more subjective.  Fearless is sometimes required for raiding guilds though.<br />
<br />
Obviously though, if you tank a lot and your guild isn't in need of 8K insta-DPS at intervals, do all the tanking AAs before HT AAs.<br />
<br />
At some point, either very early or much later depending on where you exp and raid and how much kiting you do, unholy steed and run 5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Heap</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Get run speed 3, then get 65.  Levels &gt; aa.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Don't worry about AA's till 65.  At 65, run3+regen3 -&gt; SCF3 - &gt; tanking AA's.  For the order in which to do your tanking AA's, use search.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ramgar SK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I did run3 early on, and it saved my life countless times.  I did a lot of pulling and being able to outrun them saved me on stuns and getting beat on all the way back to camp.  Plus running to the zone when it hit the fan was much easier.<br />
<br />
I'd say if you do any AA's prior to 65, just do run3.<br />
<br />
If you level fast and play a lot, it woun't make much difference.  I was in my 50's for quite a while.  :)</div></div><hr />
