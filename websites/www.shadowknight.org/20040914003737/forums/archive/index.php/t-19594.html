<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nyrvel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay. been reading the Posts for Aggro and Mana Management, especially in a Pull'er/Tank (since i'm usually that combo) situation. Basically, I have Clinging Darkness and Fear to use on the Pull, if I want to take a break from casting during the fight, I use Festering Darkness and Terror of Terris. Note that Voice of Terris is active, this is Standard set-up, written in stone until...the other day. Pulling a Highborn Noble (yellow Con), I cast Clnging Darkness then Fear...and to my surprise!...Mob went running the opposite way. I say to myself this is a fluke. Pull again, same result. 3 more times for the stubborn gene and...same result. Okay, the Zone is bugged, time to go elsewhere. New Zone (PoValor), pulling Crystalline Golem (yellow Con)...Holy!...Mob makes a run for the border. Okay, calling it a day. Next day, wash...rinse...repeat  ::sigh::  this is not how the program is supposed to work. Now, you're wondering why I posted this and what info am I looking for...well here goes:<br />
<br />
1) I thought Fear had a level cap, which is why we could use it to pull high-level mobs (note: yellow Cons to a 60)?<br />
<br />
2) Anyone else notice this or am I unique among SHD's?<br />
<br />
3) If this is a viable post, has a solution been found and what is that solution?<br />
<br />
4) Does this possibly mean that the Mobs have been 'tweaked' to resist our high-end spells and low-end ones were overlooked?<br />
<br />
5) Is this a 'limiter' (didn't want to say 'nerf' for obvious reasons) to our pull capability?<br />
<br />
Please don't Flame, this is a serious question and I would like some serious input. Have discussed it with other SHD's on my server and now I am asking the SHD community. Thanking you in advance for any insight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hmm I will try that today... if they can be feared... they can be solo'd :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>ragnorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">don't see how fear would hurt pulling since if this isn't a bug, then just use a diff spell to pull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kormus the Dark Angel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Did you not get the &quot;Your target is too high of a level for your fear spell.&quot; message?<br />
<br />
If not I am off to PoValor soloing golems... =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ganaith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Please tell me you are serious. Really, this could be our best break since....years.<br />
<br />
<br />
Check everything, check again and..<br />
<br />
<br />
Fuck that, the moment servers are up, i am checking :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>EdgeOfDetroit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">let me get this strait...you were able to fear stuff in PoV with your lower level fear??? <br />
<br />
Please say yes...doh...5 more hours till work is over!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gargar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I pretty much gave up fear kiting after i grew outta GD and EW giants...   THIS however makes me giggle with joy.. :-)   Ima have to give it a shot out in PoN.  WOOHOO!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kkhaarn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">it doesnt work.  nothing to see here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nyrvel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">1) No, I didn't get a 'Target resisied your Fear spell' nor did I get the  'Your target is too high a level for your fear spell' messages.<br />
<br />
2) Yes, I am serious...that was the last night I pulled for a group, since then been grinding the XP as SA to get to BoT, will double check it again tonight.<br />
<br />
3) Yes, Fear Spell (Level 15)<br />
<br />
I didn't even think of the Solo'ing potential, I just immediately thought about what other spell to put in that slot for Pull'ing. The Fear/Clinging Darkness Combo for Aggro was awesome. Its Friday night which means I will be pulling again in Veksar, so I will try to be a little more 'scientific' in my approach (which means I will log my play session) and if I get those results again, will post my log. Of course...I will have to edit all the hot and steamy Tells! :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Thingiemethong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">And.. did you got more info on this ?  <br />
<br />
And did you see it working on specific mobs ? <br />
<br />
I would luv to do some fear kiting in HoH ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Thingiemethong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I've checked the above info and I say it's incorrect.. <br />
<br />
I've used FD for the pull and the lvl 15 Fear and it didn't work.. <br />
<br />
I needed to aggro kite the mob in PoV ( NE corner ). <br />
<br />
I did get the message &quot;Your target is too high of a level for your fear spell.&quot; <br />
<br />
When a necro stopped laughing at me when I tried it .. he helped me with a couple dot's and logged..  He was also aggro kiting there .. <br />
<br />
Sorry, but I don't buy it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kkhaarn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">read my post!<br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ganaith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Unfortunatly, did not work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Nyrvel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Have tried it for the past several days and unable to repeat that 'flukey' night. Friend says it may have just been a 'since corrected error' from a patch. She reminded me that that happend after one of the Tuesday patches. ::shrug:: I should have checked the next night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Daikoku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Spent one hell of a lot of time in veskar, getting gear for twinks and doing duos and stuff,  nothing I can ever remember past the water has ever been affected by fear.<br />

Just remember to X out my name on every one, I hate it when people forget to . . . erm, nevermind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Nyrvel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Lizarde!!! You don't want everyone to see what Iksar and Dark Elf Shadowknights do when they get together?!?!? I'm not ashamed! All of Norrath should know! Besides, the log would be nothing but X's, wholly unreadable. :p</div></div><hr />
