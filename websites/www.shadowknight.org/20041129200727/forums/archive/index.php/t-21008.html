<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Soledragondead</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all.  I'm a paladin from over on that &quot;good&quot; northern paly board.  I'm some what of a dark sheep of the family so it figures I'd be checking in here.  I've lurked and spied on you evil knights from time to time but to be honest my knowledge of your evil ways is usualy poor at best.  <br />
<br />
However it seems my darker twins are in similiar dangers as thee good paladins of these late days.  Our GoD's seem to be frowning on us both equaly and favoring those manaless  staminia casting warriors.<br />
<br />
I've got a idea for a blessing I think maybe worth us all praying for but figured I'd see what the likes of you death fakers would think of it.<br />
<br />
Here it is pasted and held tight by the blood of a kicking moss snake.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The paladins and shadow knights will be getting a riposte/parrying ability.<br />
<br />
This new ability is as follow<br />
<br />
Name:  Holy/Unholy Guard Stance.<br />
Duration:  200 seconds<br />
Reuse:  750 seconds<br />
Effect One:  Auto parries and riposte first two of every five attacks that &quot;hit&quot; the paladin/shadow knight.<br />
<br />
Required Equipment:  One handed weapon and shield.<br />
    Lowers dps by a large amount.<br />
<br />
This ability grays out &quot;attack&quot; while in use.  <br />
This ability lowers mana regen by twelve from the time it's activated until the time it's refreshed.<br />
<br />
<br />
This ability cost 50aa's and is available at lvl 65.<br />
This ability can be upgraded for a additional 50 aa's to turn any spells cast with less then a 1 second cast to be made instant cast for the duration of the of the first 200 seconds.  However all spell refresh takes twice as long.<br />
<br />
    To insure no unfair advantage is given accidentally to paladins during this through their LH ability, EQ will be making the following two upgrades to warriors and shadow knights respectively.<br />
<br />
Warriors ability to mend themselves will be allowed to be used while the warrior is using def disc<br />
<br />
Shadow Knights HT will now work as a necro siphon life (&lt;- unsure of name)  It will allow the Shadow Knight to get some hit points from the mob he/she HT's.<br />
<br />
Warriors will retain their primary roles as raid tanks do to their parrying ability and their AoE taunt.  However some raids may now use a pal/sk when insufficient warriors with appropriate aa's/gear/lvls are around.<br />
<br />
<br />
    We'd like to remind warriors at this time that def disc has not been shared any more then LH has been and that the gap between tank classes has been defined more with the above changes.  We'd also like to restate that warriors have more hp's, more ac, a perma 5% reduction average with their DI 19, higher caps on defensive and offensive skills, uninterpretable hard number hate increase abilities, more procs for argo, AoE taunt with 100% success, a &quot;offensive&quot; ability that is used as a def ability to mitigate 100% of melee damage, a self healing ability, their shielding ability for group utility.<br />
<br />
    The above is a example of how pal/sk can become viable tanks again and how gear/aa's will once again matter for tanking.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If yee be reading this you're better then I guessed cause you shadow knights have learned to read.  :p <br />
<br />
Honestly all jokes a side, thanks for taking the time to read this and hopefuly we  nite and day twins can get fixed so as there's 3 viable tank classes in all levels of EQ.  <br />
<br />
I'm not familiar with how much HT's do and I am seeking feedback on this idea from shadowknights as well as paladins.  For better or worse post away.  Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xanathol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Personally, I would have to disagree with this suggestion, and here's why:<br />
<br />
1. it can be over powering - consider the consequences when you block 2 attacks, then avoid a number of them.<br />
<br />
2. 50aa's to balance against something basically 'given' to warriors?<br />
<br />
Just some questions as well -  why lower mana regen and why modify spell casting times on &lt;1 sec casting time spells? That basically leaves an SK with an 'instant' DD that has a 45 second recast, and according to suggestion, no has a 1.5 minute recast. <br />
<br />
FYI, SKs already can spend AAs to turn HT into a lifetap, problem is its pretty weak ( most time the damage done with HT is more beneficial than what the 'heal' would be ).<br />
<br />
Not trying to just 'shoot down' your idea; I just think it needs a bit reworking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's good to kick new ideas around, and healthy for discussion purposes.<br />
<br />
The ideas you mention above would be far to overpowering in effect, duration, reuse time, and access.<br />
<br />
The developers have stated that knight tanking is &quot;where we want it to be&quot;, that the problem is purely content related, not a class issue, and certain mobs will be adjusted with that in mind.<br />
<br />
Many of us that play at the high end disagree with this view, at least to some extent, and look for ways to improve knights' relative tanking abilities. How to do that without unbalancing the game is the tough part.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Soledragondead</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Over at PoN I was shown I got caught up too much in the %'s and that is right so I've refigured the proposal and it comes out like this and will add in the sk's HT upgrade although I'd really like a sk to do this for your insite exceeds me in this portion greatly.<br />
<br />
sorry kether I got tunnle vision on %'s but you're 100% right.<br />
<br />
The ability should have looked like this.<br />
<br />
The paladins and shadow knights will be getting a riposte/parrying ability.<br />
<br />
This new ability is as follow<br />
<br />
Name: Holy/Unholy Guard Stance.<br />
Duration: 200 seconds<br />
Reuse: 750 seconds<br />
Effect One: Auto parries and riposte every other attack that &quot;hit&quot; the paladin/shadow knight.<br />
<br />
Required Equipment: One handed weapon and shield.<br />
Lowers dps by a large amount.<br />
<br />
This ability grays out &quot;attack&quot; while in use. <br />
This ability lowers mana regen by twelve from the time it's activated until the time it's refreshed.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
To insure no unfair advantage is given accidentally to paladins during this through their LH ability, EQ will be making the following two upgrades to warriors and shadow knights respectively.<br />
<br />
Warriors ability to mend themselves will be allowed to be used while the warrior is using def disc. This ability will be upgraded as well when used durring def disc.<br />
Warriors will get a def disc up grade on the % of damage mitigated by 15%.<br />
<br />
Shadow Knights HT will now work as a necro siphon life (&lt;- unsure of name) It will allow the Shadow Knight to get some hit points from the mob he/she HT's.  ----When used durring this ability Ht will do 5k damage to the mob and return 7.5k hp's instintly to the sk.-------<br />
<br />
Warriors will retain their primary roles as raid tanks do to their parrying ability and their AoE taunt. However some raids may now use a pal/sk when insufficient warriors with appropriate aa's/gear/lvls are around.<br />
<br />
<br />
We'd like to remind warriors at this time that def disc has not been shared any more then LH has been and that the gap between tank classes has been defined more with the above changes.

<br />
The above is a example of how pal/sk can become viable tanks again and how gear/aa's will once again matter for tanking.<br />
<br />
There that'd fix it and seperate the tanks from the non tanks.<br />
<br />
If you consider it to be invalid or mistaken it'd be nice if you'd post the changes you'd like to see.<br />
<br />
<br />
before you go on the path here of &quot;pal/sk should never get a ability to cut damage on par with the warriors&quot;,  Please answer the folllowing question.<br />
<br />
What groups/raids would be lost from warriors if pal/sk had a damage mitigation ability on par with the warriors of the same level/gear/aa's?    Don't bother posting negatively until you can answer this please for if you can't then there is no reason not to give this ability to pal/sk so they can do their primary role as tank.?????<br />
<br />
As for the aa cost?  that is debateable.   btw if I was &quot;fare&quot; I'd make warriors pay 50aa's for the upgrade to their improved healing but right now I'm more worried with getting to do the role my class has always done since release.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>KLeTuS_KaSaDy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">accually i like the idea of like a 50% chance to parry inc attacks with a quick reuse, give about 30 - 60 seconds max use time with a reuse time of like 5 - 10 minz, i dont think it should affect spell casting during usage tho or dmg output</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Squigle D'Muerte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Way too powerful especially with that reuse time.  What happens when you turn on Auto Riposte disc on mob that is enraged?  You use a mob's advantage to do crazy damage to it, is what.<br />
<br />
I would guess you would have better luck submitting a request for a shield based discipline since Palys/SKs are supposed to be shield using classes but most never do because 1H weapons are too weak.  There needs to be a reason to use shields.  The extra AC doesn't help enough and the shield bash advantage was undermined by the AA ability giving everyone slam.  <br />
<br />
How about a shield only discipline that allows us to interrupt ALL cast spells for 30 seconds?  Now THAT would be worth carrying a shield for.  Of course some boss mobs would have to be immune (like they are to so many things) but it would make those CHers pay.:D</div></div><hr />
