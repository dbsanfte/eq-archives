<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Phoenix Connection</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was full of shit.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sorry I need to rant, and vent, and this I think it the best place, since a majority of people here play the Shadow Knight class.<br />
<br />
I am currently a 62 Shadow Knight. My gear is amongst the best buyable stuff in the game. Fully buffed I have 6700 HP. Fully buffed I have 1520 AC. I have mastered the art of keeping aggro, and rarely find myself losing it (unless I can't get my spells off...then I'm in trouble)<br />
<br />
<br />
Yet despite all these qualifications I rarely seem to be able to find myself a group. My time of EQ consist of sitting on my unholy steed in PoK, with my LFG tag of for hours on end. Generally, on average I find myself LFG for around 4 hours before I finally get a group invite. This frustrates me. I listen to my cousins, who play EverQuest also bullshit to me about how Great the SK class. About how groups always want a SK. About how desirable the SK class is. Well if SK's are so friggin desirable why do I sit LFG for 4+ hours everyday? Why do I rarely ever get groups?<br />
<br />
I made my Shadow Knight when Kunark came out all those years ago. I'm a casual player. I play EQ when I feel like it, but lately my desire to play the game has been dwindling down to nothing, almost to the point where I want to quit. All because my main, a 62 SK never gets any groups. Because I sit LFG 90% of the time.<br />
<br />
It's just frustrating and I'm tired of it. You might wonder &quot;He must have made a bad reputation&quot;. But I assure that I haven't. I'm a very quiet EQ player, that lets my actions speak louder then my words. Those who know think I'm an excellent tank, but that doesn't seem to be getting me anywhere when it comes to get any groups at all.<br />
<br />
I love the Shadow Knight class, and I love EverQuest, but lately, I'm really starting to build up a hatred for both. Everyday I play EQ, I'm stuck sitting LFG for hours on end. I want to get to 65, and start getting to the best parts of the game, but not getting any groups is hindering that.<br />
<br />
Bah, I'm just venting. I hope some of you can relate or share your stories. I'm sure there must be other disgruntled SK's out there who never seem to get a group...? Or is it just me...?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Moonslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Quit the internet =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Phoenix Connection</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Why would you say something like that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I posted before this was sent to flames!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Phoenix Connection</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I see.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well then let it be sent down to flames. I'm just ranting, and venting from about 6 months of built up frustrations. Thats all.<br />
<br />
<br />
Another thing I would like to add, and how much bullshit is behind the &quot;Shadow Knight Desriability&quot;.<br />
<br />
I am currently guildless. I always figured I would get invited to a guild, but have yet to. So I took some actions and researched some of the guilds on my server. Nothing special. No uber guilds. Just a guild who likes to raid, and have fun.<br />
<br />
Upon my research, I looked at 8 different guilds. All of them were closed to any Shadow Knight applications. I scratched my head, I thought SK's were desirable...?<br />
<br />
Anyway, like I said if SK's were so desirable, I'd have a group right now, and wouldn't be posting these messages. Instead I'm going on hour 3 of being LFG.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I often get groups when not even looking for one, without turning on LFG, sometimes while I'm in random remote locations.  <br />
<br />
SK's have suffered in desirability lately, but if you're sitting LFG for 4 hours, you're doing something wrong.  <br />
<br />
Not that /LFG on is the best way to get groups anyway.  Sitting around with LFG on gets you retart-filled groups and alot of other BS with higher frequency.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Phoenix Connection</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Any ideas as to what I am I might doing wrong?<br />
<br />
<br />
I just sit LFG in PoK. I figured it's the best place because if I ever do I get a group, it's the best place to get wherever the quickest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Derraj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">why don't you trying starting groups, join a high end guild, etc. instead of waiting for someone to invite you, wtf are ya, shy?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I think the better question is, &quot;Do you have any friends?&quot; or &quot;Do people on your server in general like you/think highly of you?&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Phoenix Connection</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have already inquired about join guilds as I stated previously. It's hard to join them when every guild I have looked at is closed to any and all Shadow Knight applications.<br />
<br />
<br />
I try to start my own groups fairly often, problem is there are never any clerics LFG, and if there are, when there are they all seem to want groups then and now.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's not like I don't try, I do try, but my efforts are futile it seems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kaleyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">average I find myself LFG for around 4 hours before I finally get a group invite <br />
<br />
Only 4 hours?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Phoenix Connection</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I get nothing but praise from people for my efforts when I actually do get a group.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for my attitute, and perception, generally I am very quiet, and don't talk very much. I'm a person who'd rather let my actions speak louder then my words. I don't make small talk, I focus on getting the job done.<br />
<br />
As for friends, sure I have friends. I also have 4 cousins who play on the server with me, all of them have lvl 65 characters.<br />
<br />
The really sad thing is, even they don't invite me anywhere. They form their own groups, all without me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If you have the respect of the members of the guild and are a good player, there's almost invariably a way around the &quot;recruitment closed to XXX classes&quot;.  Guilds want quality players, not just a mass of mindless &quot;required classes&quot;.  <br />
<br />
If everyone who groups with you likes you so much and is so happy with your ability to do your job, they'd invite you back to do it again... and again... etc.<br />
<br />
If your cousins and friends don't give you groups, that should probably tell you something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Phoenix Connection</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">My cousins don't invite me because there is no use to me. One is a 65 paladin. One two boxes a 65 Cleric, and 65 shaman. the other two boxes a 65 mage, and a 65 bard.<br />
<br />
<br />
So there is really no use for me in their groups.<br />
<br />
And I don't see what you are trying to say. I am a very nice person. I'm never rude, never disrespectful to anyone. I treat everyone I play/group/raid with with the upmost respect.<br />
<br />
<br />
Like I said, I get nothing but priase, and never recieve any insults for my abilities of playing a Shadow Knight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Calron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">If you have so much time to lfg.   Go to BoT 62 SK lfg (hard there since most will probably want 65), go to PoV 62 SK lfg, PoS 62 SK lfg, go to LDoN zones 62 SK lfg all the time with your lfg tag up and put in the description that you just want exp dont care where.<br />
<br />
As for guild thing, you said you looked at 8 different guilds on the server.  An idea to get into one even though they are not accepting apps is to make friends with people from the guilds.  You can do that by grouping with them or. . .<br />
<br />
Head to there web site maybe and say hello folks I am a guildless SK blah blah, if you want to group up sometime shot me a tell would like ot join guild x wen app opens up.<br />
<br />
It sounds like you are looking for a casual / social guild (and being level 62 raiding guilds probably wouldnt look at you till 65 and some AAs).  Dont mention the desire to raid x number of times a week or progress in PoP, you just sound like your only interest in a guild is for them to further you and loot.  Mention how much you play when your one and things you like to do (helping friends is always a nice one to say).<br />
<br />
When you get into guild x dont expect them to always group with you. Dont spam gu with blah blah blah group with me im bored.  Attend raids when you can, form gropus with guildies when they are lfg.  Do not expec to get loot right away instead enjoy the social guild atmosphere.  Then when your 65 and AAed up you can leave your nice little social guild that helped build your toon up and join raiding guild y.  And all will be right with the world.</div></div><hr />

And all from new 60+ folks who don't even know how good I am, as most of my friends I exp with quit already, and most of the people I know in game are raiding atm.<br />
<br />
Anyway... yah</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Your quietness may hinder you.<br />
<br />
Through the medium of the interNEAT no one can see the cool calm well gathered expression you think your silence gives you.  Not flaming because in game I had the same problem.<br />
<br />
Find some way to communicate that you are friendly.  I hate talking about out of game stuff in group chat, so I don't I still find ways to let people know I'm friendly without having to babble.<br />
<br />
Example:  In any group someone is going to do something good or make a nice save, be sure to compliment them, either in group chat or in a tell.  <br />
<br />
Just talk a little more, limit yourself to good or contstructive things about others, and you will find yourself in demand soon enough if you play as well as you think you do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Phoenix Connection</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I just choose not to talk because I like to have my full attention on the game. Keeping aggro, and keeping people alive. I've never been a person to make small talk.<br />
<br />
<br />
I usually give people praise if they did something that denotes it. Such as a cleric saving the group. Or a chanty/bard messing 3 or 4 adds. Things like that warrents praise, and I'm the first to give it.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm sure it's not my attitute or the way I come off as, with people that hinders me from getting groups. My silence my hinder me from making &quot;friends&quot; and getting into guilds, but it does not leave me on anyone's badside. At least I don't think it does, because I in no way come of as an asshole. I think I pretty much come off as a quiet, sensable person who likes to get the job done.<br />
<br />
<br />
Like I said, I like to have my actions speak louder then any words...thats just the way I am.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Phoenix Connection</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">And to comment further on the guild thing, I simply just don't want to be a bother or a hiderance, or come off as a kiss-ass, or a begger. If the guilds are closed to Shadow Knight applications then I understand. It's their guild, they make the rules, and I don't want exceptions to be made for me, no matter how good or qualified I may be. So I will not bother them, or pesture them in hopes of joining.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm sure eventually I will find a guild for me. I just need to research more guilds on my server first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">With that attitude, your chances of getting into a raiding guild are about nill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Heres a secret, guilds are open or closed based on the player, regardless of what they say.  No guild thats worthwhile will turn away a good player just like they won't take a bad one even if they need the class because it does more harm than good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Mantisrose</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Phoenix Connection you have to understand that most guilds have no more then 4 sk's if not less then that.  Most guilds dont want sk's because there is only so much we can do on a raid and numerous other classes do it better then we do <br />
<br />
Dont let that upset you keep searching for a guild, try smaller guilds too not just the big ones. being in a guild will help your chances of getting a group<br />
<br />
<br />
Dont worry about kissing peoples butts just be friendly and help people when you can and they will remember you for what you did. <br />
<br />
<br />
SK's are not desirable when compared to clerics, enchanters, shamens, bards. These classes have true desirability mostly because they can make it so much easier on a group to get things done. Some people confuse Class desirablity with Player desirablitity<br />
<br />
<br />
Some zones you can try are all of the LDOn adveture zones, I highly recommend POV for you exp is great and inner is always looking for tanks to rep them. Just go in to pov and ooc 62 sk lfg. if you cant find a group there try another plane<br />
<br />
<br />
DONT GIVE UP<br />
<br />
<br />
 If your an Sk as your Main and had to do everything the hard way and not a lowely twink sk way  you are better then everyone else</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I have to disagree there I have seen guilds turn away some awesome SK's because they don't need many SK's</div></div><hr />

<br />
That sounds alot like me. I don't know what it is, pride, stupidity? <br />
I like to do things on my own merit. SK's are so unwanted in higher end guilds, or even Planar guilds on my server. The SK class has always been &quot;me&quot;. But it sucks, I like to raid. But you keep joining up and comming guilds that fold to bad leadership, you get stuck. <br />
<br />
ATM there are 5 Time guilds on the server, then a huge gap in content, Velious. I decided to hang up my dreams of ever seeing Time and am now just playing for fun.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The people who are so full of &quot;this group set up is more efficient, that class sucks groupwise&quot; are the ones who in the end get shitty clueless groups up.<br />
Neither my funnest nor  my most efficient grinding groups have ever been the theoretical perfect ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Naraz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">honestly i would just quit if i were you hehe.<br />
<br />
 this game is not that great 60+ if you cant power game.  you might get lucky and get in a ssra level guild but  it prob be more fun being guildless then doing ssra and velious race for spawn  stuff. it's just that way, if you cant live in your parents basement then dont except much from eq. you can brag about the life ya got though:).<br />
<br />
try URT2004 and ffx , that should hold ya till wow which will prob be a  more casual friendly and less guild demanding game. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Ueuelr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Here is my 2cp. In regards to getting groups, that is a tricky one. Most of the time when I'm lfg I don't have problems getting a group, but sometimes takes a while. I usualy tend to solo when lfg, either in HoH (used to be PoV before) or I go to Akheva and farm centi meat and toes for food. As a side note exp in akheva soloing is not too bad considering.<br />
<br />
As far as getting in a guild, the others are right, you have to make it happen. If you like a guild and you want to join, try to make some friends in the guild if you don't know anyone. The find out who is the guildleader and send him a tell. Tell him about yourself and why you want to join the guild. Most guilds are willing to give people a chance unless you're level and gear difference is too big (ie don't apply for a time or better guild when you don't even have tier 3 or elemental flags). If the guild raids VT or some other ass zone that needs key/flag make sure you have the flag/key or are close to getting it.<br />
<br />
And last thing, your cousins are asses, I would go to their house and kick their ass. I always have room for close friends in my group if I solo/duo or whatever unless the group is full. Those excuses are just lame.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Phoenix Connection</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Yes, my cousins are all assholes. They do everything together, and I never get invited anywhere.<br />
<br />
<br />
And they were the ones who got me into this game really. They said &quot;Dude, make a Shadow Knight, it rules. We'll all level together, and have a hella cool group so we can all group together.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah they all pretty much abandonded me when I was still in the 50's, and they were reaching the 60's. Now that I am 62, I figured we could start grouping again but all I ever hear is &quot;We have a tank, and your DPS sucks, so it would be pointless having you with us&quot; and I go &quot;Oh so family doesn't mean shit anymore?&quot; and they'll go &quot;it does but you have to understand...[insert lame excuse here]&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
What's really funny is whenever they need a raid size hit for a mob, or a quest I always get a tell &quot;hey wanna help [insert cousins name here] with a quest mob hit?&quot;<br />
<br />
I've basically told them all to go to hell now.</div></div><hr />

You can be talkative and still show people you are a good player. Its a game, and it doesn't take *that* much concentration.</div></div><hr />

Im probably just about the loudest mouthed bitch there is.<br />
<br />
I never have any problem to get an xp group. I kind of have to push them away with a stick actually.<br />
<br />
To play well and get things done is nice and all, but this hardly leave any kind of mark.<br />
<br />
Want the folks to remember you? Give a good show.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
On a side note, as Brael said, recruitment is never closed. A good player, regardless of the class, is always a good addition to a guild. Any recruiter who isnt a complete imbecile understand that.<br />
<br />
To post the recruitment of a class is closed is merely to cut on the application spam. Unless a guild is excessively bloated, a good player is just about never turned down (good references and to be know by your server community help quite a bit).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Raife</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Some advice... Please don't take this the wrong way.  Some of this may seem redundant, you may already do it.  Just don't get defensive, I'm not critisising you, just proffering some advice you may not have thought of.<br />
<br />
1) Don't sit in PoK.  Your level 62, do your LFG in BoT or Valor.  A group that needs &quot;one more&quot; might take the sk in the zone ahead of the rogue 4 zones over.  This is actually the case most of the time with pick up groups.  This one is huge... POK IS A HORRIBLE PLACE TO FIND GROUPS FROM!!!  Be pro-active, go to where you want to be, go to the group you want into, and sit next to them, when they have a space open up... they will probly take you cus your right there.<br />
<br />
2) If you want to get an adventure, go to the zone you want to adventure in, but be willing to go elsewhere when called.   Many people using the LFG tool look at the zone your in, if your not in a LDON zone they will usually take someone else first.<br />
<br />
3) Build groups and keep talking to them while you wait on healers.  Keep everyone engaged, chat about stuff, ask if they know any healers ect.  It keeps people form bailing on you, so when someone does show up, you have a group faster.<br />
<br />
4) Make a series of humourous hot keys.  This does WONDERS for you, trust me.  If you pull a lot, make an entire bank of different funny hotkeys like &quot;Booze + Shadowknight =%t incoming&quot; and stuff like that.  If you tank or just melee alot make a series of &quot;banter&quot; keys with the mob.  Switch them up to keep people entertained.  Even if your the worlds biggest fucktard, you will get groups cus your &quot;nice&quot; or &quot;really fun to have around&quot;... works for me, and I'm a huge fucktard.   You can do this one even if you don't like to type, cus you have everything on hotkeys.<br />
<br />
5) Use OOC sparingly.  About once every 5 to 10 minutes ooc that your looking for a group, do this in the level'ing zone.<br />
<br />
6) Use the &quot;note&quot; section in your lfg tool to let people know where you will go besides the zone your in. <br />
<br />
7) Keep notes on people who are good players.  Put them on your friends list and try to get in their groups later.  If they are already on an adventure or in a group don't be afraid to shoot them a tell.  If you complimented them the first time you played with them, they will probly like you, and find a spot for you in their group as soon as they can, or fit you into their next adventure.<br />
<br />
8) Be talkative.. but not TOO talkative.  Find a happy medium, try not to insult anyone.  Keep yourself focused on winning the adventure.  If the group is good say so.  This always scores you some points with people.  But don't chat just for the sake of chatting.<br />
<br />
9) Never whine/brag about your gear.  If something good drops say &quot;ooh nice, I'd roll on that&quot; but don't expect them to give it to you, and don't act like it's crap... you never know who might see it as an upgrade... and only the elite like elitists.... and your not elite.<br />
<br />
10) Get level 65 before you work on more aa's.  I know what your thinking &quot;but I have trouble getting groups, that stops me from getting 65&quot;.  That is true... but trust me, AA's are way easier to get once you get 65, and people see a 65 as WAY better than a 64... its pure perception... but it's the way it is.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps you out!</div></div><hr />

Sit in the zone, sure, but don't sit right next to a group.  It's annoying as hell to have some random person sitting by your group.  It's kinda like when your sitting in a room in your house/work/wherever and someone comes and stands at the doorway and looks at what your doing.  I'm not alone on the matter either - it becomes a discussion topic in groups/among my friends on occasion when someone does it.  <br />
<br />
4) Make a series of humourous hot keys. This does WONDERS for you, trust me. If you pull a lot, make an entire bank of different funny hotkeys like &quot;Booze + Shadowknight =%t incoming&quot; and stuff like that. If you tank or just melee alot make a series of &quot;banter&quot; keys with the mob. Switch them up to keep people entertained. Even if your the worlds biggest fucktard, you will get groups cus your &quot;nice&quot; or &quot;really fun to have around&quot;... works for me, and I'm a huge fucktard. You can do this one even if you don't like to type, cus you have everything on hotkeys. <br />
<br />
Having one signature comical inc button is cool.  Having a barrage of hotbuttons is annoying as fuck.  It makes you appear to be oozing with lazyness.  It's not amusing.  If you think you've got this awesome system of hotbuttons that nobody will realize your not really talking, you're dillusional... I guarantee you people will catch on faster than you'd think.  <br />
<br />
Witty conversation is a good thing.  Making a bunch of lame hotbuttons in an attempt to be witty is not.  <br />
<br />
Other than that, Raife's suggestions aren't bad.  That said, if you really have to work this hard to project a personality that will lead to your being well liked, there might be deeper issues...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Open up the LFG window and build your own groups.  You'll get a reputation for it and people will seek you out after a while.  And remember, a cleric isnt *required*.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Raife</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Yeah, those are good points.  I guess I misrepresented what I meant in point 4.  I dont mean to spam people with them.  I meant to use one for 5 or 6 minutes, then switch to another, just make sure they know it's your pull message hehe.  <br />
<br />
Having a dozen or so fun pull messages never hurt anyone.  But it won't make people think your not using hot buttons, they are just less likely to notice you don't talk much.<br />
<br />
As for point one, I disagree.  If you want into a specific camp, it's not a bad idea to go to the camp.  This is usually only important for loot list camps.  But I've never had a problem with a character hanging out near our camp, it just never bothered me... but maybe I'm just a little easier going about what other people do.<br />
<br />
Now that I've thought about it... I've never done this one myself, I've just seen others do it and let them into my group... maybe I'm more forgiving than others.  This one might be a bad idea.  Go to the zone, not the group hehe.<br />
<br />
As for him &quot;working hard to project an image that is well liked&quot;, being likable and memerable is a SKILL.  It is not something people are born with or without.  That is why professional comedy is the world it is.  A professional comedian is just someone who has mastered these skills.  Not everyone has them.  It isn't indicitive of intelligence level or skill in other areas, it is simply a set of skills a person has not yet developed.  The idea's I put forth, for the most part, are part of this interpersonal skillset.<br />
<br />
I'm an amature stand up comedian, and every professional entertainer/comedian I've talked to acknowledges that being liked by many people (not just a close group of friends) is a skill.  Heck, there are even presidents who have gotten elected purely on their mastery of the skills required to be liked by a large group of people.  Some individuals just need to develope these abilities.<br />
<br />
Ok I'm done failing to practice those things myself...</div></div><hr />

If you send that chanter that owned so much in your last run that you need him again, he is 50% likely to come.

I'm a pretty decent player, I mean hell, all ya gotta do is chain cast CD and make sure you don't train the group on pulls. It's not that hard. So in the meantime I make small talk, shit talk and generally harrass someone in the group who is twinked out. I'll make fun of their lame skills and wierd funky bard clothing. Shit like that amuses people and makes them remember you. Just gotta be careful of those anal retentive people who have no sense of humour. You don't wanna group with dickheads anyway so screw those types. (unless it's a barbraid raid :P I'll put up with that guy, he's only an ass because he leads 70+ idiots around all day)<br />
<br />
When I put up LFG I usually get a group within 10-15 minutes and the tell usually goes like &quot;Yo big guy, you wanna come to PoV and trample some rocks again with us?&quot;. <br />
<br />
Damn straight I do.<br />
<br />
Good advice here though, pretty much make your own group. Don't sit in PoK, go travel to the zones you want to xp in. Solo. Log out and go outside. Pretty much the only options.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The reason I sit LFG in PoK is because if I sit anywhere else generally I am unbuffed, and have to run back to get virtue, kei, focus, etc. It's annoying, and it makes the groups wait. You might suggest &quot;get buffed before you go to the zone&quot; Well I have done that many times, and the buffs were gone before I got a group...<br />
<br />
<br />
To be honest, I don't really have much of a sense of humor. I don't really laugh or know how to be funny. It's just my nature, I guess, so that suggestion is out.<br />
<br />
<br />
You know I have often thought about quitting EverQuest, but I enjoy the game too much to quit. I have tried other classes; Necromancer, Cleric, Ranger, Druid...and I hated all of them. I Like being a tank class. It's so much funner, and where all the action is, instead of sit, stand cast gem 4, cast gem 5, sit, stand. Shadow Knights are where the real fun is.<br />
<br />
Final Fantasy X sucks, but I assume it's a typo and you meant Final Fantasy XI. I thought about getting FFXI, but I'm going to wait for World of Warcraft. That came looks very interesting. And I don't really FPS's.<br />
<br />
I don't really think my time is a factor. Generally I start playing after I get off work which is after 2:00 p.m. Pacific Standard time, which is when everyone is getting off work, or getting done with homework (I would hope) Eastern Standard time. And as soon as I log in, I turn LFG on, and pray I get a group.<br />
<br />
Tonight wasn't that bad, but still bad. I sat LFG for about 3 hours, until I finally got a PoV group that lasted about 3 hours, which was good. I was able to get my 28th AA.<br />

Don't LFG...Make a group...become the group leader...go to a ldon camp...watch how many are lfg....become the one who organizes the group and gets it started.<br />
<br />
After a while of this people start putting YOU on thier friends list and start asking you if you are getting a group together tonight...then they start seeing your name in BoT or HoH and say<br />

eventually you get<br />
<br />
&quot; I noticed you were not guild tagged. We are going on a raid tonight, would you like to come along?&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">I had the same problem many years ago.  At that time, I had two main characters, a 54 monk and a 53 druid, both started in 1999.  I couldn't solo either worth beans (monk's gear was poor, and I didn't like to quad kite with the druid).  I would sit LFG for hours, ooc in zones and try feebly to solo and either get my ass kicked or almost die and get little xp for the risk and effort.  I also didn't like to raid much, since that usually meant no xp for an entire evening (pre-/raid days), likely no loot, and hours of CR, etc.  It was a very frustrating time for me.  It took me 50 days to get to level 50 on my monk, longer on my druid.<br />
<br />
My solution was to get a second account and start an alt that could heal.  So, I started a cleric and used my druid to PL the cleric to 49 (11 days played).  I then used the cleric to PL the monk to 60.  I then created a druid on the second account so I could port the monk around, used the first druid to PL the second druid to 49 (well, started out as &quot;get to 29 for basic ports&quot;, then &quot;get another 4 levels for more ports&quot;, etc. till 44 -- then it was &quot;wth, get to 49 for sln, ds, etc.&quot;).  Was nice to be able to rez, sow and port back then (neither of my mains ever got a rez before level 50, I didn't know any clerics).<br />
<br />
I have not been LFG for 4 years (unless specifically told to, like for raids).  With 2 accounts, I can log in and IMMEDIATELY do something.  People ask to join you, not the other way around.  When there are too many people in your group to efficiently xp where you were at, I would then suggest going elsewhere according to the number of people we had.<br />
<br />
A second account was a godsend for me.  It completely changed my EQ life, made me independant, so to speak.  I wasn't the fastest leveller, I still had lousy gear but pp was coming faster because I wasn't LFG constantly.  I'm not the best 2-boxer in the world by today's standards either -- I used to impress people at a time when 2-boxing wasn't as common as it is now, but I haven't improved that much since then hehe.  But it was and is nice to log in and be able to do SOMETHING every evening and make some sort of progress instead of logging after hours of LFG with nothing to show for your time.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Cyrano</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">All good advice. best suggestion I make is crank yourself to 65 however and worry about AA after. Even a mid 60's group will take the guaranteed benefits from having level 65 versus rolling the dice on whether or not you have AA to compensate for that lack of level. When you're that close to maxxing your level the difference becomes a lot more pronounced and the assumption is that you are just another twink with lousy gear and no aa on the fast track to 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Lizarde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">It's a social game- chat with the group, make jokes, have fun.  They'll remember you and seek you out for groups in the future.<br />
<br />
I only use my SK for 2-boxing with my shaman main now, and I had to turn on /roleplay for him because he kept getting tells for groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>loathing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">I used to have issues grouping a lot, as well, but I'm a very impatient person, so sitting for 3 hours would be torture for me... So as soon as I log in, I type /who sham lfg all. (I prefer shammy healers if they're lvl 65 and have Q for LDoN).<br />
<br />
Usually, there's more shammies lfg than clerics, but if there's no shammies, I look for clerics. I pick a 65 lfg shammy, and spend 5 minutes convincing them that *yes*, they *can* slow AND heal. If there's no shammies or clerics, druids can be very decent healers as well, but then you *need* another person to be a slower.<br />
<br />
Then I look for a bard/chanter/beastlord, in that order. Tell them you're forming a 62-65 group (make sure your average is over 63). If you can't get any of those, try to get another tank that's higher level. No one will kick you out of a group that you made, and a lot of people would join a group with some under 65s rather than make their own group, I have no idea why.<br />
<br />
If you don't have any CC, get a mage/necro/beastlord to pet mez. Fill the rest of the spots with DPS -- there's always a ton of them /lfg.<br />
<br />
Voila, group! Usually, my ldon groups tend to wind up looking something like:<br />
<br />
SK<br />
Shammy<br />
Mage<br />
Beastlord<br />
Necro<br />
Rogue<br />
<br />
Then choose what works for your group -- if you have a necro, do a Butcherblock run -- necros are great at slowing undead! If you have a monk, you can do a Tak run -- FD pulling is often a necessity there, and you don't want to spend your mana doing that. Mainly, this makes people feel useful, and you want to do that. No one wants to play this game and be bored to tears. (although some proponents of the Holy Trinity might disagree! :rolleyes: )  <br />
<br />
You can swap out the mage/necro/rogue spots for almost any class, and here's the kicker -- get a wizard if you can. They have almost as much trouble getting into groups as shadow knights do, but guess what? They'll love you forever, because not only do they get a group, they get a group where they can pretty much chain nuke from the beginning of the fight. With a decent SK tanking, a wizard can really feel like their contributing, since aggro management is not as much of an issue.<br />
<br />
The point is that any class can be helpful, and restricting yourself to clerics, for instance, is really shortchanging the people like you, who also spend lots of time lfg. <br />
<br />
All that said -- level 62 sucks. Honestly. Sometimes, you have to suck it up, and find a lower level group -- they'll love a higher level tank, but exp for you will suck. But, it's certainly better than nothing.<br />
<br />
And a last suggestion, that you probably won't like -- I started a channel on my server for people that I group with that I find to be good players. There's too many to fit on my friends list, so I invite them to this channel, and tell them to invite the people *they* think are good, so we always have a pool of people we can trust, even if by proxy. I announce /lfg in that channel first, and try to get 4 or so people from the channel, and 2 random people, to see if they're good. If they are, I invite them to the channel. If they aren't, I know the rest of us can be fine without them. :)<br />
<br />
Another thing about starting a channel -- there will be lots of people there with guild tags... Or people who might want to form guilds. Then you don't need to apply, you'll get invited!<br />
<br />
This is mostly my LDoN strategy -- I don't go to the planes much, mostly because LDoN gear is still an upgrade for me. /sigh<br />
<br />
BTW, if you're doing LDoNs, look at the 760 armor in EF before you buy the 1492 armor in NRo. I got the NRo breastplate, but think the EF legs/helm/gloves are almost on par with the NRo stuff, and a lot less points.<br />

Hope this helps,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Cirulik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">Somewhat repeating what others have said, perhaps for emphasis.<br />
<br />
(1) Start your own groups -- any healer will do.  If the group isn't strong enough for the &quot;perfect&quot; spot, fight where you can as you add people and move when your group is stronger.  One reason a SK &quot;rocks&quot; is that we're versatile -- you can kite, tank, pull, and damage (ok, so our damage is only really good on raid mobs.....).<br />
<br />
Seriously -- I did this a lot from 55-65.  Only a druid to heal?  Pick a spot you can solo or nearly solo and you'll be a god.   Go to HoH where you can kite around the pillars, add a druid, and you'll have some nice fighting while you add to the group.  With a shammy it's even better.  Shoot I even did stuff like that at your level with a rogue or BST, if they were the only ones to recruit.  Eventually people will know you as someone who can adapt and make things happen.<br />
<br />
(2) Ask questions.  You don't have to be the life of the party fr people in guilds to get interested in you if you just show you're a good player and are interested in theri guild (while you are grouping) and express it.  Ask where they are currently raiding, anything.  Folks like that.<br />
<br />
(3) Be open for anything.  Nightmare too easy?  Do it anyway if you can get in a group.  Join your server pickup-flags channel and help with raids when people are forming - do a good job and you'll both meet people with whom to group and get to be known.<br />
<br />
(Last comment)<br />
<br />
We do rock --- if we rock.  We have the tools, and are one of the most versatile classes in the game.  I used to tease with a player-friend (shammy) that a perfect group was the two of us and any 4 others.  Kid about it in your LFG --  &quot;Great group looking for healer and DPS, have SK need 5!&quot;  <br />

You have the tools - use them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
another option is to just solo while waiting for a group, you'd get really piss poor xp, but it's still xp. PoD has some fearable mobs, you can aggro kite mobs in HoH too but they'd take you half a century to kill</div></div><hr />

Your cousins are min maxers.  Even so, if you level to 65, they'll start grouping with you.  More importantly, when they ask you to go help with a raid....GO DO IT!!!!!!<br />
<br />
No seriously, go do it, not for the raid, but for the buffs...then spend the raid getting to know the healers and slowers on it, and see who's available after the raid.  Use them as the start of a group, and yer good to go.  Make sure to not die.  At 62, you are not qualified even to offtank.<br />
<br />
Once you hit 64, you don't need pok buffs any more, as our hp/mana spell is as good as kei, and you can do just fine with whatever buffs are in yer group.<br />
<br />
One of the most important abilities of an sk is to be able to move anywhere independently...the abilitity to move and take over as tank in pov/bot is key...don't need to buy invis, can feign...etc.<br />
<br />
28 aas? stop it!  Start leveling. Remember to remind everyone about that ft10 their getting while fighting because of yer zevfears bite, people ferget that, just like they forget the 8 mana from pot9.  <br />
<br />
When putting together a group, first person to look for is a druid.  then a beastlord or bard, or ranger with epic.  then pick up a paladin.  Then fill out with whatever, perhaps a mage and necro.  Voila, you have a group of people who can't find groups, (other than the bard/ranger) that kicks a lot of ass.  What, paladin AND sk?  Paladin is half of your cc, and healing, and offtank, not to mention yer rez.  Yer the main tank.  Mana regen is via necro, beastlord, self, and druid buff, not to mention zevfears.  Kei is for sissies.<br />
<br />
Baring that, find a 62 shaman and duo frogs in pov to level yerself to 63.  Sometimes you gotta do it quick and dirty.</div></div><hr />

I think LDON's are a good way to meet other players.  I go to BB and try to find a group, with my LFG on, but I do a few ooc.  Then I go to each of the camps and do the same.  Usually I will find a group.  When you get in a group, note the players who seem to be doing well.  I send a tell to each after the adventure, complimenting on their performance.  I will put these on my friends list.  After doing a couple of LDON's, so they start to recognize my name, I start contacting them when I log on.  It does not take too long to build up some relationships.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>Eggborn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">If you get a group, you may not need to run back to get buffs. There should be someone in the group to do so.  I tend not to shell out the cash unless I am soloing.  <br />
<br />
I like to have them if I am a key player for something I think is very difficult, but for most xp groups, whatever you have is probably fine.  Go to those zones and hang out.<br />
<br />
Heck I think I got from 62 to 64 in HoH kite groups, where I do not belong at all!!  There are usually a few kiters in the graveyard that may welcome the help or a person who can pull a few or take some hits if things go badly.  I got these groups by going there, seeing two or three people and asking if I could join.  <br />
<br />
Normally I am way to lazy and dont have the time to put together groups (as I play maybe 2 hours when not raiding).  I solo a lot.  I love tradeskills.  Duoing is a blast too.  Go help those shouting for people.<br />
<br />
As far as your cousins having a pally... I got from 58 to 62 and beyond because of a pally who would put together groups.<br />
Two or more tanks is fine.<br />
<br />
If you have a pally and sk, for ldon and some places, no druid, cleric needed. Get the pally to stun and get a shammy.<br />
<br />
Or, do crazy stuff.. All sk groups, etc. easy ldons work fine with just about anyone.</div></div><hr />

People who go sit in a bar with their face in a drink and never get off their butts and go after the girl they want don't get the girls they want, even if they have lots of desirable qualities.<br />
<br />
People who go to a cafeteria and sit at a table with an empty tray get far less food than all those people in line grabbing the food they want.<br />
<br />
What I'm getting at is in almost every aspect of life, those who want something AND take the action to attain it, get it far more often than those who want something and hope others catch on.<br />

I'm 13.. that's a new one.. I'll remind the waitress next time I go down to American Pie.<br />
<br />
Oh, and don't forget to include that you paid for your character because you obviously have no fucking clue as to what is a Shadowknight and how to play him, especially as evidenced below:<br />

<br />
Wrong motherfucker.  Your character is mostly what you make of it.  If you buy your shit off of ebay and then don't know how the fuck to play him, don't come crying here about how much your pussy is bleeding because no one wants to group with your sorry ass.<br />
<br />
Out of all the characters I have ever played in EQ, which was about 3 years, SKs were BY FAR the most fun to play.  Cool armor, cool weapons, good grouping skills, good solo skills, and all the attitude that you needed.<br />
<br />
I don't run around comparing myself to other classes.  Gee, I can't port by myself, but then again I am not a gay fucking druid.  Gee, I can't rezz, but then again I am not a cleric.<br />
<br />
So if you want to live your little fantasy and say SK's are  the greatest on the planet while I come to reality and realize that SOE had no clue what they were doing when they created us<br />
<br />
The last thing you should be doing is telling people to stop living in a fantasy world.  You need to go and buy the Brady Guide to EQ or something , drink a nice cup of STFU, and learn that complaining about SKs is not what this board is about, you fucking foreskin muncher.<br />
 <br />
Toltanus Thule its people like who are the reason why our epics stink,<br />
<br />
Epic is a status symbol these days, but when it first came out, it fucking owned.  But oh, that was before your time, when you were still trying to find a decent buy on ebay...<br />
<br />
 our agro spells dont work,<br />
<br />
Funny, mine work just fine.  And if you had leveled on your own or with some groups, you'd know this too.<br />
<br />
we had to wait for a decent DD spells until POP<br />
<br />
Funny how I never had a problem with DD mostly because I was ATTACKING THE FUCKING MOB, SICKING JOBABER ON THE MOB, KITING THE MOB, AND DOTTING THE MOB.<br />
<br />
DD spells were a bonus, but trust me, many people did just fine without them.<br />
<br />
, we had no real mana boost for groups,<br />
<br />
I'm not an enchanter, so I could give a fuck.  Let them do that.<br />
<br />
ZB is a joke<br />
<br />
If all you do is depend on ZB, then the joke is you.<br />
<br />
Our pet is horrendous,<br />
<br />
That's because you have no clue as to how to use them.  Or maybe you haven't learned pet pulling yet... maybe that's in the Brady Games guide..<br />
<br />
we have no real buffs for our pets and have to resort to begging others to buff them for us<br />
<br />
They're not tanks.  If you are using them for tanking, you are a fucking retard.  But we've already established that...<br />
<br />
why we have no FD hot key<br />
<br />
1) We are not monks<br />
2) Death Peace hotkeyed will work wonders for you.  Look into it.<br />
<br />
Do yourself a favor and put the character back on ebay.  You are obviously not the person to be running a Shadowknight.</div></div><hr />

It's a wonder what being a little bit more open, talking to your group members, and making &quot;friends&quot; can do. I guess my whole aspect of &quot;letting my actions speak louder then my words&quot; was not what I had hoped it would be.<br />
<br />
So thanks to everyone for their advice. I still find periods where I sit LFG for hours on end, but in recent days I have been getting groups.<br />

I guess I should state that I absolutely hate LDON. I can wipe a whole LDON dungeon with my group, and walk away with only 2 blues of EXP. Thats just terrible, I'd like to ding 65 sometime in 2004, lol.</div></div><hr />
