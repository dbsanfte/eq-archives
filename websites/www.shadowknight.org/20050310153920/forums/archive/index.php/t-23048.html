  Phaed<br />
<br />
From what I've been told all Tier 4 Hate names can drop it. Overlord was apprently the first, and seems most common. However this could be becuase people tend to camp it, since the name came about first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Avengent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I got mine from the Mistress of Malevolence which is a Teir 2 mob according to the map on the walkthrough webpage.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>grinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">depends which tier your in and what your gear is.<br />
<br />
i can duo tier 4 and i got my essence solo'ing Mistress of Malevolance which is tier 2.<br />
she is also easy to solo pull since snare sticks, just invis in there snare and run out and fd, repeat untill she is out in the open single.<br />
its safe on the steps inside to med/regen about half way up where neither set of mobs can see you.<br />
<br />
i was about 7200 hp self buffed and around 1900-2000 ac depending on if self ac dd/recorse gets resisted or not.<br />
wielding sews, ft6 and 24 a tick regen.<br />
if that helps<br />
<br />
if you have a shaman with you then you wont have a problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nakky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Went up there boxing a shaman, and with another SK...we killed PH's for Overlord and the Chicky (forgot name)  both spawned at spawned at same time(about an hour/3 PH's)  and both had the essence, was CAKE with the 3 of us, and could probably hang solo, but would take a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nasiir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I wonder if I could duo the Mistress spawn with a 65 cleric (of lesser gear than myself)...<br />
<br />
Any thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">is Mistress of Malevolence the only Tier 2 name to have dropped it so far?</div></div><hr />
