<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Stradd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So how is it that I'm getting varied &quot;con&quot; messages from individual Crusader mobs -<br />
<br />
I'm warmly to Troopers in and outside Cabilis (no surprise there)<br />
<br />
I'm Apprehensive to the Crusaders outside Cabilis<br />
<br />
I'm both apprehensive and Dubious to Crusaders inside Cabilis depending on the individual mob. (Thought that was strange)<br />
<br />
I'm still Apprehensive to the first guild master and KOS to Glix? the guy you do the newbie quest through. (Much to my surprise I might add.)<br />
<br />
Prior to Greenmist quest I've not run across this variation in faction with mobs that are on the same faction. I especially found it strange that I was apprehensive to one guild master and Kos to another. <br />
<br />
<br />
Is it because I have yet to get the Iksar Necro Faction? perhaps some of the mobs are on both factions? or am I way off?<br />
<br />
 :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ashrai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Prior to Greenmist quest I've not run across this variation in faction with mobs that are on the same faction<br />
<br />
<br />
From what I can remember (was well over a year ago that I did this quest) there are:<br />
<br />
Crusaders of Greenmist (SKs)<br />
Cabilis Residents/Citizens &lt;-- if I remember correctly, both Argest and Tracker Whatsisname in FV were both on this faction, that is probably the one that's confusing you.<br />
Brood of Kotiz (Necros)<br />
<br />
Also, if I remember correctly there are a couple who are called &quot;Crusaders&quot; as far as their name goes but they are a necro or something. When you do enough explorer knives in LOIO you are able to hand in bone chips safely- however there is still an NPC guard/crusader who paths by who remains KOS until you raise his faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Stradd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks -<br />
<br />
I've done the knives and then bone chips ...<br />
The Crusader that paths past the gate is Apprehensive - <br />
<br />
Crusaders of Greenmist (SKs) I would have though that they all would have the same prefix name of &quot;crusader&quot; and they would all react the same in relation to my faction for Crusaders of Greenmist. <br />
<br />
ie if 1000 faction hits = apprehensive to Crusaders of green mist would I not be apprehensive to all Crusaders of greenmist?<br />
<br />
perhaps some of the mobs have multiple factions they are on ?  I am still kos to Brood of Kotiz (Necros)<br />
<br />
I'm wondering if some of the Crusaders are on both Necro and SK faction? Might that explain the difference in &quot;con's&quot; or am I just making this way to complicated?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Smidgit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You probably know it already, but Crusader Quarg is on the shaman guild faction.<br />
<br />
Some of the merchants in cabilis (both west and east) are on some other faction that I have not been able to determine. Anyone non-iksar, including characters that have never done any factioning at all, are dubious to them. The alchemy vendors and the necro guild spell vendors are on this mystery faction. I have chars that are non-kos there (one is shaman that has cudgel 8) who can shop at every &quot;residents of cabilis&quot; factioned merchant, but is unable to shop at the ones on the mystery faction. Pop an iksar illusion potion, and you are amiable to them.</div></div><hr />
