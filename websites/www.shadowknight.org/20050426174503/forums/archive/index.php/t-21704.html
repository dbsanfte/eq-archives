<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shadowmar Bloodlord</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am a dark elf sk, will I have to do the Khukri quest before I start on my greenmist quest? <br />
<br />
I read that I needed the newbie Khukri and if I am supposed to do that quest first how am I supposed to obtain the Khukri?<br />
<br />
Thanks for taking time to answer my question.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You can get the newbie khukri one of two ways. 1) Get your faction up (which you'll need for the quest anyway) and then talk to someone in Cabilis (I forget the name) to get a weapon that will proc a summon thing. You proc it 52 or so times, hand in what you get, and you'll get your newbie khukri. 2) Do it the easy way, get your faction up, and when you're ready to start the quest, make a newbie Iksar SK. Log him in, turn in the newbie khukri, log in your main SK, and hand in the rest of the first part of the quest. Now you're on your way. And yes, you must finish all 7 (? I think its 7, i forget.....) of the khukris before you can start on the actual Greenmist.</div></div><hr />

Explorer knives (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1663) quest.<br />
<br />
Bone Chips (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=260).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Explorer knives (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1663) quest. &gt; ALL ..... If you can, get a group in veksar (or just go and buy weapons from people there, i got most of mine free when they find out its for faction) to get your faction high enough with guards, then explorer knives all the way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shadowmar Bloodlord</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I knew about the bone chips but not about the knives, thanks a bunch. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zakton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I did the knives until the legion was warmly and then switch over to killing forsaken iksars in FoB and turning in the MM snout rings to the warrior guildmaster.  Killing the forsaken and the MM snout rings raised all my factions.  Be sure to raise your necro faction, Brood of Kotsiz (however it is spelled) because there is a necro standing in the SK guild.  ONce he agros the whole hall does and you will dead quick.   Crusaders won't talk to you about the quests unless you are warmly.  I have gotten up to indifferent and plan use to iksar potion to get it up enough for quests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Peztilence Forever</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Knives and the Iksar Outcasts that live in the caves in Warsliks woods are the best way to get Faction.<br />

I wouldnt bother with bones chips..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bushido32</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You can buy the Hero's Khukri in the Bazaar if you can find a seller (I saw one on Luclin for sale for 15K), so technically you don't need to do the Khukri quests.</div></div><hr />
