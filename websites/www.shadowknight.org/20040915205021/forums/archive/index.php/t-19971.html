<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>belize</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i'm at work and cant remember name, but at 1:15 last night my guild sent me tells to get my ass to GOD. they ran me through 4 or 5 zones, and got me invited to a instanced zone thing. the spear spell dropped off the boss of the instanced trial in the sewers refinery zone.<br />
<br />
other than port spells it was our guilds first spell drop.  just through i'd share so you guys can try for yours too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>belize</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">oh yeah. the spell looked like a rune on the corpse, and is no drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Could you scribe it directly? Or did you have to turn it in?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>belize</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">scribe directly</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That means they will not hit the bazaar, and you actually have to work for them. Nice :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thunderbumm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah, work like he did and run to the zone to loot it.<br />
<br />
Big difference!  Not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fezzika</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">So...so far the only way found to get an expansion spell is to gather X amount of people to raid a mob and get drop?<br />
<br />
<br />
wooooo...great expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>belize</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">it was one of the 6 man instanced zones for GOD trail flags. but unlike LDON in GOD you have the ability to add people to the trial if someone leaves or goes LD. in my case, someone dropped out of group, the druid was made leader, gated to natimbi and invited me. i follwed her back to dead mob. looted, then we evaced to zone, i dropped group. original member rejoined, and the group that won the trial went back and hailed thing to get their flag. <br />
<br />
they got their flag they worked for, and spell didnt rot. <br />
<br />
not claiming its the best system in the world, but just getting info out so people have ideas where to look for their spells.</div></div><hr />

I love it.  These arent new spells in the traditional sense that would come with new levels.  Its like ancient spells in Luclin, and &quot;better gear&quot; is in general.  You gotta go earn them.<br />
<br />
Justification is that they add no new ability.  They're just marginal upgrades to existing spells.  You lose nothing by not having them.  And its a little reward for the raiders.</div></div><hr />

Yay, now imagine doing that every time you do the instance and a spell drops that someone in your group can't use. <br />
<br />
Or having people do the trial, then cycling in gimps that didn't do it.<br />
<br />
Sounds ultra-win. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Vuurl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I just love you people in this thread saying &quot;cool now you gotta WORK for your spells&quot;.What the hell are you talking about? He did not work to get that spell.Others did the work and he went and looted it.<br />
<br />
I don't see anything wrong with someone else doing the work and you loot the spell,but the guy getting the spell did not work for it and you can work just as hard buying a spell in the baz.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Chania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">His guild did the work, his friends and guildmates. I'm sure he's done stuff for his guildmates too. Lame_SK_01 buying it in the bazaar cause he macro'd tradeskill sploits isn't the same thing. I find it amusing that people think because they all pay $12.95 they are entitled to the same phat lewts as the next guy.<br />
<br />
EDIT SoE did their best to give this spell only to those who are actually present. And how exactly do you want SoE to ensure that you do the work? Code it so that if no SK hits the mob, he doesn't drop an SK spell? Hmm actually, thats a good idea...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Torahdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Try posting the mob that dropped it please. Not a instanced boss dropped it, There are like 500 of those!<br />
