In a bizarre twist to a disturbing case, a man who allegedly had sex with the corpse of an elderly woman cannot be charged for that incident act.<br />
<br />
But that apparently is not a crime in California. According to Assistant District Attorney Adrian Ivancevich, who is prosecuting the case, there are no laws in California that specifically address necrophilia <br />

I'd imagine his quality of living is going downhill in a hurry with or without a current law to punish that act.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In most states rape is defines as &quot;non-consentual&quot; so as long as she didn't say yes...<br />
<br />
This is to protect women rom roofies and Dentists with laughing gass who like to do unconcious women.<br />

Aren't people wonderful creatures?</div></div><hr />

Ted Bundy, Charles Manson and Andrew Conanin(SP?) all went to school or spent time living in Wisconsin as well.<br />
<br />
So we have all sorts of laws for things you can hardly imagine people would do to each other.  Though I don't know the sentence for making a lampshade off someone that reminds you of your mother.<br />
<br />
Oh, and now for the last 7 years somebody has been pushing drunk college boys off a bridge to thier deaths in LaCrosse (at least that's one theory)<br />

Don't forget the most annoying fans in the entire US-of-A...<br />
When I moved here from SoCal, I was in disbelief that anybody could be so into a team, yet alone an entire state. It's kinda sad. <br />
But then again, what else is there to do here? <br />
Wisconsin slightly &gt; Wyoming. I can't even find decent Mexican food here. :( <br />
I feel like breaking into a funeral home now.</div></div><hr />

 If I break into a supermarket and start sticking my dick in meat and having sex with a pile of raw meat I am not raping a cow..<br />
<br />
 Its more vandalism than rape.</div></div><hr />

Give them time.  Eventually one will get caught in the supermarket meat section one night.<br />
<br />
Odd that there are laws against sex with farm animals, but not butchered animals.</div></div><hr />
