<br />
And when they battle in a puddle, <br />
it's a tweetle beetle puddle battle. <br />
<br />
AND when tweetle beetles battle with paddles in a puddle, <br />
they call it a tweetle beetle puddle paddle battle. <br />
<br />
AND... <br />

When beetles battle beetles in a puddle paddle battle<br />
and the beetle battle puddle is a puddle in a bottle... <br />
...they call this a tweetle beetle bottle puddle paddle battle muddle. <br />
<br />
AND... <br />
<br />
When beetles fight these battles in a bottle with their paddles <br />
and the bottle's on a poodle and the poodle's eating noodles... <br />
...they call this a muddle puddle tweetle poodle beetle noodle bottle paddle battle. <br />
<br />
AND... <br />
<br />
Now wait a minute, Mr. Socks Fox! <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Culdahl1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I read several seuss books whilst on acid one time to a few of my friends who were also on acid.....I think we also based a religion on on one of the books for a short period ('till we came down and realized how gay it was).  That puts dr. suess and the lion king as two of the best things to do while on acid.</div></div><hr />
