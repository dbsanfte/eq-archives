<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Baglarn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering if any of you have tried soloing any of the old Kunark dragons? Im talking about &quot;soloing&quot; either while raid buffed soloing only selfbuffed.<br />
I was able to solo the spawned Fay easy (didnt have to HT or use any disc) but I guess it is much weaker than the bigger ones.<br />
<br />
We now can HT for around 8,5k while still having leech disc up for lifegain and I guess they wont resist ToI :D so maybe it could be done.<br />
<br />
Here is my magelo in case you wonder what kind of gear I use: Baglarn (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=335931)<br />
<br />
I have some AA saved up atm so I could get fearless if you think it would be needed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dknight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, in the arena in a thread about increasing the level cap to 70 Breal says...<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't remember shaman epic mob, refresh my memory on it, and tell me. Is it easier or harder than Gorenaire? Old Gore doesn't even drop me under 80% hp/mana (and thats when an ae lands, my cr kinda sucks) to give you an idea of just how much I could take.&quot;<br />
<br />
Talendor would be easier and Servelious be about the same or harder depending on resists I imagine.  I know I've read about various SKs soloing Old_Ruins_of_Kunark_Dragon_01 before so it's not anything new.  That's just the most recent mention that sprung to mine.  Depending on your server, actually finding them up might be more of a problem than actually killing them. :p<br />
<br />
Personally, I've never soloed any of them, nor have I really tried.   I have hydras so I've 3boxed them and my gear sucks, so I imagine much better equipped SKs would easily solo them as Breal says.  I'd say I've even duoed them.  My damn BST spent the whole time feared, practically. :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
I don't know how much MR would be needed to make it so you'll basically never have a fear land, but If you're going to be attempting totally solo I'd definitely suggest fearless.  Getting feared even one time might make things messy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Baglarn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">ok thanks Dknight, im gonna give it a try now :D<br />
<br />
If Brael can I can :p You are probably right, finding them up is the biggest challenge :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dknight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm sure you can do it!  I'm also sure I don't know how to correctly type Brael as I see from my earlier post.  Post results if you ever find them up. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dkhar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Been done already. Our resident female Uber SK did it. Use search. Awesome fight.</div></div><hr />
