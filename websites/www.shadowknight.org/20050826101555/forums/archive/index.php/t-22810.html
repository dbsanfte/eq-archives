Could it be that they &quot;unnerfed&quot; the mobs to tune them for lvl70 groups?<br />
<br />
Our Warrior was getting killed every other mob  :eek:  (exaggerating a bit)<br />
He had no problem to do all of Tipt including the nameds successfully before. Only thing that really changed was that we had a &quot;virgin&quot; Cleric in the group, was her first time in Tipt but she is an experienced, elemental equipped Cleric.<br />
Did anybody else notice a difference or is it my imagination?<br />
I know thats very vague, should have loged and parsed but I was lazy  :o</div></div><hr />
