<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Marder Blacksoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Need some opinions.  I have a real competent group that I hunt with on a regular basis (all level 65 including a Chanter, 2 Clerics, Paladin, Warrior, Shaman and me).  For the most part we know what each of us are going to do before we do it....that kind of thing.  We have taken out Servitor of Luclin (probably the biggest one group fight we have had) Talendor (push over) and Sev (ditto).<br />
<br />
I think we could do Doze but it would be an extremely long fight.  We are planning to try it with probably 2 full groups (maybe only 3 or 4 in the second group adding to the mix a ranger and a wizzie).  We are all SS equipped (save one cleric who is PoTime) with some upgrades included (look at my Magelo for an example).  My HP are just over 6500 buffed but I am not tanking so that should be irrelevant.<br />
<br />
I guess my question is, do you think we could do it?  I am very strongly of the opinion we can do it with one and a half groups but my companions are less sure than I.<br />
<br />
Also, for those who have killed him, how many did you have and how did it go?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Moongarm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">One grouped him several times, some guildies almost got him with four a few days ago but no shaman and chanty had trouble getting slows in and the cleric ran oom eventually due to that,  they wiped whem dozer was at 18%.<br />
<br />
With the setup you said you should be able to kill him, it will just take a long time since with your single group you have no real DPS classes adding in the other group will help out a lot but it will still be a long fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've heard a 4 person doze kill with NToV/some ssra gear.  Warrior, druid, not sure of the other 2 classes.  Took about 40 min from engage to death.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Daegul Mistweaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">When handling Doz with low DPS, but a makeup that can grind him down safely; where's the best spot to pull to in light of repops?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rhowne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">HoT repops are 72 minuts I believe (it's been a while), so assuming you kill the entry pair and time the 3 wanderers, you should be ok to fight him in the pit (never fought him in his room myself).<br />
<br />
He can be pulled up top, and I would assume that with the door closed and from up there you won't have any adds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">up top or pit... usually fought the wurms up top in the right corner iwth the firepot, same spot we did doze the one time I killed him.  Whatever works for ya.  Might be able to keep him un-walled for ranger bow dps if you use the pit.  Otherwise... slam him into the corner for easy positioning, but positioning isn't as big a deal with a small raid size.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>bainin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">he's small enough that pulling him to the HoT Door area doesnt necessarily mean he will be walled.<br />
<br />
He can be single grouped with slower.</div></div><hr />
