<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kebsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I need information on the drug tests where they swab the inside of your mouth.  Specifically, how effective they are (as in how far back can they tell if you used drugs) and if there's any way to beat them.  I would search it myself by I don't know what they're called specifically, I just heard of them today.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dannzig</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Saliva testing is generally a short-term procedure. It is commonly used by Insurance companies for detecting the presence of Nicotine, alcohol, marijuana, meth and cocaine in the chemicals in your mouth. Since this is usually a Suprise test or a Scheduled test such as an Insurance test, your only defense is to be prepared. Our mouthwash will instantly negate any chemicals in your saliva from registering on the test. If you have a supply on hand, you can easily evade the surprise saliva test in 3 short minutes. <br />

best i could find doing a search</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dannzig</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">btw i just used swab drug test in google and got a butt load of companies wanting to sell me &quot;pass that test&quot; kits</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fenrix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Swab is short term....maybe a month or 2 tops iirc? Hair follacle they can see quite a ways back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>morbbidd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i believe 2-3 months,if they go for the hair one,your fucked unless you take a bath in nair or how ever it is spelled.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kebsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hmm...I did a search on google and got a couple of hits that said the saliva swab one is only good for a few days.<br />
<br />
Further information:  me and a friend are going to have to take this swab test in a a week or two.  We both stopped smoking de weed back in January so that's not a problem.  But my friend has been doing some club drugs up until just recently...say a week or two ago. <br />
<br />
We were figuring it was a piss test so that's what we were preparing for, it was a surprise when they told us it was a swab test, and neither of us are really sure how effective they are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Manamven Tor'Kurr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Generally the only drug that's going to show past 4-7 days on any drug screening is weed, which can be detected up to a month later.  The only exception is a hair test which can detect quite a bit back depending on where they got the hair from (since not everyone shaves all thier body hair and it could have been with you since before taking the drugs).  But in most states, companies cannot hold anything past 3 months old against you on that show on the hair tests.  Hell, in some states hair tests won't even hold up in court.<br />
<br />
As for the saliva tests, mouthwash could beat it as long as it's not testing for alcohol.  If they are, you're screwed if you use the mouthwash.  Just lay off the weed and other shit for a week or two and you guys should be fine with just a saliva test.  They're not 100% accurate anyways (supposively 99%), just kinda an insta-check sort of deal.  They're most likely just doing a quick little check on you guys and if anything shows up, they'll then give you either the hair test or the piss test.<br />

And to think I thought working at a drug testing facility would never provide some useful knowledge here...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Manamven Tor'Kurr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I've never been tested since I took this job about a year and a half ago.  Our boss use to threaten to test us all once a month but I think he knew he'd lose over half his staff if he did.</div></div><hr />

Pot will stick around alot longer since its stored in your fat cells (interesting fact you brain is 96% fatty tissue) and usually stay for 30-90 days. Since you guys havent been smoking the Rasta your fine.</div></div><hr />

Well, me and my friend are going into the ILA, and they drug test you right when you enter.  I think it's for insurance purposes.  Other than that there aren't any tests unless you come in looking like a douche bag every day, then your foreman can order you drug tested.  Also if there's an accident on the site they test you to see if you were stoned or drunk when it happened.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>brian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">well, if someone wants to swab me I'll insist that they swab my anus.  We'll argue a while and finally they will just let me go because they  don;t want to swab my crack.  And if they *do* agree to swab my rectum, I'm scot free because I don;t put drugs up my butt unless they are safely stored in a balloon.</div></div><hr />

You are incorrect... LSD doesnt show in drug tests..Meth , heroin and coke last 72 hrs tops...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>brian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I never tried heroin...  but I used to smoke opium when I could get it...  is heroin much different?  I always thought it would be just another opiate, but boy people sure are dying to get their hands on it  :P</div></div><hr />
