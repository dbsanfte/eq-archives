<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Daegul Mistweaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Whip up a pet and go to town in the newbie yard in Paineel.  Insta-kills and I'd say a good 35% of the MOBs are skels there.  Respawn extremely rapid; you'd be hard pressed to keep the yard clean and still loot.</div></div><hr />

Depends on your level<br />
<br />
Kurn's is always good (most mobs there are skellies level 10-20)<br />
<br />
I got bags and bags doing the pyramids in DL in my late 40's early 50's<br />
Not as quick but exp with bone chips = win.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vindarius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">north ro from the edge of the desert to the freeport zone at night. worth it if yer passing through for a quick stack or two.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>KlaoofQuell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Kurn's tower is the best. I farmed probably over 50 8-slot backpacks full of bone chips for Cabilis faction before I knew about explorer knives. Could fill 5 backpacks full in about 2 hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Elkar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I usually take the book to Everfrost for a few quick kills, just enough to supply me for a bit.  It's an easy run to wayfarer camp from there, so anytime I'm hitting aug pools or GoD I grab a few there.<br />
<br />
Also remember to kill a couple skels in nek forest (temple near book and wanderers) on the way to lavastorm.<br />
<br />
I try to farm them when travelling so it doesn't seem like I'm wasting time farming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Puurrdy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Throw up DS, start at the bottom of Kurns, tick off every skeleton on the way to the room at the top.  Get in a corner, 3 or 4 minutes later clean up about 20 skeletons, do the same on the way back to the bottom.<br />
<br />
Usually I can snag about 2 to 3 stacks of bone chips in one round trip.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Silvershadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Kurns tower is the best place for farming bone chips, hands down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Medzgaleer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Or just spend a few gold and buy some stacks of cheap meat in Thurgadin and have a necro convert them into bonechips instantly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gorgonbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">:eek: <br />
someone still needs bonechips?<br />
<br />
I got about 4bags of bonechips rotting on my mule's bank. Just brought them from venders while doing vender farm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Belyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If you have the gear howling stones is pretty good for bone chips.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Kurns, TofS (first level - good bone:skelly ratio, but not many spawns), paineel - there are several good places to farm.  I never really farm bone chips though; I always kill skellys as I pass them when traveling, which usually takes care of me, but if you need more, ask a necro with flesh-to-bone AA - meats are like 9 copper or something; can't get much more economical.</div></div><hr />
