<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Moonslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What spell does the Invoke Death pet proc?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Assuming Invoke Death is our lvl 64 pet, it procs some crappy lifetap that won't affect anything that you kill for xp. The proc is only useful for when you're farming green trash, basically.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">speaking on this subject.. the other day I was soloing and had my pet with two of the stun weapons (the only ones that were available in the bazaar).<br />
<br />
I would see the effect from his proc but because we dont see pet spell damage I could not tell if it was working on the mob itself. There were no messages similar to beast pets or mage pets where it said mob was shredded with air (or whatever). My though was that the mob was resisting 100% of the damage he was doing and I am wondering if that was true. <br />
<br />
Since we cant parse pet proc damage (that I know of, correct me if this is wrong) is there any real way to know if the mage weapons are worth buying and equiping for old Jabober?</div></div><hr />

its also useful when you let your pet beat the crap out of a level 50 rogue in poj for shits and giggles. aside from that, it doesnt proc on crap.<br />
<br />
yes, the mage weapons do help. although personally I've never bought any. My favorite pet weapon of all time are broken bottles though. They may not be very good, but mr. chips looks kick ass duel wielding beer bottles =x</div></div><hr />

Mage summoned pet weapons don't proc a stun, only 150 points of damage. If you really want your pet to proc a stun, I would recommend gnoll hide lariats.<br />

If you see the message &quot;XYZ was slashed by flying debris&quot; then the spell landed. If a mob fully resists the proc you won't get the message. There really isn't a way to know if the spell landed for full or partial damage though. Most magician's will cast malosinia on a mob to drop it's resists then assume all proc's land for full.<br />

This is a matter of opinion really. How much is adding 100hp to your pet worth to you? Are the magician's on your server selling them for a reasonable amount or are they ripping people off left and right?<br />
<br />
Only way to parse it is assume the swords/fists land for whatever amount you think is accurate per proc and multiply that by the number of procs. If you're grouped with a shaman or magician, it's somewhat safe to assume your pet's procs will land for full due to the mobs being debuffed. Otherwise, guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Only one vendor sells any summoned gear on Test. She only sells items occasionally and they go for 4pp each. Mostly face masks, belts, and the magic or fire based dd weapons.<br />
<br />
When that vendor isn't on it can be rather difficult actually to find summoned items as magicians aren't exactly ultra common here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>kassdax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Only 4pp each piece of summoned gear? No wonder you have a hard time finding summoned stuff. I'd  guess there's probably a lot of /anon mages. Just a suggestion. If you find a 62+ mage, offer them 150pp for two sets of summoned gear then add them to your friends list.<br />
<br />
The way several of the mages I know see making summoned gear for others is a lot of people don't have a problem shelling out 25-50pp per kei. That typically means a chanter will get 125-250pp per 900 mana used. Two sets of pet gear = 800 mana. Do a little math, apply a touch of logic and formulate something based on those. Don't take this as a hard and fast rule, but results may change in the future for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You dont understand.. buffs are not sold on Test.. not ever.<br />
<br />
You would not convince a chanter to come buff you for money on test it just doesn't happen. If one is bored and in PoK or PoT they might buff you but they wont take pp.. its just the way things work here. <br />
<br />
Its nice really. It keeps things quiet and civil.<br />
<br />
And pet stuff isn't worth 150pp.. lol I would say 4pp per peice is about fair.</div></div><hr />
