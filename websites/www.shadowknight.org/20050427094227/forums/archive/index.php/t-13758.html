<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vuloshek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I hear people mention that you need to get your AGI to at least 75 base, or else some penalty will apply later.  I can't find any information about this anywhere, just rumors.  What is this penalty?<br />
<br />
Any proof to back up the rumors would be great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bick is Bad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">AC penalty. If you want proof, make an ogre SK and leave his Agi below 75, then put on an item that will raise it above that number and your AC will raise significantly.<br />
<br />
-Bick</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vuloshek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Right, that makes sense.  By why have an innate agility of 75?  Assuming you'd be able to get agility above 75 pretty quick, should one still put in 5 points at creation time?<br />
<br />
I guess it doesn't much matter, 5 points.  It's just that this is about an Erudite, and those 5 points could really be used elsewhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>SorishMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Due to the knee-bends in the calculations, you should try getting your 4 primary combat stats above 75 to start (makes things easier later when that's 5 less points you have to worry about).<br />
<br />
Ultimately, you're going to want to boost STR/STA as high as you can go with gear, and get AGI/DEX over 100 (more is nice, but you won't miss it much if you don't get much above 100).  So, in the long run, starting points really don't matter much.<br />
<br />
My personal preference when doing picks is to get all of the 4 combat stats to 75+ (preferably as close to 100 as possible).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vuloshek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">So your suggestion is, when starting an Erudite SK, put 5 pts in STR, AGI, and DEX to get them to 75.  This leave 5 for STA, giving me 80 STA starting.  Careful, its blasphemy to suggest doing anything but putting points in STA!!<br />
<br />
Honestly, I can get stamina up that extra ten points as easily as I could get both STR and DEX up those 5 points that I wouldn't have used originally in either.  I was just thinking, 5 AGI, 15 STA, run with it.  Does this even matter anymore?<br />
<br />
Still not sure... Erudites are so damned puny, but I just gotta make one.<br />
<br />
I wish Sony would release some hard stats on these things so we could make informed decisions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>lorddaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">erudites are like trolls. you make one because that's what you want to play.<br />
<br />
either that or you like stumbling around in the dark going &quot;hi, i'm a gimp&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Khawain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I am a Ogre Shadowknight and I don't not put 5 points to agi at creation, and I wish I did.<br />
<br />
<br />
Of course it's easy to get +5 in agi items, but you always have to watch it else your AC will drop too much.<br />
<br />
I very often found myself facing a great piece of gear, but by using it my agi would be below 75 and I loose to much because of that.<br />
<br />
When you become higher and get the somewhat better gear, then it's no real problem anymore.<br />
<br />
Same for Intelligence if you make a Ogre, I did follow the Crgaming tips at creation at put all points into STA.. now I wished I made INT and AGI 75, and put the remaining points into STA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Vuloshek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I prefer stumbling around in the dark saying &quot;the time of the white man is running out&quot;, equipped with my Clock of Flav-o-Flav in the neck slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tumy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Lmao, 5 Agi is so common its sad that you would put any of your 20 points into anything but STA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Puurrdy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Definity put 5 points into agility, or any physical stat/Int that isn't at least 75 to start out.<br />
<br />
You'll have (as an ogre) more str/sta then you know what to do with in the end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Vuloshek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The only reason I ask such a simple question is because I'm talking Erudite, and 3 of the main attributes are below 75 to start.  If all of those stats can be put above 75 at the very start of the game with gear, why allocate points?<br />
<br />
It just seemed that some people were implying that you'll get a penalty for &lt;75 natural AGI regardless of your gear.  Seemed fishy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>SorishMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Only other choice is to use Magelo as a simulator... whip up an erudite profile, put the gear on it that you think you'll have at level 10-20ish and then see how your starting picks play out.<br />
<br />
My base INT as a troll is 67... (shrug) low mana pool only bothered me when trying to fear kite (less margin for error) or in a boss mob fight where I'm LT'ing to stay alive.  With gear, I've now gotten up to 100... just means I can think myself into trouble 50% faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Izda Battler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I have a 62 Ogre ShadowKnight..and i put my points into Sta and Str...i have no regrets about it.. Your Dex and Agi gets increased with the items you get at higher levels...plus you have the AA stat increases which you should be putting to anyways. So there is not really a problem</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Vuloshek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Good call.  I did just that.  Played with the Magelo, and found out how small the differences really are, even between Ogre and Erudite.  As for that AC gap:<br />
<br />
Naked, 70 AGI = 1 AC<br />
Naked, 75 AGI = 46 AC<br />
<br />
Wow.  Luckily, a simple +5 agi ring fixes that.  Damn good ac for a single 20pp ring.<br />
<br />
And damn, they aren't kidding when they say it doesn't make a difference at the end game.<br />
<br />
A naked erudite with STA 95 and INT 117 has 2230 HP and 1651 mana at lvl 65<br />
<br />
A naked ogre with STA 127 and INT 90 has 2410 HP and 1300 mana at lvl 65<br />
<br />
The only really big difference was in ATK - Ogre 140 STR, 63 atk; erudite 70 STR, 3 ATK.  I believe STR is a flat bonus to ATK, and it doesn't magically pop up a good 45 pts when you get past 75 STR (at 75 str, ATK was 8).  Big whoop though, that'll mean a lot... versus rats.<br />
<br />
These gaps seem easy to close.  Seems like it would be harder for the ogre to get 351 mana than it would be for the erudite to get 180 hp, but then again we're talking lvl 65, where these differences are at their peak.  Gear at that point should be way more than enough.<br />
<br />
Looks like it really comes down to no-stun, regen, and XP penalty.  No, scratch that, it comes down to looks.  Just wanted to apply some hard numbers; something more substantial than biased opinion.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>kaldron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I'd put 5 points into AGI on a new char (as I did with this one - Ogre). I put some points into Int and the rest into STA.<br />
<br />
People that think you should put all into sta don't look far enough into the end game when with buffs your sta will be maxed anyways, as is mine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>ayerroes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">If you have a serious shot at being in the high end game I am not sure you are going to benefit from these suggestions, or be asking questions here, or reading the creations guilds on CR.  So yes at 65 in an uber guild STA is probably your best choice, from what I hear.  I've been playing a long time and I am not 65.  You most likely willl be too.  So you do have to consider what that stat is gonna mean at 20th level as well.  Yeah you can get specific +agi gear, but until you are getting to the point where all items buff all stats that +agi item is being used in place of a +hp item (I would never waste a ring slot on agi).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Manslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Actually at 65 in an uber guild you would prolly be better off having put points into INT.  Raid buffs easily will max out all physical stats.  INT is definitely harder to max.  But that doesn't mean much for the road there:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">When I created my Ogre, I put it all in INT, knowing that I could easily find Melee stat items, or a nice shammy to buff me up!<br />
<br />
With the introduction of spears, int and mana pool become more important and I was pleased with my choice :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>neferaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Sta is really easy to get way over the cap with shaman buffs and you will always have those on raids. Agi, dex and str are boosted by avatar proccing weapons. The only int buffs are the kei series, and nothing else will stack with them that boosts int. I put all my 20 points in agi (so I would get more AC) but with primal proc I have it over the hardcap already. So I recommend int if you think you will get primal later on.</div></div><hr />
