<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kyer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Should I load up on AAXP before I hit lvl 65? I heard there's a big curve when you hit 65, you get far less AAXP than 64. Like about 6% solo at 64 campared to 3% solo at 65.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This subject has a lot of varied opinions, but I say get 65 first.<br />
<br />
(even tho I stopped at 62 and did 25AA, and then leveled to 65)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">In my experiece, if you're asking you're going to do AAs.  Whats the real question?  If you want the way thats going to yield a more powerful char and get you AAs faster, get to 65 immediately.  If you just want to do AAs because its funner for you, do AAs.</div></div><hr />

Don't solo at 65 unless you have no other choice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Naaklum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The way I read his post is that he wants 65 and aa's.  He is asking if you gain aa exp faster at level 64 than at 65 from what I read.  I've heard that aa exp is set no matter what level you are, but the person could have been wrong.  I would like to know this as well because I am currently 64.  Should I bust out a few aa's before I ding because I will be able to earn them faster now, or will I earn them just as fast or faster at 65?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ashrai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Get 65.<br />
<br />
I was lucky enough to get my Run3 from the AAs you get for flags so only stopped to get my Regen3 then went right to 65. Everything will get easier with each level and regardless of how much exp something gives at whatever level, the fact remains you have more of a chance and more zones in which to GET that XP if you are /ooc L65 SK LFG than if you are /ooc L60 SK LFG.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mdiyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The AAXP is based off of level 51, so the level you are does not influence that experience equation.  However, the mobs you fight can yield a greater amount of xp in that bar then say your regular xp bar.<br />
<br />
IMHO, I would get 65 and just get it out of the way, get enough xp to still be 65 incase of a death and go 10/90(reg xp/aa xp), and just enjoy all the AA you will be getting without having to worry about leveling anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Thack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'd say do what you want to do.  Personally, you are going to get AAs at the same speed at level 62 as you will 65 unless you manage to get to the elementals and get in groups, but that can take a while, so don't count on it<br />
<br />
What I did was just set my char at 20% AA from about 50 on.  The loss in exp wasn't significant, but I still earned AAs as I leveled.  IMO this enhanced the game for me and made me enjoy it more.<br />
<br />
Many people will say to totally ignore AAs and get to 65 ASAP and then do AAs.  This is kind of extreme and really once you hit 62 AAs won't be going up any faster.<br />
<br />
Just go with what you want to do and what will make you enjoy the game the most.  Personally, I think that the 20% AA worked really well for me, but others will disagree, as will I with them.  Just figure out what you want to do.<br />
<br />
I would say to not go over 20% AA for any reason until you are 61 or better.  There is a difference in how fast you gain AAs in the 60s compared to the 50s, and you'll slow down your progression too much for trivial gain.  Level 60 is a fast level to get through, so it's best to avoid AAs at 60 until you hit level 61 and exp slows down again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kyer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thanks for all the insights everyone!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>NorrynNoir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">being 65 will make getting groups easier which is the key to fast AA at 65 so i think in the long run 65 will make you happier because you won't LFG as long and feel frustrated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Get level 65 first.  Get flagged for plane of fire.  Zone in and say &quot;/lfg at tables&quot;.  This is the fastest way to get gobs of aa's.  Much much faster than farming aa's in sol b at level 52 on bats &amp; bugs, which is relatively fast for the 50's.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Moongarm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I stopped my cleric at 61 to pick up a few AA's for Radiant Cure and Divine Arbitration and AA exp was noticibly quicker at 61 than 65.  My cleric was getting AA's in 39 minutes while my SK was getting them in 52. So yeah there is a difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The difference between farming aa's at 61 (usually 62 is the example used) and 65...<br />
You are fighting the same mobs at boht levels, but at the earlier level they con higher to you so you get more exp.  Since AA's exp in a set amount needed, you get that amount quicker.<br />
<br />
So yes you can farm out aa's quicker at any level (62-64) faster than you can farm the same aa's at 65.  <br />
<br />
Why isn't this the generally accepted practice then?<br />
because: power increase from levels &gt; power increase from aa.  <br />
<br />
Summary:<br />
Not an awful idea to farm out a few at 64, but don't waste too much time just because you can farm an aa 3 minutes faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Lynxal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I stopped at 62 and 64 to farm AAs because the zones I was hunting in (5 man guild not getting into EP) were trivial as it was so the AA coming in faster was nice.<br />
<br />
However, if you plan on spending any time in LDoN then I would not consider stopping for anything on your way to 65.  Getting less than full AP value for an adventure would certainly be annoying and I would never have stopped to farm AAs if LDoN had been available.</div></div><hr />

All well and good, but know why you get AAs faster at 65?  You kill harder mobs in harder zones.  You group with other 65s and kill mobs faster.  If you're staying 62, or whatever, and grouping with 65's because you get AA exp at a relatively faster rate than them, you're robbing the group.  They're better off getting a 65 of the same class who will contribute more and increase their rate of exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">i played my sk from 1 to 55 no aa's stopped then and got run3 regen3. Then knocked out i think like 14 aa's in the time it took me to get to 65. I agree aa's were alot more fun to do then lvling heh.<br />
<br />
With my bots though cleric and bst i lvl'd both of them to 62 no aa's. Cleric stopped to do aa's at 62 since he had the main spell i wanted for him which was virtue. Bst kept lvling till 65 and luckily soon as i hit 62 my new 3box spot was hoh and i actually came into enough spec's to get my bst all his spells excluding SD. (paid 23k for the extra ft2/regen2 heh)<br />
<br />
Cleric stayed 62 to run3 regen3, scm3 hg1 ha1, rc1 dva1 was done then went and got 65 then just recently i grinded out the 9aa for mgb for him(said i'd never do it).<br />
<br />
So from what i experienced cleric would gain aa slightly faster then my sk and bst which is the reason why he waited so much longer to get 65 since he did his job (casting cheal) fine at 62 and scm3 helped him more then say getting 65. Now while you could notice the exp difference i dont think once did the cleric ever manage to get an extra aa. Though i must say i am much happier now htat the cleric is 65 then had i kept him 62 and gotten say healing adept3 or something heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kralthan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Another thing to keep in mind when trying to decide between lvl and AA is spells.  I'm not in a raid guild, and was having this conversation yesterday with some of my guildies....<br />
<br />
Right now the lvl 60+ spells ( well, mostly the 65 ones ) are kind of hard to find and pretty expensive.  In a few months, when more of the uberguilds on each server have completed PoP and are working more on GoD, those spells are going to become nearly impossible to find, and ungodly priced.<br />
<br />
While you still have the option of buying them at any time, it seems to me that a lvl 65 will be hunting in places where you have a better chance of getting valuable drops and therefor will make money faster.  But if you're in a guild thats going to let you loot all the runes you need for your lvl 65 PoP spells, this wont apply to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>ZilshasisEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I doubt the value of Gypthed rune word spells will increase dramaticly. After all once the current guilds move on there's always some guild that just broke into the elementals with it's rain like drop of Runes. And they are not going to be using them all.<br />
<br />
In essence it comes down to what you are doing, and what your guild is doing. If you're one of the highest level toons in your guild and you don't really want to get too far ahead then stay at a level and grind some AA till you think you're ready to move on. But know that people prefer 65 toons in pickup groups if they can get them, thus based on level alone you'd loose out on groups if you don't make them yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Justjoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">i did run 3, meta 1 and regen 2 at 51, then i went to 55 and got ND3 and scf1, then at 59, i got steed, iht, and PE.  at 61, i got the first rank of pp, pd, ut, speed of the knight and knights advantage.  at 62 i plan on getting pp2, and ca 1-3, at 63, i'll get the second rank of all the above listed pop aa's, then at 64, i'll get pp4 and cs1-3.  at 65, i'll cap off all the pop aa's then work on LR 1-5.<br />
<br />
everyone i talk to says rush for 65, but im in a small guild that doesn't demand i get levels, and i can already out tank the guild's MT (65 sk with 40aa).   that's my plan for aa progression.  it really is all in how you want to bring your character up, but i'd rather be a bomb ass 62, than an average 65.<br />

I agree with you Catharsis, was just explaining why there is even a question.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Eggborn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I love to solo.  I got a ton of AA's soloing up to 58.  After that it got slower.  It is very very slow at 65, but I finally dinged 65 because of my friends and guild suggesting that I do.<br />
<br />
I still like to solo and found a few spots that are 1 percent per kill.  With groups in the right places I get 6 percent per kill like back in my mid 50's.  Normally though I am raiding or in ldon, and back to 1 percent per kill if lucky.  AA's for me personally go very slowly since I hit 65.<br />
<br />
I wish my character had the power it did back in my 50's in comparision to the mobs I fight.  I don't like that I have to change the way I played up until 59 or 60 suddenly.  I got to these levels because I liked the way I did things.  Now it is like a different class sometimes.</div></div><hr />

thats all there is too it. Nearly everything in this game takes your level and the level of the mob into account.</div></div><hr />
