<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lythen</div><div class="date">03-30-2002, 01:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just started playing EQ again and wanted to play a fun class (Have a 51 Warrior on The Rathe).  I must say that through the first 10 levels, I absolutely love the SK.  Harm touch is great, I can take a hit, and I have spells!  I have played just about every other class and they were all missing something.<br />
<br />
I decided to play on Tallon Zek, cause I like the idea of PvP.  The problem is I have no money, still have mostly cloth armor, and could really use a new weapon.  Are there any quests in Grobb (I am a Troll) for armor or weapons for a young SK?  I have looked at everlore, allakhazam's &lt;sp&gt;, and Caster's Realm to no avail.<br />
<br />
Also, is there a place where all the important SK information is, in a neat little package?  For example, how to grab aggro from a mezzed mob?  I read that thread somewhere on this board I think :)  I really enjoy the SK and the class seems to have the best community.  Any information would be a great help.  Also any PvP advice for young SKs would be an added bonus :D <br />
<br />
Thanks for the help and nice to meet you all!<br />
<br />
edit:  Added advice after PvP.. Duh!</div></div><hr />
