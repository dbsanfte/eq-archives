<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>NorrynNoir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">well i recently saved up my pennies and got a copy of Aura of Pain at a reasonable Xev Server price. was very excited to test it out last night.<br />
<br />
i did a Ruj group with an enchanter / shammy / cleric so I had the following buffs on me - Virtue  / Focus / Cloak of the Akheva. I also had the enchanter spell that transforms you into a scarecrow, raises atk and dex and gives you a liftetap proc. was very surprised this stacked with MC.<br />
<br />
anyway the issue i had was i could never land Aura of Pain , i got the 'Spell did not take hold' everytime. I even tried pulling with it once to see if it was another spell someone in the group was casting but no.<br />
<br />
so i'm guessing it didn't stack with one of the buffs i had. can anyone tell me which one?<br />
<br />
[EDIT]<br />
<br />
could it also be possible and this is just occuring to me that i was out of buff slots, this is the message you would get if you were out is it not?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You must have been out of buff slots. I can't think of any spell that over writes it.<br />
<br />
I think MC works if its first on the buff slot list in front of scarecrow. If scarecrow is first then MC doesn't work. (Don't take my word for it though)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I can confirm that information is correct, Vici.<br />
<br />
When Night's Dark Terror is earlier in the buff list than MC (or any of our other proc spells), it's proc takes over, giving a 35hp lifetap proc.  When one of our proc spells moves higher in the list than NDT, our proc takes over.<br />
<br />
Most of our chanters will put NDT on the melees in LDoN Groups or Raids and this has been the case for me every time.  Typically what I will do to keep NDT from rising higher in the buff list is to junk buff myself with clicky grim aura before the rest of the buffing starts, then have the chanter do NDT last (has to wait until inside the zone/dungeon anyway), then click off Grim Aura and put MC in that spot.  Occasionally, as buffs wear off and are re-applied, NDT will rise higher than MC in my list, and I have to either click it off or wait until it's about to wear off and do some quick re-structuring in order to get the correct line up again.<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
<br />
Oh, regarding AoP, if any member of your group is out of buff slots when you cast any of the group recourse spells, it will give you the &quot;Your spell did not take hold&quot; message.  Did you look and see that the AoP recourse icon was indeed not in your buff list?  Chances are you might have just received the message because it wouldn't stick/stack on one of your group members.  I get this quite frequently when I'm not MTing and we have our tank buffed to the nines including Voice line.  I'll cast and Aura of Darkness and his won't hold because he's got his slots filled.  In cases where one group member's buff slots are filled, it is usually better to just tell them to click off the recourse anyway, as not having a slot open for HoT's makes the cleric angry... shammies too. ;)<br />
<br />
Edit2: <br />
<br />
Doh, just looked at spell listing, AoP is listed as self only, and I obviously don't have this spell yet.  I was thinking of the group recourse on Torrents.  Never mind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>NorrynNoir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i'm pretty sure now that it was buff slots and i feel like a fuckin' tard for posting this in the first place.<br />
<br />
hey at least i've got the down low on the scarecrow thing. i'll be sure to bring up MC first before getting it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Meneltel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Also if you cast a group debuff/buff and someone is full of buffs, you will also get that message of &quot;this spell will not hold&quot; as someone doesnt have room for the buff icon.  Something ive noticed also.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Saveaux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Speaking of having Nights Dark Terror (enc scarecrow) up, I 2box a 65enc and have found that MC rarely procs when NDT is up, yet just the opposite when boon of garou is up. Has anyone else ever noticed this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think that we determined that when two procs have a chance to go off, you will indeed see a decrease in the number of procs that actually go off.  If you search around a bit, you'll probably find what I'm talking about, but it seems like there was a big discussion a few months ago about adding proc augments to a weapon that already had a native proc and then casting our self-proc lines.<br />
<br />
As for NDT and MC specifically, I have been receiving this quite a bit more recently, but hadn't paid attention to how often MC goes off.  I recently re-arranged my windows and I'm not used to where the proc dmg listings are situated anymore.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'll have to take a closer look.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The weapon proc will go off less but its a very slight decrease, a 1 point dd augment would still provide more benefit on a weapon with a 500dd proc than the native proc alone would provide, ill post some parses for you later</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Goregan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">dont you get that msg when the mob has already been debuffed? but you should still get the AoP symbol in your buff list</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">AoP doesn't debuff.</div></div><hr />
