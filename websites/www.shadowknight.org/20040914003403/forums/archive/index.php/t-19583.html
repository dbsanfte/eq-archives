<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kelefane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have the cash to buy a lvl 65 spell now and was just wondering which I should get? Im not in a guild but I do raid at times with this Non Guild Alliance on my server. Should I get AoH to start off with? Or ToI?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Carasak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">get them in this order:<br />
1.ToI<br />
2.AoH<br />
3.CoL<br />
4.Voice</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rhumba_Kween</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Generally SK lvl 65 spells are pretty rare. My reccomendation would be to pick up any of the big 3 CoL, ToI and AoH as soon as you see them for sale. On Tunare ToI is super rare for some reason.<br />
<br />
You also may want to vary it depending on who you group with mostly.<br />
<br />
If you group with a BeastLord much, you can skip AoH since it does not stack with Ferocity. If you group with a Ranger, BeastLord or Pally much, you may want to skip CoL since they all have buffs which because of either better hps or atk are better.<br />
<br />
Either way they are all great spells. Good luck finding them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kyfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">ToI &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; all. This spell is far and away the best of them. It lands on near anything and is exceedingly helpful in most situations. With ToI &amp; ToV up my survivability in AE situations went way up. It also helps for gap healing when a cleric is a bit snoozy.<br />
<br />
AoH is nice but because of the retarded degrade and effect &lt; recast it isn't a HUGE average atk upgrade over ToH and it is like 8x the mana. Still a nice spell though.<br />
<br />
CoL is actually better for tanking than BSS/SOT/SV but any of those is fine, so it isn't vital.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Squigle D'Muerte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Personally in with other melees I get a lot of use out of Aura of Hate.  125 to ATK will make rogues your best friends.  The other night with Shaman buffs my ATK was 1500.<br />
<br />
ToI is a nice upgrade but not a spell I cast much.  I keep it up at all times but only cast in emergencies.  Like all taps it eats a lot of mana, so for extra life I tend to stick to BoD.  Of course when healer dies and mob is below 50% you will be glad you have it.<br />
<br />
In 4 months I still haven't seen Cloak of Luclin for sale at any price.  Since it is just an upgrade to CoA not critcial just would be nice to have.<br />
<br />
Voice spells (and Terror spells) are pretty useless.  Only use I have ever had for a voice spell is to cast on warrior MA in raid.</div></div><hr />
