<br />
only thing is I have no clue wtf the lauchpad is or what it does...</div></div><hr />

Maybe it's a central place that you can choose which game you want to log into.<br />
<br />
ADD: Found this:<br />
Sony Launchpad (http://launchpad.station.sony.com/)<br />
The Station LaunchPad is a free utility that not only allows you to launch Station.com games, but also lets you chat with other Station members. Page a buddy one-on-one, or start your own chat room! You can even browse through the current Station.com headlines and catch up on the latest happenings with your friends.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I still want to be ble to send PM's to off-line characters in game</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Saibot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My thoughts exactly Verm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>GorranVZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Sounds like a rip off of the PlayOnline program you have to use to launch FFXI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rhumba_Kween</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I really liked the play online program with Final Fantasy. We can only hope that this new interface has an email interface also. That would be so handy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tukka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I hated PlayOnline.  I want to get in the game with as little muss and fuss as possible, and to me, PlayOnline only seemed to get in the way.  It did have a slick appearance, and did have e-mail, chat, ect. built in, but frankly, I couldn't care less.  I don't need yet another e-mail account to check... if they want to send me e-mail, they can send it to the address I desiginated when I created my account.<br />
<br />
However, a PlayOnline style gaming portal would seem to make a lot more sense for Sony than it did for Square-Enix.  Sony will soon be running three separate MMOs, in addition to other little games.  Square-Enix's only online games were Final Fantasy XI and Tetra Master.  For S-E, it was overkill.  For Sony it could make sense, as long as they make using the Launchpad thing optional, or they don't introduce additional unnecessary steps to get into the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jorren Y`Kelt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">So long as they do not force us all to have to use it, fine. I hated Play Online with a passion. It already takes way too long to log into EQ as it is, I do not need any more layers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Flanders</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I think you missed the whole point behind the process.  You actually save time when you login and do all your account setup in a win32 app instead inside EQ.  You update, login, change passwords etc all from one quick app that doesnt need all the resources that a full screen DirectX game needs.  Also the email system was designed mainly for other players to be able to contact you while your offline.  People also couldnt email you unless you granted them friendship...the whole thing just makes more sence, quit being so stubborn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tukka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I personally don't notice a significant performance difference between the PlayOnline and EQ.  EQ has a bit of lag when transitioning from log on to server select to character select, sure, but so does PlayOnline/FF11 (all those nice little meters filling up as you go from screen to screen, and there are more screens to progress through in PlayOnline than there is in EQ, especially since you now have the option to &quot;quick connect&quot; to a server).<br />
<br />
I'm not being stubborn, I simply have a preference.  Sometimes less is more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Androsulach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If I read the little blurb thing right, I'm thinking they are going to expand on the patcher they've got for SWG.   You'd log into your Station account, it'll give you a list of games, you make your choice, it goes on to patch that game if necessary and off you go to play.  If not in that order, it'll liable have us log in, the patcher will then patch what your account is flagged with as far as what you're subscribed to, and then give you the menu when it's ready to play.</div></div><hr />
