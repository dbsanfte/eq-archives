I camped this guy for the better part of Saturday afternoon, three cycles for him and no luck.  Found the normal guy, he ran out to the rock around 4 AM then checked out at about 9:30.  Well, Hero boy never came out to the rock.  On the third cycle I got a Ranger who happend to be in zone to help out.  When he tracked him it appeared he was near the city line, but never got to him before he despawned.<br />
<br />
Does this guy have a history of falling under the world???<br />
<br />
Anyone else have problems with him?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help<br />

<br />
Just did a search for &quot;Tracker Azreal&quot; and found about 20 posts regarding close the same problem I'm having.<br />
<br />
Apparently the day shift guy works as well as the night shift kid.  That and the guy who does spawn around 10 never walks across the bridge.  I'll try it out tonight.<br />
<br />
I'd just like to say thank you to all that have posted, tested and got this to work.  Also thanks for the lesson in using search.  Seriously, no sarcasm, I've read it 100 times always laughed at the constant slams back and forth.  Now I know.  :)<br />
