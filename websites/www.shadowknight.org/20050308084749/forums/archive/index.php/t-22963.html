<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thaln V'Orro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This whole beefing up of Mobs is getting rather obnoxious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tumnayar DiSalvo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Falmont has always been that hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kendril D</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">k thnx, anyone know about how many time people are needed to take him down?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Duke Malagen Shai'Kar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">He hits for 3.7k now? Walkthrough mentions 2.7k max. I'd say just plan his fight as you would Blazzax or Reparm for the numbers needed, that is what I'm doing this weekend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Iosif_McCloud</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Just talk to your Guild leaders  so that on a night you brake early to head over and bump him off.. If your not in a Raiding guild .. Pray... becuse i hate PU raids</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Thaln V'Orro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thats cause youre on MM Iosif, and we all hate PU raids here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kendril D</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Im not in a guild heh, but i do have like 20 friends that are pretty good :P, and yes he hits for 3702 max because i went to check out what he hits for and got owned instantly rofl.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tumnayar DiSalvo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The walkthrough is wrong on the numbers, he rampaged me for 3.2k WAY before the last patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kendril D</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">kk thnx ill try today or in a week when my power/internet is restored from the hurricane.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Krushum Gudended</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I didn't get hit for more than 2.5ish when I did it... I played with him for a few minutes to find his melee capabilities and ramp tanked him for the fight.<br />
<br />
He was definately beefed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>karzok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">wiped on him with 20 time/elemental geared people, had 4 clerics and warrior, his meele, although nothing to laugh at wasnt the problem.<br />
<br />
With 515 resists across the board all clerics got hit by ae. lowest we got him to was 60% before all clerics went oom from ae, ae also went off every 30 seconds, so after 2 mins a 6k mana cleric was oom , 2k from ae's, 2k using group heals, 2k on spam/ch on warrior.<br />
<br />
Either hope fight is retuned or bring enough dps to burn him in under a minute.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Thaln V'Orro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Edit: found the range<br />
<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5759&amp;source=Live<br />
<br />
That looks like his AE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Space</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">You need to work on some more dps next time if you wiped with 20, i know we were qvic/time geared we did it with 16 people had this breakdown<br />
3clerics<br />
1sk<br />
1war<br />
2druids<br />
1 boxed shaman<br />
2 wizards<br />
2monks<br />
1mage<br />
1 necro<br />
1 box paladin<br />
1 enchanter<br />
<br />
the fight was over in under 2mins and the war was never in danger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Lugdug Studthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">How much HP would you say he has?  Gonna try taking him down tomorrow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Hoppen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Hitted me for max 1900 somthing. And warrior said he only hitted for 1400 somthing with defensive.<br />
<br />
Used the AE 3 times during the fight (at start, 36 sec later, and after 2 mins)<br />
Resisted once and partially the 2 other times.<br />
<br />
Mid fight he also started to chain heal himself with Touch of Nife and he did a LoH.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Krazaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">He was hitting for 3600+ before the last patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>boy-</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Ppl are placing too much value in 'how hard he hits'.  Yes, his maxhit is 3.7kish, but he rarely if ever ever ever hits that much.  Despite his massive maxhit, 2 clerics ching can keep up a 9k buffed def war.  If not for the ae, one cleric could probably do it.  He spends most of his time casting.  We didn't even bother trying to slow him after the first attempt.<br />
<br />
The ae is the issue.  the -175 chrom check seems rather decieving, i was getting only partial resists at lvl 67/510resists - and it seems that partial resists don't work on the mana part of the ae or something.  Kinda cool to take 46dmg after resists, but lose 3 chs worth of mana.  My bard was getting full resists at 68 tho.  I suspect at lvl 70 he's probably winnable with 6-10 ppl if you have 2 bards.<br />
<br />
So yeah, either bring enough dps to burn him to 40% before the clerics go oom, or bring enough levels that you can negate the ae.  I think our problem (i was with karzok) was that we brought too much casterdps - elemental casters (ie: no concussion pants) really can't do much dps on him - they go oom before doing any meaningful dmg.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Seduktress</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Pwnt this guy with about 3 groups. Had decent DPS classes with me as well. I tanked him with one cleric healing me, and I boxed the other so was 2 clerics. He died pretty fast. Wasnt as hard as I thought it would be. Couldve one grouped him if I really wanted to but I didnt want to fail.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Nachti DarkAnger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">anyone know his respawn time?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Vaeldarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">If I remember to, I'll parse my kill on Falmont tomorrow and get his HP. Seems like a lot of interest in this factor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">His respawn time is very quick.  We failed on him with 38, then succeeded with 45.  Mostly elemental geared folks.  Respawn is an hour or less, if I remember right.  It's posted on the boards, use search and you'll find it.<br />
<br />
-Bolas</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>The Zenogias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">He has about 100k HP, respawns fairly quickly.<br />
<br />
The way to win is have a solid tank, a solid rampage tank and then a bunch of rangers and rogues. You want to have him dead before the fourth AE, otherwise you've been at it too long and the mana in your clerics is going to run out fairly soon.<br />
<br />
Don't waste your time trying to find a position to hide your casters to avoid the damage, the range is too big and there is NOTHING out there to hide behind.<br />
<br />
He hits hard but it is not so bad as he doesnt always make full contact.<br />
<br />
It's a DPS fight, you want him dead right away. That's how you do it, that's how you win. The Secret is out!<br />
I did him with 19 people fairly easily, mostly rangers and rogues, a few wizards, clerics of course, a druid and shaman plus a paladin for rampage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Astrakan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Just to add my own info, did him four time last night.<br />
<br />
1 - Wipe with ~15 no bard.<br />
2 - Wipe with ~15 no bard.<br />
3 - Sucess with ~25 bard.<br />
4 - Sucess with ~20 no bard.<br />
<br />
Pretty clear what happened with 1 and 2.<br />
<br />
Was sucessful with 3 because of the bard obviously.<br />
<br />
Won with 4, barely, by burning down and just taking the AoE.  In all fairness, about half the raid was ~VT level, the rest was Time+ people that are friends/acquaintances that came to help.  Tank was ~11k buffed, and was never in danger any of the 4 times until clerics were OoM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Vaeldarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Did him Monday night and got my epic. We used immense overkill. Had 4 groups, each group had a bard (playing Veeshan) and Talisman of the Tribunal + Seasons + GoD, so the AE only hit once or twice on a couple of n00bs. We got very lucky on that huge Bard turnout. Got him to 50% with discs/burn, fast heals, and a defensive 12.5k tank (no problems, tank never below 70%), then moved all push to his back and sent him flying clear across Western Wastes - never let him get a crappy healspell off. He started meleeing again in the 15%-20% range, but at that point he was already a goner. He dropped some mediocre pauldrons for plate classes, and my Holy Symbol.</div></div><hr />
