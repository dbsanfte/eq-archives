<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nokturnal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Thank you in advance for any help you might give me on this. Basically I bought all the parts to assemble a computer about 2 years ago. I had a friend of a friend put it all together and the system has run beautifully for the last 2 years, just recently however I have been getting random freeze ups. Today my computer froze up immediately upon opening a web page and when I shut it off and back on it came up with the message 'Warning CPU has overspeed' or something to that effect. Now I am not at all familiar with computers in the sense of how to fix them or how they operate, but I entered set up to see if just looking around there might be some easy way to turn off the overclocking. when I exited the computer worked again.<br />
<br />
     What I am wondering is if something hardware wise is broken, or if I simply need to turn off the overclocking. Also whether it is a simple thing to turn it off where I can just find an &quot;Idiots guide to overclocking&quot;, or if I should just pay someone $50 to make it better (I am on a very tight budget so would prefer to not have to pay).<br />
<br />
     My other new problem not sure if it is related is that almost any Movie clip I attempt to download causes an immediate disconnct to the web with a box asking if I want to send a copy of the problem to microsoft. as soon as I click yes or no the web site shuts down. This is with windowsmedia.<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>vilesoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sounds like your system was overclocked all right...what happened was your bus speed was prolly tweaked (Pentium 4 rig, I'm willing to bet), and that bus speed barely worked, but passed your friend's testing due to the colder temps from that time of year....so now once its jsut a bit warmer...POOF.<br />
<br />
Overclocking is a very hard thing to work with, due to the millins of variables, it's almost more art than science.  Sure you can say &quot;jsut do x and see if it works&quot;, but to get any decent results, you have to put in tons of research and careful part selsection.<br />
<br />
Just find out what your CPU is, and make sure in the BIOS, it's either set to suto-detect cpu and bus speed, or force it to whatever teh proper ratings are.<br />
<br />
Really, there is no point in overclocking anymore, since hardware is now so cheap.  i remeber back when a good CPU could easily cost you a grand, and motherboards were about 400 and up, back then I did overclock, and was damn good at it.  OCing was more of a thing about how costly hardware was back then, and finding a way to make it still reasonably usuable just that much longer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jorren Y`Kelt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Quick way to make sure that it is not overclocked:<br />
<br />
Open your BIOS (usually the delete key when you are on the very first screen that does the memory check and drive display)<br />
<br />
There is usually a 'Set to Fail Safe defaults' or 'Set to Optomize defaults' select one of those save and exit.<br />
<br />
If you are having problems still, you may be screwed. Post as much information about your system as possible.<br />
<br />
Is the CPU an AMD or Pentium? What speed?<br />
What motherboard do you have?<br />
How much and what kind of RAM?<br />
Vid and audio card?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ghoule</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Jump on over to this site: http://www.ocforums.com/<br />
I think in the forums there you can pretty much get any answer you need, in as technical or non technical a fashion as you need or want.<br />
I dont overclock, as its too potentially damaging to your computer if not done properly (and sometimes even if done properly its damaging), so I cant really help you out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>vilesoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">properly it's not harmful at all, well except for accelerrated electronic wear, but we don't even come close to using our stuff to it's end life expectancy anyways, even when OCed to hell.<br />
<br />
I'm sill waiting for the newest cooling stunt....already saw super-cooled (liquid nitrogen) fuoroinert.  The entire pc was submersed in flouroinert, and the fuoroinert was being chilled with liquid nitrogen.  almost worked except flouroinert starts to break down at about -30f, and they had it pushing -50f...so it turned into a thick sludge and ceased to provide adequate cooling.  Just a case where RTFM would have saved teh day...they also wasted over $15k in flouroinert...and for that I think they should be shot...that stuff is a watercooler's valhalla.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You tried opening your case, buying a can of compressed air, and blowing the dust out of the heatsink/fan?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>^UGARK^</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Buy a cheap orbital fan.<br />
Open side of case<br />
Plug fan in<br />
Turn on fan.<br />
<br />
If necessary tape fan to case .... I did this to remove vibrations.<br />
<br />
Works fine and keeps _everything_ frosty ... including the ram (which is also overclocked in my case)<br />
<br />
Atm 2.6 running 3.2 no probs.</div></div><hr />
