<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Akademik Technique</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">im a lvl 28 delf sk on tunare server i died and forgot to loot my corpse b4 i went out of state for thanksgiving and when i got back i realized my corpse isnt there anymore,i petitioned it and they said they couldnt do anything so i was wondering if anyone knows any good quests i can do without armor or a weapon to get armor and a weapon i would apreaciate it alot thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dester</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">go to newb area and find a skelly with a weapon on it.   Then go to EK kill spiders and lions ( have to kill snakes dogs and everything else to get them to spawn) and collect spider silks and HQ and MQ cat pelts.<br />
<br />
Sell in bazaar and buy new equipment (starting with weapon).<br />
<br />
should take you less then a week to get into some good gear.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Atrocity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You can probably do Grobb Cleaver quest if it's still in the game.<br />
<br />
Atrocity</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Strahvn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You also might want to check out the newbie armor quests that they've implemented as well. <br />
<br />
I was surprised at how nice it is for being newbie armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Akademik Technique</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">ok thanks for the suggestions i will try them out</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Neeklot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Leather padding sells very well in the bazaar. You will double the money you could make by taking the spider silks and pelts and making the padding.  check Eqtraders.com for more info.<br />
<br />
Another farm spot is in Shadeweavers Thicket near the tunnel to Paludal Caverns. Kill Lesser Shades and farm the Shadeling Silks and Swirling shadows to sell in the bazaar. <br />
<br />
Good luck. The same thing happened to me long ago with my level 21 Mage in Befallen (fell in the stupid well).</div></div><hr />

Talk to Holly Longtail who can be found in the Plane of Knowledge. She will tell you that she collects stuffed animals and would love to obtain some replacement parts as a couple of her animals have been damaged. She will then ask you to speak to Marri, and obtain a Collector's Box. Obtain an Undead Froglok Tongue, a Cockatrice Beak, a High Quality Cougarskin, and a Tiny Rockhopper Eye. Place all four items in the box and hit combine. Now return it to Holly and you'll be rewarded with the Fine Antique Ring.<br />
<br />
other quests similar in the same room, this one is best though, and all can be gotten in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nikumu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You might also hook up with a smith and have him make some of the new LDoN armor.....Many smiths will do it for free or cheap since it is skill up practice above 200.<br />
<br />
The &quot;Gothic&quot; armor set adds str and sta and has decent ac up until level 50 or so and you should be able to get better armor by then just by upgrading as you go.<br />
<br />
Also the LDoN armor sells cheap (on E marr anyway) in the bazaar usually 150-300p per piece, and the chest and greaves are worth getting at any rate.<br />
<br />
One last note all the LDoN armor has 2 augment slots on it as well, makes a few of the pieces worth using just for the extra stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zakton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Crusty is pretty cheap now if you can stand the neg to DEX.  Gothic is really good but it is more expensive than Crusty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>vilesoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">amagingly on C-T Gothic is about the same cost as crusty.<br />
<br />
I got one for my iksar warrior for the time his fungi is outgrown.<br />
<br />
There may be better, but for the price, gothic plate has to be one of the best twink armors you can buy on the server.</div></div><hr />
