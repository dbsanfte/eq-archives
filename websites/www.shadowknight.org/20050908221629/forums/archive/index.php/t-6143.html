<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dravok</div><div class="date">09-29-2002, 04:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is it a crazy idea to pick a race for a shadowknight just because they worship Innoruuk and you want that cause the epic is named Innoruuk's Curse?<br />
<br />
     I mean I love playing my human Innoruuk worshipping SK but I kinda feel a leaning toward an ogre SK too.  They are menacing looking, cant be stunned from the front, and with such high STR and STA at the beginning, they can beat the stuffing out of mobs either in groups or soloing.  <br />
<br />
     I was just curious as if I should try out an ogre SK too even though they cant worship Innoruuk?  Perhaps an ogre SK worshipping Cazic Thule is my calling.  Oh well maybe some who reads this can answer me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unless you Reeeeeeeally have your heart set on a certain set of Diety-specific cultural armor, It won't make too much difference.<br />
<br />
Your Ogre will have better melee stats, will be unable to be stunned from the front by melee, and be hated in a few more places. That's about the only difference.<br />
<br />
Play what you want.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The followers of Rallos Zek, the Warlord, believe in survival of the strong and death to the weak. The heart of a true follower of Zek yearns for strength, courage, but above all, victory. They believe that the heat of battle is the only place and time where enlightenment can be gained, that the universe was formed by conflict and in conflict it will end, with the victors feasting upon the remains of their fallen enemy. <br />
<br />
Why would you have any other deity?</div></div><hr />
