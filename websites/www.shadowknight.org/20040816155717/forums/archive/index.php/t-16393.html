<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kalendrox Grimblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Been messing around in here since I saw the sk only 1hander from the new Nortlav.  After a few hours of killing, I got:<br />
<br />
Lore, No Drop<br />
A Ruined Sword Hilt<br />
<br />
Months ago, someone posted a quest writeup on these boards (not a real quest, but an idea for one)  Prehaps it has been implemented with the zone revamp?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Krushum Gudended</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This is Jobrill's Quest (http://forums.shadowknight.org/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=4450&amp;highlight=greenmistish) <br />
<br />
looks like im gonna have to go check out the hole, next time you go shoot me a tell</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Eitsekur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Have killed Guardian of the Seal twice now with guild (gratz me on the earring and an Ancient Tome of Research) and after hearing a guildmate talking about a safehouse thread on an associated quest, I've been very interested. Looted a page from a guard on each kill of GotS and picked up a ground spawn bringing my page count to three out of 12 (as it says in the NPC's quest dialogue). From the extensiveness of this quest (kill the 70 NPC, pick up a lot of ground spawns, kill a lot of named spawns, possibly go to other zones and do 'side quest' sections - the gnomes), the end result will definitely be interesting. Presumably it opens the fire pots up for use, which would suggest a one time completion quest only. Could be that the quest gives you some sort of Firepot key.<br />
<br />
As for the Jagged Sword of the Dragon Slayer, my guildmate looted it and dunno if he's done any research yet. I presumed some sort of associated quest and at first figured the sword and the Ancient Tome were related but after reading the NPC dialogue I scrapped that guess. Looked through Paineel and didn't spot any new special looking NPCs, but didn't go into the guild areas very extensively. In other words, I'll be looking a little more later. I also was going to talk to Echo of Nortlav, I may have seen a trigger phrase in an NPC's dialogue that will open something more up. More on that later.<br />
<br />
(note: for easy access to Echo of Nortlav and to Guardian of the Seal, if you want to see / kill either of them, you can VERY easily and safely DA parachute. Pop Harmshield and immediately jump down the Hole in Paineel - make sure lev is off. You go smack down into the ground and take no damage. There are currently no wanderer mobs going through that room and nothing is KOS to start. Just be careful leaving - there are a pair of stone ward gargoyle NPCs on the other side of the rock fall that now 'blocks' the entrance to this area who hit for up to 260 and respawn very quickly. For raid setup purposes just jump your whole raid down and splat em then have a cleric DA down and rez. Easy :cool: )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>The Zenogias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I don't think DA lasts through a zone, have you tried this yourself?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Eitsekur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yep. In fact I've done it a few times - once with a cleric and once with my SK, and guildmates have lived through it as well with DA. Both times I've done it, I plopped down safely even after I forgot to click off Bobbing Corpse with SK for a few seconds (so took me extra time to zone). Makes GotS a very quickly raidable mob as long as no one minds a teeny bit of exp loss ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kalendrox Grimblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">For the gnome quest, has anyone found the 2 gnomes he wants you to take notes to?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Morgrist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">They found one of the gnomes-in Chardok. Handing in the note gets you the info that it's a historian that has the torn page (in the prince's room) ,who drops it and a decent melee earring. <br />
<br />
No word on the other. Safehouse has a thread on this one in the Quests section.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jobrill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hrm, I may have to make a real effort to start playing again if they've implemented an Erudite SK Blade, especically if it's similar to my quest :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Morgrist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Other gnome got found-he's in Dragon Necropolis. They ran a live patch, he started showing up afterwards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Eitsekur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The pages quest and the gnomes are of no connection to the Jagged Sword of the Dragon Slayer. It looks like the page quest is solely an int caster thing, because combining chapters takes research skill. Sucks to be the guy that has been working on the quest for the past week :( <br />
<br />
Anyone found anything else related to the Jagged Sword though? New quest NPCs maybe? Nothing in Paineel after another, more thorough search. Have yet to talk to Nortlav but if anyone else is in there area try the following keywords for Echo of Nortlav:<br />
<br />
'Who are you?'<br />
<br />
'Nortlav what happened'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Oberyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">.......verify the DA parachute technique.  I've done hole trips from the bottom up a few times for epic mobs.  Just used a brell rogue to verify Yael wasn't up.  Nice way to go if your time is limited, or you have a moron or two you don't want to drag though the city.<br />
<br />
Oddly enough, I even survived without a 10K fall twice, pre-DA.  Took about 600 damage, but was fine.  The next time I went splat though.  Odd.  I'd like to know what the variables involved are there......<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Dregor Thule</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Was very disappointed to find out the pages quest requires skill in research.  Oh well :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Loneshadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">in case noone knew: you dont need DA to get down to the bottom of the hole safely, just JUMP before you fall over the edge of the hole in paineel and you will only take up to 900 points of damage from the fall. Did this with my lvl 30(experimental) sk and he was just fine. no kos mobs on landing so you have time to heal up after the fall. Dont try to leave that area without being prepared tho, theres a high lvl invis seeing gargoyle on the path up<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Khat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Is it still the same situation where you have a chance to land safely, (in the water) or splat and die, (hitting land)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Loneshadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">doesnt matter, i simply hit the spot on land were everyone normally dies(i was nowhere near the water on landing) when they fall in and lived, i can confirm this for my alt mage also. seems that as long as you JUMP in youre fine, dunno how but it works(might wanna try with an expendable alt first or when ya have a res and coffin rdy tho, never know when they change this)<br />
<br />
happy hunting!<br />

(edit) also: you can reduce dmg from falling in by first letting you zone in the hole and then hit /q before you hit the ground, everytime i tried this i logged back in in mid air and fall dmg was calculated from the point where i /q out</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Did the DA drop for the first time the other day.  Went to edge of the hole by the paineel city entrance.  Clicked off Lev, hit HS, jumped in.  Not a problem at all.  We droped down a few SKs, Cleric, and let a mage suicide down, then just used CoH to bring a few more down.  Takes maybe 20-30 min total to kill the guy, from first DA until he hits the dirt.  Knockback he does is a bitch, expect to aggro some more of those stone guardians at the door when you do.</div></div><hr />

those weapons fail to suck.</div></div><hr />

I have been wanting to do this for a while. Last weekend I packed my Vial of Velium Vapors and Harmshielded into the Hole near the Paineel Entrance. Had friends laying bets on whether I'd survive :) Easy landing and the two mobs conned Indiff.<br />
<br />
I then spent about half an hour with a Pally friend as we Corpse Summoned and Rezzed some people who tried the same jump with Lev prior to my shot at it.</div></div><hr />
