1) sleeper isnt awakened yet (probably because people want to let everyone farm primal) <br />
<br />
and<br />
<br />
2) SK's are treated with respect, rather than being passsed over for warriors even in exp groups.</div></div><hr />

I wont go on and on about other traits because they are all well known what we can do to benifit a group, not to mention keeping ourselves healed with a fungi helping of course. Normally when I shout out LFG I dont wait long. I must also add that if people out there see you on a regular basis and you have a reputation for knowing how to skillfully play your class, you normally dont get looked past but get looked at and asked to join. Good luck in finding what you are looking for and your future decisions...Last but not least, Lots of people respect the &quot;SK&quot; class on my server due to the fact that we are pretty amazing in PvP ~ enough said :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">velourea</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 09:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">aye, such a pace exists. you can even reach it from your server!<br />
<br />
first you must enter the legendary &quot;Kansas&quot; zone. to get the key for the legendary &quot;Kansas&quot; zone, you must kill 700 ashenbone drakes, give or take 400. on your 700th (or 1100th as the case may be) kill, you will see the &quot;Key to Kansas&quot; on the corpse. Once having recieved the key, you need to enter the Oasis of Ro and travel along the Orc Highway (be careful of &quot;a Orc Warrior&quot;-thats a mean one) and then when you hit the magical &quot;zone line&quot; you have to say &quot;EQ iS My MaStEr, I aM iTs $12.99-a-mOnTh-Bish.&quot; (case sensitive). then you will be magically teleported to the Kansas Zone. from the Kansas zone, you need to fight your way through one hundred angry wil-o-wisps with nothing but a newbie tunic and a Reaver. when you have slain all the wisps, the named wil-o-wisp &quot;Fred&quot; will then appear. you must then hail him and say &quot;I seek the portal to SK heaven.&quot; If he thinks your will is strong enough, you will be ported (for a 10pp donation) to the Ellirosi Zek server. this server is populated with nothing but Shaman and Rogues. your journey will then be over. (as to the question of whether sleeper has been awoken, no, but a really uber shammie with a JBB tried once...)<br />
