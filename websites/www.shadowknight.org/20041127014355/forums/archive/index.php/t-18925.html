<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vuurl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Voice graft is no longer working properly for me.I thought maybe I was bugged,but had the other SK in group use my axe and try it and asked a couple other SKs later to try it and no one could get it to work.<br />
<br />
It casts like normal and you get the buff icon but when you /say nothing happens.Tried it with pet targetted myself targetted and nothing targetted and /say simply did not work at all for me.<br />
<br />
I know most of you could care less,but I have a lot of fun badgering the chanter for buffs with my pet.Haste plz kk tnks from my pet drives her nuts :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">As a matter of fact, I noticed this last night too.  I haven't whipped out the Sentient Axe for anything for at least a month, but last night I figured I would play a little joke during an adventure (pet making fun of groupmate, etc) ... but nothing happened.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Silvershadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hmm, I thought it was just me, but this happened to me too last night. Way to go Sony ;P<br />
<br />
Of course, given their priorities, I bet voice graft will be fixed asap. Much more important than class balancing ;P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Voice Graft was broken a few days ago when they took the servers down to fix an exploit allowing people to among other things talk through any character/npc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jinsei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">DAMN! That woulda kicked ass! I would have really cussed out alot of dumb fucks in my groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vuurl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Don't know when they fixed it,but it is now working again.</div></div><hr />
