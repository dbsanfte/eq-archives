<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>SinuuarSoulreaverrMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi I'm currently lvling a SK and been using CD ,siphon strength,and Disease cloud for agro.I hold good agro usually,however despite my asking alot of times other classes i'm grouped with will snare on incoming and when i try cast CD i get you spell did not take hold message.I've noticed that CD produces alot of agro is there a spell that produces the agro of CD that i can use when other people snare ?Also I do alot of LDoN and was wondering whats the best spell to pull with? ATM i use CD if 2 or less mobs are in room if 3 or more i use siphon strength and can usually get just 1 or 2 of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>senor sperro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">back in the day i used to use disease cloud as my main agro getter.. cast that a few times on a mob and agro was mine, but clinging darkness still gets agro even if a mob is snared and the spell does not hold.  its is the greatest agro spell an sk will get and can get agro no matter what...<br />
<br />
use clinging darkness anyways sinuu</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">We have a terror spell that adds a bunch of agro at 34.<br />
Used it and heat blood in an LDoN group where the bard was a jag-hole (typical) and pulled with a snare/slow.  Being 3 levels lower, less equipped and using a druid as main healer didn't really make sense for me to mt, but they wanted me MA with bard as puller.  Terror is very strongly effected by proximity though so get right up and the Mob before you cast it to increase (create) effectiveness.<br />
<br />
BTW I was casting cd at first, because I heard it caused agro even if it didn't land and it had no effect on the snared/slowed mobs whatsoever.<br />
<br />
Edited for clarity</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>yuggoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Doesn't matter if CD takes hold or not, the aggro is the same.  Nobody past 22 will cast CD for the snare effect, just for the mana-cheap aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Noctix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I use CD for the snare effect at level 58...but only because I already have CD memmed for agro and don't want to mem two darkness spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sudela Teir'Anastazi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">At 65 I still use CD for agro.  I find it works much better (after much testing) than the Terror line of spells.  Strangly it lands on almost everything I cast it on and always has.  Unless it's imune to changes in run speed, and even then it's still our best agro spell IMHO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>SinuuarSoulreaverrMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks I didnt realize CD still caused agro even if it didn't take hold.I did notice thou if i get thirsty I can cast CD 2 times and 1 disease cloud run to fridge grab a coke and when get back i still have agro lol.I played a Warrior to 64 and i have to say my SK owns him on agro holding =).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>evilspawndark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well, I was gonna suggest FEAR, but I realized you were lvl 35.  This will however have unpredictable results during your exp session.....but, has the bonus feature of auto-pull.<br />
<br />
I agree with the other posts...Clinging Darkness.  If someone else pulled with a snare (ie Ranger) smack them in the mouth with a dead trout, gonna be hard to grab aggro of the bat when they do that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My experience has been that this is not true....<br />
<br />
Yes it has the same agro if the target resists it.<br />
<br />
But,<br />
<br />
When I get the &quot;your spell would not take hold&quot; message (generally due to a higher snare being on it)  I've had mobs run right past me (so proximity is not the issue), ignore my whacks and run to the bard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>shadowblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Clinging Darkness is primary agro spell forever for me.<br />
Since you are low level though, its probably a good idea to use terrors as well until you get too around lv 50+ where terrors just dont cut it anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dakkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Higher level snares pull more aggro, so if someone throws one shortly after the mob arrives in camp they'll have more aggro than you can easily get from a CD and a couple of hits, and the mob will turn on them.<br />
<br />
Clinging darkness always seems to draw its full aggro when thrown on a mob which already has a higher level snare though, in my experience.</div></div><hr />
