<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Brildayr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">confirmed that all 3 still spawn in thehole.<br />
<br />
Caradon still spawns in the jail cellls, saw him yesterday, but I'm not at that part of the quest yet. and didn't have the cell key. at the time.<br />
<br />
a chest or mimics are in their same old place also, and confirmed that they still drop the cell key.<br />
<br />
Ratman guard spawns down in the city just past the docks, or in other words, the back part of the city.  Saw him yesterday too, had to evac as we had no slower and healers were lom at the time (gimme a break, was a wee group of us).<br />
<br />
Confirmed that the Ratman guard still drops a dusty tome.  Another guild killed the same rat the next morning after my failed attempt and got the tome.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Krushum Gudended</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">undead tower is difficult again, so be warned, no real way of doing that with a single group of epic seeking folk</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Drakang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">ratman guard is also in the jail where he was.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Flauer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Soo, the ratman guard can spawn past the docks, through the hidden wall in the bank, and in the jail?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rolukk Earbiter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">you can do undead castle with 1 group and get to Glohnor...I did. You just have to be very careful with the pulls because some things are partially slowable, and some are even immune and hit good and hard. Some were up in the 400's<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Drakang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Also the placeholders are gone for Glohnor.  Looks like the ghost spawns every time in the same spot on the left side.  Did him twice in a row last night.<br />
<br />
For enchanters joining you Kindle has been moved.  Before heading down the tunnel to the undead city there is a door to the left of the tunnel.  In and up to another big building.  Kindle spawns outsite that building on the left side.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Brildayr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Flauer:<br />
<br />
Ratman guard spawns in the city, past the docks, not behind the hidden bank wall.  Only thing past the hidden wall is chests and one or two normal city mobs.<br />
<br />
Drakang:<br />
<br />
There are no rats in the jail area anymore.  You confirmed that the ratman guard is still spawning in the jail area ?  Ratman guard has spawned twice in the city (that I can confirm) rather than in the jail since the zone revamp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Drakang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ours must have wandered or gotten pulled up and stuck.   We had a group kill him up there.  However on our return this weekend I didn't see any rats in the jail and lots in the city.  especially over near the new spawn for kindle.</div></div><hr />
