<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kebsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I think it would be a good idea to put a sticky thread in the arena, with instructions on how to make a simple sig and which lets people know that you don't have to make a 'sig test' thread when you try it out at first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lejina Bloodbath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think we should create a &quot;Post your sig test here&quot; thread.<br />
<br />
Then ban every single individuals posting on that thread.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, and ban the folks who create a new &quot;sig test&quot; thread too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zakton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">We could flame everyone that posts a sig test thread.  oh wait I think we do that already....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Drynnious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think if they post more than once or create a post called 'sig test' they should get banned. Can't they wait until they have something meaningful to say to check their sig? They don't even need to do that, all they have to do is go comment on one of the threads in the flame forum, thats easy enough for anyone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lejina Bloodbath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">This isnt a fucking EZboard board.<br />
<br />
They can look at their new sig by looking to a post they made in the past.<br />
<br />
The dumbshits who didnt notice that already sure cant be smart enough to be an asset to this community, thus no loss for banning them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Spylmann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm fighting a strong urge to just say &quot;sig test la~&quot; in this thread :)<br />
<br />
Even like EZboard, you can see your sig in the preview. Just tested it with this post too. It's not exactly hard, instead of hitting one button, you hit the OTHER one. I will never understand..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Drynnious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I wasn't saying it was an ezboard. I've actually never used an ezboard. What I was saying is if they are a new member. They start posting worthless stuff to test their sig. Can't they just wait for a useful post? then modify it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Carpathieon Wargasm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Anyone have any good advice on how to post a flash sig? I cant get mine to work.</div></div><hr />
