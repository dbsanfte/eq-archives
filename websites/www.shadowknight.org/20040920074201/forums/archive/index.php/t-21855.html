<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aoninie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I may be a computer illiterate dip shit old fuck. I did a search of Faq and a search but couldn't find my answer. How do I put an image in my sig? I have no clue about HTML codes and shit like that so break it down for us old folks that didn't have computers in school. Thanks for the help and a big Fuck you to any Flamers. <br />
<br />
PS. I'm in Iraq right now so I didn't have time to search all 355 messages that came up for the search...got through about 200 though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Carasak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">in the menu on top go to user cp -&gt; edit signature<br />
there put &amp;lt;img src=&quot;http://www.mydomain/myimg.jpg&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&amp;gt; <br />
exchange the http://www.mydomain/myimg.jpg with ur actual URL of the image u wanna have (need to have the image on a server accessable from internet, cant have it just on ur local comp) also ajust the width and height to the actual size of ur image. <br />
hope that helps</div></div><hr />

Glad to see our military is full of such happy, positive people~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Go to www.photobucket.com, make an account and bla bla - then upload whatever picture you want your signature to be. Then you'll be able to see the address of it on photobucket (free btw, hosting site). Copy that address, and paste it where catharsis had the mydomain.com thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aoninie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for the reply's. I was just going to ask for a host for pics too. I'll register at that site then give the sig a try.<br />

Kalendrox, let's see what kind of attitude you have when you are dodging mortars, rockets, car bombs, roadside bombs, and small arms fire while being held past your retirement date. So until you decide to fight for real and not just in the game do us all a favor and shut the fuck up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You have to admit calling yourself a &quot;computer illiterate dipshit old fuck&quot; paints you in a light of... lacking self esteem... lol.  I think his post was more a sarcastic observation of that fact rather than a flame/rip on you for being in the military or anything.</div></div><hr />
