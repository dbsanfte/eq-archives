<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mystina</div><div class="date">10-31-2002, 04:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yea, I tried trial of flame several times, and a guild group went to 4th wave in stoning with no cleric.<br />
<br />
Peoples say they are uber hard, but I totally disagree with it, they just require more skill and more time to learn imo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
After trying most of them, it's clear that execution is the easiest, no contest there.<br />

Oh, and bring mages/wizards, they own rogues for this kind of short fights.</div></div><hr />

Anyway, it was pretty much impossible. We had a group of 6 61s, five of whom were with the server uberguild (me being the only exception). <br />
<br />
Think the goal was to save a bunch of halflings. So the first wave of MOBs comes in (4 I think). I get aggro on one ASAP. The chanter mezzes one, then gets five consecutive resists on the second and dies. We evaced and gave up after that. Think you definitely need a higher level chanter for it.<br />

<br />
It was fun but we go owned once our cleric decided to do a AoE heal = taunt of death, and died..<br />
<br />
The trials are fun, go with any geric balanced group and as long as they have skill you should be able to do exe.<br />
<br />
Seems to be fun, but the 30min after a win is kinda gooberish--but hell The Tribunal dont have good janitors to clean up I guess</div></div><hr />

Shadowknight<br />
Shaman<br />
Necro<br />
Cleric<br />

(it was definitely not the ideal group for this encounter)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trysbrina67</div><div class="date">10-31-2002, 11:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">finishing the trials depends on levels, gear and skill.  6 level 60s will find it tough to do execution, while 6 level 64s will own it with no problems.  the same goes for the rest of the trials, all this stuff is built with the 61+ character in mind and i find it hilarious to see mid 50s groups try and defeat the trials.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ssoth</div><div class="date">10-31-2002, 03:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I will one-up you, Damphere:<br />
<br />
We finished the with:<br />
Druid 62 (our healer)<br />
2 Shadowknights 61<br />
2 Warriors 61<br />
1 Paladin 61<br />
<br />
No cleric, no shaman, no enchanter, no wizard, no bard and no rogue. It was 5 tanks and a druid. One of the warriors was an alt and didn't have high dps at all, the other shadowknight is just getting back in the game after 6 months of inactivity so he didn't have good spells (didnt have the highest pet, nor augmention of death, heck he didn't even buy the spear spells before he enter the trials).<br />
<br />
Unbelievable that we actually won. The high executioner chased one person around the stage as the other four chased after him (druid had to power med). When someone else took aggro, the high executioner chased that person around the room while the other four bit at his heels. The whole thing looked amazingly like the end credits of &quot;The Benny Hill Show&quot;<br />
<br />
It was the funnest trial group I went with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Okami</div><div class="date">10-31-2002, 03:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">so far, every group I've seen defeat it easily, are in no way a &quot;balanced&quot; or &quot;Ideal&quot; group.<br />
<br />
Mages are a good thing. Seems the elementals summoned can be banished.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lejina Bloodbath</div><div class="date">10-31-2002, 05:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What was cool, was to do this while the other people had no idea what it was. Waiting? Theres no waiting when you are the first to do something :D<br />
<br />
Oh, and Groo, if you dont want to wait to have a shot at the trial, thats your choice. Personally i dont miss at all xp'ing in PoN/PoD/PoI, if you are fine there, its all good i guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shelrabbi</div><div class="date">10-31-2002, 06:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's about DPS, just DPS and nothing but DPS. Bring a cleric, a warrior, an off healer for when the cleric gets his ass kicked, and 3 wizards. Or 2 wizards and a bard/chanter for mana regen. Or just buff the wizards with c4 before going in.<br />
<br />
I went in with a 61 warrior (got slowed every time), a 62 bard, 2 65 wizards, a 65 cleric and a 65 shaman. We couldn't kill the damn things fast enough to reset the exo and lost 3 times in a row. <br />
<br />
This was the trial of execution BTW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Duke Malagen Shai'Kar</div><div class="date">10-31-2002, 06:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did Exe with my typical xp grind group: 64 SK, 64 Chanter, 64 Cleric, 63 Rogue, 62 Monk, 61 Shaman. Was a lot of fun, and a close intense encounter. We're going to try and defeat all the trials simply because they were fun, and something different.<br />
<br />
Sad thing is, I don't see why people are so intent on getting to PoV for the XP. It is nice, but you can get the same amount elsewhere if you just look around. Whats worse, at least on Sol Ro, is that the zone has become a total cluster-fuck. People exploring, making trains, taking those trains to the GY / Zone out...its just bad. Those lemmings can have that zone, I'll hunt elsewhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fait</div><div class="date">10-31-2002, 09:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Errantly tried lashing and torture with a full group of 61:<br />
<br />
Warrior <br />
Ranger <br />
Rogue + trueshot<br />
Chanter (squishy me)<br />
Cleric <br />
Monk<br />
<br />
Owned. Owned hard. I've heard that for a majority of the trials, expect to need an output of something along the lines of 300+ dps total. It truly sucks when you're getting wave after wave of unmezzable/stunable mobs, and you need to keep the waves separated. While the fungal-type mobs can be mezzed, the rocktypes (which you get more of) can't be. I believe, however, they can be rooted...however the fungal types can't. <br />
<br />
Location, location location.<br />
<br />
Basically, we have gotten bored with waiting in line for the Exe and Hanging trials, just due to the fact that they are perma-camped these days. Figure that, when enough capable guilds have gotten their flags, the lines will diminish and can go forth from there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was sick and home from work and some dude spent the whole day directing traffic and calling who was next in line etc. while he waited for his groups turn. Plus a cleric is always there to rez you when dumbasses decide to train a trial gone bad instead of just taking the death and getting the rez themself.<br />
<br />
- Peace</div></div><hr />

To prove your worthiness to travel to tier 2 planes. Successful attempt flag you to be able to enter two more planes.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Forelorn</div><div class="date">11-01-2002, 01:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's to keep the trash out of the second tier planes. It's so nice to be able to join groups and not having to notice the warrior is in crafted or using a yak. Although with the levels there is a bit of the trash sneaking in now, but the upside is you can move on to the 3rd tier plane. Or kill Grummus to kill in CoD.<br />

LOL I guess I outta change my sig shoudn't I, I'm 63 heh.</div></div><hr />
