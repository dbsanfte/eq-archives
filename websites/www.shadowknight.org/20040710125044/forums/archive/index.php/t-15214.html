<br />
So I'm a 38 SK, and just got this spell back at 34... I have been using it when solo'ing in Crystal Caverns (which is an AWESOME zone for these levels, btw). I know that it has a long recast time but it seems to me that it often is broken. Example:<br />
<br />
I have just killed some orc and I have been medding for awhile. Lets say I FD or invis, go AFK and get myself a sandwhich. I come back 10 minutes later. Obviously, all my spell gems are back. I go to kill another orc and when I try to cast Spear of Disease it says &quot;spell recovery time not yet met&quot; even thought it clearly is. If I try and cast again immediatly following this message it will work. <br />
<br />
Any idea what's going on here? Am I doing something wrong or is there something wonky with the spell? Anyone else experienced this? It isn't a huge deal, just gets annoying to have to cast the spell twice in a row if I want to use it. Sometimes it works fine, sometimes it does this... Any info is appreciated. I'm likely making some newbie mistake or something but still would like to know about it.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Saruton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A while ago SoE tried to fix this problem as this effect occurs with alot of verry fast casting spells. This is going on for a long time now. They said they would fix this in two steps but up today this second step is missing.<br />
<br />
As a fix for you, when you cast a spell and want to cast a Spear afterwards, just wait a second more befor you cast it.</div></div><hr />
