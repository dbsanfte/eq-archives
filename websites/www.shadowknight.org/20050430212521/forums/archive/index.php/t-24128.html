<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>grinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">did some seaches, even on google!, didnt come up with anything, so heres the Q ..<br />
<br />
what order would you rank the MPG raids trials in from &quot;easiest&quot; to &quot;hardest&quot;<br />
<br />
im not after strats, just which are the easier ones to start on, Eg from what i've read, hatred is the harest one.<br />
<br />
currently time is the hardest raid we regularly do [once a week] and we're doing ikky raids, and looking to start MPG raids this week, so if any of you know, and would be kind enough [lol] to rank their difficulty that would be great, if you dont want to say and want to flame me for asking then be my guest, i really dont care ;)<br />
<br />
here are the names btw<br />
<br />
Hatred -<br />
<br />
Endurance -<br />
<br />
Foresight -<br />
<br />
Specialization -<br />
<br />
Adaptation -<br />
<br />
Corruption -<br />
<br />
thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>makaky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If Time is the Hardest content for your guild, i realy suggest you beat Uqua and farm Qvic for a while before heading Mpg.<br />
<br />
Going straight from Time to Mpg is gonna get you guys assraped<br />
<br />
hope that helps<br />
<br />
note: We havent done the trials in over a month so they might have been toned down.</div></div><hr />

Simons say was fun till they fix Directions on it and boy did it make it really hard then.  my 2 bits</div></div><hr />

wth are you talking about?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
and thanks Makaky, time isn't &quot;hard&quot; for us, just thats what we're raiding atm, well farming really,we can do time, comeplete to quarm, with 45~ people give or take, but you'd say MPG raid trials are harder then ikky 3/4 by much ?<br />
<br />
we did ikky 3 with 36 as i recall but i dont think we've tried ikky 4 yet.<br />
<br />
i think i kind of know what you mean tho, expect to die, but be happy if we dont ;P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Naubi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Corruption trial (at the projection of power) is the easiest I would think.</div></div><hr />

much appreciated. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Foresight is easy once you've mastered it.  We always succeed at foresight, only get corruption once in a while, haven't succeeded with the rest yet that I know of.<br />
