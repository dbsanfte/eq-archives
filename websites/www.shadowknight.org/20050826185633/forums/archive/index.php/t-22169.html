<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gordrach</div><div class="date">07-19-2004, 05:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've read suggestions from posters that KC is a good place to hunt at certain levels.  I've always been told that hunting in KC will lower your faction in the Outpost, where we start our quest for Innoruuk's Curse.  Might anyone be able to clarify this for me?  I've just reached level 52 and KC is mentioned repeatedly as a good place to hunt.  I appreciate your input.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paynreaver</div><div class="date">07-19-2004, 06:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The simple answer is that KC, in my opinion, is not a good place to hunt.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The complicated answer is this:<br />
<br />
KC used to have a good experience yeild (IE: In Kunark/Velious days) however it was also packed 24/7 with every idiot to ever follow the &quot;experience highway&quot; and was thus known for adolescent behavior and amazing trains. You had to weigh the risk/reward to decide whether or not to hunt there. Today, it is largely abandoned because there is better experience to be had elsewhere - not to mention that its reputation preceeds it and people tend to avoid the place. <br />
<br />
(On that note however, if you planned on taking friends there instead of going LFG it might be worth checking it out. You may be able to get the zone to yourselves at the cost of less EXP/Kill. Some people prefer to have a zone to themselves even for less EXP; you might be one of those people.)<br />
<br />
Now, as for it lowering your faction in the OT outpost, that is somewhat true. Not every mob will lower your faction, but some will. Its your choice whether or not to ruin your OT faction. Your epic is started there, however the Epic mob is on Truespirit faction and not OT faction. He is also not located very close to any OT faction mobs. Therefore, while it will be a little trickier, you can still complete your epic with bad OT faction. Also, search in the Epic section of these boards for information on &quot;Seal Running&quot;. It will allow you to skip the first part of the epic quest, including the part in the OT outpost. Seal running is too complicated for me to recite here, especially because there are already many great guides on it located on these boards.</div></div><hr />

Get used to this as every asshat who followed the &quot;experience Grindway&quot; is now playing in poV and knows jack shit about their class.  <br />
<br />
/rant<br />
a 63 iksar SK who can't hold agro off a 62 shaman on his second cast of slow (first cast was when mob was at 90% because the effing SK didn't know how to hold agro) is the type of idiot you find in PoV now and probably was at one time in KC also not knowing how to play his class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oagan</div><div class="date">07-19-2004, 07:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye to that Keev.  I can two-box FC and CY's with my shaman.  People try to join and I say NO.  Every time I try joining a group (like I think things might be different) some idiot does something stupid that winds up causing a wipe.  I don't bother grouping in PoV.  Actually, if I want solitude, I head for Torment.  I can 2/3 box there without anybody bothering me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paynreaver</div><div class="date">07-19-2004, 08:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">While it is true that those same morons now play in PoV, the zone exits are a little different. KC's trains were extra-super-special because of the way the zoneout was constructed. Maybe some other factors too, but for sure the trains in PoV tend to not be as bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cames</div><div class="date">07-20-2004, 01:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most folks can't take the pounding to form a really good planar train.  Nothing like pulling Venril Sathir and all the stuff along the way to the zl in KC.  Really makes one smile.  Okay Pulling the Ghost to the zoneline in Unrest.  Different level same smile.  A proper train must have at least 20 mobs.  Anything less is a pull.<br />
<br />
Edit....okay less humor.  KC has an issue where it is very easy to pull aggro from the zone in side from trains that were taken to the zone out side.  Especially if you have morons near the entrance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Belyle</div><div class="date">07-20-2004, 03:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">KC is pretty much abandoned now, and if ya do it right its not a bad place to fear kite solo at 52.  Zone in and area outside of VS room.  Use the lower lvl fear/undead fear so mob wont go too far...lower lvl ones wear off faster, then walk the mob back to start point and fear it again.  Being able to bash is quite helpful, as a feared mob bashed from the back is pretty easy to stun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gordrach</div><div class="date">07-22-2004, 12:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you for you responses, I truly appreciate it.  I was working on some fear-kiting skills last night in DSP, killing the Rockhoppers.  The upgraded fear spell had them walking quite far, right into a patch of mushrooms that were still blue and aggrod.  I initially switched to the lowere level fear spell, and walked them back to the pull spot more often.  However, the spell would often be resisted, so I switched back to the upgraded fear spell and adjusted the spot where I would cast fear and start their &quot;dead rockhopper walking&quot; routine.  Fear would wear off just in time before reaching any other mobs.  It was a little tricky, but that's alright by me as I would get just too bored if it were too easy (hence my druid collecting dust).  Again, thank you everyone for taking the time to respond, I appreciate it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stattic</div><div class="date">07-22-2004, 04:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Plus remember that if you have or plan on getting the Workers Sledgemallet that your faction will help in OT. if you dont have it and plan on getting it. PLan on a lot of turn ins. If you have it now and use it a lot then look out for losing to much faction in OT and wind up getting chased off every time you gate into town..<br />
<br />
I myself went in there (KT) for like 10 min one night and lost 2 levels of faction with OT all the way back to Ind. =( Well I have the Mallet now anyway so screw it =)<br />

<br />
The very fact that you specify a &quot;zone in&quot; side and a &quot;zone out&quot; side when speaking of KC should be a clue to the type of idiocy that abounds in places like this.  It's a typical &quot;Y&quot; shaped zone out, one side (on Zeb it was, as I understood it, the right side) was where you took trains as you exited the zone.  The other was where you came back in to look for your corpse.  The very fact that it was necessary (due to the sheer volume of zone trains) to label the sides &quot;in&quot; and &quot;out&quot; is indicative of the nature of these places and the people who hunt them regularly.  These are the folks who are now in the EPs with their /lfg up...  presuming that they've been able to snow some up and coming guild into getting them the flags.<br />
<br />
KC may be empty now, but it still gives me the creeps just thinking about it.  Take some friendly advice and find a shaman partner to go duo in City of Mist with when you get to the level that everyone is suggesting KC.</div></div><hr />
