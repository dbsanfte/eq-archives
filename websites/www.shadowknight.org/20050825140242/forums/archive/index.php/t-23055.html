<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zefan</div><div class="date">09-30-2004, 07:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all, im relatively new to the forum, and wont be staying long as I am deploying in 2 months, however, i the meantime, I have roleld a new character aftera year retirement from EQ. Most of my friends are gone except one who has a druid and enchanter to PL me occasionally, but ive always preffered soloing and doing it myself. I am decently twinked, 1400hp, and a little over 800ac at level 32, and I have fungi so downtime is minimal. <br />
<br />
What Im asking all you experience and current palyers is, what zones have the best xp modifiers that I can take advantage of.. and good spots to solo. Loot is absolutely no concern, I just want xp spots that I can solo at or possibly duo with a healr or DPS... So if anyone has any input or any good spots, or a link to an UP TO DATE zem chart.. pls post your info, I appreciate any and all info!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zefan</div><div class="date">09-30-2004, 07:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, while im new to beign a SK, I have much experience as a melee. So i know how to MA etc, and Ive read up on pet pulling, so if there are any good ZEM zones that some tricky tactics etc to pull, Im not a moron and I can try em if you post the strategies. Thanks ShadowKnights!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nytemyst</div><div class="date">09-30-2004, 07:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would do the current hots spots. I was pling my alt bard with my alt shaman(i 3 box). Since the early hot spot zones are kunark they are easy as cake. My bard had no problem tanking over 5+ mobs at a time. The xp was incredible and i got addicted. Felt like PC all over again just without the trains.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zefan</div><div class="date">09-30-2004, 08:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">honestly thats the one place i didnt want to go heh, the hot spot for me is suppsoedto be dalnir... ive been there a few ocasions, always in a group. 1. There are tons of casters, 2, its tights so ill always have adds, and 3, once you drop down the first floor, its a long ass way to run if your getting beat down and FD fails... Im not worried about much, but yuck, dalnir scares me. <br />
<br />
<br />
P.S.    What are the other hotspots, i can seem to find an up-to-date info anywhere?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Putrid</div><div class="date">09-30-2004, 09:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Usually there is only one zone per 5 levels.  I think Dalnir's is it for you.  As an alternative, Crystal caverns has always been a good 30's zone.  It is not a hot spot, however.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nytemyst</div><div class="date">09-30-2004, 09:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I loved dalnir. Got the 5 levels there in one day and fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slein Jinn</div><div class="date">09-30-2004, 02:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dalnir is also the kind of zone that will make you a better player.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">smage</div><div class="date">09-30-2004, 03:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dalnir is an awesome zone...at your level, it really shouldn't be scary, since you can pull to and fight at the zone-in (invest in SoW potions and you're golden; unless you have good resists, be careful with the necro mobs, and always darkness/fear the clerics before they can heal...and, of course, let your pet take one for the team against the shadowknights, hehe)...it's better with a group (especially if you can do the 2nd floor), but solo isn't too bad.  The most important thing, if you do decide to fight more than the top level, is to learn the layout of the levels (and, if solo, learning to run before the point of no return).<br />
<br />
P.S. - Might also want to learn how to drop down between levels without taking damage (takes practice).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nasiir</div><div class="date">09-30-2004, 03:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Learn to pull in Dalnir and you're set anywhere. As Slein said, leveling there makes you a better player.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zefan</div><div class="date">09-30-2004, 03:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the input, ive been doing some lvelling in GUK (im now 34), and the xp is crazy. Howeever, I think I will go to Dalnir because it sounds liek a challenge, and I think it will be fun. I know the layout from laying waste with higher level chars back in the day when some of the drops there were awesome for twinks :). It sounds like I will get some good hands on with pet pulling and other things I havent tried as a SK. Any suggestions for the 35+ zones? as I will probably make 35 there quickly.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zefan</div><div class="date">10-02-2004, 11:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, to all shadow knight twinked and untwinked i would say Dalnir is NOT the place to get xp at level 30-37.. In my experience over half the mobs you will fight are casters, and the coerced gnomes are chaincasting wizard types... yes you can fearkite them, and they do go down easy, but the xp is not so good that it is worth 1) the trouble of walking to dalnir... and 2) having to fearkite half your kills. for levels 30-34 and posibly 35 and 36, I believe that the entrance area to lower guk is equal xp per kill, the mobs are a littel stronger, but still easy kills, and you only get maybe 1 shaman or wizard per spawn of around 12 froggies. Im going to try crystal caverns now, as I hope that may be better xp.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TelimTor</div><div class="date">10-03-2004, 04:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think I did all my 30's in Sol A, down at the bar, then along the EXG path.  You'll learn to snare before they run or you'll be dead... ;)</div></div><hr />

They are listed in patch messages when they change.</div></div><hr />

_____________________ <br />
<br />
Hunt for greater XP rewards in the new Hot Spots. Make your way to the following zones. <br />
<br />
60-65 Plane of Torment <br />
55-60 Chardok <br />
50-55 Grieg's End <br />
45-50 Nurga <br />
40-45 City of Mist <br />
35-40 Kaesora <br />
30-35 Dalnir <br />
25-30 Hollowshade Moor <br />
20-25 Runnyeye</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paynreaver</div><div class="date">10-04-2004, 10:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the list Keevel. Just because I love asking for favors, is there a list of all zone ZEMs that I can see?<br />
<br />
I &lt;3 Runnyeye, and my Necro is just getting to that level.<br />
<br />
What is the general boost in a &quot;hotspot&quot;? Are we talking EXP x 1.5 or something more like x1.025?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keevel</div><div class="date">10-04-2004, 11:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hot spot supposedly = same ZEM as PC<br />
<br />
They've removed the methods to determine it directly, but I would agree with that.<br />
<br />
My issue is that some of the zones they made hot spots in the last batch and in this batch (LoY and GE) have fairly high HP MoBs, meaning that though you get great exp per kill, the kills go slower.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zefan</div><div class="date">10-04-2004, 08:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">not to mention that dalnir once you drop down , you cant exit the same way, and half the mobs there are casters or clerics or shadow knights.... in Kaesora, the exit is a dangerous run away once are in, and alot of mobs there are casters too. The risk is not worht the reward unless you have a good group.. and where do you find those anymore pre 50?</div></div><hr />
