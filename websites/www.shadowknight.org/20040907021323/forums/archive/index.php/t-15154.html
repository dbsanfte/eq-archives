<br />
Trolls think im to weak <br />
<br />
ogres think im to small <br />

gnomes think there more sexy :)<br />
<br />
Erudites are my friends :) <br />
<br />
Darkelves think they are the evilest <br />
<br />
Lizards think im a softskin <br />
<br />
It is nothing like having all these races underestimate me and getting spanked.  <br />
<br />
Plus I like being different because not many ppl pick human sk's on vallon zek :)<br />

So... &quot;nouthing&quot; is a typo fix then?<br />

I've heard nothing about &quot;nouthing&quot; being an actual word...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jodgrim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Actually Groff, if you look at what I quoted you will notice that all I did was change &quot;underestimate me&quot; to &quot;underestimate my twink gear&quot;.<br />
<br />
I usually ignore minor typos because we all make them every now and then. Had I actually attempted to fix his spelling errors, I would also have pointed out the following:<br />
<br />
Nothing misspelled twice, in two different ways.<br />
im should be capatilized and have an apostrophe.<br />
underestamate should be spelled underestimate.<br />
<br />
But I'm sure you didn't mention them because you were being funny right?<br />

How wrong of me OMG OMG <br />

Zigfried inherited his equipment from a main that I gave up on. Plus hanging in the bazaar can pay off well.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>badsmofo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My first SK was a human and while it was fun being different, it only took me 15 twinkless levels to realize that Humans suck.  I would much rather pay the XP penalty for the regen and AC of an Iksar (if you are twinking, then i guess it doesn't matter)</div></div><hr />

What else can you really discuss in the &quot;Race Discussions&quot; forum besides that?</div></div><hr />

anyway DE are the evilest and own all kthx :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Makk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Your gear is pretty nice for your level.  So on that token, When my troll used go trollin about OT on the ye ole vz server, only one super twink sk (full ToV at level 30) I had to run from about 60% of the time rest I beat down with equal gear (I love to hunt down twink killa's in OT) being a twink myself.  So imo equal gear on a troll that is equal skill as a human will pull off a victory to a human at these levels if both participates decide to stay the whole fight and not SS or run off on a horse after getting beat down.  That is just my opinion.  <br />
<br />
That and go after twink dark/gnome sk's instead of your run of the mill newbie.  If you do that I appluad you.  If not then don't boast here plz.  <br />
<br />
P.S.  somebody proof read this whole statement for me, I am too lazy and I know you guys will do it for me tks^^.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Denaiele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I thought we were done with pointless &quot;My race is better than yours&quot; theads. <br />
You mean these are pointless?????<br />
<br />
Makk-  you have one hell of a run on sentence there.  Oh, and that first &quot;W&quot; on when....  put it lowercase...   :)<br />
<br />
   But anywho....  the fact of the matter is, your equipment if very obviously twinkage (is that actually a word?) or off a melee that you don't know how to dress.   I don't think I know of any self respecting melee that would willingly run around in a Fungi Tunic, after like level 30, perhaps some would, but I sure wouldn't.  I'd rather wear something with more AC to it.  Granted, the effect of the tunic is nothing to laugh at, but still, you're at the level where even old world mobs, when they get a good smack in are hitting  for 80+.  Tell me that that tunic is going to take care of hits like that before the mob smacks you again.<br />
   Oh, two more things...  try tanking more.  Your defense skill is lacking.  You max that out for your level, and I'd just about guarantee you would have AC closer to 820-830, instead of the 793 you have now.    And the last thing is... you willingly wear that mask?  Yes, I saw the hitpoints, mana, and saves.  Personally, I have to agree with the majority here that AC is king.  There is much better face pieces out there that are obtainable at your level.  Choose one with 6 or more AC, instead of one that you have to wait until level 45 to get the full 5 AC from.  <br />
/em slaps self.<br />
Was beginning to feel like I was coddelling (that just doesn't look right, does it?)...  giving advice, in a post that started out so nice and sarcastic.  Today must have been too long or something.<br />
<br />
Oh, and notice my spellings and usage of too and to, Zig, and learn from it.  There is a reason they teach grammar and spelling in school.<br />

I can see from reading your post that you have never ever played on a pvp server :) My equipment that my charater has equiped is for pvp not PVE, I did not have time to list my PVE equipment so it's not on magelo.<br />
<br />
If you played  on a pvp server you would notice a large percentage of the ppl carry around 2 sets of equipment either in finger face or ect. Now why I use a fungi tunic dispite it's low ac Would be because the effect does me very good and helps me in down time(alot might argue that). For my bp I use a queens caraparce. <br />
<br />
<br />
Now next, Someone stated that twinks only go around and beat up on newbies poorly equiped, The fact is... I only kill or attack if Im attacked. <br />
<br />
<br />
 Now the whole start of the post was supposed to be a joke not a boast or insult to anyone. I was attempting somewhat a type of roleplaying (if you call it that) <br />
<br />
And the whole fact or the matter about races is every race can yeild a very nice shadowknight.</div></div><hr />

This by all means is quite  true...  I myself am a Human Shadowknight.  I started one after watching this level 30 Human SK in MM.  Of course now I realize that it was more his gear than knowing the class that allowed him to take on 3 blues in one pull, and only casting snare, and tapping a couple times during the whole fight.  Any race that yields the Shadowknight class can make an awesome Shadowknight.  Just look at that Erudite profile that was posted.  I think someone mentioned  that he  was the top SK on his server.  I have seen Erudite Sks, and gone WOW, but then again, I have dealt with Ogre SKs that were unbelievable.  I have come to realize that one must know and understand the class, in order to be good.  Gnomes, however, I still feel should not be Shadowknights.<br />
<br />

<br />
Also quite true.  I tried PVP about a month after I started playing.  Getting killed as I walked out of my Guild with my starting tunic, and having it and my starting sword looted off my corpse before I made level 2 was not my idea of fun.  PVE, I am assuming is the normal player vs mob.  (btw, what does PVE stand for?  plaver vs entity?  vs equipment?  vs enviroment?)<br />

HAHAHAHAHA<br />
<br />
Sorry that was quite funny. I really wish you were trying to be sarcastic. Even until around 50 a Fungi can be better than most BP's. <br />
<br />
On a pvp server they are godly for much of the lower levels. <br />
<br />
You unintentionally showed how ignorant you are to the advantages of a fungi.</div></div><hr />
