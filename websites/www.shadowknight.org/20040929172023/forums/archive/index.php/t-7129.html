<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>AkumaShreddies</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If i hunt in Field of Bone as a low level gnome, roughly how long would it take to raise my faction enough to go into town and train? 10, 15, 20 etc?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Seku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Roughly 8,000 bone chips turned in AFTER you have killed enough outcasts and goblins and sarnaks to get so the Troopers wont kill you. Or you can turn in explorer knives which only takes a few hundred.<br />
<br />
Basically the answer to your question is nearly forever if you are a Cazic worshiper and more than forever if you aren't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kebsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">But if you do the explorer knives thing, you'll screw up you're FV faction (I dunno if good race SKs use FV, but if you do, you should know that)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kebsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Well Erud SKs worship Cazic right?  All iksar are Cazic worshippers so it makes sense you would have higher faction with them then most...and I do believe I started off pretty well in Paineel.  <br />
<br />
You probably have higher than your starting faction with them though, if you've done any hunting at all in loio, WW, or OT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Baroyonx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Unless you are power leveling, the regular newbie areas should be fine....just don't kill orcs in gfay if you plan on being friends with the dark elves later on<br />
<br />
If you are power lvling, Kurn's Tower is great (it's a little rough without higher buffs and heals)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Yisaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Newbie Gnomes have one of the best 1-14 zones right outside their city.  1-4 on rats and such, 5-8 on Kobalds, 9-11 at the windmill, 11-14 outside the mino caves. After that, head to Unrest and kill yard trash to 18, and finally off to the moon you go. At 18-24 you should be in Paludal Caverns, nowhere will you find a better exp./loot combination.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Mousepad4life</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Can't forget about crushbone!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Putrid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">For your answer on quickest and fast exp. I would say get to 12 or so and go to Warrens or Paludal Caverns.  I dont know much about the Caverns but a lot of people on the board think they are great.  I did the Warrens from 12 to 18.  Good loot and exp.  You also gain faction with Paineel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Eatbugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I am a 60 sk (erudite) and I have done no faction work for cabalis, I am doubious to the sk guild and threatening to all others..<br />
<br />
Erm...  not unless they changed Cabilis factions.   You're probably dubious to troopers, (who are on Legion of Cabilis, not Crusaders of Greenmist) not Crusaders.   Most people end up at least dubious to Legion of Cabilis if they fight in Kunark for long, but that and Brood of Kotiz are the only ones you can bring up by killing.  The others have to be brought up by doing faction quests - all race/religion combos except Iksar start out KOS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Kebsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Hmm...it is possible they changed cab faction, they have a couple times in the past...for the Quellious monks, and (I think) Rallos Zek Ogres.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Faeeldora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">As was stated I am thinking that the dubious faction IS with the Legions of Cabilis faction.<br />
<br />
Though I found it quite easy to faction with them, kill outcasts in FoB near the water but beware a blue to 35 monk-like guy spawns there...while there auction WTB Bone chips =)<br />
<br />
I say this because Brood of Kortiz(Necros) is ONLY changed by fighting outcast!<br />
<br />
when you are bored with the outcasts go beat on skellies in Kurns<br />
<br />
I don't recommend factioning with Cabilis until 30 when you get Gather shadows cause the turn in (Trooper Mozo) has ABUNCH of various guards roaming around him ALL on different factions!)<br />
<br />
I love walking around Cabilis with a bunch of newbs looking at me funny =)<br />
<br />
ON the subject of Firiona Vie - We HUMANS are KoS to em before fighting explorers in LoIO however I am working on this faction while hunting the illusive Shrunken Goblin head earring! :D<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Jobrill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Don't listen to these goobs. Iksar LOVE Gnomes.<br />
<br />
I suggest you march right in Cabilis and shake hands with Prime Heirophant Vek, he always loves to meet new friends.</div></div><hr />
