<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bushido32</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been working on keys lately so that I can do it while I grow in levels.  I've come up with a list of zones that you need keys/flags for and was hoping people could double check it for me.<br />
<br />
Old World:  The Hole, Sky (requires port), Hate (requires port, can buy now via NPC)<br />
Kunark:  Seb., HS, VP<br />
Velious:  ST, CS key via Skyshrine<br />
Luclin:  VT, Intrazone keys for Seru, Ssra, &amp; Acrylia<br />
PoP:  flags req. for EP &amp; Time<br />
LoY:  None?<br />
Gates:  flags req. for KT &amp; beyond</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>cames</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Acrylia key gone a long time ago.<br />
<br />
Flags were originally required in all PoP zones other than PoI, PoJ, PoN and PoD.<br />
<br />
Hole does not require a key for an SK.  Just Harmshield and take a header.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Doesn't access to Lower Acrylia still require some sort of key? I did VT shards there a while ago and I'm not sure if I could have gotten to the area where we farmed those without the keyed person in my group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Oh, also there are a ton of missing keys on that list.<br />
<br />
Tower of Frozen Shadow keys and master key.<br />
<br />
PoI factory 'key'/flag<br />
<br />
Other PoP keys that are tied to progression there, like CoDB/PoNB/Torment Saryrn Key/Aerrin Dar Key/HoHB/BoT Tower &amp; Agnarr/EarthB...and so on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Silvershadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Doesn't access to Lower Acrylia still require some sort of key?

<br />
I got there perfectly well when farming my shard solo, without a key.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ramgar SK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Acrylia key gone a long time ago.<br />
<br />
Flags were originally required in all PoP zones other than PoI, PoJ, PoN and PoD.<br />
<br />
Hole does not require a key for an SK.  Just Harmshield and take a header.<br />
<br />
Well, the Hole does have a keyed entrance.  You can get in the way Cames said, just be certain you have a gate potion/hammer on you to get back out.<br />
<br />
Add Paineel and Befallen to the list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bushido32</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Can't seem to update my original post, so here's what I have for an updated list.  Thanks for the responses.<br />
<br />
Old World: The Hole, Sky (requires port), Hate (requires port, can buy now via NPC), Paineel, Intrazone keys for Befallen<br />
Kunark: Seb., HS, VP<br />
Velious: ST, CS key via Skyshrine, Intrazone keys for TOFS<br />
Luclin: VT, Intrazone keys for Seru &amp; Ssra<br />
PoP: flags req. for EP &amp; Time, plus Intrazone and regular PoP flag progression (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/maps/Planes_of_Power_flags_1_13.gif)<br />
LoY: None<br />
Gates: flags req. for KT &amp; beyond (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/maps/god_progression.jpg)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>cames</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well there are 3 keyed areas of Vex Thal as well (castle, north wing, north tower).<br />
<br />
We left off Sol Ro's Tower for flag and Sol Ro's Room for a flag as well.  BoT Tower Keys and Agnarr Key.<br />
<br />
Najena has keyed areas.<br />
<br />
There are some normal rogue spots that might have keys I believe (CoM, Howling Stones Wings - pretty sure on these, Seb Crypt - unsure).<br />
<br />
Jaled Dar's room in Dragon Necropolis has a key.<br />
<br />
On a historical note, it used to be required to pick up a tooth at the portals in GD, WL, and CS to be able to be ported there.<br />
<br />
Sorry, every time I look at the thread I think of somewhere else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tukka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Unless it was recently fixed (maybe it was changed with the DX9 engine), you could squeeze through keyed entrance to the Hole without the key, if you did some ducking and wiggling, at least as an erudite or smaller race.  It's not as if that key is hard to get, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>NorrynNoir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">regarding pop , Plane of Tactics hasn't been mentioned, but that &amp; Sol Ro Tower still require flags to enter. there is also a key needed (acquired via flag) to get the the lower part of CoD where Bertox is.</div></div><hr />
