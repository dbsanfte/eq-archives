<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Trewfelagh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First off, let me say Hi.<br />
<br />
Hi. :D<br />
<br />
I have never posted here before now, but I did troll through occasionally looking for info after I got serious about finishing my epic.  Thanks for all the good posts.  <br />
<br />
I never have seen a ratman guard in the Hole.  But thanks to the seal running thread I found I was able to work around that.  But everything else I completed as intended.  And last month I was finally able to wield Innoruuk's Curse. . . only to find it had been broken during the patch a couple days before.  :mad: <br />
<br />
I mention all this because I never had the pleasure of using the weapon prior to it being broken and subsequently fixed (thanks for the rush job VI, jerks).  So now it doesn't eat us anymore.  But I just noticed another issue a couple days ago.<br />
<br />
I was fighting in CoD when IC procs.  I get message &quot;your spell does not take hold&quot; but mob is taking 50 pts every tick and I never get the recourse icon.  After playing with my buffs a bit I determine it is a stacking issue with Foul Pus and Corrupted Pus.  My sword would not heal me when I had either of these 2 effects on me.  I had the same issue in Skyfire the next day when I was infected by Dark Poison from one of the wyverns.  So it seems whenever I have poison or disease effect on me I cannot be healed by SC recourse.  Seems pretty screwy to me, but stranger things have happened.<br />
<br />
I have submitted bug reports.  I petitioned a GM just see if they knew anything about this.  A guide responded to me today, but didn't know.<br />
<br />
So my question is, does anyone else know about this?  Is this a known bug/effect?  Is it supposed to be this way?<br />
<br />
Since I just got IC recently, I have no idea if this was always this way or it's just residual screw-up from the June patch.  Hopefully one of you knows about this cuz it's bugging the crap out of me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dharkenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1st qustion.....did u have all 15 buff slots filled?<br />
<br />
if so that solves it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Trewfelagh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I wish it were that simple.  No, my buff window was never full during this.  Only had 10 to 12 buffs at any one time.  I removed and added several buffs trying to figure out where the conflict was.  But I wasn't buffed with anything unique that I wasn't used to having anyway.  <br />
<br />
I tested it enough to be quite certain it was the poison/disease counters blocking the recourse effect.  My question is just whether anyone else is familiar with this?  Not having had IC for very long I didn't know if it was always this way and just an accepted part of the effect.  If no one here has heard of this then I will assume it is another new bug and persue it as such.<br />
<br />
If I recall correctly my hp total was not red as it should be when affected by a DoT.  It could be that some of the poison/disease effects in game are not correctly toggled as detrimental even though they perform all the effects they are supposed to.  It's just a guess.  I am not at all an expert on all the raw spell data and what all that stuff means.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Trewfelagh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Oh yeah, it also appears that when it does proc it lasts for 6 ticks instead of 5 now, for a total of 300 hps dmg.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Moongarm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Here's the stacking info from lucy Soul Consumption R. (http://lucy.fnord.net/stacking.html?id=3977&amp;source=Live) .<br />
<br />
It never did that before and not quite sure why they changed it to do it like this now. I don't quite agree with the change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Trewfelagh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">well, I've been staring at that list for over half an hour and not really sure what it means.  Care to translate?<br />
<br />
Does that list mean that nothing on the list stacks with it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's what it looks like to me, and that's what it looks like to a few other people I asked.<br />
<br />
So it means that our Epic is practically worthless if we're fighting any mob that has a dot of some sort.  It seems like a rather stupid way to set it up, and there's never any problem with any OTHER lifetap over time, if we're dotted.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, okay.  Maybe not worthless.  It's still a decent weapon.  Just not great without that lifetap :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Delvekion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">A few weeks ago I noticed that IC was actually damaging me instead of my target. I contacted a GM immediately and the problem was escalated to a high priority (or so I was told). Last I checked the problem seemed to be fixed.</div></div><hr />
