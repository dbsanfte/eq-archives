<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kelefane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Any tips on soloing PoFear if its a full spawn? Any tips on getting to the temple from zone in ect? This part has me worried :o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hadrius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Zone in on your horse, fly like hell to the temple, FD, magically snare split one amy out of all of the ones in the temple, melee it to death. Repeat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Trysbrina67</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I wouldn't try it while CT and the Golems were up however unless you like DTs and TONS of chain aggro.<br />
Other than that just go to NWest corner, aggro a bunch from temple, snare a knight or warrior, FD and wait for clear message.  Festering should wear off about the time you get the okay message.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Arikash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah, if CT is up, definetally don't go w/o a group, or a healer at least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>kilst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Invis up, get on ur horse, zone in and run to NW corner. Normally I dont get aggro doing that, but if u do just fd. Then as Trys said, just pull from the temple snare an Amy, fd and pull when u get the message.<br />
<br />
Note, u might wanna clear NW corner 1st, a few wanderers there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>nytemyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i just used a low level pet i think  it was our lvl 52 spell pet to single pet the amys just pray he makes it back =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>grinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">clearing the NW corner first is a good idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Saruton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Zoned in, dashed to south eastern most corner, FD, wait 2 mins and start killing mobs. It was alot easier to grab all the roaming Amygdalean Mobs then splitting the castle. Got to clear some trash but wasnt hard at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Seku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I was helping a group that had died at West Wall with CR when I got mine. Was pulling corpses from around the ZI and such to WW. During the course of the multiple deaths of the CR group there were some wanderers a bit South of the CR area. The third one dropped my piece. Sometimes there were adds by the time I finished the fight on the Amy. Once they got me down to 60% on HP and about the same on mana. I have a few pieces of Elemental armor but no where near a set, level 67 when it was done and about 8k hit points and 1550 AC with the buffs I had while doing it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Elhrairah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I was &quot;afraid&quot; of fear as well before i got my amy eye. In reality, this is the easiest part of the quest so far. You have a better chance of dying in Nightmare kiting glooms or in PoG from random adds than here. All you have to do is:<br />
<br />
1) Mem harmshield<br />
2) Invis, get on horse, zone in<br />
3) if aggroed at zone in, harmshield, break west on horse, FD at wall, wait your 2 minutes, stand up, invis, creep north towards temple.<br />
4) If necessary clear NW corner or just train/FD the mobs away.<br />
5) To pull, simply run towards the NW corner of temple, ull chain aggro everything almost as soon as you cross the fire. Just run back thru fire, hop on horse, break to corner, FD.<br />
6) pretarget your amy, stand up, snare, FD. FD timer and festering last same amount, so wait until u see ur FD message (***NOTE:VERY IMPORTANT***, if you stand up b4 u see that message, thats how noobs get DT'ed or x-loc from random aggro)<br />
7) Stand kill Amy, toe-to-toe or kite if u have too, a lvl 65 sk can solo these guys with snare alone, they have crap for hps<br />
8)loot eye, gate.<br />
<br />
The only issue I ever had was with parking the stupid Wraith of Shissar guy. If he adds, just treat him like ur next amy. Single him the same way, satnd up and snare him, kite him south then when he gets far enuff south, break to NW corner and FD. Hell stay where u parked him for 20+ minutes at least.<br />
<br />
This part is, like the PoG drop, is all about FD tactics. Bring your blood ember as it will save u alot of mana here. Have HS up for emergencies, about all thier is to say.<br />
<br />
I wouldnt bring a group for this camp, they are a liability to you here, not an asset.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Why are people recommending you clear?  You don't have to clear shit.  And pulling wanderers is slow as hell (and may require you to clear).  Splitting the temple is easy as hell, with very, very, very little chance of adds in a fully popped fear if you are at the right place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Nasiir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I did this solo when Fear was fully popped. A group would definitely be a hindrance to a SK trying to do it.<br />
I ran in, ran towards the NW corner and FDed (actually FDed once prior to reaching to top corner, just because I was worried about chain aggroing a golem). ***Always wait til you see 'your enemies have forgotten you!' message before getting up! (if you don't expect DT)***  I set up camp in the far north of the west most side of the temple, against the zone line. <br />
When ready, I walked to the temple, used 'target closest npc' I was able to pull the Amy's out, then I waited til I could see the first Amy, cast festering, then FDed. At the 2 minute mark, just as all mobs had forgotten me, and when festering was just wearing off, the darked Amy was still just where he was when I FDed, so I'd pull him back to my spot, straight melee him down, then do any resting that I needed to, and started over. <br />
A few times, I had to run NW to recast festering for resists. I also had an roamer when I was fighting in the NW corner (which is why I moved to the spot I mention above - which was completely safe from all roamers when I did it). I also was very careful not to pull the Amy's when CT was near the area the Amy's path out and around to the back - consulting Ms. Cleo is highly recommended.<br />
I think the piece dropped on the 4th or 5th Amy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Iosif_McCloud</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Bah just clear the zone...  worked for me.. Acculy we went to get Warrior the golums .. Went in with 8 peopel 3 of them boxed.. killed umm.. Everything .. wasnt planed that way but the pullers were sloppy (The Warrior) we had a 30min train .. by time we got done with the golums .. we moved over pulled temple in 1 pull and had 5 Eye's drop.. i looted and we got the hell outta dodge.. When i checked track from NW camp i only saw likr 10mobs on camp... Ranger said he didnt even have 20 mobs on his list<br />
<br />
And it was a hell of alot mroe fun then soloing</div></div><hr />
