<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thupid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">how long did it take you, and got any tips? <br />
<br />
i'm lookin at about a good 20 hours so far camping him. on and off.<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;~~~ the gun is to my head....2 more hours and i will be dead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jobrill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I did the whole Visc dagger in about 6 hours. I think it took me about 12 PHs to get Church Imp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Celedyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">About the same as Jobril for me, maybe more like 4 hours.  Just keep the ph (one behind the alter) dead and eventually youll get lucky.<br />
<br />
Im not sure if its accurate but I made sure there were no other impreceptors up by visually checking the spawns and then making sure i was the only one in zone; on the off chance there can be only 1 popped at a time.<br />
<br />
As for advice, set a timer or read a book while at comp, no sense staring at the screen when its easy to hear it pop.  Try to sace your sanity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jobrill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">As far as checking for other Imprecators up, I did it very sloppily, once every 3 or 4 spawns I would go around and look for other Imprecators (and the Smith) and kill em if they were up. Only had to kill the Smith a second time, otherwise the other two didn't even pop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jabbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">All the horror stories for this are in the Dirty Deeds section, in the Khukri quest stickied at the top.<br />
<br />
You'll find a great many people did it in 6 hours, and a great many it took 30+.  You've got about a 50/50 chance here, so say your prayers at night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>krikk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Once you've taken care of the 2nd floor Imp and are ready for the 3rd floor, I'd say it's a good idea to kill the PH behind the alter, and then move over to the Laboritory Imp to kill him if he's up. Then zone out, zone in, move back to floor 3, wash, rinse and repeat. I did the camp for 2 seperate daggers, average time was about 8 hours, on and off each time. Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Thupid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">yea, ive been practing that method of rinse repeating the zone, checking and stuff....just been really tough. im gonna go at again straight tonight. last night i did a good 5 hours and nothing. truely, when it comes to quests, im hated by something :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jackkal Darknite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You dont want to know how long that damn kly imp woudnt spawn in the church.<br />
<br />
That was about the worst camp for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>JikkoColdheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">LoL... I got my dagger the easy way.<br />
<br />
62 Necro in my guild had one he didn't use anymore so he MQ'd it for me.<br />
<br />
You can all flame me now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kentsin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I got lucky with this one...I had killed about 4 PHs for both the church imp and the blacksmith, when the blacksmith popped up on me. I wasted him, proceeded over to the church thinking &quot;Damn, here comes a long ass camp.&quot; But lo and behold when i get there the imprecator is up. Total time in Dalnir was about...4 hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">i got each imp to spawn, about an hour a peice.</div></div><hr />
