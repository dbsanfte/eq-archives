<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Deccimus Pryme</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi, I was just wondering how many Erudite SKs we have on this board. I recently made an alt Erudite SK ( I know it's weird making an alt with the same class as my main) and I wanted to know if they really were as rare as they seem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Izus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm a Erudite SK. I don't know how far along you are with your alt but keep a couple of things in mind. Erudites are rare cause our starting stats are just bad. Make sure Agi is at least 75. I've found this attribute to be the hardest to get any decent gear for.  Also, put the rest of your points into Sta. I know that starting strength is weak but there is plenty of relatively lower priced gear to get strength up to a decent level. Enjoy the character...you will be unique. Take advantage of the warrens nearby. Good loot and xps for the early part of your career.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Requiam O'Souls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">We have quite a few actually.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Scrion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Us Erudite SKs are not popular, but theres a decent number of us around. I choose Erudite for the looks, and the mentality - I love the pursuit of knowledge and sort of scientific and sophisticated personality of the Erudites. My only regret is putting all my points in Strength, but I was young and newbish back than, and the Strength is far from useless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>The Shadowsil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Fairly rare as far as servers go, but many seem to frequent these boards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jobrill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I suggest you check the &quot;What SK race do you play thread&quot; that is almost always bumped near the top on this board. Maybe do a search for &quot;Erudite&quot; in the Race Disscussions forum, and I'm sure you'll get lots of views and statistics on Erudite Shadowknights.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Riaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Erudite SKs are the win!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nizuzen Crevecoeur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">We are few in number but great in spirit!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Katha Ath'Nan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I've noticed quite a few more on Prexus lately.<br />
<br />
<br />
Of course, 'quite a few more' in this situation can still be counted on the hands with enough fingers left over to slap a gnome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>PLW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">On drinal, there may be a few Erudites, but not many 60+. <br />
<br />
Three 60's (me included) and 1 62, who may be 63 by now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Itzena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I actually ran into another female erudite SK on Vallon the other day and nearly passed out from shock. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Mushizo Von'Darkenblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">theres a couple on bertox...only 2 fem eruds over 60 including myself....we're so hotter than de's =) our stats arent too bad in the long run when compairing mana pool/hp at least that i've seen....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Cirrean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">There's a few Erudite SKs on Druzzil Ro.  There are a couple in my guild besides myself, and a few that, if they are still playing, I imagine must have been lvl 65 for awhile now.  When I started playing EQ, my first characters both started out on the &quot;West Side&quot; of Antonica, so I was already familiar with hunting zones, factions, and quests.  I already had a human druid, but since I didn't see many Erudites around (and NO Erudite SKs), I thought I'd try it out.  It definitely is a challenging class/race combination, but people do seem to take notice of us when we reach the higher levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Zaim Nae'blis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Last time I checked there were only four ERU/SK over the level 50 on Eci. <br />
<br />
I like playing race/class combos that are rare. <br />
<br />
Dont worry about the stats you start up with. The difference in starting stats between races can be as much as 15 points in a single area. This used to be a big deal when ubber for a SK meant Rubicite/Darkforge and A Dark Reaver. But now, at the high end game , you have single peices of equipment that can have as much as +15 to +25 on any stat now.<br />
<br />
Enjoy the game.</div></div><hr />
