<br />
Where exactly are Loremaster Piza'Tak and the Alchemist Acolyte?<br />
<br />
I am told the Acolyte is not in the castle with nobles but down in the catacombs next to the lake but cannot get confirmation of this.<br />
<br />
(Would be nice not to have to have a full Nobles raid to acquire these)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarkWyld</div><div class="date">07-02-2002, 12:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nothing on any maps I have seen of Chardok shows the exact location of the Library, though I have heard many say it's located somewhere just after the Prince.<br />
<br />
The Alchemist Acolyte spawns next to the Herb Shack.  He and the Herbalist needed for the Necro epic both spawn at the same location (i.e. are PHs for one another).  I hear there are other PHs as well, but don't remember what they are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Galac Bloodreaver</div><div class="date">07-02-2002, 12:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's a map:<br />
<br />
&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.xegony.org/guides/Newchardok_2.jpg&quot;&gt;<br />
<br />
top right is the graveyard.  the four square thing is the prince area.  the part where it splits is the library, the leftmost part being an upper floor and the right part being the lower floor.  <br />
<br />
the loremaster spawns on the lower floor of the library.  last time i went through there the loremaster was one of the two spawns at the hallway where the pit trap to the king room is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ikrog</div><div class="date">07-02-2002, 07:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would like to think anyone else looking at the maps available could understand any confusion:<br />
<br />
*) The map shows the prince way on the top left - but you say he's in the top right around the four columns.  Fair 'nuff.  I understand where you said the library was, thanks.<br />
<br />
*) The map shows the &quot;Herbalist&quot; in the callout window past the nobles.  However other indicators have it that the &quot;Herbalist Hut&quot; is not there, it's somewhere else.<br />
<br />
<br />
I am trying and willing to find answers myself, however this is not a zone easily &quot;infiltrated&quot; on recon missions.  <br />
<br />
Thanks again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarkWyld</div><div class="date">07-03-2002, 04:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are some good maps on www.monkly-business.com (in fact, the one above was taken from the same source that the Monks use).  Go to Zone Guides and Chardok should be at the top of the list (at the moment).  The Loremaster was not shown on the maps (thanks for pointing out his spot, Galac).  However, on the mine map, the Alchemist acolyte and the Wizened Herb Collector (correction to above) spawn in the same location - #5.  Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ikrog</div><div class="date">07-03-2002, 06:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye.  Much thanks DarkWyld.  I had never seen a version of that map so marked before. <br />
<br />
Guess I'll be using Monkly-Business a bit more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Puurrdy</div><div class="date">07-03-2002, 08:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Graveyard is not in front of the castle.<br />
<br />
It is the area, directly past the waterfall on the way to the castle, filled with Gravemasters and skeletal berserkers and champions.  A Couple of Nec/SK drop (mostly) mobs spawn in this location.<br />
<br />
The Herbalist is no longer found behind the locked door with the pit trap, he is now in an entirely different part of the dungeon.<br />
<br />
The guy with the greenmist book does spawn in the library, which is past the former &quot;safe hall&quot; and down a second flight of stairs.  Every raid to royals I have been on in the last 3 months, I have seen him up on the way thru to get to the King and Queen.  The book is NOT no drop, so it can be traded if your guild picks it up for you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I had the same type of questions about the Alchemist Acolyte specifically.  He spawns outside the Herbalist Hut near a body of water.  Referring to the monkly business maps, look at the &quot;Mines Map&quot; and spot 5 is EXACTLY where the Alchemist Acolyte spawns (as of last night 7/2/02).  Managed to kill him last night and get my Greenish Metal Shard (he equips it when he has it and it is a dagger).<br />
<br />
Now I'm a proud owner of the Greenmist.<br />
