<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kelefane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After I get all the defensive AA I can get on my SK. I was planning on going SCF/SA and then my HT AA's. Does that sound like a good path to take? And somewhere in there im gonna get my steed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">That's what I did(am doing)<br />
<br />
I have HP maxed, Avoidance maxed, and almost have Mitigation maxed. I then started on SCF3 which I just finised, and now working on SA3. Next is going to be IHT and then UT.<br />
<br />
If you look at my AA's I mixed it up a bit, I did Planar Power, Theft of Life, Knights Advantage, Speed of the Knight, etc. I will get the horse last, but that's just me. (Gnomes look silly on a horse)</div></div><hr />

Noam's just look silly. )<br />

I'd say get what you need most.  If you raid and you think you need the HT .. get that.  If you feel you need more HP's, get that.  If you want to see more crits, get those.  If you want to be on a horse, get that.  If you need more mana, get the MC ones, get my drift?  No one can tell you how to spend your aa's.  If you keep playing you'll get all of them, so it doesn't matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>frotty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">yeah, it depends on what you do the most.<br />
<br />
I personally think SCF should be gotten ASAP as it is such a sweeping change that benefits you on raids, in exp groups, in LDoN... defensive is great, if you're taking hits. I'm rarely taking hits, and those that I'm taking are handled fine by the healers I'm with in exp/ldon..<br />
<br />
SCF SA TOL is the line that benefits you overall the best. If you tank alot in exp/ldon, Work CA -&gt; LR then CS -&gt; ID.<br />
<br />
Follow up either of those by maxing HPs and hp related, like planar</div></div><hr />
