<br />
Personally I would advise you to die a lot at those levels. No CR and no exp loss when dying until level 10 (or 9?), so have fun with it and be aggressive. Plus, you can use your HT a bazillion times/gameday that way :) Worry about dying later, when it matters.</div></div><hr />

Solo anything dark blue to you.  You can find stuff in Nektulos or East Commons.  If people still do orc groups you can pick up one in EC.  <br />
<br />
i am a Dark Elf, Shadowknight (for those of us that are blind) <br />
No idea wtf the blind part means.  You've got ultravision, are you're saying you're blind IRL and it acts like some form of braille for you?<br />
<br />
i would like to lvl fairly fast and die little<br />
Thank you for clarifying these unique goals.<br />
<br />
 i have little to no good gear.<br />
Hrm, thats not really gonna help with the level fast, die little part.   Plate tanks are easily the MOST gear-dependant class in the game.  If you are starting on a fresh server, with no friends or support I would NOT suggest a plate tank.  <br />
<br />
If you like your SK, I would reroll as a Nec, which would then allow you to level fast, die little, and all this with crap gear.  If you do stay an SK, prepare for a long road as groups arent going to have problems realizing your a mana sponge for the healers, and soloings going to suck.  <br />
<br />
Whether you do SK or Nec look up your Newbie armor quests on Allakhazam (look for quests starting in the three Neriak zones) and do them, they're easy and will give you a full set of some crappy armor.<br />
<br />
Now, Question two, what is a good guild that i should persue at the server of Veeshan, and if its a high lvl guild, whats one that could &quot; tide me over&quot; untill im high enough?<br />
You're not going to get into a high-end guild on Veeshan.  If you are really determined though:<br />
<br />
/t furor I'm really interested in joining FoH.  BtW how many batwings do I need for my newbie breastplate quest?<br />
<br />
Looking for a guild to &quot;tide you over&quot; is shitty, not even going to go there.  Join a guild with people you like and are appropriate level to do stuff with and help them grow through the raid content, instead of trying to ride someone elses coattails.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ramgar SK</div><div class="date">12-31-2003, 01:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hunt right there in Nektulos until level 10 or so.  Then hit CrushBone, Kurns Tower, or Paldual Caverns.<br />
<br />
Do your newbie armor quest.  It's easy and fun.<br />
<br />
Make some plat and hit the bazaar.  Good equipment is dirt cheap.  A good weapon will help you level fast.  Buy a Mace of the Shaddowed Soul, and a Blackened Alloy Bastard Sword.<br />
<br />
I second the motion to not get a guild to &quot;hold you over&quot;.  Find the guild you want to join and go for it, don't step on another guild to get there.</div></div><hr />

Very entertaining if you are soloing.</div></div><hr />
