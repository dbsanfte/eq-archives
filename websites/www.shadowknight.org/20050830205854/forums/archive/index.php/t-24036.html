<br />
the 4 named spawn in specific spots- for a point of reference, if you stand in the middle of the CY and face out towards the 2 named birds:<br />
<br />
Captain spawns in the hut to your right and in front of you ( solder or defender is PH)<br />
<br />
Vicar spawns in the lil stage/chapel area to your left (always a chaplain PH)<br />
<br />
Sorceror spawns behind and to the left along the lower catwalk in the bottom of the stairwell (always a magus PH)<br />
<br />
Charmer ahead and to your right, along catwalk, up stairs, and 2nd mob on the upper level (alway a diviner PH)<br />
<br />
i'll be back to camp it tomorrow with this info...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ephyr</div><div class="date">01-17-2005, 05:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">that was my understanding also when i first went there....but did some more research after i could not get them to spawn...<br />
<br />
pallie boards had lots of posts confirming these spawn points...ill let you know if i get the spawns from the posts when i get some time to farm in the next few days...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ephyr</div><div class="date">01-18-2005, 08:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just an update....spent about 2.5 hours in PoFire today...cleared about 12 PH while 4 boxing....got one named...Charmer of Fire....in the spot indicated above...dropped the Basalt Bulwark shield....so about a 1 in 12 spawn rate so far for named...<br />
<br />
With a full group...and a bit of adjustment to pulling routine/camp location, i'm pretty sure i could keep all 4 ph clear....<br />
<br />
got just under a full yellow of normal exp with my 67 druid...sk exp was split wiht aa so harder to keep track...all in all not bad exp grind while farming the gear...<br />
<br />
after farming RCoD names tanking the PoFire mobs felt easy....and while exp per mob was lower the speed at which i could kill made the actual exp rate higher for me...at least for a 4 box group...<br />
<br />
ill be back again in the next few days to get the Charm of Defense...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">appren hightowerr</div><div class="date">02-06-2005, 07:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The spawns mentioned seem correct to me, I never actively farmed for the nameds, but I did kill them a few times when I was exping (2boxing my SK twink and a shaman bot), and I got one spawn of each of them except the Vicar. Dropped Shield, Charm and Charm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maniacles</div><div class="date">02-07-2005, 11:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been leveling there 66-70.  I can confirm all of the spawn points, except the captain, other than they have the building right. (the monk was pulling when the captain spawned).  Sks make great pullers here, because they can invis to avoid accidentally aggroing a mob they can't see through the side of a hut.<br />
<br />
A note about the vicar of fire...he paths even weirder that the rest of the mobs...We set up in the ne corner, and when pulling the vicar from the south to the north, he pathed diagonal to the se hut, then made a beeline for the captain's hut, all while i just went straight north.  Go figure...just means you might want to clear the se hut before pulling the vicar.  The ph paths normal.  Both vicar and vicar ph can be pulled out of their platform without aggroing the folk around him.  I tend to pull the stair guards just to be safe, however.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Silvershadow</div><div class="date">02-07-2005, 08:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Confirmed Vicar and Captain spawn points, grats me on Basalt Bulwark and Charm of Defense. These guys were serious wusses, I expected them to be harder - all the better for me that they weren't of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ephyr</div><div class="date">02-07-2005, 09:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the only one i found to be at all a challenge was the vicar....bad pathing on pulls and he likes to heal himself...and i had a hard time interrupting him...<br />
<br />
you can go up the side of the rock wall behind him an pull him singel up the wall there....which is easier than pulling him outside...<br />
<br />
just expect a longer fight than the others cause of the healing...<br />
