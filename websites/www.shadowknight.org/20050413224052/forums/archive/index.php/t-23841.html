Does the root actually stick on a 68 SK for long if at all?  MR would seem to be the way to go.  Check Lucy for the actual resist and modifier and adjust accordingly.  Pets can usually be offtanked with the SK pet for a short period of time, this might give you time to quick DPS the mage.  You can also snare the mage pet and run away, this will keep its DPS in check and its root too if you can get far enough.  Shadowstep is also key when dealing with melees (even pets).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kelv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Snare the pet, sick boney on it, and go after the mage.<br />
<br />
You need high FR and MR, lifetap him a couple of times, then run in and IHT.<br />
<br />
<br />
I never had any mage last over 1 minute in a duel against me using that strat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wyrdlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Mages tend to forget you aren't as dumb as the mobs they typically fight.  Just like enchanters forget you can break mez with a dot they can't dispell.<br />
<br />
Solution: Try not to be as dumb as the mobs they typically fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vindarius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">a fun strat would be having the mage challenge you since she's hot to trot to duel, so you have the advantage of controlling the start. Could start at near max range, accept, then real quick get off, say, festering on the mage, hopefully it'll stick, then take off outta range and lure the pet far from the mage, then snare it, then zoom back on horse, circle around her even outta sight, and nail the mage at your leisure while their pet is off picking daisies somewhere.  That would freak her out.  Could sick pet on mage from get-go also for a distraction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aphyon D'Veldrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">See you had me thinking your sig was cool until i looked to the left and saw the gnome head sticking out lol  :p <br />
<br />
Thing is you have to be a little sneaky,i havent played for a couple of months and i havent dueled a mage even longer, i don't know if the resist for Owner/Pet is still the same, Pets Resist is 10 points below it's master, so the if your mage friend changes his/her equipment to counter your disease and magic spells, snare, dot,  etc....you have a 40/60% chance of landing your snare on the pet<br />
<br />
Then you have to consider a mages rune spell, the range of their dd's, another thing last i remember (could be wrong) mages dont get root unless they use their earth pet<br />
<br />
I would keep All nukes,taps up (common sense of course), once you see on your screen that you are hitting for near full dmg with taps and nukes, not just getting the message with no damage points listed taken from your mage friend move in :<br />
<br />
1hs/shield: Move in bash, joust with 1hs and then SS as soon as possible, if you get your friend nervous she might use a rain spell thinking that she will get you but you are OOR already and she is hitting herself,tap,nuke with top 2 nukes each time less resist and max dmg,another obvious tactic don't wait till the end of the match to burn your HT every class expects us to wait till the end to blow our load so to speak<br />
<br />
2hs: joust and then SS, run with horse away from pet stopping while keeping a perimeter around her, if she has a horse as fast as yours then you'd better start switching up,tapping as you know you dont get full dmg so keep 2 up<br />
with your dd dmg in 2mins time 400,600,420 (estimated numbers from 2 of our top taps and nukes) should be 1500-2k dmg depending on your aas<br />
Joust<br />
SS<br />
Nuke<br />
Run<br />
Burn HT<br />
SS<br />
Tap<br />
Tap<br />
<br />
and feel your way around with snaring the pet if it doesnt work after 4 times do not try anymore,she has it set up for disease and magic resist</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fallgore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">First off:<br />
No horse is faster than the Sk/Pally AA Horse, you can probably get a horse near as fast from Lord Seru though, but that's not real likely.<br />
<br />
Second:<br />
Just follow Kelv's idea, it's best, have tried before, it took me 2 mins though because I was runnin around tryin to find a &quot;soulution&quot;/strat. But I ended up dieing because I was 44 against 49 mage, but it was close, used HT and he was down to 4% hp at the end (or somewhere under 5%).<br />
<br />
Just Snare Mage Pet, Snare the Mage too, don't wanna let him/her run + the dot will hurt, then from there, get your pet to fight his/her pet, and tank the mage, use some major dots for fun, life tap about no more than 4 times (doubt you'll need more than 2-3), and HT if you want :D</div></div><hr />
