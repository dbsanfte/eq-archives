<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>drazilyob</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What the HELL IS THIS?<br />
I've been waiting here, killing PHs for 18 hours now...not one imprecator here in the church, and I really, really am getting tired of this quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zhugok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yeah the imprecators on the last lvls suck more than anything i've seen, i was very very lucky to have the one in the church up when i got there, but the one in the lab took me 17 hours of camping to get, 12 hour sesion (was about to go insane) + 2 hour session + 3 hour session and the bastard finally spawned...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Graphyte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The imp in the church took several hours for me, but  the imp in the Laboratory took 3 days of 5 hour camping. I was about to go insane, I am lvl 53 so no exp for me. It was hell, but do not give up. I can't, I had to to the faction work just to start this quest. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Orthogonon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah, the church imp is no joke.  If you get sick of camping him, just pop into dalnir everytime you are in cabilis for whatever.  Dalnir is ALWAYS empty.  It is not like somebody is likely to be camping the imps.  Just make a quick tour and if he is not up, then go to sebilis or something.   Doing it this way makes you think that you are wasting less time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Klissar Silverspine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I couldn't tell you how many times I've seen people sitting at the church or labratory camp for 12-18 hours and never see an imprecator spawn, but on the 2nd floor an imprecator is up.  I have NEVER seen more than 1 imprecator up at a time.  This may be coincidence, but I suspect that if one imprecator is up, you won't see another spawn on the 3rd floor.<br />
<br />
<br />
Try this:<br />
<br />
Go to 2nd floor.  Kill imprecator PH (or Imprecator)<br />
<br />
Go to 3rd floor and kill penkeeper/undead blacksmith PH<br />
<br />
Go to Church - Kill imprecator PH<br />
<br />
Kill the PH for penkeeper/crusader near the water.  Leave crusader up once he spawns.  (I don't know if this was actually a factor, but I saw 4 imprecators in an hour after he spawned)<br />
<br />
Go to Labratory - Kill Imprecator PH<br />
<br />
Do all of this before the PH respawns on the 2nd floor.<br />
<br />
Rinse and repeat.<br />
<br />
In 4 hours in dalnir I was able to get 4 imps on level 2, 3 in the labratory, and 1 in the church.  4 of those 8 spawns were within the last hour.<br />
<br />
I was bored and a friend asked for some help camping the shards.  If you're gonna be there anyway, why not have some fun rather than just sitting and waiting, right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jackkal Darknite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">yea, the church is a beeyach. also my last piece.<br />
<br />
Immediatly got the hammer, hilt took 1 hour, lab took 3 camps totalling around 8 hours. for the church I'm working on my 19th hour total campin that bastage.<br />
<br />
Gonna be soooo glad to get that last damn piece.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zhugok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">During my camp i was also getting paranoid about what if another imprecator is about and there cant be two, so i went back to the entrance and checked all the spawns, i ran through all of them and not one imprecator was up. I realy don't know how the damn imprecators spawn functions but to me it seems like you either have dumb luck (my church imprecator) or you dont (my lab imprecator) hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sepcieulus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I guess I got lucky.<br />
<br />
2nd floor imp was up when I got to Dalnir. Had my drop in about 10 min.<br />
<br />
Camped chapel/statue room continueuslly clearing that area of the 3rd floor for about 4 hours ... nada ... (saw the Imp on the 2nd floor on track twice more during that period)<br />
<br />
Log on the next night ... boom ... blacksmith is up ... got hammer. (go to guild raid)<br />
<br />
Log on last night ... clear the chapel once ... boom imp spawns ... got that piece.<br />
<br />
Move on to lab ... went through 4 spawn cycles in lab (while clearing everything between lab and overseer each time) ... then boom ... imp spawn ... got last piece.<br />
<br />
Did combine .... woot ... Bye Bye Dalnir.<br />
<br />
It would be my guess that these spawns are random. I had a druid friend with me(woot track) ... the imp on the second floor was constantly spawning and despawning. Never saw more than one imp up at a time ... I never bothered with going back to second floor to clear that imp when he spawned though.<br />
<br />
Good luck guys ... <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
 ... I got real lucky I think ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jabbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">61st lvl SK.  Did the First two Imps and the Blacksmith in about 20 minutes.<br />
<br />
I've now been sitting in the Lab for 6 hours...  I think I'm being punished. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ghismonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yep.  Boring time sinks make the baby Jebus cry.<br />
<br />
I spent four six hour days in the church before he spawned.  Anytime a group came into Dalnir, and had someone capable of invising, I offered them 5k for the shard and cleared the church with single pulls so the pops for them would be manageable, then went to camp the lab.<br />
<br />
After I got the church spawn on the 5th day, I spent a relatively short 3hrs in the lab to get his shard.  After I did the combine and turn in, I went to the bazaar and just happened to see a shard for sale for 50pp.  You bet your buns I bought that sucker.<br />
(By the way, anyone remember if the church was sharp or jagged shard?)<br />
<br />
After collecting those six scrolls, I then spent eighteen straight hours in one cell in Droga waiting for one &amp;%@)($U stone key.  This quest is a pain in the ass, but at least it can all be done (up to this point) solo at 55.  Can't stay that for IC.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jabbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Btw- it was a total of about 9 hours in the Lab.<br />
<br />
Has anyone done all the camps in succession?  Kill Shackle room, kill Blacksmith room, kill church PH, then kill Lab and rinse/repeat?  I'm sure if it wasn't that shackle, blacksmith, and church all popped for me after I killed the first PH, I woulda done it.  Might be this is the quickest way to manage all of it.  All you need is a Circlet of Shadows or a quick hand on the invis spell and you could dash all over w/o training yourself.<br />
<br />
And on my server, at least, the only person who was in Dalnir for the whole roughly 10 hour stint aside from me, was a 65 chanter who came in cuz she was bored.  No problem with trains.<br />
<br />
Time to wake up my toon... hims camped in the library in Kaesora.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Caklez Insanly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">on the spawns...yes only one imp can be up at a time.  i got all the pieces except chapel in about 7 hours.  Then while waiting at the chapel for imp to spawn the imp spawned on 2nd floor 5 times in a row.well he dropped the robe of dalnir there for me..after a long long time the imp finally popped in church and i got my last piece...keep checking other spawns to make sure another imp isn't up.<br />
<br />
total time was from 12 midnight one night to 5pm the next day.</div></div><hr />
