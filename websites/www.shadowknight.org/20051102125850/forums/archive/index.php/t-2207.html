<br />
/RUDE!<br />
<br />
Grrr!<br />
<br />
I know...I know...I USED the Search function and found all kinds of nice stuff about the jail in Droga, penkeeper, Stone key, etc., but I guess I'm just here for some moral support.<br />
<br />
I have been working fevereshly on the Khukri's for the Greenmist for the last week.  Sleep has evaded me.  I've learned things about my tolerance for high levels of boredom.  CoM ate 16 hours of my life up.  The only &quot;pleasant&quot; experiences I've had so far have been some great conversations with other SK's working on this and spending only 4 hours in Dalnir and 2 hours in Mistmoore getting the Dagger and Scrolls.<br />
<br />
Now...I sit in Droga...blankly staring at a patch of wall where, I'M TOLD, a Penkeeper drops the only thing keeping me from moving on.  A Stone Key.<br />
<br />
I got there at 10 AM yesterday morning.  I quickly got the bone key and bone necklace key...back to back Penmaster spawns.  I even got a Brass key pretty quickly, making it pretty easy to get in to the Prisoner cell...<br />
<br />
But, as of 4 AM THIS morning...I am missing a Stone Key...<br />
<br />
ARGGG!  Someone please tell me that it WILL drop eventually...to make my life easier...just a sliver of hope is all I need right now to go back down there after work to continue this Masochistic behavior.<br />
<br />
Is it really THAT rare of a drop to not see one drop in 18 hours!?  I was so desperate at the end of the night, that for the last 4 hours I cranked my volume up and took &quot;naps&quot; in 25 minute increments...getting up when I heard myself getting attacked...I finally gave up when I spent 4 minutes fighting one, only to realize that in my dazed state, I forgot to turn on Autoattack...<br />
<br />
*sigh*<br />
<br />
Killed some time running down and picking off the Chief, but I realized I could get a lot of other stuff done in downtime without running down to a mob that has probably a worse chance than the Penkeeper of dropping anything useful.  :)<br />
<br />
Just wanted to check to see if my karma from Dalnir and MM had simply come back to haunt me, or if this sucker is broken.  Obviously, if there are any &quot;tricks&quot; to get him to spawn with the Stone Key, I'd love to hear them....even if they're just myths, having SOMETHING to hope for will keep me from giving up this close to the end.<br />

Tankies.  Yub yub.<br />

<br />
I logged in after work and killed the Penkeeper I was camped next to, cackling gleefully as I noticed the Stone Key in his inventory.<br />
<br />
Ahh...such a relief.  Turned in for LoP Khukri soon after.<br />
<br />
Now...just need to get down and get that Shard in Chardok, and this Trollie's got the Greenmist.<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the help everyone so far.  Great job collecting information here.<br />
