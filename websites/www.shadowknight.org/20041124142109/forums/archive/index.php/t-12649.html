<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dkhar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">With all the battle this game can produce.. why is there no bloodshed ? I would really like a R rated server where you can turn on a blood option and see the red haze of slaughter. Anyone know why SOE has never implemented it ? It can't be due to violent content.. I mean the game is based off of killing everything that moves anyway. Too much graphic work ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Keyan Aubaine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Because it wouldn't bring anything to the game ?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kyfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Generally, games with blood are games where you shoot or stab something once, the thing dies or gets blown apart or whatnot, and it goes away.<br />
<br />
Think about EQ for a moment. Forget for a moment the complete pointlessness of adding blood. Sometimes you'll have 60 people raining arrows, nukes, swords, spears, daggers, and maces on a mob for 20 minutes straight. Do you really want the stupid mob to be spurting blood from 60 different places for 20 minutes straight? <br />
<br />
It would seem kind of ridiculous to me. Even the shorter EXP group fights last a minute or more with lots of hits. Think of the graphical lag. Think of the spam on your melee screen on your typical raid, and imagine each line corresponded to a spurt of blood. Would be madness.<br />
<br />
In summary, terrible idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Not to mention the fact that adding blood and having it look like more than a simple red haze/tint to the mob would require NPC damage models, which is a hell of a lot to add to a game in which such a change would add nothing to(and quite possibly detract greatly from) overall gameplay.<br />
<br />
Bloodbaths in games are eyecandy for particularly stupid and uncreative people.  Use your imagination, it will get you farther.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Imagination.. green blood ? :P<br />
<br />
How about turning off the blood graphs when on a large raid duh. I turn off all my spell graphics when in a group of even 1 other person who cast spells. I'd like to see it when I solo. And yes it is eye candy. I play a virtual computer game, I think eye candy plays a big part, I mean, look at all the &quot;I am so studly look at my pic&quot; threads. If they can make swirling skulls around swords and spell graphics.. then blood is not out of the option. <br />
<br />
I take that last statement a little to heart. I am an artist. I draw quite well and think graphics, any kind of graphic, enhances game play for me. Like the stupid bowing and waving.. what does that bring to the game ? Roleplay ? What would blood bring to the game, roleplay.. a touch of reality ? Are you scared you just might come to realize that you're a mass murderer on a p.c. game ? <br />
<br />
And someone named Groff Gorespiller shouldn't be calling anyone else.. unimaginative..</div></div><hr />

/agree - I hate that I swing my sword in the same arc.. every time.</div></div><hr />

Then multiply it by like 10 for all the other groups in the zone killing shadow wolves and whatnot, and even more for the rest of the heavilly animal-laden zones.<br />

Every animal rights activist in the US would be all over SoE's ass.<br />

The lag theory is weak. You guys do realize that we have a spell book full of spells with stupid fizzy graphics (as do half the classes in Norrath). Blood levels could be turned down, up or off. On a large raid, if you had any sense.. you would turn it off.</div></div><hr />

No.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>shadowblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Bah, I think its a nice Idea, if it was implemented properly. <br />
<br />
But I would much rather, they fix the horrible luclin models, and give them more animations, especially combat ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Phyreheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Hell,  befor I want blood, (with in eq, I think is outa place) fix the damn game as it is.  I play with spell effects oof most the time,  most my models on old world (cause most the luclin ones suck), and am getting tired of the smae ole' animations.  Make the curect graphics more enteractive and more realistic.  Hell,  maybe..... *MAYBE* even a BIT of blood,  but if you want to watch the red stuff rain, either go play Mortal Kombat whtthefuckevernumbertheyareupto, or reload doom and quake back on your PC and play them.<br />

Can we make it so that you have to keep repairing your weapons too?  =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Darkreapyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">could at least show like blood being on your weapon and maybe when the mob hits a certain % it looks like its more beaten up i would say just do this on raid mobs not exp <br />
<br />
Oh and i agree would love to swing different ways <br />
<br />
Cant wait till eq2 when you can chose each part of there body hopefully it wont be too complicated</div></div><hr />

<br />
no. diablo sucks for that exact reason. Fantasy Isn't real. Taking 20 mins to kill something so uber isn't real. Repairing weapons isn't needed. <br />
<br />
Only having to repair non-magic ones would be ok.</div></div><hr />

Maybe like.. if you got the last hit it could be a finishing move or cool pose. A cool finishing move for each different class/race with some BLOOD of course!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
No.  <br />
<br />
Yeah the whole thread pretty much says that already, but thanks for stating the obvious.<br />
<br />
As for blood, it would sure as hell make the game more interesting.  What would be even more interesting is if they actually spent the time to tune the models and the animations so they actually look semi - realistic and attractive.  No female in the world would swing a one hander like these ones do, and iksar males look like their tripping instead of swinging a sword...now comon.  Less time invested in spelling errors and door fixing = more time to fix stuff that we actually give two shits about.<br />
<br />
No new races<br />
No new classes<br />
No new zones<br />
<br />
Fix...the...current...problems...first...<br />
<br />
See, I said that slowly for you slower devs.  Maybe someday you will get the idea.</div></div><hr />

It wouldn't be any more complicated or laggy than spell effects.  You could just turn it off if you didn't want to see it.</div></div><hr />

Amen.  This has got to be in the top 10 for worst ideas ever.</div></div><hr />

Who said I was unhappy ? I don't play console games. Stop making assumptions.</div></div><hr />

EverQuest Online Adventures is a pretty sweet game!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Darknyss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">enough with the LAG already... go out and get a better computer and stop whining about the lag...<br />
<br />
I agree that they need to fix the animation, and perhaps make everything WORK right and efficiently before adding all this NEW crap...<br />
<br />
the blood thing would simply be:<br />
<br />
- We added a blood effect, use /blood on if you want to see it.<br />
<br />
and all the little kids and parents would cry because they accidently set the default to /blood on anyway</div></div><hr />
