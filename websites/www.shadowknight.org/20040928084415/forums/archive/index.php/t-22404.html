<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zachnafein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">It it possible to just kill this bastard without giving him the darkforge armor and 900pp and still get the letter to Duriek?  I mean shit, 900pp is a lot of money considering this is a lvl 51+ quest</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Khat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There are quite a few parts of the quest that result in increasing Truespirit faction, and this is one of them.  My understanding is the sole purpose of giving Kurron the armour and plat is for the faction increase and not as a requisite for him to drop the note.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zachnafein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">So it's possible and the rest is the stuff is just for faction?  Because if that's the case I could save myself the money and the camping darkforge and just hit up a few shaman epic encounters to increase Truespirit faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vaedar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">No, Kurron repops with the note in his inventory after handing him the money and armor.  He does not otherwise have the note.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vaelenu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There are quite a lot of parts of the SK epic which you can skip if you want to, using quests which raise TrueSpirit faction. I won't go in to detail here because it is kinda not kosher, but a quick search should get what you need, or PM if you can't find it.</div></div><hr />

Whew, good thing this post came about after I unknowingly mislead you, Zachnafein.  Hopefully you read it before wasting your time on my inaccuracies.<br />
Now we both know. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zachnafein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ok, thanks for the replies.  I just want to state that this quest bites.  I sure hope that the Epic 2.0 are more balanced out and are worth the time put into them.  I think it's insane some epics can pretty much be soloed in one day while others takes days or months of camping.  FUSOE</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Paradox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">1) Everything you need to know can be found on THIS THREAD (http://www.shadowknight.org/forums/showthread.php?t=7112).<br />
2) Skip Kurron Ni by &quot;running seals&quot; between the Kastanes several times.  Check a search for &quot;seal run&quot; or whatever for info.  Yes, it does work, that's how I got my IC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>krazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">When you attempt to kill Kurron Ni  does he aggro or summon anyone to help <br />
him ? Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kynan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Still need 2 swords. I gave up on my epic a while back unless we need it for epic 2.0 or something goofy like that..<br />
<br />
Yes we got the coolest lookin Epic but damn...</div></div><hr />

<br />
His spawn point is a distance from other aggro NPC's.  You should be fine fighting him here at his spawn point, or pulling him to the water.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>krazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Thanks for the quick reply, I'll be doing my turn ins for the darkforge armor this week , and if I can get some people together I'll try to take him down this weekend ..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Paradox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Dude, skip Kurron Ni.  Save the plat, use the darkforge for Tribute or sell it off.  You could run seals to get enough faction in the time it takes you to try and get people together.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Or better than running seals or wasting items/plat on the turn ins, follow the no faction needed guide posted on this board.</div></div><hr />
