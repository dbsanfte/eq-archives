<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Daywalka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have never, ever been asked to use Aura of Darkness on any raid that I've ever been on, nor any group situation either. The last time I tried to use it, against Mystical Aribitor of Earth, 4 people in my group didn't want it.<br />
<br />
If Aura or Hate/Pain actually debuffed the mobs, though, I'm sure it could be useful in certain situations. But I do NOT want to be a debuff whore, that's Shaman/Enchanter territory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Oagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Some use Aura of Darkness.  I never have.  Hell, people don't even want the 100 attack from AoP.  <br />
<br />
Even though we get a few, we're not really a debuff class.  Shamans, Chanters and mages are the debuffers, and bards could be thrown into that as well, depending on what songs they play.  <br />
<br />
Not to say that in some group situation you might be asked to do something, but there's usually someone in the group that can do it better.  Slow, Tash, Malo, Malosinia, and Malicious Decay are debuffs, and mean ones that can cause some aggro.  We're supposed to be chaining CD so the mob is still more pissed at us than the person that just slowed it by 75%, or dropped is MR by 100.</div></div><hr />

i dont think anyone who isnt an sk knows that we have debuffs =p<br />

or spells other then HT for that matter</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Blackstone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I still use Torrent of Hate in groups over Aura of Hate.<br />
<br />
I occasionally use Aura of Darkness, but really only for the recourse on AE fights like quarm.</div></div><hr />

  <br />
<br />
Sure, they wouldn't mind that ONLY if 100 atk is placed in bard window. ;( That would solve lot of gripes.. Casters/priests got mad that they got useless 100 atk to take over 1 buff slot that they could use for other buff or reserved for hp reg like HOT..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Used to use it more on AE fights like Quarm, but most people are close to max resists now with buffs and songs, so it rarely gets memmed. Never use it for the debuff aspect really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I actually find Aura of Darness very usefull on some raid content. It is not a big time debuff by any stretch of the imagination, but it does manage to do -10 vs all to the mob when it lands, as well as giving +30 vs all to your group.<br />
<br />
As a debuff, there is a small chance that AoD will allow your casters in the raid to land some spells earlier or with less partial resists, but that is a very slight benefit.<br />
<br />
Mostly, the group recourse buff from AoD is the larger benefit, especially against mobs that have multiple resistance based spells. Especially when a bard dies or goes out of range, any +30 to all resist boost certainly helps your odds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Trysbrina67</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Aura of Darkness gets resisted so much (even after a boss has been debuffed) its not funny.<br />
Only real complaint I have about power taps is that people in group can't click them off if they dont need them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kalendrox Grimblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have never, ever been asked to use Aura of Darkness on any raid that I've ever been on, nor any group situation either.  <br />
<br />
I use Aura of Hate sometimes on PoTime Vallon when i'm keeping the adds snared, every little bit helps there~  As far as using it for its resists, no.<br />
<br />
Hell, people don't even want the 100 attack from AoP. <br />
<br />
Thats Aura of Hate, and its 120 something</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Crimson Tears</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">A debuff along the lines of cripple with a recourse to group would be the only thing to ever make me use a spellslot on any debuff spell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You do realize that isn't a debuff, right?<br />
<br />
As a self buff, yes AoP does help.</div></div><hr />

For some reason I thought it used to be DD, but it seems that it is a debuff now...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Darkmourn D`Estrellas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">That's not Aura of Pain, that's Aura of Darkness.  Aura of Pain doesn't debuff anything, nor does Aura of Hate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kahntun Derstand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I use Aura of Hate all the time.  I use Aura of Pain when I'm tanking Time trials and in GoD.  I use Aura of Darkness on Saryn because it literally helps me resist 9 out of 10 of her ae's, rather than 2 of 10.  I assume I would use it against Cazic too, though I have never tried him yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">sorry, got it mixed up with torrents.<br />
<br />
However, it SHOULD debuff the mob, it SHOULD be an upgrade to the torrent line.<br />
<br />
I need a beer. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Rhumba_Kween</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">That's not Aura of Pain, that's Aura of Darkness<br />
<br />
You are correct, thought the discussion was on Aura of Darkness. Sorry</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I use Aura of Darkness in Plane of Time on Saryn, Terris, Cazic, Inny, Bertox(haha takes forever to stick), but I don't use it on Quarm on him I actually use the sorry Resistant /disc/combat ability. <br />
<br />
I use Aura of Darkness for the resists, not the debuff. When I get more upgrades or hit level 70 I probably won't use it at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>NorrynNoir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Some use Aura of Darkness. I never have. Hell, people don't even want the 100 attack from AoP. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
most melee i know will certainly leave a buff slot open for 120 atk or so. i'm really surprise no one you're grouping with would want this. is their atk already so high that this doesn't matter?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>signa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Originally posted by NorrynNoir <br />

<br />
Depending on the zone sometimes I'm put with a warrior to keep an eye on them and grab their mob if they go down. In that case, cast AoH while a war is tanking and prepare to get an earfull. On the other hand, when I'm with rogues i get a lot of 'cast atk already!' You also have to bear in mind that this is going to hit everyone in the group, melee and casters alike. A lot of people just don't like having to leave open a buff slot for something that they cannot click off, and that doesn't last for very long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">It also depends on how many beastlords are around, assuming that the stacking is the same as I remember it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Ashrai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I've used Aura of Darkness for mobs like Arbitor, but again it's risky depending on the makeup of your group. Last thing you want to do is take up someone's buffslot that would be better off with a HoT or whatever. I usually just ask if anyone's getting tight on buffslots.  If no one cares then I'll use it since every little bit helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">If the person is counting on a heal over time, and can't click off some other bullshit buff...you're already fucked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">AoD is a cruel cruel irony.  A highly resistable resist debuff.  I chuckle every time we're in a chromatic/prismatic AE fight and after 12 casts of AoD just give up and swap in another lifetap.  I swear most of my spell sets for bosses these days is 4 lifetaps, ZB, BoD.  Its the only stuff that lands.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Zobb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I used to use Torrent of Hate and Aura of Darkenss on some Time fights when we first got there, but once we got geared up I didnt need it. I use Aura of Pain sometimes during GoD fights depending on the mob, but thats not a debuff.<br />
<br />
Sometimes I use Aura of Hate on DPS fights, but a lot of people dont like the buff slot it uses. Paladins yell at me a lot when I use it, but that just makes me cast it more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Blackeagle Dwimmerlaik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I use toh on most bosses, and aod on the ones that have AEs<br />
<br />
I also use toh over aoh in most situations, it's less mana and less fussy<br />
<br />
aop isn't a debuff, but I use it all the time when tanking, and you should too. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">AoD is another great argument for blowing a fuckton of cash at the casino for HEB's...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Darkenesis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I would like our current spells to be debuffs.<br />
<br />
I also wouldn't mind getting another line of spells that was debuffs either.  Maybe it's just me.  I'd like to contribute more to a raid than just dps and offtanking occassionally.<br />
<br />
Not something I'd crusade for, but if the option was given to toss a debuff on the mob to lower their dps, and up the raid's dps, I'd take it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>aress</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">debuffs are ineffective.  Darkness gets mostly resisted on mobs it would count.  Hate and Pain do not debuff.<br />
<br />
I parsed asystole (AC debuff) at level 60 a long time ago, and was not able to reliably reproduce an increased dps rate vs. controls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Chania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Personally I lament the loss of our &quot;debuffs&quot;. I liked to pretend that Torrent was taking a meaningful amount of ATK away from the mob, and that the AC debuff I had increased the guild's DPS by a significant amount. This was probably false, however. Now, we've lost that part of our desription, where the mobs we fought grew weaker and we grew stronger as the fight went on. I would welcome a MEANINGFUL debuff/buff that would make a difference.<br />
<br />
I stress meaningful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Zero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Screw the casino, I use stalking probes. 5 charge right click instant cast eye of zomm, like 20pp each.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Kahntun Derstand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">So you carry around 4 10 slotters full of them?  I get asked to cast eyes all the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Qoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Asystole stacks with Shadow Vortex and with these could largely help in grind groups i believe?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>nezzka is bad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I would like a debuff that reduced mob dps by like a tiny bit, it would fix our tanking a little bit in groups, but still then on raids we would just debuff while warriors own stuff. Would help the single group stuff though, say reduces mobs dps by 2%, or something stupid like that</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Belyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">There was a time when i would cast all the sk debuffs on raid mobs, but they nerfed them not to stack and to rarely land.  Dont expect them to undo that, as they dont want to have to design encounters with that in mind.  Alone they meant nothing but back then if you used all 15 buff slots of a mob for debuffs it made quite a noticeable difference.  That caused a whole nother problem having to ban the use of dot spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Zero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">By the time you could get asystole and SV off on a single group mob, it would be dead.<br />
<br />
And no, I only carry around one 10-slotter full. Screw casting them for anyone else.</div></div><hr />
