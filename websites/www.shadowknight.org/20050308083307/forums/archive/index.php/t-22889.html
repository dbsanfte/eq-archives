I've seen this multiple times lately, and it's annoying and useless. If you say &quot;I camped x&quot; or &quot;I soloed x&quot; you have to provide a Magelo link or some description of your gear. There's a massive difference if you soloed it with 5k unbuffed, 7k unbuffed, or 10k unbuffed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ninaelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've camped maybe 5 hours total here yet to see the overlord, first time was a 3hourish group there came back the next day for about 2 hours. seen one pop of grave lord who was up when the 2nd group got to camp no overlord.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, if you spent any amount of time there, you would know that the named DEs there are tiers 3 and 4.<br />
<br />
My group of friends has about 7 4th gems, 10 3rd gems and a few MQs banked for various arch-types.  If anyone has question about the Overlord, shoot me a tell at tunare.ciraq<br />

Best of luck</div></div><hr />

Set up camp in the landing between floors in her little house, mobs split fairly easily without snare, 30 minute respawn.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Moonana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">cheers buddy, appreciate that</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Valarkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The PH's in PoH are all the same mob type...ie in tier 4 a warrior will always be the PH for Warlord, etc.<br />
<br />
The Warlord is snareable and slowable and doubles for around 800.<br />
<br />
There is 1 mob downstairs in his building, and 3 mobs upstairs including his spawn.<br />
<br />
There is a roamer nearby the building which you should clear, and you can also clear the downstairs mob in the adjacent building which houses the SK named PH to give yourself room.<br />
<br />
The upstairs room with the Warlord PH is pretty cake to break, as the stairs down break caster LoS and staggers casters from the melee, ie if you snare the Warlord or PH its not difficult to work him out of the room.  The additional advantage is that even at 65 the aggro range in tier 4 hate is surprisingly small.<br />
<br />
If even a casual SK, ie about 1400 to 1500 ac and 5 to 6k unbuffed hes easily duo'able with a shammie without issue.  Just make sure while breaking your shammie doesn't creep up on you into aggro range and you get a Q or such prior to engaging and slow.<br />
<br />
Spawns like most in EQ run in streaks but hes not exceedingly rare, about 1 in 8 or 1 in 10 from my experience in the zone while hunting for Marsinger drops some time back.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps<br />
<br />
Edit: Forgot to add the Paci works on all the mobs in tier 4 except the named rather handily, so it adds additional ease in breaking spawns for different group types.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Thaln V'Orro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Anyone have better drop information on the essence of hate?  Ive killed multiple named in tier 2-4 including Mistress of Malevolence and Overlord and have yet to see the essence.  Its getting to be an extremely long camp and very tiring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The guy who previously said he soloed it was at 8k hps unbuffed. Would it be feasible to solo with my gear?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Iosif_McCloud</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I never said i &quot;solo'ed&quot; i said &quot;i camped&quot; .. Solo.. i probly could solo them but the down time would be to much for my likeings<br />
<br />
<br />
I have a 66 Druid i Box who has no problem healing me... for you i would say get a friend to help ...   a Shammy would be the Best... you guys can Due damn near everything in the zone.. i belive a 60-61 shammy can slow everything up there but the golums.. once thay are slowed thay are uber gimp<br />
<br />
Yeah my Mango is wrong ATM i just piced up a few items and not really intersted in updateing till thay fix all the damn bugs with the HP</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Xyros</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Anyone else having issues getting the Essence of Hate to drop? I farmed for 14 hours straight in Hate this last sunday spawning 5 named from Tier 4 and not a single Drop. The nights before also killed the Mistress of Malevolence with no drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Iosif_McCloud</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">From my observations thay Nerfed the hell out of the short cut.. Befor the Last few patches there was a druid on my server that was camping the named for MQ stuff, he said that he was gettin them about 40% of the T5 named would drop them... now he hasnt seen any of them drop.. i have not been up there since 2 patches ago.. ben to busy on my EPic to worry abou twinking my Druid</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Ilvai Oloth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I thought it was going to be a long and enduring camp, when a group of people had been camping there for over 8 hours and had spawned 4 Overlords and 3 other named and hadn't produced a single essence, but... they left, and the very next set of mobs had an Overlord, and she dropped it.  I think I spent more time collecting the people to go to hate than making it to the camp and killing her.  Oh well, best of luck on the RNG.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">We kept 8 named PHs down in Tiers 3 and 4.  Got 2 of Dread Lords, and one Overlord in 8hrs.  Overlord dropped essence.  A guildy was up camping for Marsinger quest pieces the next day, Overlord spawned, and he dropped another.  Then about 3 hrs later, Overlord spawned again, and again he dropped essence.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Zobb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Did this guy get beefed up after patch or is he still an 800 hitter?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>nytemyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">nothing changed. Still easy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Bergak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Recently did it and it was easy with SK, cleric, bard, 2 magicians.  Dropped it on first spawn.  We were there for 2-3 hours.</div></div><hr />
