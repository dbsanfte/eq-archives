                My friend and I were on the other day and he was worried about faction.My home is Ogguk(im still liked there)The elves of Kelethin and felwithe are cool with my ogre.My real stomping grounds are Luclin and POK....should I even worry about who likes me in Freeport?Qeynos?Kaladim?The way I see it is,Its either them or me.I could care less.Ping fuzzle cutter got outta line and dis respected the ogres,called me smelly or something...SOOoooo I had to whack him!!  I take no mouth from an NPC.I let them all know Im not playing with a full deck,and I find it interesting to play be a wanted and hated Ogre world wide.<br />
                                 Any thoughts?<br />

Trash away.</div></div><hr />
