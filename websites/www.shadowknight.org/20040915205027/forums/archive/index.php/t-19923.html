<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kelefane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Where is this Drake house located? Ive been thinking about going through the pain of killing Drakes for my hide now since I got my Soul Leech from Fear. Soul Leech just sort of fell into my lap, was on a p/u CT raid and was the only SK there and it went to me by default. Wasnt thinking about doing the SK epic until I got that sword from Fear. The location of this Drake House where the Broodmaster spawns would be much appreciated. Ive heard its next to where Maestro's house is? in this general area? I know the Book of souls is directly across from the Maestro's as your standing on the stairs facing that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Saruton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This map (http://crysagen.chedrock.com/seofon/Hate_b_Tier1.gif) shows exactly where the broodmother is located ... though just any drake can drop the hide and not only those in and around that spot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kelefane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks man! Much appreciated!!! I knew any Drake could drop it. But was just thinking that since theres always a Drake there as the PH there would be less downtime searching the zone for the Drakes. Staying in one spot and chain pulling just seems so much easier to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ganodoar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for the link of the map as well. That will really help since I wasn't sure where some of the named were. That is good to know there are a few named near the drake house. I only knew where the broodmaster, lord of ire, coercer, and magi p'tasa were located. My wizard friend told me lord of loathing has the 2nd highest chance of dropping the Shattered Emerald of Corruption (Inny being a guaranteed drop). Good luck with the hide as well.</div></div><hr />
