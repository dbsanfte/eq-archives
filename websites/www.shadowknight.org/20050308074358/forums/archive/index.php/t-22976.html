<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vandil_TM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So i finished the Pre- 1.5 since i didnt have IC and i did the turn in to Ritkan or whatever got the mini innuruks voice and i went to the lady in pok..... no she hates my freaking guts or something cause i cnat get her to talk to me for the life of me but last night i decided it was a glitch and it would fic it self later....WRONG--- i went to PoN after the wailing sister and couldnt get her to attack me no matter what i did which was about 10 minutes before the patch so my guess was that because it was so close to patch time they wer elocking anyhting they were changing down and i was boned.....well here i am today in the exact same POS spot anyone got any ideas how to unscrew myself =P?  God only knows GM's wont help...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vandil_TM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">it got changed.... kinda.  it would seem u dont just hail her now u give her the freaking sword to start the quest..... i was VERY worryed about giving it to her i didnt feel like doing it all over again lol... but i did and she started talking to me... kinda she told me to tlak to Librains but till wont respond to hails +P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Daerkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sienn wouldn't respond to my hails after completing the initial steps - I turned in the sword Ritald gave me and she talks (no response prompts), saying talk to Grand Librarian Maelin. Did not receive the sword back and no confirmation of receiving any type of flag - Maelin does then continue and tell me to collect the Murkglider Egg.<br />
<br />
It seems a good bit different from the walkthrough, but assuming others have found this to be the case also?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>VengerMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">correct, she takes the sword and does not return it to you until you complete the quest up to the Wailing Sister.  at this point she gives you the sheathed IV back and sends you on to see Gilina Yilzior.<br />
<br />
i too was freaked out when i turned it in to her and recieved nothing back but instructions to go see the librarian about a book.  i have since then completed every step save the final kill.  have faith, the quest is not broken.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Belligeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I was gonna hand it in, but was too chicken lol, I talked to librarian and he gave me the quest for the egg anyway.</div></div><hr />
