<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Diabolus99</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is it posible to do this quest with iksar illusion potions rather than factioning up?<br />
im amiably in iksar illusion to the trooper who takes the bone chips. i heard you only need indifferent for the quest? so if i bought 10 dose iksar potions. gather everything i needed for all quests..then illusioned up and ran about doing them, would that work?<br />
<br />
cheers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Daywalka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm maxed out to all but Necros, to which I'm still scowling. An iksar illusion got me up to indifferent I believe. So I would say yes. Just don't do any turn ins until you have just about everything you need, unless you want to buy alot of potions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lynya Shaddowfury</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">When I got to dubious with Crusaders I was a bit irritated at bonechips, scavenger knives, and Veksar weapons, so I got the illusion potions too. That brought me to ally with Troopers, amiable with Kotiz, warmly (iirc) with Crusaders, and dubious to Residents. I did the same, gathered everything I could ahead of time and did as many turn ins as I could. Worked great. I can't remember if only indiff was good enough- esp for the Tracker Azeal and Alchemist Granika- used potions there too to be safe. Used a total of 6 illusions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Puurrdy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Illlusion was the only thing that let me complete it, he ate my stuff before that without it and maxxed out faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Senladar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Just some notes here. As a human SK I was scowls to Crusaders and Legion of Cabilis. However, with Ikky Illusion with no faction work I was indifferent to Crusaders and amiable to LoC. Amiable to Crusaders of Greenmist is needed for this quest. With Illusion I proceeded to turn in 8 10 slot packs full of bonechips to trooper Mozo. This got me up with Illusion to kindly with Legion and amiable with Crusaders. I had no problems with turnins using illusion whatsoever.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lilharm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm up to amiable with Illusion and completed all of Pennance quest, but sk guildmaster won't accept turn in for newbie wepon.  So more bone chips I guess, /sigh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fallgore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yes, here is what I think you should do:<br />
First off, get a Potion/Mask (clicky from Inven.) Iksar one<br />
<br />
Then:<br />
Look up on Illia's/Alakhazams for quests in Cabilis for newbs that are EASY!<br />
So what you do now is get 9 empty bag slots (no more than 9 in your inven.).<br />
From there, you collect the quest items in advance! (yes, so that means, if the guy wants Bone Chips x10, buy 180 Bonechips or whatever to hand in)<br />
Hand in Quest items w/Ikky Illusion until you are Ally faction. (yes, that means repeating it over and over)<br />
<br />
With this in hand, you will have good faction, and just repeat this until Ally faction, and then you'll be happy.<br />
<br />
I think this shouldn't take more than 4 Hours tops (on the newbie collecting part) - You can farm your BC's or buy them in the Bazaar (some ppl should sell them).<br />
<br />
So I hope this helps :D</div></div><hr />
