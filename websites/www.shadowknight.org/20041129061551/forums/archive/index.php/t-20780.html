<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rocza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings,<br />
<br />
A friend of mine with a 63 Druid is on vacation and has allowed me to two box her Druid with my Sk (ungrouped, so all the xp will be going to my Sk).<br />
<br />
Essentially, I'm looking for a good, SAFE, xp spot, as I've never two-boxed before and I will be physically hurt if I get my friend's Druid killed. Plat would be nice too, but is not necessary.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

Poj is no adds unless you fighting and easy to zone out</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>eansdad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I would agree. PoJ is your best bet just camp one of the zone outs and single pull. Easy exp to 55.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jodgrim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Nurga has equal or better xp and much beter loot than PoJ and there are always fewer retards in Nurga due to it being in the middle of nowhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Oldin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I agree with the Nurga comment. <br />
<br />
The zone has a 14 percent experience modifier and with this duo you should be able to hunt anywhere in the zone. MOBs do not see invisible.<br />
<br />
As a bonus you'll be gaining faction in Chardok which can be helpful if you've got a cleric friend who needs their epic piece. (and for the Chardok Ring quest.) MOBs drop up to diamonds (where I'm hunting) and I rarely leave the zone without several hundred plat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Nurga is ton of exp and money but you can get adds<br />
<br />
You've never 2 boxed and haven't listed any experience with playing a druid.<br />
<br />
With those assumptions in mind<br />
<br />
The druid will only be used as a healer, buffer, and root parker for the ghetto CC.<br />
<br />
The heals will get a ton of agro and since you don't have a slower you'll need heals frequently, so keep agro holding in mind when picking your spell line up and use your SK to snare as you don't want druid getting too much agro.<br />
<br />
Don't use the druid pet, it's green as shit and will get killed instantly and get druid agro.<br />
<br />
Look through zone and you'll see several ramps where you'll be out of agro range and only have to deal with wanderers every 10-12 minutes, most of the zone is on a 12 minute pop timer.<br />
<br />
Find what are PH's for named, park near there and enjoy, the loot will either be upgrades for you or sold in bazaar for 200-2000pp (with a few higher and extrememly rarer exceptions like the fists that I've been offered 20K for)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just be sure to pull with something low aggro like a low level nuke or dispell.</div></div><hr />

I learned this on my shaman...<br />
<br />
use the lowest possible dd spell to pull (like 5 damage flame something), and you'll get fewer adds regardless of level difference.</div></div><hr />
