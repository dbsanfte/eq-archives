<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gordrach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings fellow Knights.  I just did a search for &quot;raid&quot; and came up with only one answer (LDon Raid), so I'd like to pose a questions to you (if the questions has been posed before, as I suspect it likely has, please feel free to throw the n00b tag at me and include a link for my sorry arse).  What is our main role during a raid?  I've focused entirely on AC/HP to this point (I'm level 52), as we have spells that can draw aggro sufficiently to make DPS but a secondary goal for me.  The way I've perceived my role in groups so far, I hold aggro with my spells and tank tank tank.  The AC/HP focus helps me not be a mana-drain for the healers in the group.  My guild is going to raid Nadox (if he's up) then moving on to Hate's Fury.  I would like to ask you for your insight on what my role should be during this event.  I plan on being my usual aggro-fiend tank, is there anything else I should focus on?  (I do plan on bringing some coffins to summon corpses if needed since we don't have a Necro in our guild).  Any and all thoughts are greatly appreciated.  Thank you very kindly for your time and insight.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gordrach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Off-tank: Makes sense.  Our guild is light on tanks (we have Rangers who have to tank at times, poor clerics) so I foresee myself taking a hell of a beating on Saturday (a notion I welcome with open arms).  We have a 65 monk, a 64 Bard, and a 65 Paladin.  They have been the ones (historically) to pull when we go out and group, though I've no reservations about pulling myself.<br />
<br />
Loot whore: Since it's a guild raid (our first) it will definitely be NBG.  :D <br />
<br />
Thank you both for your feedback.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Your role depends on the make up of your raid, plain and simple.<br />
<br />
Is everyone your level?  Does everyone have the same gear levels?  Do you have more or fewer knights than warriors?  Does the encounter require special tactics (off tanking, special aggro concerns, need for kiting, need for higher mitigation/defensive disciplines, need for fearless)?<br />
<br />
You're thinking in a group mentality, which is understandable, considering what I'll presume your normal game experience has been like up to now.  However, this doesn't work in raids.  You don't have a normal group; you have several groups working together, and some jobs you can double (or quadruple) up on, some you can't.  Your raid only needs one Main Assist.  Presuming that because you wear plate armor and you usually fill that role for your group isn't doing what's best for the raid, especially if there are special circumstances around which the raid strategy revolves.<br />
<br />
In short, you don't decide what your raid role is, and neither do we.  We know what we're capable of, but if you're going to be going on raids you need to learn early that the raid leader should be the one calling the shots, good or bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gordrach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Groff, what you wrote makes perfect sense.  You are correct, I've not taken part in any raids so my mentality is still geared toward a group mentality.  I know that we will have some very nicely equipped lvl 65 tanks at the raid (Paladins and Warriors, I am the sole SK).  I will wait in anticipation to see what transpires.  Thank you for your insight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>StPatrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">As the highest level tank in guild, I'm usually tanking on raids. There are other pallies who are close to 65 as well, but pallies are considered as better off-tanks than SK for simple reason - they have root and stuns (for root parking or waiting for chanter to mezz adds).<br />
Also at least my guild only uses warriors for tanking when their defensive skills required, because of common thought that warriors can't hold aggro as good as SK.<br />
Also a lot of other roles as was said before, depending on situation, like pulling. No monk, no high level chanter present on raid and need to pull a room of 4+ mobs, the only option is SK to either pet pull or snare-split (I personally prefer pet pulling if Jabober can stay alive  :( )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>cames</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you have a &quot;bunch of level 65&quot;  Warriors and Paladins and perhaps monks/bards as well, your main role will be to provide whatever DPS you can and try not to die.<br />
<br />
A level 65 will mitigate damage much better from the same mobs even in the exact same equipment due to level (you said you were level 52).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Oagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">For Spiritseer Nadox:  <br />
<br />
You're going to either be a MT, or an Off-tank.  His room is occupied by about 8-10 other troll mobs that for your level are going to have a ton of hp's and hit fairly hard.  Once they're slowed, they're cake.  Re-pop in the room is pretty fast, though, so you're going to need more than yourself handling them.  I would suggest 3-4 off tanks dispatching them (this is based upon a guild with your similar levels).  <br />
<br />
For Nadox:  Hits about 400's.  For a lvl 50's guild, you're going to want some clerics on him.  I can't remember his dot, but I believe it's MA only (person on top of the hate list).  He'd be a pretty good test for a 50's guild, actually.<br />
<br />
You don't need coffins for Nadox.  Invis works everywhere, except in the undead area, and IVU works there.  If you're going in through the Luggald Temple in Gunthak, you're almost to Nadox's room.  If you've got a caster with improved invis, they can CR the whole damn raid.  There's sort of a safe hall at the zone-in of Nadox from the temple.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>yuggoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">For your first raid, sit back, do what you are told, and watch how things are done.  It is very different from operating in a group.  I seem to end up pulling as often as not - not many monks in our guild, and we have plenty of higher level tanks.  Even when I am not an assist I usually keep a snare up just in case of a runner, or to grab aggro in a bad situation, like to kite a mob so people can camp out.  Otherwise, as has been said, focus on damage and not dieing - use your lifetaps to minimize the need for a cleric if there are any aoe's, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gordrach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Thank you very kindly everyone for your responses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Eggborn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">One of the reasons I love this class so much is our able to serve many functions.  We are much more than just tanks.<br />
<br />
I serve as main puller, but often I assist our monk on difficult splits by tagging or pulling when he dies.  If I am assisting, I also do reports on the status in camp for the monk.<br />
<br />
I serve as main tank, but rarely.  We have always had warriors or pallys with slightly more time in than me.  Never the less, many raids require more than one main tank, one for trigger mobs, one for trash, one for big guys.  I am on trash and trigger mobs most of the time.  Keeps the raid from dying as we work our way to the big guy (aggro again is the reason)<br />
<br />
I serve as off tank or tank mez.  Works great, since we get aggro so fast.<br />
<br />
I serve as summoner.  There are quite a few raid situations in which people need summoned as part of the raid.<br />
<br />
I serve as kiter.  Some raids require a class that can take more damage to kite for crowd control.  Also helpful on a wipe to train the mobs away from the camp for faster recovery.<br />
<br />
I serve as a spotter for break ins or after wipes.  If I am not in another vital role that kills me easily I can fd at camp and let people know when things are clear.<br />
<br />
I serve as extra damage.  With the low resist life taps, fear resistance, feign death and finally a Harm Touch I can often be the last alive on a raid to put in that vital kill shot.  Then I go kite adds or spot again.<br />
<br />
AA's:<br />
defensives for hps/damage avoidance<br />
fast horse cause it just saves ya time<br />
harm touch, this includes spell casting fury to crit on them</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gordrach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Thank you Eggborn for posting this insight into the roles you've played for your guild.  <br />
<br />
Our raid went fairly well.  Nadox wasn't up so we skipped right through to Hate's Fury.  Though we didn't get the Captain to spawn (lack of planning, despite my suggestions to the contrary during the week preceding the raid) we did get some valuable practice working in teams, and two decent drops.  We fought our way from the Gunthak zone-in through Nadox to Hate's Fury.  Once we boarded Hate's Fury we fought our way in for almost 2-3 hours, then worked our way back out.  After we made our way back out to Gunthak, we went to Burning Woods and took out Ixblat (spelling?) for on of our Cleric's epic.  By the time we got around to Ixblat we were down to 10 people but still had no trouble taking him down.  He dropped what the Cleric needed, and he also dropped the Cloak of Flames (36% haste).  This is where it got ugly (The raid was set up as NBG since it was guild only, but the cloak was given to a 2-boxed alt when there were 2 mains present for whom the cloak would have been a great upgrade).<br />
<br />
I'm happy to say that we did not have a single death during 4-5 hours of raiding.  Though we did not exactly push ourselves to our limits, we did some good work.  Not too shabby for our first raid.<br />
<br />
Our guild-leader is a Paladin, and he did all the pulling.  I did mostly DPS work with the occasional off-tank as needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Murgutk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Well, just to add a wee little idea.. I'd just like to say that any form of Voice ya have Voice of Terris, Voice of Thule when ya get higher... Always a good idea to keep this cast on the MT who will normally be a warrior, and as we SK's know, they can be somewhat weak in holding aggro so therfore need ALL the help they can get. Anyway just a thought and I know your only 52 right now but that is one of my main rolls besides dps and others mentioned previously. Good luck in future raids.<br />
<br />
Murgutk 65 SK on Tunare server</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Arikash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">That's really shitty about the cloak, I'd be horrendously pissed off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Eberan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Someone is seriously misunderstanding NBG if the CoF was given to a boxed twink. Write down some rules regarding loot distribution ASAP and stick to them, loot distribution is the thing that destroys 99% of all new guilds and tbh, not a whole lot of guilds survive growing up. Point systems are popular with most high end guilds. However, you can speed up your progress by making sure you key classes gets geared first (sadly this does not mean sks). But making sure your warriors have some proper armor and HP gear and make sure you clerics have proper mana regen and mana pools.<br />
<br />
Also, since your a new guild, you might as well start training your pullers (no pun intended). Its not a paladins job to pull and he should leave that for the classes with FD imo.<br />
<br />
Now with that out of my system.<br />
<br />
As you've already seen, we can do a multitude of things on raids, sk is prolly one of the most adaptable classes. <br />
<br />
We excel when it comes to really hard pulls/splits because of our CoS, Darkness, Harmshield etc. Imo a good sk can pull anything a monk can and then some.<br />
<br />
We're pretty good at saving casters with our ability to generate aggro quickly.<br />
<br />
We dont have &quot;bad&quot; damage output. Its not great, but its not the worst either.<br />
<br />
We rock at corpse recovery, summons, locate, CoS, FD, Harmshield all come in handy again.<br />
<br />
Offtanking, were prolly one of the only classes that can offtank a mob well, without damaging it (in some situations, this is helpful) normal offtanking isnt a problem either.<br />
<br />
We're pretty self sufficient in regards to healing on raids, our different lifetaps and procs make sure of that.<br />
<br />
At higher levels, we can beef up pretty much any group quite well with zevfeers and our aura's.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I prolly left something out but those are some of my more common roles.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>StPatrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I have further question to SK community here, actually advice maybe. I believe this belongs to SK role so posting it here.<br />
<br />
The situation in my guild is like that: We have two level 65 tanks (me and a pally) and I was MT on all guild raids so far - ability of SK to keep aggro is damn good. Guild is family style guild btw. Now we coming to point when we got 2 our warriors to level 55-56 - the point when they get their defensive ability (~50% damage mitigation). My question - would it be better switching MT to warrior instead of me, since he can tank boss mobs easier than SK? Now boss mobs I'm talking about are not from PoP or GoD, I mean mobs like Vindi, Ixiblat for example. I personally don't have any chance with 7khp raid buffed against unslowable Vindi who hit for 700 and quads and I will be dead in 14 seconds. Now I hear people saying we should let warrior tank it, because with defensive up, warrior will get hit by 350 only. <br />
So what you think, should I step back (grrrrr) and let warrior be MT or keep MT for myself? 55 WAR against 65 SK (check my magelo to see AAs or whatever can help you on advice)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Any 7k tank should be able to tank Ixiblat and Vindicator just fine.  With just two clerics you can have a complete heal landing every 5 seconds, which should be more than enough healing.  Something that will make it itself apparent if you do try it with the 55 warrior, is that level has a huge impact on tanking ability.  A 65 shadow knight should be able to outtank any 55 warrior, really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Arikash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Yeah, I'd stay MT until the warrior gets up to lvl 63ish, even if he is uber twinked and has 7khp buffed like you, just because you'll be a stronger tank than he is etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I second the motion that you (or the 65 Pally) should continue to MT. At some point the warrior's /discs and innate mitigation will catch him up to you in terms of being able to deal with damage, but it'll be a few levels.<br />
You can easily test this any time you want, though: take yourself, the warrior, and healer to any mob that cons dark blue to the warrior. Let the warrior tank it. Have the healer track the mana cost of keeping the warrior up. Then you tank the next spawn. At this point it will be pretty clear that you cost less mana to keep standing. I'd imagine the margin will be pretty wide even when the warrior is 56-60.<br />
Whoever is tanking, eventually your clerics do need to work out a heal rotation. You can tank the mobs you mention now, but you need some coordinated healing on the part of the rest of your raid. Even when the warrior is ready to do the tanking, he'll need the same thing, though.</div></div><hr />
