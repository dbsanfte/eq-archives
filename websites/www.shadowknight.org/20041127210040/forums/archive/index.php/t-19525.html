<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ok, I will try to explain my thoughts, even though my writing skills are not as good as my mathematical skills...<br />
<br />
I am a casual player which means I play 4-5 a week for about 1.5 hours each time. This is usually during the week after work, and on rare occasion a early am weekend visit.<br />
<br />
Since my gaming time is limited I do not like to spend my time on-line farming supplies or farming plat whacking green stuff.<br />
<br />
75% of the time I can get a LDoN group if I know I have about 1.5-2 hours. However, if I know I only have about an hour I am reluctant to try and get in a group since I would have to bail during an adventure.<br />
<br />
For a while I left EQ and decided to give SWG a try. SWG has many problems which I will not list here but the mission concept was great for the casual player. I could log on, get 2 missions, go blow something/someone up, then camp all within 45 minutes. When I was on for a longer period I could go find a nice group.<br />
<br />
I wish there was something to that effect in EQ...something that takes 30-45 minutes...gives you xp and a chance at a reward (item, cash, adventure points, etc.). Of course, it would take ALOT of missions to ever achieve a good prize or generate ALOT of points, but the casual (again, under 1 hour at a time) player could get home, do something fun on-line (even if solo or a 2 man group), then camp and deal with their real-life responsibilities.<br />
<br />
Then when I did have the longer periods of time on line I could go get a group and attack the big stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nikumu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Heh, I'll echo your sentiments C.<br />
<br />
I have always been a pretty time limited player, and recently its gotten worse.  I did SWG for a while on a friends account and really enjoyed the fact that I could log in, complete some missions for $$ and XP, then log.  I spend most of my time anymore on EQ doing quick farms for some $$, because I don't have the time to do LDoN or even to set up for a decent solo camp.<br />
<br />
The quick solo missions in SWG were very attractive and have tempted me to go ahead and get my own account.<br />
<br />
The trouble is that EQ has some stuff like that, but they all top out in the mid teens.  That and quick casual xp tops out around 25 or so...probably why I have a whole slew of 25th level characters across 5 or 6 servers.<br />
<br />
Sum it up:  Give the truely time-restricted players something to accomplish that makes their $12.95 a month worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tukka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I can imagine there are difficulties in balancing out what you propose... giving casual players and/or solo players something worthwhile to do, without detracting too much from the allure of finding a group and doing that when you can.  From what I've heard, SWG doesn't quite manage to successfully pull off that precarious balance.<br />
<br />
I'm sure it's a tough nut to crack, but I feel it's the one last thing that EQ needs to implement to have broad appeal to all player types--raiders, single groupers, and more casual gamers/soloers.  Of course they they'd still have to keep churning out new content for the single groupers and (especially) raiders who have seen and conquered everything there is to do for their playstyle.<br />
<br />
Of course, there are some who will say that this is a social/group game and that if you're a casual gamer or someone who prefers soloing, EQ just isn't the game for you.  But I still think it's a worthy goal.  And most people have trouble finding groups every now and then, it would be nice to have something worthwhile to do in the meantime (besides browsing your class forums or playing /gems), something that preferably you could stop doing at a moment's notice in case you do manage to find a group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ZarrosLivinglight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There was something like this on Horizons.  The way it worked though, each character could only do a quest once, and they were basically either a variation on &quot;Kill X number of mobs&quot; or &quot;Fed Ex&quot; type quests where you had to run all over delivering messages, package, and what-have you.    Experience for them was pretty good, and when time-limited, or LFG, they were fun.  For the time, group experience was better of course, but it was a good option for traditional non-soloists.<br />
<br />
The biggest thing they would have to do is fix the NPC dialogue/quest system.  The largest impediment to doing old world quests was trying to figure out the often incredibly cryptic clues the NPCs gave, or worse just trying to guess the random sequence of words and keywords to trigger the next step.  While Horizons had its problems (and why I stopped playing it) the quest system was a nice balance of &quot;just enough&quot; information to not face the choice of frustration vs. spoiler sites, and not being so easy as to be trivial.<br />
<br />
Even cooler, tie them to old world city factions, with class-and-level appropriate rewards.  Stay loyal to your home town, and you could theoretically quest your way up to at least the low-50s in a mix of solo and group quests (solo quests should be xp only, no gear rewards past newbie armor and such) and then be ready to move on to the raiding game in some pretty decent gear potentially, at least for the level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I am wondering if that new &quot;Tribute System&quot; is an attempt to do exactly what you are suggesting. Everyone have been extremely quiet about the tribute system, so maybe there is something there.<br />
<br />
Assist your hometown by killing bandit x or delivering a message to a dangerous area. Slowly build up &quot;faction points&quot; with the hometown and get xp along the way too.<br />
<br />
hmmm, too bad that NDA is in effect. :)</div></div><hr />
