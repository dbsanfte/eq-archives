<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zmabik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been tanking and soloing for 24 levels and my defense is 37..does anyone have any ideas on how i can raise it? My shaman at the same level had 3x my defense.<br />
<br />
It seems kinda retarted to me because I am always tanking if im grouped, and when im not grouped im soloing. The skill just won't go up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Burek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Group more...or spend money on the pts to raise skill</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wozan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Defense skill-ups are gained in inverse proportion to your AC.  If you have great AC (i.e. twink/PL/3rd toon) you will gain Defense slowly.  If you have crustacean shell armor battling yellow mobs you will get Defense skill-ups like mad.<br />
<br />
Defense will even out eventually.  Don't bother worrying about it.  You can't train it with a trainer.  The only reliable way to train it is to take off half your armor, grab a healer you trust, and pull yellow mobs until your healer is oom.  Defense++</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sithanator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Also try tanking multiple npcs at once. That always seems to increase the rate at which my defense was raising.<br />

<br />
Make sure you have int or wis 100+.  If it's around 60 you will rarely see a skillup.<br />
<br />
Dex is for wepaon skill ups.  But Defense might fall under dex.  I dunno for sure.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I believe INT/WIS only affects non-combat skills (spell skills [evoc, abj, etc.], tradeskills, languages, etc.).<br />
<br />
DEX is responsible for all offensive skillups (weapon skills, etc.).<br />
<br />
AGI is responsible for the defensive skillups.  But don't sweat trying to get this stat up high.  Seriously, just keep tanking and keep getting hit.  It will raise soon enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kromglon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ive been locked in at 186 defense for 2 levels now. It doesnt seem to move on dark blues at all. I never seen a skill rise so slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Meriboh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Silly question but…<br />
Are you fear kiting?<br />
If you are, obviously, your skill won’t go up.<br />
