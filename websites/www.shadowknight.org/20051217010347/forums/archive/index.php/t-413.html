<br />
In just fooling around last night after I dinged, I ended up with:<br />
<br />
Lifedraw<br />
Disease Cloud<br />
Siphon Strength/Scream of Hate/Scream of Pain<br />
Engulfing Darkness<br />
Feign Death<br />
Heat Blood<br />
Gather Shadows<br />
Pet Spell / Buffs<br />
<br />
Wondering if people have other &quot;must have&quot; spells memmed than I do.  Since I just dinged, I know there will be quite a bit of trial and error.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">velourea</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 09:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i'd switch out heat blood with vampiric embrace, but that's just me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Naelael Sang'Noir</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 10:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Honestly at this point I would switch out your pet spell. At that lvl it's damage is really a non-issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Garila</div><div class="date">04-04-2002, 12:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would say gather shadows and the pet spells should be moved out because they are more situational . . . invis is needed alot more for travel than every moment interactions and pets have their time and place and then move scream of hate and scream of pain into those slots if you like using them . . . siphon strength is my favorite spell . . it more or less sucks but I love it for pulling and love all the self buff taps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Emnity</div><div class="date">04-04-2002, 01:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use something like the following<br />
<br />
Lifetap<br />
Vampiric Embrace<br />
Scream of Hate/Pain<br />
Siphon Str<br />
DC (groups) / Darkness 2 / Undead Nuke<br />
Clinging Darkness<br />
Invis / Invis Undead<br />
FD<br />
<br />
I dont use the pet a whole lot except to practice evocation on or occasionally pulling something and can still stand toe to toe against mobs so dont fear kite.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dreorg</div><div class="date">04-04-2002, 02:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Pet slot is also the slot that holds Grim Aura, Deadeye, Endure Whatever - that sort of stuff.  It tends to have whatever spell I cast last in it, and I switch them around during downtime.  It may sound strange, but I like to have one slot where all the non-critical spells live, so that I never try to cast something important during combat and find J Random non-combat spell there.<br />
<br />
Obviously, I need to play around with them and find a good mix.  Being a Troll, and not having an enormous mana pool, I tend to shy away from the Scream spells due to the cost, except situationally.<br />
<br />
Does anyone *ever* use Wave of Enfeeblement for anything?  The only use I could see for it would be to take aggro off of group members without having to switch targets from whatever you are currently beating on, but I don't know if it breaks mez or not.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paradox</div><div class="date">04-04-2002, 01:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm a 28 DE SK, started playing EQ in Feb 2002.  This is my first char...<br />
<br />
I cast Grim Aura and Vampiric Embrace before I start.  I usually use lifetap to pull a mob and once it's on it's way, I pop off disease cloud.  This gets the initial damage going and disease cloud usually forces/keeps agro on me.  Once it's in front of me, i hit lifetap to make up for the initial hit it may have gotten on me then I cast siphon strength.  While swinging on it, I'll cast lifetap after I get in a bash because sometimes bash will stun the mob.  I'll continue with swinging, bashing and lifetapping until the mob is dead - casting disease cloud again if it wears off.<br />
<br />
Be careful using DoT spells like engulfing darkness when in groups.  Casters cannot mez a mob with a DoT spell on it because the DoT spell breaks the mez right off the bat.<br />
<br />
My big pet peev : TAUNT THE MOB BEFORE BREAKING A MEZ!<br />
<br />
It's really annoying to have to chase down a mob who is chasing a caster who is running away, sometimes causing more mobs to join in on the battle.  It's a big mess that wastes a lot of time, mana and hitpoints that could have been avoided with a few clicks of the taunt button.<br />
<br />
Some of this may be basic info, but being a newer player to EQ, I had to find out the hard way with people yelling at me in group chat or in tells sent to me.  Hopefully, a newer SK will read this and keep it in their mind.<br />
<br />
If you have found better tactics that can be used at this level, please let me know - I'm always open to new ideas for causing mobs to bleed in larger volumes quicker.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bruuz Err</div><div class="date">04-05-2002, 03:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Im in the same boat as the original poster. Here's how I use my 8slots<br />
<br />
Darkness (Forget the name, the highest level one I have)<br />
Lifedraw<br />
Siphon Strength<br />
Heat blood <br />
Scream of Pain<br />
DC (Or Fear, if Im soloing)<br />
Scream of Hate (Grim Aura Goes here, when needed)<br />
FD<br />
<br />
<br />
I use a Post-Nerf Circlet for Invis, and I use my Gauntlets for Vampiric Embrace.<br />
<br />
I tend to use slot 7 as my 'interchangable' slot for other misc. spells, when the time comes for them. Slot 8 is always FD...Always</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pheargore</div><div class="date">04-05-2002, 03:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Been using this setup for awhile now.<br />
<br />
1) Life Tap spell for Level<br />
2) Siphon STR<br />
3) Engulf<br />
4) Fear<br />
5) ATK Debuff/Steal<br />
6) AC Debuff/Steal<br />
7) Disease Cloud<br />
8) FD<br />
<br />
Recast Grim Aura and Vamp Embrace every other med round. Swaping out Disease Cloud while I recast them. 7 is my random slot... Although if I am in group I always leave it up for Aggro management if I am tanking.<br />
<br />
- Peace</div></div><hr />
