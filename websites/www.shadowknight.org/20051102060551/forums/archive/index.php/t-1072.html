Is my equipment good for my level? What are some upgrades that I should be going for? I am most interisted in what I should be looking for in ways of weapon upgrades. I hunt solo most of the time and I am not part of a Guild so I can't do anything too hard.<br />
<br />
Weapon: Dark Reaver<br />
or<br />
Yakesha + Velium Round Shield<br />
<br />
Armor: Full Dreadscale<br />
<br />
Earrings: Orc Fang Earing x2<br />
<br />
Ring: Jagged Band x2</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krazix</div><div class="date">04-25-2002, 01:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would shoot for a Mithril 2 Handed Sword (21/41+haste) for 2hs.<br />
Might try and upgrade Yak to a Velium Short Blade (10/24 +some saves and weak ice proc) Both those are cheap upgrades. I don't know much about iksar armor, maybe work to start grouping Frenzy in Lowre Guk for an FBSS if possible.  May want to consider picking up cheap 1hb 2hb and pericing weapons for practice.<br />
<br />
In the future though, please post equipment questions in the proper forum (The Armory)</div></div><hr />

Keep both, for the STR upgrade. Dreadscale....you might consider ry`gorr or sentry. As for your sword, I don't know your price range, but a wurmslayer would be better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
at 40's there's not a lot you can solo to upgrade your equipment. <br />
<br />
Hunt for loot and buy upgrades.<br />
<br />
Suggestions - WC solo the druids, farm outside CT for FS, Lgukk for FBSS, etc. <br />
<br />
Weapon - MoSS &lt; Noct &lt; Ebon Mace &lt; SoP. Work pierce! Some good weapons out there with that.<br />
<br />
My thoughts, at 40 in quested DarkForge, were to upgrade my secondary slots (range, rings, neck) and not worry about my armor. What you have can last till 50 when you get the nice stuff. DF will. ;)  You can check my gear here. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Catharsis</div><div class="date">04-25-2002, 03:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Armor wise, I'd just swap out the jagged bands for a pair of velium fire wedding rings (6ac, 65hp).<br />
<br />
You should be fine until you start hitting PoF for greenmist, or PoG for noctivigant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gykon V'Onyx</div><div class="date">04-25-2002, 03:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Optimize for AC &gt; HP &gt; Stats on armor, and DPS on weapon.<br />
<br />
Screw stats.<br />
<br />
Stats are for later when every little bit counts. <br />
<br />
Sell all your stat jewlery and replace it with AC items. Any items you have that have no AC and good stats, replace them.<br />
<br />
Bottom line for all gear is decreasing DPS vs you, and increasing it vs. them.<br />
<br />
If you sold the Yak, with a little extra pp you could get a MoSS and get a dps increase of almost double.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cesar</div><div class="date">04-25-2002, 04:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, seems like the plan is for me to just work on leveling and save $$. I'm poor, I have approx 80 pp total. And nothing worth selling except the Yak. <br />
<br />
Since i'm in Kunark, I was planning on going to hunt in the Dreadlands, but there isn't much cash in that... so does anyone have any suggestions on where to solo for exp and cash in Kunark?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nasiir</div><div class="date">04-25-2002, 07:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Save up to get 2 6ac 65hp rings. Maybe get a MoSS cheap and try getting into a frenzy group in lguk for a fbss or save for a different haste item. I'd recommend hunting in Skyshrine for sentry armor. Good exp at your level and the armor is pretty much the best pre planar/velquest/+ armor an iksar sk can wear.<br />
<br />
I was in full dreadscale in my mid 40s til I started hunting in skyshrine. Pretty much the difference between my old gear and yours is a crested mistmoore shield + moss combo was what I used always (had a dark reaver in the bank :) ).<br />
<br />
Solo for exp and cash? Hmm.. EJ is doable at your leve I think, but the loot isn't so good. Grouping in City of Mist is decent loot at your level (or was in my day). I soloed a lot in Overthere from 40-52 and it was decent plat and decent exp.<br />
<br />
If you get in your high 40s and want to know what to upgrade from that, my profile has a couple ideas. I play on Tallon Zek, so priorities are different. If I was blue, I'd focus a bit more on STR for the atk benefits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gykon V'Onyx</div><div class="date">04-25-2002, 07:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The OT can be decent cash if you stick to chickens.<br />
<br />
If you pull 100% chickens, you will find your cash per hour ok in OT.<br />
<br />
One of the the best places to make money is netherbian lair.<br />
<br />
At 40, you can beat fungoids sensless, and they drop 4 plat almost every time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vachir</div><div class="date">04-25-2002, 08:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually in the mid levels I always optimized my gear for stats over AC or HP.  The reason is that I was mostly fear kiting and AC and HP did me no good, but extra stats helped a lot in increasing damage output and reducing downtime.  Once you get to the higher levels you'll need armor upgrades anyway so once you get to that point you can worry about increasing AC and HP, this is totally different if you're trying to get through the mid levels by tanking though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yisaar</div><div class="date">04-26-2002, 11:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For cash at 40, find a partner and fearkite hill giants, by 43 or so you should be able to solo them, but having a partner will still be much more efficient...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zanix The Unholy</div><div class="date">04-26-2002, 12:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">another thing that'll help u out are the litle known &quot;Silver Jascinth Wedding rings&quot; which are 10 AC -7 save magic a piece... imo when not grinding for stats or resists MUCH better than the 6/65s<br />
<br />
not sure where they are from</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neq</div><div class="date">04-26-2002, 01:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Silver Jacinth rings are jewelcrafted (oddly enough from a bar of enchanted silver, and a jacinth :) ) believe they are pretty easy to make since the metal type is very easy to work with, I'd bet you wouldn't end up paying too much for a pair of these</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valkyria Grymreaper</div><div class="date">04-26-2002, 03:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fear kite and kill the druids in WC at the ring for some fast cash as Grim suggested. They will cast on so be sure to have your /pet back off hot key setup or else u can find yourself fighting both of them at first. Once the two are split u should have no trouble.<br />
<br />
Spawn is quick on them, plus the loot you get you can sell back to the vendor at the ring!<br />
<br />
I found the cash just as good as doing HGs, with far less risk involved.<br />
<br />
Just dont try the vendor yet. She will kick your butt :D <br />
<br />
As far as weapons, Mith 2 hander is nice til u get a haste belt. If no haste belt, MoSS or Ebon Mace or SoP and a nice shield. Practice piercing as mentioned above! The Dark Spear of Venom is not that bad a weapon and after a few Kael raids you will have one most likely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fengz Deamonscale</div><div class="date">04-26-2002, 03:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alright, I hit 41 last night in the Dreadlands. After some beggin' (I know, I know) and selling of loot I'm up to approx 80 plat. After everyone's suggestions, I'm going to stay in  Dreadlands and try to level up again.<br />
<br />
I like the idea of getting the druids in WC, but how tough are they? I tried to solo a Doolvarg Rampager (cons blue) and he kicked my arse. Fiegn Death fizzled and I ended up dieing... after that experince I got a group fast.<br />
<br />
The Plan for Upgrades:<br />
1) Mith two-hander ...approx 500 <br />
2) Wedding Rings ... approx 1000 for the pair<br />
<br />
Seems like I have a lot to save up for! hehe.<br />
<br />
Thanks again!<br />
:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grim</div><div class="date">04-26-2002, 04:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">WC is easy. Those two go lt blue at 42. They can be single pulled. Just pull one directly away from the other one. Don't pull with a snare as you don't want them to walk and nuke. Once they're split hang on the hill and pull with your best DOT. When they run close start to fear kite. They do have bow's and arrows and will shoot them. Once they're split it's gravy. Hell, I wish i could find another camp so easy with xp and covered in loot.  I think they're on a 6 minute timer. It's short, but not too short. Lots of druids to beg/buy a buffs from. Closest zone is befallen I think. About the same to kith. If you're worried about the long walk - bind in EFP. But hell, with TP rings right there you should be good.</div></div><hr />
