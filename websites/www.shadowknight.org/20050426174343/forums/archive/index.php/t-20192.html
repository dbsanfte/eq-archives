Ok, now on to my question :)  I have all items for the LoP khurik, the all 6 scrolls the neddle from Argest, oh and I got the Circulet off the bodyguard, got it right after i killed him (lucky me ) Now I was wondering is the wheel to make the tome still in droga?   I hate to go down there at my lvl or at any lvl without a group.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks again for all your help my fellow Shadowknights :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rhamuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Heya   :) <br />
<br />
I just did this about a week ago, along with a monk friend of mine.  We were both working on the Stupendous tome- he for Whistling Fists quest, and I for the Lord of Pain's Khukri.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, to answer your question:  yes the wheel is still down there.  :(   The good news is that none of the mobs there see invis.  If you have a shammy buddy to shrink you, or have a Minimizing Device, you can then invis up and run down to the jail area.  If you're shrunk, you can run right through the locked doors in front of the wheel.  After you do the combine (which can be done invis, without losing it), simply run out again.<br />
<br />
I will say that this is pretty risky.  The mobs down there now are mean and plentiful.  But we were able to make it out without any problems.  I might suggest splurging for one of those insta click gate potions (one can be bought in West Cabilis for around 1k).  I know that's a lot of money, but you don't want your invis to fall around those mobs and try to click your Thurg gate potion, lol. :D <br />
<br />
Anyway, good luck to you.  I'm sure you can find a better response to your question posted on this site somewhere, but since I'm new to the board, and have just recently done this, I thought I'd reply.<br />
<br />
Peace.</div></div><hr />
