<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>spanky4458</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am a casual player and am about to ding 46 tommorow.  I am excited about visiting the planes, checking out new zones and trying to upgrade some equipment.  I am in a guild, nothing &quot;uber&quot;,  but could probably get a group of low to mid 50s together whenever I want.<br />
<br />
Any advice on where I should go or what some of the first things I should do there are.  I am looking for anything, from good xp to loot, but most importantly I just wanna have fun.  I dont really know to much about the planes at all so any advice woul be much appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for anyhelp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dkhar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think Plane of Justice is a good starter if you want a good intro. The run to where you fight with a group is right around the corner, not very confusing or dangerous. Plane of Innovation is also good if you can find a group there. In PoI, you never leave the zone in unless of course you are with crazy bastards that like to run down the path and take a junk room. Really it just gets you used to how hard and fast they hit and what to expect in planes like PoD and PoN, where the mobs get a little bit crazier.n (pretty soon you will be making a post titled &quot;CoD, ouch ouch ouch, Loading please wait...).<br />
<br />
But basically I would just stick to LDoNs and get to 50+. I found the xp in LDoN at 46-50 better than tier 1 pop xp. That of course stopped as soon as I hit 51 or 52.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>spanky4458</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I havent realy gotten around to playing in a while, but I got in a group in PoJ last night.  Lots of fun, had to stay near the entrance but it was a good time and got good experience.</div></div><hr />

As a rule of thumb, I wait until 46.5 before I head to POJ groups with my toons after a friend got smited at 46+0 by some High Guardians that trained to the zone out and killed his group.   The cleric rezzed him 75% or 90% and it wasn't enough to get him back into 46+<br />
