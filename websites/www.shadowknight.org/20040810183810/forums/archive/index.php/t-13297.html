So far the spawn times have been 30.5, 30.75, 31, 32.5, 32.5.  I missed one by 30 minutes, stopped in before work to find that out.  Another time before work.. the SOB spawned while I was literally at the computer but I wasn't expecting him for another 6 hours (my log missed a spawn) so the other guy sitting there killed him before I switched back.  <br />
<br />
Worst.<br />
Camp.<br />
Ever.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Hsystah Shadowspawn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well, there you have it.  Get off the damn surfboard and kill that oversized parakeet!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rokktor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yay!  After a week of logging and missing him and sitting in Ice Clad starving, I finally got him!  Was the first spawn after the server reset and had no idea when he'd be up.<br />
<br />
The 18 hour after reset is complete BS.  I've logged it after TWO resets including the time I actually killed him.  If it's 18 hours, how can anybody explain two spawns after server resets that were 28-30 hours?  That number doesn't sync with 18 at all.  If I somehow missed a spawn, it should have been about 40 hours total but 28-30 (closer to 28 both times but had to estimate the server up time).<br />
<br />
And yes, this post was NOT to ask about the spawn time you damn invalid.  I posted my own results for the benefit of others and the screenshot my guildmate doctored for me (can't take credit for it).  So get a clue before you do a Search Flame, moron.</div></div><hr />
