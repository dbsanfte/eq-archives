<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mallyce</div><div class="date">06-18-2002, 03:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi everyone.  <br />
I come seeking advice again.  I did the first 4 Crusader's Tests yesterday.  All went off without a hitch.  The 5th Test (Betrayal) is now throwing me fits.  <br />
<br />
I hailed Lord Qyzar who gave me the instructions to see Goxok.  I went to bottom tower, hailed him and was given the quest text which I followed.  He gave me the coin and told me he'd meet me in FV.  Here's the problem (possible problem).<br />
<br />
I went to FV immediately.  I did not stop or delay, I went there as fast as my little Jboots would carry me.  I went to the spawn location (approx neg. 2550, neg. 1550 by the rock there.  Conveniently a guildmate Druid and Ranger happed to be in FV killing time and came to hang out with me and help out if needed.<br />
<br />
Here's where I am confused, bewildered, and frustrated.  I literally spent about 6 real time hours there trying to find the imposter Track Azrael.  According to this guide and the Allakhazam guide, I followed the quest.  <br />
<br />
My guildmates actively checked Tracking for Azrael/Goxnok.  The also ran around the zone killing stuff with me to cover different areas of FV under tracking.  Game days came and went with absolutely no sign of him on track.  We made runs between the above coordinates and the outpost bridge (I of course had to be careful and even got killed because a Pilgrim broke my invis causing a guard train).  <br />
<br />
He was a complete no show in the entire 6 hours I camped.  I also submitted 2 petitions and 2 different GM's came and were of no use.  One suggested I submit a /bug report and said she would do the same as she was unfamiliar with the quest.  Active tracking did not reveal Azrael/Goxnok.<br />
<br />
So, my question is:  Has anyone recently done this quest?  Was there a change to the quest that isn't indicated anywhere?  He is a random spawn?  Has anyone else had trouble finding him?  Is he known to be broken now?<br />
<br />
I saw a couple very recent posts on Allakhazam about the disguised Goxnok not spawning.    I'm perplexed and my guildies are as well, since one of them did recall seeing two Tracker Azrael's on track a while back that he thought was odd.<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance for your advice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eatbugs</div><div class="date">06-18-2002, 04:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Had a similar experience yesterday, finally submitted a bug report myself.  I tried going back and doing the sequence in Cabilis two  more times, but no luck.  There are a couple of previous threads here from the last few weeks complaining that he doesn't spawn anymore and saying that various GM's were either no help or think he may be broken.  Given how long it usually takes to fix this stuff (nobody really gives a damn about these quests at Verant, look at how long it took to fix the quest sequence the first time) I suspect it's down for a good long time.<br />
<br />
Why do I play this game again??<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mallyce</div><div class="date">06-18-2002, 06:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did the same thing also, Eatbugs.  I destroyed the coin and completely camped out, and  took a walk to chill.  I re-triggered the quest from scratch to see if I might have missed something.<br />
<br />
Ok next question, What happens when you submit a /bug?  Does someone from Sony/VI email you a response?  Does a special GM float down from the sky in the game and taunt you?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Quest is broken.  My belief is that the quest sequence is initiated by the NPCs that gather in front of the bridge and eventually should &quot;March onward&quot;.  They have stopped doing this for some time now.  When that gets fixed, I'll go back and check on Tracker Azreal.<br />
<br />
I've since done the Visceral Dagger and collected all scrolls and keys and obtained the stupendous tome.  I believe I'll have all the items required for the Greenmist by the time this quest gets fixed.  Or maybe I'll have all the stuff and have to wait a few months.<br />
<br />
I hate quests in EverQuest</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eatbugs</div><div class="date">06-22-2002, 10:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I sent in a message to the Developer's Corner a few days ago about Tracker Azreal not showing up, and got a reply back:<br />
<br />
&quot;The team is aware of it.  I have no idea when it will be corrected, though.&quot;<br />
<br />
So at least they know about it.  Meantime, guess I'll camp the pieces for the next couple of stages. ;)<br />

I need to attempt it before it TLC's out on me. (Firiona Vie Server) What level are both the Drachnid Spy and Goxnok? I believe they are around 30th, but am not sure. Any help would be appreciated.<br />

<br />
Can't they do anything right?<br />
<br />
I tried this quest last night (July 14 2002) and it is STILL broken.<br />
<br />
I petitioned and waited for 9hrs and not a single response.<br />
<br />
Looks like today I need to make some &quot;friends&quot; at Sony. <br />
<br />
I'm an almost lvl 57 SK being held up because a stupid lvl 27 mob won't spawn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dade the Mad</div><div class="date">07-15-2002, 02:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Seems both the SK's and Shammy's are being screwed by VI.  Tracker won't spawn and neither will the Overseer in Nurga.  Hehe, both are quest no.5, coincidence? ;p<br />
<br />
Rabbi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Medzgaleer</div><div class="date">07-17-2002, 10:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">spent 1/2 hr arguing with a gm about this quest.  finally got pissed off enough that i called the phone number and pestered them till I got a manager.<br />
<br />
i'm expecting an email from a lead-gm today per the manager.<br />
<br />
I've taken the postition that while this is a &quot;game&quot; it's one that I'm Paying to play.  Hence to me this has no longer become a &quot;game&quot; issue, but rather a Sony customer service (or lack thereof) issue.<br />
<br />
I'm tired of us being taken advantage of.  Fix the content out there before you send out new stuff.  So this has become my personal crusade to get this damn quest fixed.<br />
<br />
I may accomplish nothing, but it won't be for lack of trying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fezzika</div><div class="date">07-17-2002, 10:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm right there with you.  I'm hoping this will be fixed on the next patch July 24th...but god help them if it isn't.  It's just friggin unacceptable.  You're working on all this bullshit UI crap (that was supposed to be on the Luclin CD to begin with), and you can't even get a simple quest to work?<br />
<br />
Someone in my guild referred to the POTC quest as the collaboration of the best of Verant's programming knowledge and talent.<br />
<br />
My response:  So POTC = Pong?<br />
<br />
Pathetic....</div></div><hr />

<br />
As of last patch this quest is STILL broken.</div></div><hr />
