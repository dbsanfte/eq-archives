<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">soupy</div><div class="date">04-05-2002, 10:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello, <br />
Science of War is a guild in formation on the Stormhammer server and is now recruiting shadowknights who know their stuff.<br />
<br />
(The reason I've come to this forum is because I believe that class boards are full of people who know how to play their class really well or are at least interested in improving on their skills by learning from others. Those are exactly the people that we are looking to recruit).<br />
<br />
I'm convinced that there is a core of extremely talented players on the Stormhammer server, and we aim to get them into this guild so that we can do things that are not done on other Everquest servers. Isn't it time that the &quot;Legends&quot; environment lived up to its moniker? Let's create a great guild.<br />
<br />
If you are interested in applying, please visit http://www.scienceofwar.net and get to know us. Read the FAQs, evaluate our goals, familiarize yourself with our recruiting requirements, and spend a little time thinking about whether or not you'd also like to apply for a position of officership (we primarily need class recruiters and class leaders right now (we don't have a Shadowknight class leader yet, and class leaders are the foundation of the guild -- so please apply if you think you're up for the job!). <br />
<br />
I think that you'll appreciate the fact that one requirement for getting in is that SKs demonstrate knowledge of what it means to play a their class really well. We therefore ask that all applicants post a guide on SOME aspect of being an SK to these boards as part of their applications. Maybe we'll see a few interesting guides come out of it, at the least. =)<br />
<br />
Thanks, and good luck.</div></div><hr />

Does anyone else see this as a pointless endeavor? I mean, ya, they don't own the game, but walking wilfully into that much server competition seems downright crazy to me. It's bad enough competing with 14 ToV armored guilds on Saryrn (OOP, H&amp;E, AC, TWC, Fam, ToN, TBS, FS, Isen, DW, AoTS, LDT, Sam, ToS), but a guild the size of TR which is understandably capable of clearing basically everything worth killing in one night by themselves. Well, I wish ya luck. I'm sure the one or two kills you get a week, if that, will be well worth the effort...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">soupy</div><div class="date">04-05-2002, 10:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think that the server is as crowded as you make it out to be. I was soloing in HS the other day during PRIME TIME and was the only one in the zone. <br />
<br />
The new CT is by no means saturated either. I don't think that people have fully explored / pillaged Maurader's Mire or the new Nurga either. Verant seems to be creating upper-level content at a fair clip now.<br />
<br />
I also think that PoP will help ease the congestion of high-end encounters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pixels Soulscream</div><div class="date">04-05-2002, 10:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As much as it might seem that way, it's far from the reality of the server. There are 4 or 5 guilds on server who are ToV/planes/etc. capable, and there really hasn't been any fighting over MOBS. TR is also not the largest, or most powerfull guild currently. I've personally witnessed many smaller guilds raiding with great success, in places like ToV, Umbral, etc. There have also been GM regulated re-spawns of high end mobs, to help accomodate everyone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So that's what you pay for....This is not the way it should be, everquest is everquest...If you can ask a GM to respawn a mob, it should be everREquest...<br />
<br />
Ah well, sorry for the flame, just my 2cp...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pixels Soulscream</div><div class="date">04-06-2002, 08:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">GM's really have no choice BUT to do respawns at times. With 3 or 4 guilds on server that have hit the 100 55+ member mark, NOT repoppping some stuff would just lead to a huge loss of subscribers. As it is now, there's not much fighting over big spawns...however, if they changed policy, it could get ugly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">soupy</div><div class="date">04-08-2002, 03:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In fact, I was on a hate raid last weekend -- GMs not only repopped the entire plane, but held an impromptu event for us by becoming a gigantic grim-reaper type mob. Dropped the Enchanter chest-piece.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hideo</div><div class="date">04-08-2002, 03:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm curious do guilds on Legends have problems with players essentially looting and scooting.  By that I mean arriving on the server, joining one of the resident uber guilds, getting some phat lewtz then scooting back to their original server.<br />
<br />
I know plenty of Sullon Zek mongoloids did this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Syfon</div><div class="date">04-08-2002, 04:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Basically it seems to me you have one or two top guilds on every server. Then you have maybe half a dozen or more sort of waiting in the wings. <br />
<br />
These half dozen guilds you could say are an expansion behind. When PoP comes out then they will move into doing NTov and ST while the guilds who have exploited, pillaged, and raped these zones are out getting better with the new content and begin their stranglehold on a new area. <br />
<br />
Months later the guilds that are now Primal equipped wearing NTov gear will not be able to move into PoP because the same top guilds have even better equipment from the new expansion and are able to dominate these areas completely.  Sadly it seems an endless cycle. You are either able to compete with these guilds or not and wait patiently for verant to release something for them to go do so that you can finally fully explore areas and have encounters you bought with an expansion 6 months ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ashnek</div><div class="date">04-08-2002, 04:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yech....<br />
<br />
I tell you what...Sullon Zek has nicer players than you see on stormhammer.  I would put 90% of the population there into one of two catagories:<br />
<br />
1.  Complete and utter loot whores<br />
<br />
I have have heard what did/does it drop more times in the last month than I have in the entire two and a half years I have played EQ.<br />
<br />
2.  UberWannaBe's<br />
<br />
These guys are the oasis/LOIO/OT/Dreads crowd that actually managed to grind their way to 55 but somehow still have no clue....or the rejected ninja looters....or the zek refugees looking for a leg up in peace.<br />
<br />
Or folks like Soupy who just plain think they are better than everyone else and know so much more about EQ...<br />
<br />
Feh....biggest waste of 40 bucks I have made in a while...<br />
<br />
please...let them transfer my characters back soon...I hate that place....so very much =)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Skurrge</div><div class="date">04-09-2002, 12:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ashnek, I was on Stormhammer for a couple of weeks myself and I found it to be pretty much the same.  But I don't see anything in what Soupy said to lump him in with those kind of people on that server.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, I did see some pretty good players on Stormhammer as well.  &lt;Legendary Twelve&gt; seemed to be pretty good, for example.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ashnek</div><div class="date">04-09-2002, 01:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I must admit my potshot a soupy is related solely to his messageboad posts on the old shamans crucible and on the stormhammer board...I havent actually grouped with him.<br />
<br />
That being said...I still think Stormhammer is...how you say... &quot;teh sux&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slashim</div><div class="date">04-09-2002, 01:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have, for the most part, really enjoyed my time on Stormhammer so far.   Things don't seem too crowded in the exp zones either.  I mean I can get a group in Seb within 10 - 15 minutes.<br />
<br />
The only thing that bugs me about Stormhammer is all the people from the Zeks going around and beating thier chests saying shit like &quot;man if I was on my old server I would soooo PK you&quot;  or just constantly talking about thier great moments in PvP.  Not to mention a good majority of those that are from the Zek servers just don't have the experience raiding that us smurfs do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zanix The Unholy</div><div class="date">04-09-2002, 03:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ashnek (and other SH bashers)<br />
<br />
perhaps you don't see stormhammer like the rest of us do....<br />
theres 20 times more opportunity there than ANY other server...be it unfair or whatever...that's how it is...<br />
<br />
1) On my old server (or any other for that matter) you can submit a petition and wait up to or past 4 hours for a response....fuck that....I send petitions now.....I get a response within 5 minutes EVERY time. we ran into a &quot;problem&quot; in the hole last night - Gm was standing next to me before the mobs even popped<br />
<br />
2) Grouping is GREAT here.. velks usually has 20 or less people in it. Aiming towards good reps etc, guilds and PC won't KS, and usually make room in certain groups/etc to accomodate.<br />
<br />
3) there are 5-7 full time grave lords on this server......<br />
<br />
4) Ive done 56, 57, 58, 59, 60 and 1 aaxp point in 5 weeks....i play about 4 hours a night/.....more than half my epic - without being in a guild - - through cool people i've met.... any SK calls upon any SK for help/etc and everyone is cool with each other.<br />
<br />
5) GM events - KICK ASS - i know a lot of people say SH lacks the amount promised, but believe me, EVERY TIME i've wandered (not grinded EXP) i've ran into a random event..... Ever run past KC and a wounded iksar NPC begs you to call upon other adventurers and rescue his captured partner? didn't think so - I know on luclin - in 2 years i saw 1 GM event (about 300 people attacking a giant in FM who was /shouting WHY ARE YOU ATTACKING ME....) [you get the point]<br />
<br />
6) bottom line is - why not come to legends? give one legit answer.... and don't say 40$ is too much - 40 bucks a month is CHEAP (basic shitty cable is 50 per month, etc)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ashnek</div><div class="date">04-09-2002, 04:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1.  Agreed.<br />
<br />
Petition response time has be excellent.  At no point in time will I decry the customer service on Stormhammer.  The GM's are friendly, helpful and fast.<br />
<br />
2. *COUGH*  Grouping is great there if you are 50+<br />
<br />
Ashnek is 31...In the time I have been there (1.5 months...doh forgot to cancel before first was up =P)  I have been able to get into one group.<br />
<br />
There are soooo many zones desolated..its guess work to find out where I might acutally find some people.. I went to OT the other day and there were three people in the zone..<br />
<br />
3.  Im not too sure what your point is there, but I have run into a fair number of High level SK's there...a good bunch mostly.<br />
<br />
4. Im glad you have been able to get groups..not all of us have been that lucky...see #2 above<br />
<br />
5.  Im split on that one...I've had some fun at a couple, and some have sucked...mostly they suck when the inevitable swarm of locusts...err...I mean druids come swarming down on the zone.<br />
<br />
Granted its new content and that in and of itself is a good thing.<br />
<br />
6. ok:<br />
<br />
1.  Not much low level content 90% of events are catered to the 50+ crowd<br />
<br />
2.  Difficulty finding groups if you are below 50<br />
<br />
3.  Horrible economy, over inflated prices.<br />
<br />
Now that all being said...Stormhammer will be fun for some and not for others.   I personally wish I had the experience you did and ran into some good folks...mostly I just ran into jerks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">soupy</div><div class="date">04-09-2002, 11:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Interesting that this has become an evaluation of Stormhammer. I'm generally with Zanix on the value of the server, but agree with Ash that some lower-level zones can be ghost-towns (which is heaven for a solo class, but hell for a group-dependant class).<br />
<br />
Anyways Ash, don't hold anything against me for my acerbic posts on the crucible. There's a bit of history between me and the mods, and so I am not as well-behaved as I'd like to be. ;)<br />
<br />
I'd love to see some of the stormhammer shadowknights that frequent this board stop by to fill out an application, however. Please read about us and send &quot;vova&quot; a tell in-game if you've got questions. <br />

<br />
Just a brief update. The guild is off the ground and running and we are recruiting slowly but surely. (It sure it hard finding people who don't treat their time on Stormhammer as temporary only.)<br />

Thanks for the support from those of you who gave it! <br />

If i could spend 40 bucks on the legends, along with DSL id transfer in 1 minute.  I love luclin, but god the BS on the server is crappy alot of the time.  I think ppl tend to forget EQ is a game, its supposed to be fun, Stormhammer is trying to bring back that fun i think, altho i wonder if they couldnt have done it w/o charging 40 bucks.  VI needs to look at all of the high end game on every server and step in and do something to some degree.  Some of the problems on many servers would almost disappear if spawns on certain mobs were increased and made random (epic mobs, not the ToV crap, seen more fights over epic stuff than ToV cuz there are less guilds on a server going for dozekar, and those that lose the race go kill something else, than there are guilds going for Shissar, Severillous, Gorenaire etc). and the rare drops were increased by a few %.</div></div><hr />
