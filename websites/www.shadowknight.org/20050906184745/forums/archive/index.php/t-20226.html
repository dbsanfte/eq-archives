<br />
I am the single FDer in my guild. Would you think some pet pulling is possible to single VZ copies ??<br />
<br />
Will the pet survive ?</div></div><hr />

But thanks =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Make sure each group has a healer and that the raid is in the corner so when respawns occur they don't aggro them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They don't hit that hard individually....maybe with a fully buffed pet you could do it.  You could eventually get pet pull to work for you even if you lose every other pet I suppose.<br />
<br />
It's a big room though.....I am sure you can come up with a different way.</div></div><hr />

So, asking how to do the encounter with a raid that small is interesting but not very useful (unless you are in a Time guild and want to see if you can do the encounter that way).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Simu</div><div class="date">02-24-2004, 10:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I Know they are snarable, even if they tend to campcorpse the FDer. I was just wondering if they were pet pullable ;) I just slapped my head for not having thought to pet pull them and was wondering if our pet does have enough hp to make it or not ?<br />
<br />
We know we won't go far in PoP with 18ppl, that's it, but VZ is definetly doable for us and is a nice source of upgrades =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DConquest</div><div class="date">02-24-2004, 11:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I never tried the pet pull method on VZ, but if you buff / HoT / mage gear equip the pet before the pull then it should work imo.  I used to pull named out of packed rooms on LDoN Hards using the same method, and they have more DPS than any of the VZs.</div></div><hr />

He is so easyily 1 groupable its not funny...the`VZs cannot kill my pet when Virtued/Pet weaps, single target shrew, BSS, and shaman buffed...<br />
<br />
So in a one word answer YES he can be pet pulled.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maicom</div><div class="date">02-28-2004, 12:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i read somewhere here that you can use the cleric targetable DA on your pet prior to a pet pull and it will still get agro on the mob you tell it to attack, but cause of DA the mob won't be able to hit back... never tried it myself but might wanna give that a go.</div></div><hr />
