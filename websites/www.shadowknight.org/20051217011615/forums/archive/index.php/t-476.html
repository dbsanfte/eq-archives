<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smaelikar</div><div class="date">04-05-2002, 02:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Im curious about some of the places where other SK's may be soloing for their aaxp at level 60. I know I have heard of a few places. There was some talk of good aaxp in katta, xilith mentioned soloing in FG and some have talked about chardok. I have been soloing in the grey. The main reason I solo there is Panic the dead is so cheap that with KEI on I have no downtime solo fearkiting here. Without Clarity or KEI I can kill about 5 skellys untill im almost oom and have to med. Ok theres my spot..wheres yours? Please dont tell us about how you can solo some really tough place and then later we find out about your cleric/shaman bot that is standing nearby helping:) So where do you solo aaxp and why there?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shakeera</div><div class="date">04-05-2002, 03:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">SK soloing is easy in the cobalt scars; I've grabbed a c3 and fear-kited wyverns non-stop for the 3-hour duration of the buff.  Haven't tried it for AA exp though, but I assume it's about the same as soloing at level 52-53.  Quest gems are an added bonus there.   On the downside, druids and wizards will hate you in that zone because they like to hog all the wyverns for their little quad kitting shennanigans.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xilith</div><div class="date">04-05-2002, 03:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Grey is pretty good, but it's an inconvenient location.  If I have enough time to go all the way there and get set up, I would rather get a group and check out new CT or a Luclin dungeon.  FG is conveniently located and something I do for 30 min - 2 hours at a time tops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jarxle</div><div class="date">04-05-2002, 03:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I solo in the grey a lot.  I usually set up on the hill straight out from the enterance to ssra.  I then pull shissar and golems from out in the rocks to the side of the temple.  Many are light blue but I always find a regular blue one to pull.  I would like to find a few other spots as well.  I went in the scarlet desert but found too many light blue, however I have heard there are pockets there that support many more blue mobs.  I would like to solo more in ME or other places if anyone has suggestions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ronoh</div><div class="date">04-05-2002, 03:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not 60 (yet) but I'm 3 blues till 59 and I've been running 50/50 AA since SoL came out (I was 53 at that time).   A few places that I've found that I can watch the blue fly soloing:<br />
<br />
Katta (my favorite)<br />
Scarlet Dessert platue (so - so)<br />
The Grey (so -so)<br />
Chardok (pretty good)<br />
Akheva (pretty good)<br />
Maiden's Eye (so - so)<br />
Sol B (so - so)<br />
The Hole (pretty good)<br />
Skyfire (so - so)<br />
Sebilis (pretty good)<br />
Velk's (so - so)<br />
<br />
This is being totally solo, only self buffed with right clicky items and my own spells.  I also use a pet, and depending on what zone I'm in depends if he gets buffed or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gaggrog</div><div class="date">04-05-2002, 05:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">when i solo it usually depends where I'm logged<br />
<br />
i used to live in chardok, but too many people camp the fort or zone in and pulling past people gets old &amp; fast---need circlet to avoid light blues.<br />
<br />
i did mimics in the hole for a week, would switch off for a twink while waiting for repops, but this was pretty slow and light blue mobs spawning really hurt your rate of exp.<br />
<br />
exp in maidens seems pretty crappy to me<br />
<br />
ahkeva at zone in is ok if no groups are there, because if there are groups then pulling gets to be kind of long range &amp; greater risk---also sometimes resists are higher so more mana used---i get a lot of oor of target hits as well when fear kiting<br />
<br />
cobalt scar is too low level for a 60 grinding aaexp to my knowledge<br />
<br />
adds are very annoying in ww (at least if kos to cov)<br />
<br />
fear kiting doesn't seem to work well in the new CT har har<br />
<br />
skyfire just seems to be slow due to some hps on mobs and finding low hp targets takes too long (this with an unholy steed)<br />
<br />
haven't tried katta or fg yet, but don't have fungi (and i'd take a huge agi hit putting me below 75 cap with fungi on) so haven't really tried fg.  katta---not sure of faction yet and i'm not usually on luclin since oggok/ct doesn't have a spire on that half of antonica (getting ports are a pain sometimes)<br />
<br />
i got bored of soloing and try to do more grouping, but those are some of the spots i've tried and my results.  i can say the hole is definately secluded (hopefully nobody trains you while your afk hehe).  i pretty much got burnt out on getting exp again and look forward to raids instead...<br />
<br />
oh, i used to solo in sirens grotto, but my guild got me to club some seals &amp; now soloing doesn't work out so well there (better cash than exp)<br />
<br />
EDIT:  velks spiders are ok to solo if there aren't too many people in the zone...but that fear  path bug at the zone in sure sucks...for you and the suckers at the zone line that are afk *whistle*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rorak</div><div class="date">04-05-2002, 05:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Who/What do you kill in Katta?<br />
<br />
I am only lvl 55 so I doubt this is an option but I am curious.  SD and Neriak FQ still decent for AA at my level although I am focusing more on regular exp before I get more AA right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bazgazu</div><div class="date">04-05-2002, 06:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Typically, I find a zone close to where I am after a raid or something.  Some of my favorite's are:<br />
<br />
Fungus Grove (even after the upgrade)<br />
Akheva<br />
Chardok<br />
The Grey  (the occassional named snake or golem is always a plus)<br />
Velks is ok if you can find something to kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Forelorn</div><div class="date">04-06-2002, 03:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I find fear kiting Goranga Gatherers, lookouts, and followers near the DS zone fear simple and very easy xp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mystina</div><div class="date">04-06-2002, 06:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My favorite spot used to be skyfire, south of ragefire.<br />
There is one spot on East wall that has perfect fear pathing.<br />
However, now exp is shit in there for 2 reasons:<br />
*Nerf of solo exp: I was allways playing with 100% aa , since the nerf exp has been cut by 50%<br />
*Verant bringing ragefire in SF: I really hate em for this, there were usually 1-5 players in zone, now it is allways 15-20 and the fuckers camping RF in group-guild take all good mobs letting only chromadaracs up, wasting alot of time to pull and i'm sometime directly  bothered by the jerks, especially druids.<br />
<br />
FG: was ok exp before the 2 nerfs (zone and solo exp), didnt try since then but I heard zone nerf has been removed and that its ok solo exp for a 59 monk.<br />
<br />
Katta: i spent some time behind bank before solo-exp nerf, exp was not very good since at least half mobs in this part of zone were light blue and they were still getting me some dowtimes, even with fungi.<br />
<br />
Since this damn solo nerf I don't solo anymore, when i'm not raiding I usually do faction-quest-farming and sometimes grab invite in exp groups from guild, 1 houre grouped in CT = at least 3 houres solo in exp.<br />
<br />
Anyone know a safe spot in Katta where all mobs are blue?<br />
I saw alot of blue mobs otw to Lcea but I don't know theire lvl and if they are doable solo. (+ a yellow con roaming in garden)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Graznoth</div><div class="date">04-06-2002, 10:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well depending on what time im playing, I generally head to EW and do bodyguards because its about the only thing uncamped on sol ro. Can pull in about a yellow every hour which isnt great, but like I said is more or less an uncontested spawn.<br />
Im also very found of vox pits, but it being in the middle of no where makes it quite inconvient to get to after a raid, and get back to anywhere for raids. It's also startin to draw high ammounts of traffic, have a lvl 1 barb camped there to check now so I dont waste my time on the run.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Groobash</div><div class="date">04-06-2002, 11:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Katta - get what you can at 59, cuz at 60 more than half are light blue. <br />
<br />
The Grey - If you can get settled into a groove, it's ok...but constant trains by nubers makes this pretty impossible.<br />
<br />
Fungus Grove - why bother, even in a group. It's a shame.<br />
<br />
Akheva ZIN - not bad when the zone is empty. Watch for snare immune mobs if fear kiting.<br />
<br />
Maiden's - If you can solo here, amidst all the trains, you roXXors :P<br />
<br />
The moon basically sucks for xp (and everything else). I see some people mention Katta, anyone try grinding guards in Seru and found a decent spot? Seru seems a lot more blue to me the few times I've been thru there.<br />
<br />
I'm liking spots like CS otters, Chardok ZIN/ZOUT, SolB etc better lately...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Groobash</div><div class="date">04-06-2002, 11:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">P.S. Shakeera what yoo bothing with wyverns at 60 for?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gahhl blaadur</div><div class="date">04-07-2002, 03:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am 3 yellows from 60... since 57, Ive been in Katta.. I have the PERFECT place for it, and when I hit 60, Ill happily tell everyone else where... till then, i dont want to compete anymore then I already have to.<br />
<br />
My disclosure will also come with exact directions of how to pull/etc... :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zagzal</div><div class="date">04-07-2002, 08:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I fight in FG there is ALWAYS something to pull so if u have int u shouldn't havea  problem... if your DR is above like 70 shrooms won't slow u... and at 60 u can single pull them.... also what i do is just get my pet out and own.... shrooms are damn easy to kill also..... the sad thing is i am useing noob weapons so if i had uber stuff i would kill alot faster..... i like FG alot... its that or velks (i hate velks only go there when i need gate potions)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brael</div><div class="date">04-07-2002, 08:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The rare times that im exp'ing (even rarer that im doing it solo) i tend to do akheva, i prefer the zone in but anywhere in there works well... and yes i mean true soloing although bumming a kei from an enchanter doesnt hurt</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jice Virago</div><div class="date">04-07-2002, 09:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I rescently started soloing hard core again lately, even going as far as turning down well balanced groups to solo.  There are a couple spots I like, but two seem to work the best for me:<br />
<br />
Sebilis- Hanging out in the Jail hall pulling all the unwanted blue cons from the area, I can even lower my downtime by buying C2 off of enchanters in Necrosis.  I toe to toe these mobs, using DoTs and lifetaps to dish out most of the damage, along with DS.  Dispelling to pull works really good here.<br />
<br />
Maidens Eye-  The Gorangas are easy to fear kite at zone in area.  Since the loot nerfs, there are a lot less idiots in this zone.</div></div><hr />
