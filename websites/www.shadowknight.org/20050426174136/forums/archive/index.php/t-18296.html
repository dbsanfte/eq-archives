<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thirs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey, I lurk around here a lot, and I just thought I'd post my experiences while questing to obtain the Greenmist.<br />
<br />
To give you some idea, my Gnome Shadow Knight was level 51 for 99% of the quest.  He is my alt (I play a level 65 bard main), and has some pretty nice gear, I suppose.<br />
<br />
So I'll just go through the write up sections, and give some pointers on things I had questions on while I was doing the quest =)<br />
<br />
Faction: I turned in 80ish knives to the Iksar Guard in Lake of Ill Omen.  I was only threatening to begin with, so it didn't take much killing to get to dubious to turn them in.  This put me non-kos to all factions inside Cabilis except the necros.  I did very little necro faction farming (see Test of Pain experience).<br />
<br />
For the turn-ins, I had an enchanter project illusion on me.  This put me at least amiable or higher to all the mobs in Cabalis.<br />
<br />
<br />
Test of the Pawn: You collect the whelp heads and not the hatchling brains from Lake of Ill Omen. They do indeed drop off the sarnak hatchlings, and you will probably have to clear most of the mobs in the newbie area outside Cabalis to get them to spawn. This part took about 10 minutes to complete.<br />
<br />
<br />
Test of Pain: I cleared the area listed on the walkthrough. I also cleared the Iksar Bandit camp in this area everytime it spawned for some Necro faction.  This part took me about 3 hours to complete.<br />
<br />
<br />
Test of Suffering: Pretty straight forward.  Skull I got was no rent, no drop.  Dropped from a greater icebone. Took about 45 minutes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Test of the Zealot: The iksar knight WILL eat your quest pieces if you try this part at dubious.  This part took me about 3 hours because I had to re-do it due to that fact.  Otherwise, just kill the sapling until he drops 2 of the pieces, and the other piece is at bottom of water in northern part of zone at the loc listed on walkthrough.<br />
<br />
<br />
Test of Betrayal: Conned Tracker from distance, was indiff.  Turned in coin to trigger him.  Ran to Drolvarg cave and waited.  He walked up, spawned traitor.  Single pulled traitor with arrow and killed very quickly solo.  Then killed the Hero.  Took about 20 minutes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Test of the Hero: This part I was fearing, but it wasn't bad at all. Apparently, I lucked out though.  Kly #1: In the little cubby, make sure to clear room, and pull him out of the cubby or he will poof in ceiling. Camped him for about 20 minutes.  Undead Blacksmith was up when I got there.  Whole room aggro'd me though, but it wasn't a problem.  Kly #2 (church): Fought him behind altar against wall, no aggro from other mobs but they loved to heal him from across the room in the pews.  Camped him for about 2 hours. Kly #3: Just clear both spawns in lab room everytime they spawn.  He spawns next to table.  Took about 2 hours.  I ran back and forth between camp 2 and camp 3 (well, had to zone out and run back to camp 2), so I suggest doing this as it will make things go faster. I got both 2 and 3 within 2 hours.  Forge works while invis or FD.<br />
<br />
Test of the Lord: By far the worst part, but still it seems I lucked out on it.<br />
<br />
City of Mist: I camped this scroll 10 hours.  I cleared both sides of the stables continuously.  I did need help at this camp, because of the revamp.  I held it fine with 55 shm friend of mine.  The spectral couriers seemed to only spawn in 2 locations. The first one, as you are coming into stables, take left turn.  First building on left as you are entering with 1 spawn behind the door is one spawn spot for him.  The other is opposite side, in the building on left with 3 spawns, the spawn in the very back of that building as you enter.  The first and third scrolls dropped off the latter, and the second scroll dropped off the courier that spawned in the first mentioned ph spot.<br />
<br />
Mistmoore: Also needed help here at this camp, due to revamp.  There was a blue con (light blue to 65) undead shadow knight mob at the entrance to the castle.  I brought a 65 cleric friend for this.  The Librarian Assistant (name was actually something like &quot;an ass't librarian&quot;) was up when I arrived.  The Librarian spawned 20min or so after I cleared her ph.<br />
<br />
Kaesora: Went down with 55 shm friend for this as well.  We had no problems getting to and holding camp.  He spawned inside the building, next to one of the fallen bookshelves on the first floor.  This camp took about 1.5 hours.<br />
<br />
Argest: This part is completely moved to Fronteir Mountains.  Once you enter the caves, just hug the right wall all the way to the room at the end with the 2 iksars in it.  Clear and keep this room cleared.  The Pennmasters and Pennkeepers spawn in two spots from what I noticed.  One was the guard on the right as you enter the room, the other was the ph in the center of the room.  They could spawn in other spots, but those are the 2 spots I saw them spawn in every time.  &quot;an enslaved iksar&quot; was not up when I went, so I killed the iksar on the left and he respawned later.  The keys dropped within about 1 hour.  I did get Iksar Illusion faction to turn in the keys as I conned dubious to Argest and did not want to risk losing the keys.<br />
<br />
Droga: Ran to the pottery wheel invis, nothing aggro'd me.  Being a gnome, I just jumped through the locked doors with no problems.  Did combine while invis, and ran out invis.  Was a little unnerving, but fairly simple =)<br />
<br />
<br />
Greenmist: I'm sure people will call &quot;cheat&quot; on these parts but, hey I used what resources I had to obtain the item =)<br />
<br />
First, I bought the History of the Greenmist in the bazaar for 800pp.<br />
<br />
When I did the turn in in OT, it was raining.  Bad idea.  It didn't actually effect the outcome of the battle, but it made things more tense than they needed to be.  For this battle it was me (52 SK by that time, thanks to 10 hour camp in CoM), 65 wizard, 65 cleric.  Mob was unslowed, I tanked it and held aggro over the wizard just fine.  Cleric didn't really have to heal me much.  The mob does rampage, though.  Dropped him farily easily.  One thing to note, when you do the turn in, he doesn't spawn immediately.  A bunch of undead guards spawn and walk out of the fort.  Then the glowing golem spawns where the regular golem would be.  I waited for him to walk away from fort a bit, halfway between the undead guards outside and the fort itself, and I tagged him with arrow.  Single pulled him and killed him.  No problem =)<br />
<br />
Hammer of 1406: These mobs were blue con to SK, so I didn't bother trying to pull them in that small space.  Instead, I logged on my main (65 bard) and pulled him and killed him, then relogged to my SK to loot hammer.<br />
<br />
Riles Shattered Blade: I ran into KC up to the room, FD'd.  Picked up blade, ran out.  Took about 5 minutes.<br />
<br />
Cracked Mirror: MQ'd.<br />
<br />
Greenism Metal Shard: This camp was somewhat strange.  I did it on my bard.  I think it could be done solo on a 65 SK, or maybe lower level, but I'm not sure.   I'll tell you how I did it on my bard, and maybe someone can figure out a way for it to work with a SK =)<br />
<br />
First, my bard is non-kos.  This makes things much, much easier.  You can do what I did while KoS, but it might be rough.  Second, if you look behind the acolyte/ph spawn point, there is a little cubby to the left with some stalagtite/stalagmites on it.  I pulled him with slow to the cubby and pinned him against the wall between the 2 stalagtites.  Snare was absolutely necessary.  If he ran, he aggro'd the entire herbalist area (this did happen once, and I did die, even with FM-capable bard.  FM doesn't do much when a mob is fleeing becase it still calls for help and mobs still assist it).<br />
<br />
Anyway, he was fairly easy to kill, as were his PHs.  I have significantly less DPS than a Shadow Knight, and don't tank as well, so I'm fairly sure a level 65 SK could tank this unslowed.  I don't know about lower level SKs, though.  Camped this for about 8 hours total.  I also cleared a bunch of other nameds and named phs while I was there, so it wasn't a complete waste of time =)  You can tell when he is going to drop it because it looks like he is holding a dagger.  The one I killed that dropped it was holding the Greenish Shard in main hand and evac staff in offhand, but he only hit with piercing (he didn't hit with the staff).<br />
<br />
Did combines listed on walkthrough, and got Greenmist =)  Overall I did the quest in about 1.5 weeks - 2 weeks including the little factioning that I did.  I got extremely lucky on drops from what I've heard, and I think it was a fun quest to do =)<br />
<br />
Anyway, I hope this helps people who are working on this quest.  If you have any questions, feel free to post here and let me know!<br />
<br />
Take care,<br />
