<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Korzine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wanted to get some input as to what people think the most important AA abilities are. I've been storing the AA's and dont want to put them in the wrong spots. I play a Human ShadowKnight. I know that wasnt the best choice but to late now.:(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Need to know level and number banked....and probably should look in the spells and aa fora down the page.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Korzine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">65 SK with run3, sta5, nat dura 3, unholy steed, aprox 30AA banked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bloodmere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There are two main roads to go with AAs. Either you go mainly defensive and put the points first into Combat agility, combat stability, Physical enhancement, planar durability, lightning reflexes and innate defense. This is for the tanking shadowknight. If you have a tank when you play, the other route is DPS, with Spell casting fury, combat fury, improved harm touch, 2hand bash, soul abrasion, fury of ages, knights advantage, speed of the knight, unholy touch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Korzine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thank you for your input</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>synnoira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you have 30aa banked and you've got to the class aa stage (since you have Unholy Steed) i'd buy Combat Stability, Combat Agility and Physical Enhancement now. You'll see a significant boost to your tanking which for most folk is their regular job. Spell-casting Fury is a very nice aa to get since it supplies more damage and healing with lifetaps. Plus you will need it to get the big HT eventually and get full value out of Soul Abrasion. You may also want to think about getting Theft of Life which is good value for its price. Planar Durability and Planar Power are not all that spectacular for the aa spent. I would place getting ID5 and LR5 above them.</div></div><hr />
