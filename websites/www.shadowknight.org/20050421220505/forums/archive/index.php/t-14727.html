<br />
Where does the Quest Start? (since not specifically stated in the walk through)<br />
<br />
Why would I need the Faction? (or would that Deal with the Starting Point)<br />
<br />
What Level does it Proc at?<br />
<br />
Not that I would want to Cheat or anything, But can anyone list if what pieces are NO DROP and are just Regular pieces.  <br />
<br />
My brother BUYS 100k a month at the going rate $200 bux real money.  And I cant stand that... I am one of those EQ players that likes to earn what they get... (with some possible help along the way)  Not being Cheap...<br />

P.S.  I know you all are going to Flame me down to cinders on being  level 30 and asking about it, but I just want to get a head jump on a nice 1hs :) Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The quest starts in Cabilis in the Tower of Terror, which is why you need the faction.  In addition, you need amiable faction with Crusaders of Greenmist to even begin the quest, and there is a necromancer not more than five feet from the first quest NPC, so you'll need to be out of KOS range with them.<br />
<br />
As for the no drop vs tradable pieces, there are too many to list.  There are several walkthroughs and a very good checklist in the section of the same name on this board, so just check there for the required pieces.<br />
<br />
As for buying the item, well, we each play the game the way we like, and occasionally we're forced to do things we wouldn't normally do because of lack of time or assistance, but I'd recommend doing as much as you can yourself.  The reward isn't so great that it's worth buying the whole thing.  Most of the benefit of the quest is the feeling of accomplishment from doing it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ashrai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There are a few threads here you will want to look at and most likely print out. One is a nice concise Checklist on the basic items to assemble. Another has to do with just the factioning. I recently started this myself and have found both to be constant sources of reference. <br />
<br />
<br />
Where does the Quest Start? (since not specifically stated in the walk through)-<br />
------What you will want to do here is also use Allakhazam's. They go into great detail on each part of the quest. <br />
<br />
<br />
Why would I need the Faction? (or would that Deal with the Starting Point)-<br />
--------The Greenmist was formerly Iksar only. Basically what you have to do is to become so well liked by the various factions that they allow you to even start this quest. I would seriously advise that unless you really like quests and farming to consider if you want to undertake this.  I am doing all of my faction first before starting the actual quest. However you can get some of the drops here and there without any questing- much like an Epic. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Not that I would want to Cheat or anything, But can anyone list if what pieces are NO DROP and are just Regular pieces. <br />
------You can purchase your History of the Greenmist for about 1-2K. There are other parts you can purchase or MQ. Again, depends on how you want to go about this. You cannot purchase your Faction and that's a huge part of this. You can shortcut a bit with an illusion potion, and buy bonechips outright from players in Bazaar but that's about it. And yes, if you add up the pp you would spend IF you found the few droppables for sale, you could purchase a much superiour weapon.  <br />
<br />
Being level 30 is actually a good thing, as you can get a bit of exp while factioning some of this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wyrdlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Important:  Greenmist is an extension of the Khurki quests.  &quot;Beginning&quot; it is finishing the Lord of Pain's Khukri.<br />
<br />
You want to do this because as an SK you should strive to be fucking sexy (Pardon the language, but it's the real reason) whenever possible.  Also, if you are a gnome, you want to do it to piss off the Iksar and other &quot;pure&quot; SKs.<br />
<br />
Begin here to see the work you have to do to really BEGIN the Greenmist: http://forums.shadowknight.org/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=1412<br />
<br />
Buyable peices:<br />
<br />
THEORETICAL: Hero's Khurki -- Droppable, but I've never ever seen one for sale.  To get this you'd need another SK that gave up on the quest essentially. <br />
<br />
THEORETICAL: Lord of Pain's Khurki is MQable with someone who was willing to camp the Stupendous Tome.<br />
<br />
PRACTICAL:<br />
Greenish Metal Shard (Bazaar)<br />
History of the Greenmist (Bazaar)<br />
<br />
Mirror from Drusella is MQable.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It procs at 45 according to lucy.fnord.net.<br />
<br />
At level 30 you SHOULD be looking at this quest, because it will not be as painful for you to camp CoM and other parts while you get experience from them.  However, it is excruciating.</div></div><hr />
