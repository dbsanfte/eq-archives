<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tukka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Though I think I can recall a few scattered discussions on this topic in the past, I get too many irrelavent threads when I try to perform a search to find this info, so forgive me if I'm asking something that's already been answered many times.<br />
<br />
I'm a level 65 shadow knight who has close to no experience raiding.  I just joined a guild that's part of an alliance of other guilds that does some raiding, so I'm looking for some advice to help maximize my effectiveness and make the transition into raiding as best as possible.<br />
<br />
I'm already familiar with most of the generic words of wisdom and advice that people offer about raiding, but don't have a lot of SK-specific knowledge.<br />
<br />
Chiefly, I am wondering what spells I should be memorizing, as well as what buffs I should be asking for and clicking off.<br />
<br />
I presume I should be memorizing FD, snare, a lifetap, Zevfeer's Bite and a nuke or two, but aside from that?  Should I memorize Harmshield?  Is Aura of Hate valued on raids, or will the recourse just annoy my group?  Or does it depend on what group I'm put in?  Should I just ask the group?  What about pets, are they worth using, and worth buffing (reserving a mem slot for Augmentation of Death?)  I know that if the raid leader says no pets, to get rid of the pet, but otherwise?  I do have pet discipline.<br />
<br />
I'm not quite sure what buffs I should be looking for either, and also, I will admit to not completely understanding the effects and stacking issues of all the shaman spells.  I am assuming I want: P9, Symbol, Brell's, Focus7, Stamina, VoQ, SD, Cloak of the Akheva (don't have Luclin yet), SoC, plus whatever resist buffs are relavent.  How important are other stat buffs (ATK, STR, AGI) and other misc junk like regen?  Keeping in mind that none of my stats are at the max, even without Planar Power.  How many buffslots should I leave open for recourses, Paragon, DoTs and HoTs?  Is there anything else I'm missing?<br />
<br />
I suppose when OoW, this is one less thing I'll have to worry as much about, but I'd still like to know how you more expereinced raiding SKs rank various buffs in priority.<br />
<br />
You can check my magelo (linked in sig) to see where I'm at otherwise.  Obviously, I'm not going to be on the top of anybody's list to tank/offtank in raids, so I am guessing that I maybe should focus on doing what I can with my ghetto DPS until I'm more respectably geared.  As for the guild, they aren't pushing the envelope or anything for raid content.  Right now they are mainly raiding the elemental planes (not killing the gods there yet) with occasional excursions into Vex Thal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I usually keep harmshield up for raids, in case I get called upon to pull a hard hitting enemy that isn't aggroed on anybody else or get asked to pull a large train in some of the easier areas.  Aura of Hate depends on the group I'm in, if they want it I mem it (assuming we're fighting enemies that aren't immune to the nuke).  Pets are situational, but with Pet Discipline I'd say if you are allowed to have it up, definitely have it up.  Having a snare up is good, just be careful you don't dot something that needs to be mezzed.  If you're fighting enemies that are immune to fear (basically any mob 55 or higher), mem fear and use it for aggro.  Ignore the terrors and the voices unless specifically asked for voice.  In general our DoTs aren't that great, if you mem any just use Blood of Hate.  One or two lifetaps is a good idea in case you eat a riposte or are taking AE damage.  Definitely Zevfeer's if you can land it.  Spell lineup is situational in some respects, but you have a pretty good handle on it it seems.<br />
<br />
For buffs, agility is nearly worthless and is often the first buff I click off.  Strength is nice to have if you don't have max or nearly max strength (sorry, didn't check your magelo), as well as any stamina and dex increasing spells assuming you aren't maxed in those either.  The number of buff slots you should leave open depends on the encounter, most times one or two is sufficient.  Attack buffs are great to have, regen is nice but usually not necessary.  Obviously you want any buff that gives you hitpoints, mana regen and haste, for hitpoints Po9, Fo7, Symbol, Brell, Cloak is usually the way to go, while for mana regen having both the Enchanter buff and the Beastlord buff is nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tukka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Alright, thanks.  Magelo seems to be down at the moment, so you couldn't have checked my stats even if you wanted to.  Right now I'm only at 4450 HP unbuffed and 1227 AC (IIRC), so I don't know if there are many situations, for the time being at least, where I'll be asked to tank, but then I'm unfamiliar with the kinds of situations that raids can produce.  I'll try to keep Fear memorized just in case, I imagine I should be a sufficient, if not ideal tank against the trash in most of the zones we are raiding, at least.<br />
<br />
None of my stats are close to being maxed (STA being the closest at 211), but I am guessing star priority goes something like STA, STR, DEX, AGI, with the first one being the only one that's really that important.<br />
<br />
Thanks again.</div></div><hr />
