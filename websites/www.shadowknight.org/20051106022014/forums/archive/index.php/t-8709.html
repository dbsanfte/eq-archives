Ive been wearing a shissar scale headband since 30 b/c i cant stand the new helm graphics on females.  Now im shit out of luck for the head slot unless i stumble across a narrandi crown. They gave the males their custom velious helm graphic standard with Luclin, why the hell couldnt we get the bullet helms over these god aweful bucktooth chipmunk helms? /sigh</div></div><hr />

I liked the &quot;old graphic&quot; for the skull-helm, but after the graphics revamp, I am glad that my helm doesn't show a graphic at all. ;)<br />

Mind you Ive always thought everquest had some very ugly looking helmets. Check out the velious high elf female, its disgusting =P<br />

The Spiked Velium Helm, or something to that nature. Drops off the Enraged Relative in Tower of Frozen Shadow, lvl 5. It's No Drop, has some simple stats, among them is 5Str and like 10AC. Check it out<br />

I seen you around the Bazaar once in awhile and you just look sooo cute in that little bucktoothed chipmunk helm- /ducks and runs...<br />
<br />
Honestly though, yes the DE helm graphics suck.  I carry two helms on me, a Sentient, and an Exe Hood.  I hate the graphic of the Exe Hood, looks like a damned fucking blue and pink football helmet, but heck the Str and Dex stats on it are worth it.<br />
<br />
I like the graphic on the Sentient much better. If only I could find one with the same graphic and better stats, that I can actually afford.<br />

_Crown from icewell<br />

Nearly got a heart attack when I saw SoL models helm, and since on this you can add that they are awfully animated: bye ugly models, I'll never turn them on again<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kamlatir</div><div class="date">12-02-2002, 02:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That was uncalled for. Calling respectable Gravelords gnomes left and right! Simply uncalled for!<br />
<br />
I am a human shadowknight. Dark Elf, Troll, Ogre and what have you was too obvious for me, I like the subtle evil better. My human could just as well have been a paladin but he made a conscious choice to be evil. There's something much more corrupt about that which appeals to me and let us not forget that the first shadowknight ever was a human named Lhranc. He travelled the lands and tought you guys the arts (although I refuse to believe he ever deigned to be in contact with such a miniscule being as the gnome).<br />
<br />
Considering the subject maybe I should make a contribution instead of just ranting about the 95% dark elf shadowknights out there and it is this: humans also got the sharp end of the stick in the helmet department. I used to love the graphic on my custom blood lords crown but with Luclin models it's transformed into utter ugliness. I'm not ashamed to admit that at times I've removed it to let my bald pate shine through even though I actually needed the ac and stats :/</div></div><hr />

<br />
Granted, females look like bullets with overbites and eye holes, but the male plate helms make us look like someone squashed a gigantic bug on our heads.</div></div><hr />

And to all those that told me I was vain to give up AC/HPs for just a look, I always pointed out they were not wearing a butt ugly helm at the time...<br />

Thankfully I was able to find a helm that shows off Choz's head in it's fullest glory. Not saying what it is. Don't want VI to fuck with it as they did the crusty.</div></div><hr />

I can't believe any DE's would complain about any of their graphics.<br />

Try having a helm that looks like people should gather and pray in it... not to mention that any plate Bp makes me look fat... grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr  :mad:</div></div><hr />

Personally, i use the no graphic and occasionally, red croissant (blazing helm /grin..... phear the 61dd)</div></div><hr />

They deffently need to hire rl female game designers with taste on visual graphics and a bit more imagination. I about gave up my DE after Luclin came out, but i switched off the new models, so problem solved.<br />
<br />
Btw, graphicless helms should be more common, especially in the far end game (sux not wearing an uber ass helm due to crappy visual design, but i'm that vain too)</div></div><hr />
