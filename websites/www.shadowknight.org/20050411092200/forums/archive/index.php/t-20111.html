<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>RyuujinZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Newbie question of the day: how does a 47 SK pull and split mobs? Especially in LDoN's since there's 901823987234 mobs waiting to kill you in each room? And what kinda groups should I look for? All I know is I'm never joining a group again without a cleric to heal :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Presuming you're talking about some of the more mob packed themes (like Guk, Mistmoore or Takish), you're simply going to have to work on your feign splitting in tight quarters.  I typically don't have a problem with Guk or Mistmoore myself, but Tak can be challenging because of the doors and narrow hallways.<br />
<br />
I'd suggest working with a tagger and practicing your splitting technique in a less stressful environment first.  Try going to City of Mist and pulling in the stables for some feign splitting practice, then move up and on through Justice tunnels or some place a little more narrow until you feel comfortable enough to do so in an LDoN adventure.<br />
<br />
The basic idea is that you're cast a snare on your target mob, then run a short distance (usually about half way back to the group) and feign death.  This will bring all the mobs within aggro range toward you.  When you feign, the mobs will start walking back to their spawn points, but your snared mob will be slower (in another 2 levels, he won't move at all) and will naturally separate himself from the group, allowing the tagger to hit the mob with another spell or ranged item and bring him the rest of the way to the group, single.<br />
<br />
There are different variations on the specifics, but that is the most basic method of feign splitting.  Be sure that you have good communication with your tagger, so that he doesn't tag too soon, as it will negate all the work you've done.<br />
<br />
If you don't have anyone capable of tagging a split mob, you can always feign flop them away from the others, like monks do, but our feign spells are slower cast and slower refresh, so it's a little more difficult.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Theres a ton of tricks that make it easier.  Im sure people will drop them in here.<br />
<br />
Heres my contribution ... Caster mobs need line of sight to start casting.  If the pull is a caster + a melee, agro them and run around a corner.  The caster will probably start a spell the second you agro.  FD right after it hits.  You'll be left with the melee mob standing over you and the caster who hasnt moved.  Tagger brings melee, or F9 to look around the corner and confirm caster is reset.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dakkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Make a button that says &quot;Lull this %t now and tell me when you've done it&quot;.<br />
<br />
Keep the cleric, chanter or paly well up with you and use him/her to lull mobs.  Pretty soon you'll get the hang of how to do it - typically you lull one or two further mobs and pull the closest.<br />
<br />
Pull with a heavy snare, and if you get an add it'll arrive in camp well before the snared mob.  Then you can throw CD on the add a couple of times before the snared one gets to camp, then switch between the two of them casting CD by turns when the other arrives.  (That's assuming you can tank two mobs at once.)<br />
<br />
Both these techniques are much more effective than feign splitting for LDoN, because FD splits are a bit slow when you're on a time limit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ramgar SK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'd recommend not FD splitting in LDoN.  You have a slow FD with a long recast.  One failed FD and you may as well have pulled both anyway.  And that will happen.  You need an alternate way of handling it anyway when it does.<br />
<br />
At your level you should have the capability to pacify pull in your group.  A bard, enchanter, cleric, or paladin(49+) can do this at your level.  Tak and Guk limit this effectiveness with mob placement, but it's easily countered with a sneaking rogue or invis.<br />
<br />
Why aren't you pulling the extras and using CC?  Root, Mez, slow, or off tank.  A good slower/healer will make puling 2 or 3 no problem.  Just about anyone can root.  Necros, bards, and chanters can mez.<br />
<br />
Learn the capabilities of those you work with and assign roles before you start.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Arangar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">as you dont have run speed yet, make sure you get a sow before entering the dungeon - running faster = easier to get that distance needed to FD.<br />
<br />
that said, FD is usually not the way to go in LDoN.</div></div><hr />

If it looks like a duck, sounds like a duck....<br />

I didn't even pay attention to his level. <br />

Feign splitting is not recommended in normal difficulty adventures, true.  Before 50, you probably won't have a problem tanking multiples anyway, and root park is extremely useful for CC, provided you're not grouped with a bunch of dumb asses who don't know how to get out of the way of a rooted mob.<br />
<br />
Lull pulling is a bit trickier now that they've lowered the timer on those spells.  The recast time prevents you from lulling a whole room and pulling a single out of it, but after a few adventures you'll figure out what the typical mob distribution is for any of the given room shapes in a theme and you'll be able to choose which mobs to lull pretty easily.  I wouldn't try to lull more than two at a time unless you're using a bard for this.  They seem to be able to cast their lull a bit faster than the chanters/clerics/paladins I've grouped with.  You can also head down to the crystalline spider cave in Crystal Caverns and pick up some Crystalline Silk Nets if you want to have a clicky root available to you for pulling.  It can be useful to have one or two of them on you for difficult pulls.  Typically though, by the time you've had a few successes, you'll figure out the best way to pull for your regular group, and how many mobs they can handle at once.<br />
<br />
In normal difficulty groups, I can usually bring up to 6 back at once and not worry about it, though occasionally we'll have a little trouble if we've had to take a few pickup folks.<br />
<br />
Looking at mob placement can also help you out tremendously with pulling.  On your first few pulls, pay close attention to how large the aggro radius of the pulled mob is.  Note which surrounding mobs come with him, and how the aggro seems to chain.  You can sometimes break a room simply by changing where you're pulling from and walking a mob back to camp via a longer route (library rooms in Takish theme are great to demonstrate this.  You can pull center of the room mobs around the outside edge of the room and avoid adds fairly easily).  Be forewarned that some mobs in some rooms in some themes (can it get any more general? :D ) will have some strange pathing issues that might cause them to bring more than you originally intended.  <br />
<br />
I usually call out to my CC classes how many I think I'll be bringing and which mobs they should be specifically looking to get off of me.  &quot;three incoming, please mez the fast elf and the stone, my target is the robe&quot; is typically enough to let them know what I expect and to give them a little time to prepare themselves mentally for what they're going to have to do.</div></div><hr />
