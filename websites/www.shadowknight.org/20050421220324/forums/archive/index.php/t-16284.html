<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Anlyn Sny</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been currently working on gettign all factions raised to enter Cabilis and start working on the Quest for the Greenmist but would like to start from square 1 if at  all possible, was wondering if anyone knows how to get the Pawns Khukri for a non lizard or where to jump in at to MQ with one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Newark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Its a common thread, do a search for the details on HOW to do it... but the simple answer is - if your NOT an Iksar, the ONLY way your going to do this is to MQ the newbie sword.<br />
<br />
The quest to replace a lost newbie weapon in Cabilis will not work for NON-Iksars.<br />
<br />
&lt;lol&gt;  In fact, I just went back and found - This (http://forums.shadowknight.org/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=1412) in one of the stickies... check out step 1  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lunawhite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">MQing the newbie weapon is disabled cause a quest is added.<br />
I tryed to MQ by making a new iksar SK but simply I couldn't.<br />
<br />
Quest to get a newbie weapon is described here :<br />
http://www.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1259<br />
<br />
and the one who gives this quest for SK is the spell vendor on top floor of left tower when you facing the SK guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>DrMobius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I started my greenmist just a tad over a month ago, started an iksar to hand in the khukri, then turned in the heads.  Worked fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Newark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The quest to replace lost newbie weapons, as listed on Allas', only works for Iksars.   In the quest you have to collect bone shards/fragments or something.. these are made by equiping a certain hammer (quest giver provides) and hitting mobs.  When the hammer procs, bone chips are converted into the proper item for the quest.<br />
<br />
Hammer is only equipable by Iksars.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lunawhite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">No, it changed. Now it's equippable by all races which an SK can be.<br />
I did the quest as an erudite and it's the only way to start greenmist as a non-iksar for now cause pawn's khukri MQ has been nerfed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Newark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Last night (9/10/03) I went and checked the Toilmaster out.  Sure enough (as Lunawhite said), The Hammer of Exoneration has been fixed.  It is now equipable by all SK races.  This means that ANY Shadow Knight race (with the proper factioning) can now do this quest.<br />
<br />
I did not bother to try and check the MQability of the newbie sword.<br />
<br />
Good Luck! :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>tremere98</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I MQ'ed the newbie Khukri about mid-april to start my Greenmist.  As of then, it still worked.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ashrai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I did a lot of my quest out of order, so it was only a week or so ago that I actually made my newbie Iksar to do the first part- worked fine. However- I did this with both accounts logged on, handing in together. Worked fine.<br />
<br />
No idea if it still works in the old way of logging off your newbie Iksar and logging on your SK to complete it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>armengarkai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">guess mines most recent attempt, i gathered all the suff needed for the first quest, combined them<br />
then i made a new ikky sk and did turn in, logged out and back to my human sk, did the turn in and got the result of the quest...<br />
so it does work, at least recently (note u need amible faction to do i have been told) this was in september 03</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Atlis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I helped a gnome start his Greenmist khukris.  I told him to start with Penance since I didn't want to make an Iksar SK newbie.  Then we realized the hammer can't be used by gnome shadow knights.  The MQ works fine.  Just get your amiable faction which is required to start the quests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kowl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I finnally got my faction up enought to start the Greenmist yesterday. I got the bag and filled it with the sarnak heads and ran back to Calibis. I had a friend in the guild make an Iskar SK and he turned in his Khurki and then I turned in the bag. I got the sword without a hitch. No problems at all :D <br />
<br />
Now off to kill Froglok Raiders</div></div><hr />
