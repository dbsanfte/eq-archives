If I recall correctly...Brael posted a conversation he had with a programmer and they talked about this issue.  I don't remember all the details but I do remember that there was a weird glitch with the way they initially tried to make a death peace hot key - maybe something about recast time.  But the conversation made it clear that it was a programming thing, not a monk bitchfest thing.  I understand your frustration, but if you keep it to the facts you will have a much better chance of making a positive change.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i dont havta work slightly more, i just get do to die &quot;alot&quot; more from cast time bugs, spell intrupts and fizzles. i accually played a wizerd as an alt for a time, but the character wasnt what i started and grew to enjoy. between my equipment and a few tribute points i have max FT, but thats not the point, we got denied lich because of necromancers claiming showknights would become &quot;too powerful&quot; &quot;unstoppable&quot; because the class can wear a fungi tunic. and who said i cant keep aggro ? were in the fuck did that come from? your ass apperently<br />

<br />
ive tried lighting farts before and one time i accually got my ass singed! ya i feel i worked harder, but so did everyone else. these days you see people lvl a class to 65 in under 24 hours, example- now that im 65 i should go group! why do people keep diying? could it be because i have no fucking clue what im doing?) and the wizzy thing?  na like i said i tried it, need to be in your face melee beating on something. prison? ive been there not going back either.  i catch you underwater im shoving a shark up your ass</div></div><hr />
