<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">window</div><div class="date">01-02-2004, 02:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">if you use search you'll find plenty of posts. you can use an asterisk to make pet fit in the search (ie pet*).<br />
<br />
anyway, as was already explained:<br />
<br />
target mob<br />
/pet attack<br />
when the mob is hit, /pet hold<br />
pet comes back with mob chasing, single.<br />
<br />
if your pet dies, or someone casts on your pet or the mob, or you are sitting, it won't come single.<br />
if you FD before having your pet attack, it is &quot;safer&quot;.. so if you're in a spot where mobs do assist on your pet, or if your pet dies, they won't agro on you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Klotar AngedeMorts</div><div class="date">01-02-2004, 04:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We generally aren't supposed to talk about it because it's likely not intended.  But as mentioned, it's been discussed enough times here if you look for it.<br />
<br />
If you FD first before sending the pet in, and spam /pet back off or /pet hold, the mob comes back single and other mobs will not assist.  This assumes your pet has enough hit points or is buffed so that it makes it back to you.<br />
<br />
Assuming that you FD'd out of aggro range, and the pet made it back to you alive, you can stand up and whack the mob (thereby saving your pet) and you have it single.  Using FD takes care of any &quot;your pet is or is not green to the mob&quot; issues of singles, it ALWAYS comes back with a single.  Have used this on King in Chardok, Protectors of Zek in Kael, lizards in Cazic-Thule, Black Reavers in CoM, etc.<br />
<br />
If you stand up too soon; i.e. if pet is still in aggro range of the OTHER mobs or your pull is still in assist range of the other mobs, you will get aggro.  If you FD'd and you had aggro already before sending in a held pet, you aren't guaranteed a single (depends on if your memwipe was successful -- wouldn't count on it).  Sowing or Shrewing your pet helps, along with hp/ac buffs.  And as mentioned above, healing the pet or otherwise runing it on the way back etc. will ruin a single pull.<br />
<br />
If you set it up right -- /pet guard here at the right spot (behind you preferably but within pet command range) and with you out of aggro range, and you FD before the pull and not stand up until the pet has returned to you with the mob, it's never failed.  Stand up too early because the pet died halfway or whatnot and you may or may not get a single.<br />
<br />
I don't feel that it's a major secret/trick/exploit because generally it doesn't work on high level mobs, simply because our best pet (lvl 41 warrior) won't last that long against a hard hitting mob, even if it has virtue/7th/sta etc. buffs.   On lower level mobs, you might lose a few pets trying to figure out the right spot to FD in before sending in your pet, and may end up costing you more mana to make the pets and buff them than it would to split the mobs the conventional ways.  And on lower lvl mobs than that, you probably could just single pull without FD or the pet.<br />
<br />
This does not enable us to do anything more than we can do already.  In some situations, it can save a lot of time; especially in places where space is tight for FD pulling or when no pacify/harmony is available.  Other times, the pet just won't live long enough for it to work.  And other times, it's more trouble than it's worth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ashrai</div><div class="date">01-03-2004, 02:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good place to &quot;practise&quot; your petpulling would be stalkers camp in PoN. You've got a lot of room to move, and good line of sight to get a feel for how quickly to pull your pet back. Agro range on the stalkers is large enough to get you used to where to FD. <br />
<br />
<br />
A lot of it is getting used to having him just smack the mob then getting him out of there immediately- he can't take many hits and the more he is engaged with the mob, the harder a time you have pulling them both back.  <br />
<br />
The hardest part is getting your pet back alive, or just keeping him alive until you have a clean tag, and keeping control of him when he keeps wanting to turn and tank your mob- if you have a long way back to camp you may need to sit kite it to keep it from ripping up your pet. <br />
<br />
I use it when I'm splitting something where the mobs take forever to path back, or there's a chance of a repop soon in my pull path, etc- it's basically just a timesaver then. Also useful in LDoN if all else is failing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Amphitryon</div><div class="date">01-06-2004, 07:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I 2 box often w/ a lvl 54 cleric and I cast Virtue on my pet. Helps a whole bunch in getting the pet back alive.<br />
<br />
But even then hes pretty messed up by the time he gets where I can take over and staying out of aggro range of other mobs can be hairy depending on where you are at.<br />
<br />
And its not a fast way to pull by any means. Its just less messy than FD splitting (dont need all the space either)<br />
<br />
Im not worried about talikg about this. Its not that wonderous of a thing and its not something I do often anyway. Personally pet pulling gets annoying real quick</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aethor</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 09:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you are FDed, healing the pet won't get agro on the healer. I had a cleric chain healing my pet in VT during pulls. Just tell the healers that fast heals are needed, not CH or heal-over-time.<br />
<br />
If the pet is DAed by a cleric, he can pull ubermobs. <br />
<br />
You can pull a boss mob out of a cluster of mobs in this way.</div></div><hr />

Does anyone do this with much success just using /pet back off?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dhantes</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 06:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">just on a side note what do you buff pets with? i normally buff pet with faith (too cheap to virtue it) Infusion of Strength, talisman of kragg and stamina. I asked a bl to buff my pet that way though last night on a ldon where i was on boxing cleric and he told me that sta does nothing for pet?<br />
<br />
I find pet pulling highly useful thought i really really prefer pet pulling if im playing cleric i dont like having to trust a bad healer to keep my frail pet alive.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The mob is quad 800s or so..the pet wont last long enough to move him noticeably.<br />

p.s : nice tip on the pet DA<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenadar W'Vern</div><div class="date">01-13-2004, 10:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've always just used back off without bothering with FD and I never get adds.  Pulled Magus from beside Naggy using this and didn't aggro Naggy to get myself banished.  Have pulled most of Droga using this method.<br />
<br />
Always best to try and get pet buffed first if its a big mob as if pet dies before mob is away from potential adds then pain inc.  Usually just get a cleric with a clicky Donals or something to give pet Valor.<br />
<br />
I have noticed that sitting down causes the pull to run to you and not bother with pet but I occasionally get adds that way, not 100% but too often to risk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elysea</div><div class="date">01-13-2004, 11:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Can the pet still attack a mob and get agro with Cleric-cast DA on it?  That's pretty nice, if so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aethor</div><div class="date">01-19-2004, 11:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, DAed pet can get agro and pull the mob. I used it when I wanted to pull a boss mob out of a cluster of small mobs, or when I had two boss mobs in the same spot - example, I used it on Raex and Vindor in Carprin cycle, those mobs will 1 round the pet if not DAed, even a fully buffed one. I FDed, had a cleric DA the pet, and the pet single pulled without problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Squigle D'Muerte</div><div class="date">01-20-2004, 10:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">BTW the best way to get your pet to return to guard spot as fast as possible is to tell pet to attack a mob which is out of his range.  Once you do so pet will RUN all the way back to guard position (instead of walking).  Be warned though if mob isn't out of range you're screwed :D <br />
<br />
So SoW pet and get him to run if you can and you should be able to get him away from mobs more easily.</div></div><hr />

I got /pet hold and everytime ive tried FD out of aggro range then sending in the pet, soon as it attacks something all the mobs assist, and beat the snot out of the pet.. Yes i succesfully FD'd and i was well out of aggro range..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daegul Mistweaver</div><div class="date">02-15-2004, 12:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looks like this got nerfed during the GoD patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ashrai</div><div class="date">02-15-2004, 03:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I petpull constantly in LDoN, past 3 nights straight in fact due to some weird mezzer shortage, and haven't had any problems.  I don't have /pet hold however, perhaps if it was nerfed it was just with the use of /pet hold? You don't even need to FD if you're out of agro range of the nearest mob- I just send in the pet and try to keep him in my line of sight, meaning he has a straight line back to me. Jabober is not too smart about corners, stairs, etc. - but have never had another mob assist on what he's pulling unless people get stupid and try to debuff his target while they're still in agro range of other mobs.</div></div><hr />

pet pulling will be nerfed i bet. too many know about it / brag about it / taunt poor monkies with it..just like mages used to brag about pet canni mana regen..</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ashrai</div><div class="date">02-15-2004, 12:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">But the reason it works is because of a nerf in the first place. Nerf the SK petpullers and they would have to go back to having every real pet class whining about their pets agro'ing everything that wanders into the same zip code.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Makkon</div><div class="date">02-16-2004, 10:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ashrai, not really, it works because the pet is green. Does not work if the pet doesn't con green to the mob. I see an easy &quot;fix&quot;, do you? :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ashrai</div><div class="date">02-17-2004, 01:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The green con thing was a given, our pet is a green con to a moss snake practically :(<br />
<br />
I see a few &quot;fixes&quot; sure- but can't come up with any that wouldn't totally unbalance/screw everything up.<br />
<br />
#1 make all our pets a little higher level so they would be light blue to most of the mobs we're fighting<br />
-- we'd just use the next lower and buff it up more<br />
--we'd end up with a more powerful pet (hey and a use for the pet AAs they tossed at us) <br />
<br />
#2 do something with the agro programming on mobs so that a green con NPC will still trigger assists from whatever it's attacking<br />
--could have repercussions/effects on all pets then, thereby getting pet classes in an uproar. SK's are the redheaded stepchild anyway, would be too much effort for Sony to do something to the SKs that would affect any of the classes they actually give a sh!t about.<br />
<br />
<br />
#3 Take our pets away completely (followed by our ability to weild weapons, etc)<br />
<br />
<br />
#4 Turn our pets into rangers that spontaneously combust if they get more than 5 feet away from you<br />
<br />
#5 Turn our pets into enchanter type pets- meaning they don't attack unless we're hit first. &lt;--- this is the only one I see them being able to do easily but then they'd have to acknowledge that we are not a pure pet class and actually are supposed to be tanking mobs now and then. But this is the one that would seriously suck, and would be easy to do to us.<br />
<br />
I may be missing something- probably am, who knows what evil lurks in the minds of the Nerf Team at SOE. /sigh<br />
<br />
Anyways, it would have to be something minor- they just seem to have completely discarded SKs altogether, and I can't see them bothering with so much as an hour of coding to do something to us when it's a situational tool at best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Makkon</div><div class="date">02-17-2004, 03:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">you put a lot of thought into it :-) simply bumping level to 60 like nec/mage/bl/shm etc pets is what i had mind. i have to bust out ole 49 pet vs my much more powerful pets to do it<br />
<br />
though i steadfastly will argue that sk deserve the lvl 53 nec rogue pet, bumped up in level to 60, maybe with a few sk specific gimmicks like life or manataps that heal or regen mana of their owner..or perhaps the group?<br />
<br />
some argue that sk need a rogue pet with 3k hp (more than nec 63 rogue pet by far) and higher dps than 63 nec rogue but i disagree :P<br />
<br />
speaking of ranger pets..heh..they gave nec &quot;skeletal archers to harry your foe&quot; haha. they are utterly worthless..much like the class they are modeled after :P the crappiness of GoD aa's is a whole other thread though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kuvak</div><div class="date">02-20-2004, 05:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe a SOE rep recently said &quot;Our nerfing days are behind us...&quot;. If that is to be believed, then don't expect pet pulling to be nerfed. Rather, expect SKs to be ignored while everyone else is given power boosts, ala GoD, where warriors were boosted so much they now surpass SKs in every way except pulling.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Klotar AngedeMorts</div><div class="date">02-20-2004, 05:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've never run into this 'green con' thing.  Our 64 pet cons light blue to a lvl 61... so it won't be green unless I am pulling 62+ mobs using the pet.<br />
<br />
Most of the mobs I'd xp on are less than 61 for the most part (especially when 2-box or 3-box), and I haven't had other mobs assist on my pet pull yet (keeping in mind I do FD first).  So to most mobs, the pet cons blue.<br />
<br />
What am I missing here?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kuvak</div><div class="date">02-27-2004, 07:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe if the pet cons light blue to the mob, then they won't bother to assist on the pet, but if it cons dark blue or higher, they will. I thought that being FD would solve that problem, but it does not, as I found out in the PoJ basement recently, where the mobs are light blue to dark blue range to me at 65. I made pet, FDed, sicked pet on one, got two to come running after my pet. Bad thing was, then another added, so I had to kill three of them things, and without a healer. Managed OK though, luckily those things aren't that tough. I hope this helps.<br />

I stand corrected.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As far as named in LDoN; it doesn't work because MOBs near to the named are, I belive, treated as pets of the named...so will agro regardless.</div></div><hr />

The mobs in the hard adventure conned the pet green (as they were over lvl 61).  At least, that's how I'm interpreting it; since the pet is light blue to lvl 61 PC's but green to 62+.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daegul Mistweaver</div><div class="date">03-06-2004, 01:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Doesn't hold water with my scenario; things at the Kael bank are green to me, so not even close to 61+ and they agro'd.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shadowfox98</div><div class="date">03-07-2004, 09:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Been pet pulling awhile, ever since I accedently sent litle joboner into a huge room of ugly mobs and had to get him out and nothing agroed but main mob.  Since the pacify Nerf I've had to become a good puller.  In tight dungeons like some of the LDoN's I use my pet since space to FD split is limited.<br />
<br />
The FD trick has yet to work out for me.  For some reason on DB to white mobs they all agro pet and kill him.  IF I am standing when I send him in pull him back fast once he hits it then I'm golden NEVER had an add (unless someone does something stupid which is why I give a one minute breif on what to do not do with pet pulls :) )  <br />
<br />
So standing up out of agro range and sicking pet on mob bringing him back brings the mob.  I recommend NOT pulling caster mobs with pet, specially wizard mobs, since the caster can stand way back within agroe of other mobs and nuke poor boner to dust.  IF boner dies and sometimes if healer heals boner, even though he is back with group you will get agro from the rest of the mobs.<br />
<br />
I taught some wizards and necros how to do the same trick any class with controlable pets can pet pull....</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since when do wizards get controllable pets???<br />
<br />
As for necros pet pulling, yes any necro can pet pull as well as any SK. Only diff is they have higher level pets to choose from, and they need to make sure their pet cons lower than dark blue to the mobs they're splitting. My wife always uses Invoke Death pet on her 65 necro to pet pull LDON. Anything higher and she gets adds.<br />
