2. Do you have to Go into the Tower?<br />
3. Does It Require any Keys to get to him?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Messer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1.  Glohnor is inside a coffin at #4 on the eqatlas map<br />
2.  No need to go in the tower, Glohnor is in the west courtyard.<br />
3.  No keys.<br />
<br />
When I did this two weeks ago, took about 45 minutes tops to make our way there, gank him and leave.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ravenar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">1. How do you get to Ghost of Glohnor?<br />
The Ghost is somewhere at the Undead Tower.  I realize the before post said he was at #4, but I beg to differ.  Of the last five times I have gone after him since the Hole revamped, only twice has he been there.  Once he was in  the East courtyard, once in the undertower accesed by the West courtyard, and once he was almost on the top floor of the tower.<br />
<br />
Each and everytime so far the mummy did not auto aggro from the &quot;basement&quot; and we had to go pull him.<br />
<br />
2. Do you have to Go into the Tower?<br />
<br />
Once in five tries we did.<br />
<br />
<br />
3. Does It Require any Keys to get to him?<br />
<br />
No.<br />

Little secret: Paladins and Clerics using DB and Knights and Necroes using Harmshield can jump to number 7 on the map above by fallling into the Hole immediately after acitivating their DB.  From there a CoH mage's dueled no XP loss corpse can be summoned from the Hole entrance and the rest of the raid CoHed down.  Saves you a lot of time especially if you have a bigger raid going for Kirn and the Ghost at the same time.  <br />
<br />
Doing it this way allows you to have to fight only 8 mobs to get to the Tower.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Naaklum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">For me he was in the courtyard in the coffin.  Mummy aggroed us in the courtyard at the doorway from the front of the tower near gargoyles.  He was fairly easy, but did have a few hp's.  We had about 16 peeps there though, so it was pretty simple.  Took a few hits to damage him, but once his health started dropping it dropped fairly quick.  He's one groupable IMO once you get to him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ravenar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have a theory that the mummy aggro depends on what level the person doing the turn in is.  When I was 52 and did mine, the mummy came straight away(of course that was almost a year ago).  The 60 we had do it recently did not gain aggro and I had to go pull the mummy.   *shrugs*  Just a theory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aoninie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Have a mage or Wiz use eye of zomm to locate him. He spawned on the right side for me and the mummy auto agroed on me. If your raid is in the mid 50's you need a good puller to clear the courtyard. 60+ should be a breeze.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Krushum Gudended</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I was 51 or 52... one time I had to pull him, the other he came.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>halcyonforever</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">From experience I know that he also respawns fairly quickly, before everything else in the courtyard.  I have a screenshot if you want to see half of a dead raid right ontop of him..<br />
<br />
Our group #1 (Main Cleric, Raid Leader, MT) got evacced by mistake by a very sorry druid.  Group 2 saw Group 1 go poof and their evaccer hit..  Groups 3, &amp; 4 did not Evac, killed the mob we were fighting and waited for groups 1 &amp; 2 to fight their way back.  Well while we were waiting a wandering gargoyle found us, marched back and got LOTS of friends and everyone but the shadow knight died.</div></div><hr />
