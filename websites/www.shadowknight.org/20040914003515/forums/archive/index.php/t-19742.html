<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Darkadian Dy'Shaynn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK, i was resently on today talking with another shadowknigh and the effect on the Elemental SK BP is Fury of Bertox says it increases spell damage by 35% for all detramental spells.. that are instant casts.  Now i would think this would improve HT damage but he told me it didnt, or atleast not anymore?  Can someone figure this out for me.. if anyone know let me know please.<br />
<br />
Also if it doesnt effect HT is there any Augments you can buy from LDON that do raise the damage of your HT?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cyrielle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Improved HT is unresistable based  Only  X of Solusek line works <br />
<br />
Normal Unholy aura is DR based     X of Bertox Line works + X of Solusek line.<br />
<br />
Normal HT w/o disc is MR based     X of Druzzil line works+X of Solusek line.<br />
<br />
  X here being Anger or Fury etc...<br />
<br />
<br />
So BP works with Taps such as Bite and Auras also works with Spear. Thats'ts it.<br />
Bp effect isnt that great for sk (especially if you have a spool)  but other stats are worth it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It also says disease only, which means it doesnt work with IHT.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Darkadian Dy'Shaynn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">With that all cleared up, are there any augments that you can use to improve your HT damage? if so where and how many points please</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Duck_72</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The is an ID II item from Guk or south ro  that improves HT</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>lorddaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">shouldnt' any generic ID item improve HT damage.<br />
<br />
but ID limits itself to 20% focus damage iirc.<br />
<br />
the specific &quot;god&quot; focus's can go up to 36%. <br />
<br />
that's iirc of course.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Max damage focus in pop is 35% actually, with ldon time lvl raids max damage focus is 40%</div></div><hr />
