<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>DConquest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">2 AAs I think would be extremely appropriate to our class would be as follows...<br />
<br />
&lt; Creative name here &gt; - It would increase the DD portion of Aura of Pain, Aura of Hate, Zev Bite (s), Lifetaps (?), Spears by 100 per rank ( 3 ranks ).<br />
<br />
Reason for this AA:  We usually cast multiple recourses per mob, and atm due increasing power of Melee weapons ( both ours and that of others ) it is actually subtracting from our DPS to cast so many spells.  Making the recourse DDs more powerful would make these spells be more in line with Melee dmg. <br />
<br />
Also, would like to see lifetaps included though Necros might find this over powering.  A major issue I find between SKs and Paladins is that their damage mitigation spells ( Stuns ) scales with mobs.  The more dps a mob does, the more they save from stunning a mob.  SKs damage mitigation spells ( lifetaps ) never scale.  We lifetap for the same amount no matter how much a mob hits for.  Thus there should be a way to increase it's power.<br />
 <br />
<br />
Life Leech - This AA would drain 10 percent of the damage dealt per rank and add it to our health ( 3 ranks ).  Adding more to the problem I started earlier.  If we're not going to be even close in the dmg mitigation abilites of Warriors or Paladins, something like this would at least close the gap.  Even at 30 percent, if we're dealing 150 dps melee ( hard to do ) that is an extra 45 dps being shaved off the mobs melee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Krazaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I was thinking about this the other day.  The more powerful our weapons get, the less efficient it is for us to cast spells.<br />
<br />
With hard hitting but fast weapons, we basically break even with DPS while casting our lifetaps.  Touch of Innoruuk doesn't add any DPS if I miss a round of combat to cast it.<br />
<br />
First thing I'd like to see is a change to spell casting haste.  At 65th we have innate 45% casting haste, which leaves little room for improvement with the cap at 50%.  If our cap was raised to something like 75%, we could benefit from focus items.<br />
<br />
Second, is a toggleable skill that allows us to double our damage and delay.  Net DPS gain from melee would be zero, but we could cast more without losing so much DPS.<br />
<br />
EDIT:  I also think it is time for them to up our offensive weapon skills.  We have to work twice as hard as a pure melee to put out respectable DPS.  The only way to keep up with even Warrior's DPS anymore is to melee, DD, DoT and use pet.</div></div><hr />
