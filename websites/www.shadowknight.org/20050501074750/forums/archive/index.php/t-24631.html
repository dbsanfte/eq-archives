<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mikazu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I hate goblins in PoN. The xp is slow, the kills take too long, and while it's been fun to watch my tanking progress through level 59, 60, and now a few kills into 61, I NEED to find somewhere new.<br />
<br />
I went to the plane of storms and found some cave with a bunch of frogs and a whirlwind in it. The xp was really nice there (5% aa xp per on a duo), and the kills seemed not too difficult, although those bloody frogs were hitting for high 500s, which seemed a bit excessive for a level 60 mob. Plus the tunnel wasn't condusive to duo'ing, as it the slow took too long to land after malo, given it's such a tight space.<br />
<br />
So anyhoo, I'm wondering if there's a spot in any tier 1 or 2 pop zone with a relatively easy to set up spot with a few typical level 60ish mobs (melee type preferred ;)).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rhumba_Kween</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My favorite spots before BoT were:<br />
<br />
1) Plane of Storms - In the desert area there are various mobs. All easier than those frogs. The thing you really want here though is the medals off of the Diaku. After you collect 4 of these medals (or whatever they are) you can alternate flag one full group for Tactics, which is a great XP spot at 64-65.<br />
<br />
2) Plane of Valor - Either Caves or Other side of zone from zone in are great xp. The xp in Valor is a bit better if memory serves, but both are great spots and a nice step up from PoN.<br />
<br />
3) You might also try Gargoyles in PoN. They were my favorite spot until we moved to Storms. You find these around the castle area. They are simmilar xp to Goblins, but seem lots easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mikazu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks. Those are some amazing suggestions. :)<br />
<br />
So for tactics access, it requires 4 medallions that any of the mobs in the desert area drop? Good to know ... I might give that a try then.<br />
<br />
I was sort of angling to stay away from PoV when dual boxing. Not sure why, but I just like out of the way empty type zones, off the beaten track, as it were. I was considering Torment (the mobs there only hit for mid 400s), but iirc the birds by the zone proc an aoe silence spell, which was always a HUGE pain in the ass when I was grouping there before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zedlepln</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Torment - Invis past the birds, you can xp all day on the bridge 2 box and even have room. I can't say how rewarding the xp will be, but you have plenty of room to maneuver.<br />
<br />
The NE corner of PoV is also very isolated and solid xp for the level. CoD may also be empty, but I seem to remember the xp being a little less than PoV.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rhumba_Kween</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">So for tactics access, it requires 4 medallions that any of the mobs in the desert area drop? Good to know ... I might give that a try then.<br />
<br />
No, only Diaku drop the medallions. And they are a somewhat rare spawn. But you should see a couple a night.<br />
<br />
Not sure how crowded PoV is anymore, but can't imagine its that crowded anymore. The xp there really is about the best at that level though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Maniacles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">note about the daiku...they aren't aggro, but all the OTHER mobs assist them with ridiculous assist ranges, and port in on you when they wander back into pursuit range, so pull them only after you've cleared a bunch of the wanderers that hang where they are at.</div></div><hr />

Sorry to sidetrack my own thread here, by the above quote caught my eye.<br />
<br />
What level were you when you started hitting BoT? And are we talking a simple duo here, or in a full group? And any specific camp if it *is* a duo we're talking about here?<br />
<br />
Sorry for all the annoying questions. Thanks for all the info. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rhumba_Kween</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I would definitely say a full group until 65. You could do fewer, but those giants have lots of hps so not sure how good of a spot it would be with a duo, until your dps is good. Also alot will depend on your gear, and I don't see a magelo listed.</div></div><hr />

Key word:<br />
Before.<br />
<br />
So therefore he is talking about simple duo before heading out to BoT, and if you read earlier he is 60 (from what I think atm) and so he wouldn't be able to enter BoT unless he had the key already, which IMO, is very unlikely + like you said it's hard to duo there, etc.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps see what your eye caught  ;)</div></div><hr />
