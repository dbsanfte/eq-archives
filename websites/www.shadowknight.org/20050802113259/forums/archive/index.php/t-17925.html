She's pretty good but im wondering what kind of wep's should i use and equip? i just bought my SK a few things and her stats are pretty good (Str is pretty low still /cry)<br />
<br />
She's lvl 26 Sk, been MT in Ldon grps which works i either use my new 1hnd blunt wep that skills are just flying up with (who knew u could hit in the 50s with a 1 hander at lvl 26 with 11Dmg, and 107 str?!) or the cheap but decent Weighty polearm (max hit with it is 90 i belive done at ll 24 in HHK) <br />
<br />
I dont have a maegelo link fr my Sk but i belive her HP is like 1K unbuffed Ac like 500-600 not sure though.... As for Fd practice i plan to try that in younger zones then move to CC or something after i get somewhat good at it.. Am i doing good so far? Tuants in the 130's i cast lifetap and VE as much as i can and tap Str, Attack and HP when needed. lemmie know am i doing good as a Sk so far? =p</div></div><hr />

I myself have that and a Disease Imbued Greatstaff, both ran about 6k each</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dakkin</div><div class="date">10-29-2003, 09:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your DE can't Slam with 2 handers equipped, and Bash is useful not only for interrupting casters but also adds extra aggro which is important at low levels now you can't buy KEI so mana's not limitless anymore.<br />
<br />
I'd suggest getting a decent one hander and shield, but spending some time each level getting your 2Hs up with the polearm because you'll probably want to use 2Hs when you get high level (especially when you get the AA to let you bash while wielding 2 handers).<br />
<br />
If you want a decent 2Hs now, maybe a Reaver or something like that with a decent ratio that's not level restricted.  For later on, there's a thread in the equipment forum on this website that lists all the top weapons like WMBS, Windblade and so on.<br />
<br />
Don't worry too much about it though; at higher levels your melee damage contribution is relatively small, and the wizard in your group will care less whether you're wielding a WMBS or a fishing pole.  This is because he expects you to spend all your time spamming spell taunts on the mob to stop it ripping him to shreds while he chains his multi-K crit nukes on it.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps - and happy to hear you're having fun with your SK :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wolff-Kishner</div><div class="date">10-29-2003, 06:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just buy a Sarnak Battle Shield or a Clay Guardian Shield.  I used my CGS from lvl 1 to 30 then bought a SBS when they were running 1k each.  Now I have 2 different shields and a couple different 2handers to swap in an out depending on my fight.  Look into a Mace of Shadowed Souls if you enjoy your 1hander.  Pickup one of each weapon and get your skills up in all of them.  It's worth have 200+ in all skills due to the nice higher level no drop weapons out there.</div></div><hr />

You won't believe the damage you will be doing.<br />
<br />
<br />
Get a 2 hander to keep your skill up.  Later on in your life, 90% plus of the time will be spent with a 2handed weapon.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Millq Toasst</div><div class="date">11-18-2003, 09:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another good 1 handed weapon is the Butterknife of Doom aka Shard of Night.  I've seen the price on this thing fluctuate wildly so watch the bazaar like a hawk.  I used a MoSS until I lucked into my Butterknife and it's been my main 1 handed weapon since.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hatre</div><div class="date">11-18-2003, 09:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a young SK I would make sure that me, my pet, all of my group permanently have endure cold cast on them to get those abjuration skills up.  FD practice when you get to it will be a lot less infuriating if your not fizzling 90% of the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drakkimor</div><div class="date">11-18-2003, 09:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yup, or you'll have to do like I did and dump all your saved up skill points at the trainer so you can feign reliably.  Lot less annoying over all though I guess.  never was one for casting worthless spells to get skills up.  Came back to nail me on evocation though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Reflan</div><div class="date">11-18-2003, 10:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Iksar beserker club is a very fast club, 7/18.  I think SK's can use it; I used it on my druid and shaman and monk and I think on my warrior too...forget if i did on my SK.  <br />
<br />
It's 7/18 and procs a very good buff that ups your ATK and defense and offense.  Kind of an escape hatch, as far as boosting your defense when you're getting slaughtered.  Cheap too.<br />
<br />
It's good to have at least one very fast 1-hand weapon.  Use it as soon as you ding until your skill in that weapon is maxed.  This will help you level your offensive skill, not just skill in that weapon.  Now, move on to your other weapons you need to work up your skill on.  With offense raise via starting each level with your fast weapon, you will hit for higher amounts and more often with your other weapons.  Now that, say, two-hand blunt thingy you have terrible skill in will at least have a chance to do something decent, since your offense has gone up a bit.  Offense being maxed can make a very big difference every level in terms of your damage output, especially with weapons you stink at.<br />
<br />
Find something very fast, and start each level with that.  Don't stop until you've maxed that weapon for that level(five points per level).  That way you will always have one reliable, fast weapon skill to use and, more importantly, always keep offense high, which applies to every single weapon you use.  Emphasizing two-hand weapons can sometimes get you very far behind in offense.<br />
<br />
Also...be sure you do a fair amount of MT'ing or even soloing, whatever keeps you getting hit.  Each point in defense equals an increase in AC.  For shamans, for instance(I don't know if SK's get a bigger bonus per point), each increase in defense is worth 2.5 AC.  That means you can get 12.5 more AC per level if you max defense every level.  Think of what adding 12.5 AC on one piece of armor you have would mean -- it could make a pretty junky piece look darn good, or a very good piece outstanding.  Nothing to sneeze at, and it's FREE.  So be aware that if you're always second banana in terms of being beat on, you'll might pay a price if your defense falls behind.  And you cannot get defense higher unless you get hit -- no buying it at trainer, etc, like you can with weapons skills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keevel</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 06:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">New SK info: 1) Keep all weapon skills up, you never know what will drop and you'll want to be effective with it if you use it.  Low Delay weapons are good.  Don't neglect 2HB either....<br />
<br />
Junk buff your cold buff all the time, it'll make FD'ing easier.  (Note: casting find corpse over and over will help you raise your divination so you can cast deadeye, gather shadows, etc. easier)<br />
<br />
It you need a good shield look at the sturdy stone shield, not the most common SK shiled out there but not to expensive and comparable to the Sarnak.  (I mean you're a DE SK do something to appear unique)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maxxpain</div><div class="date">11-26-2003, 11:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">/agree Keevel - keep all weapon skills up.<br />
/agree Hatre - keep all spell skills up (especially abj - I didn't, and had to get a KEI at 30 and run around POK enduring cold on everything and everyone in sight to get it practiced - pain in the arse)<br />
<br />
Here's what I used to maintain skillups and get the best bang for the DPS buck with no level requirements:<br />
<br />
1hb - MoSS 19/29 = supercheap, Ebon mace 19/24 better damage ratio and faster for skillups, but costs more and seems to be very rare in bazaar now<br />
2hb - granite face grinder 29/36  one of the fastest 2hb for practicing, and a decent ratio for DPS<br />
1hs - defiance 9/19 good for skillups good ratio and some stats<br />
2hs - Nathsar greatsword - 17/30 - ratio sucks, but it's FAST and you can skill up quickly at low levels, plus super cheap<br />
Piercing - Shard of Night for nice DPS ratio, or crystalline spider fang for cheapness - under 100pp and it's 10/22 so good skillups Centi warspear 20/30 if you prefer 2 handed weapon also very cheap (25pp or so) and fast<br />
<br />
Armor:<br />
Crusty is very cheap and gives impressive performance through 45 or so, when you will outgrow it.  By this time you will have made some plat and can do your upgrades, look for deals on appropriate cultural armor.  Fungi if you have assloads of plat.<br />
<br />
Skills:<br />
bind skills to macros to keep skills like sense heading (irrelevant now), disarm, forage, etc.  All of my spells are done like:<br />
<br />
/attack off<br />
/doability 1 (hide)<br />
/doability 2 (sense heading)<br />
/cast (x)<br />
/attack on<br />
<br />
or something to that effect hehe I'm on vacation can't look it up now.<br />
<br />
Faction:<br />
screw faction, you are an SK, kill dem all!</div></div><hr />

I didn't and regret it terribly.  OT Hammer... (aka Worker Sledgemallet) got mine at 54 and had 5 skill in 2HB... ouch!</div></div><hr />

You don't need any skill in 2hb to set off your OT hammer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Abandoned Orc Shovel (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=467) isn't too tough to get and the price can't get any better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Gah!  Really??  I had no idea.  I've probably used it 5-6 times, I thought it would take a landed hit to proc.  Very interesting.  <br />
<br />
Also, it seems to proc much more easily on my necro friends pet than on a mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nyrvel</div><div class="date">12-02-2003, 08:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Faction is important if you plan to do any Quests. A bit of planning ahead will save you many hours of Faction crunching in the future. Of all the advice given on this Forum, many SHD's will tell you to kill, then kick it to make sure its dead. NO! Research the Faction Hit vs the future Item you may have to Quest. Example, I wanted Blood Ember armor from Karnor's Castle, well I might as well Destroy my Worker's Sledgemallet (Gate: The Overthere). Apparently the only way to regain Venril Sathir Faction is to kill all the Named Dragons in Kunark ~ sigh ~. Save yourself this headache and just do your Faction research before you go kill. :eek:<br />
<br />
PS: Tried that, then General D'Veer finds me, brings a few friends and then it turns into 'Tag Tinvenau', not a fun experience. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lizarde</div><div class="date">12-05-2003, 07:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wouldn't trash a faction just for the sake of trashing it, but I wouldn't worry too much about it either.  Yeah, you might wind up hurting a faction that you'd like to have later, but most of the time there's no compelling reason to worry about it, as most of the better quests later in your character's life will originate in neutral zones like the PoK or PoTranq, or in zones where you need to work faction anyway, like Thurg or Kael.<br />
<br />
You can still use the OT hammer if you've blown your VS faction, the spot where you port in has only a weak low-level skeleton within aggro range, so you can kill it, then get to the PoK book.</div></div><hr />
