<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ceptic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know that this thread will get major flamed, but I figured that I would come out of the proverbial closet and own up to making a newbie Gnome SK and why.<br />
<br />
I’ve been at this game on and off since July of 99, though I quit for over 2 years, and just recently came back to play, though casually.  Of all the races, I find the Gnome, specifically the female to be unique and somewhat rare.  Many of you hate Gnomes, I know from reading threads over the past few weeks.  However, finding a class/race combo that is both unique and somewhat rare intrigued me.  Much has changed over the last few years, and I decided to start from scratch with a newbie to learn the lay of the lands anew.  So far, I have quickly developed a love of the little Gnome for the diversity in skills, being smaller then my pet, and the completely unique ability in skill i.e. Tinkering.  I will more then likely never see level 65.  Will never experience the “uberness” that comes from belonging to a high-end guild.  Never know what it is like to have excessive AA points.  I will however enjoy my limited time spent wandering the various zones that have become second nature to most of you.  Please feel free to blast me for my decision to play a Gnome, as my skin is hardened to the likeness that of an Iksar.  <br />

Happy Journeys …</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jodgrim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I would be willing to bet that female ogre and troll are just as rare, if not more so, than female gnome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yes but watching a little itty bitty tiny lady beat the crap out of a Giant could be strangely arousing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jodgrim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Only if she is naked and hawt</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kuvak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've got nothing against gnomes. I hope you enjoy your new character.<br />
<br />
You said you made her female to be &quot;unique&quot; too, well I just hope you're not some homo male making a female to cyber with other guys and get turned on that way. Those people make me sick!<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jaeger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think one of the greatest screenshots I have taken was seeing a female gnome SK tanking Vindi.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Duke Xerro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Female ogre is the rarest combo of race / sex in the game I think. I've only seen 2 my entire playing experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Azika Lotusgnome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Has anyone even bothered to look at the high end clockwork armour (aimed at lvl 45 and above) it is awesome this with the fact you are cute especially when tanking a dragon hehehe..... well there is my main reason for choosing gnome as a race for my SK. also my guild has a dragon raid team limited to level 52 (Naggy etc) and am a member of it so I knew I wasn't going higher on this toon.<br />
<br />
My main is a 61 shammy and though I love her my cute little gnome is getting more lovable by the day.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I doubt anyone really hates Gnomes....they're just so tasty that we can't really regard you as much more than kabob-material.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ruuti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Gnomes are usually more fun to have around than most.  People who play them almost always have a sense of humor.  That and playing a troll it is lively to interact with gnomes who can hold their own.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Mynka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I agree with what everyone else said, plus Gnomes are great in a sandwich. :D <br />
<br />
-M</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ziglug D</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hehe I had a female ogre SK in my group...I asked her why her toon had titties...And then I fgiured it all out, WOW!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Paynreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Really, i think the Gnome hate started because when gnomes became SK-able 99% of the bastards were super-twinks of 13 year olds who thought they were hi-friggen'-larious.<br />
<br />
It was a gay as hell 2 months or so.<br />
<br />
Now, i finally take gnomes sereously because those 13 year olds are looking for the next superclass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Greldor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">u want unique? check me out. . . pink ogre <br />
<br />
edit - pink male ogre</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gnaughty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I also have a female gnome SK (not for cybering, either!), and have more fun playing her than most people I know with large race shadowknights...  You forgot to mention the most important asset they have:  GNOME POWAH!!!   :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Judithe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Gnomes are the best SK's to solo up to 60 I think.  With the right click haste arms you easily outdamage any equally geared SK of any other race.  You don't lose much if any str or dex because of the clockwork gaunts and boots.  You also have a very nice intelligence bonus which helps alot when soloing at higher levels.<br />
<br />
I'll admit that you give up a nice amount of stamina but I think it is well worth it for any solo SK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gnocchia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Gnomes are the best. Basically the same stats as DEs, last time I checked they had a slight xp bonus, NEVER need to be shrunk, clockwork observer armor is awesome, and tinkering is fun (at least for me.) Plus less faction problems in the beginning, though my little gnome sk accidentally got on the boat to FV once when I first started out, they didn't take very kindly to him there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Oagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Me only like one gnome, and dat iz me gnome wizzie.  Oderwize, dey jus gud to keel en eat.  Ogre da bestest SK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Specnatz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Most Noam Sks do not make it to the high 60's, i am at 64 and would not trade my Noam SK for anything.  I know i give up alot of str and hp compared to the Troll and Ogres but hey it is still unique and i want to make him the best on my server.  Of course it will be a while until then but that is ok by  me anything worth doing takes time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Ghismonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Yeah, gnomes were treated a lot like frogloks have been.<br />
<br />
Ghismonda is my main, and a female gnome SK.  She saw 65 a while ago, and is arguably my guild's best off-tanks.<br />
<br />
I get a lot of hugs, and I have a lot of fun.  I don't get offered free stuff or told &quot;wow, you have beautiful eyes&quot; like when I play my barb twink.  And for some reason, everyone assumes I'm a dude IRL (though I'm not.)<br />
<br />
So yeah... female gnome SK is my main, and it's 100% for comedic value.  I don't know of any other female gnome SK on my server.  But I know of zero female troll or ogre SKs.  There are a buttload of DE and human, though.  /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Cabot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">My sig pic speaks for itself. After retiring my old main at 61 and levelling my Gnome SK to 62 I can safely say that being a short melee is a pain in the ass. Got my Froglok Reet Crown and almost done with uguk faction so getting up stairs should be a lot easier soon.<br />
<br />
The gnome jokes are just sad and tired now, I've gotten so much of it I don't even see the text anymore. Kind of like watching something through a window screen, you just don't notice it.<br />
<br />
One cool thing about being short is it always looks like you're running faster than you are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Makkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">gnomes are kind of amusing, it's fun to make fun of them, and this little tiny gnome having 6k hp tanking down some tough named is just funny.. <br />
<br />
ive seen several female ogre sk's but have never seen a female troll sk, much to the dismay of my male tsk :( that's a pr0n vid that would make you a bit of money on the freak market<br />
<br />
most popular on the rathe and now im on zeb seem to be<br />
<br />
de<br />
ogre<br />
iksar<br />
troll<br />
human<br />
gnome</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Cabot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Crown of Deceit completed.<br />
<br />
Do not ever loot a Froglok Reet Crown.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Kebansis of DRo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I always find it funny when people talk about which race is the best to play a certain class, and back in the day it used to make a difference.  However, these days it really doesn't matter what you play, because by the time you make it to the &quot;high-end&quot; of EQ all your stats will be maxed or close to that.  I know some people don't make it that far because they either don't care or want to..  so maybe just for the casual player it really matters which race you pick ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I don't see any &quot;other races suck&quot; posts here.<br />
<br />
It's just nice to see, when you've picked a less than common combination, who else has made that choice and how they have faired and what thier style is. <br />
<br />
Kind of like an EQ personality test based on race..</div></div><hr />
