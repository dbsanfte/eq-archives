<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Beyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Even after hitting 70 and getting over 500 AAs on my Troll Sk, I don't feel like I'm &quot;allowed&quot; to comment on the -20 fire resist because my resists suck ass anyway. I never really cared before OoW, since it was easy enough to put on a few items and max it out for the duration of a fight where fire AOEs needed resisting. But now with the prismatic/chromatic, which check every resist, -20 (which was probably more symbolic than anything back when they implemented it)  seems an awful lot more fucked up to me. I know its only a -1/30th of a reduction overall, but I just KNOW every time I die to a new AOE, that another 20 points would have saved my ass. Anyone else think it's a little unfair to bait and switch with penalties, but make sure your benefits are always watered down to the point that even the lowliest, most underequiped newbie on earth isn't impressed by it? Or should I just be happy?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">All race have some lower resists, troll as just all in fire (they start with an FR of 5)  so this would be hard to fixe, as it would have to be done across the board and those people, like Brael, who have maxed resists anyway woul be justified in wondering why they're watering it down now.<br />
<br />
Conent plays a huge part in both race and class balance, I think with your awareness of this you'll just put extra effort into making sure that if you have 2 nearly equal choices you'll pick the one with better FR.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Araden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">my gears focused on dr / pr / mr due to rangers gain in fr/cr.<br />
<br />
It's only a couple of recent gear items i aquired that ended up lowering my FR to the point where it's my lowest resist.<br />
<br />
/shrug for me being aware of chromatic and prismatic resists... my gear choices haven't been limited just to whatever has the best effect / hp's but also which resists they have, so that I am balanced.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not only resurrecting a year-old thread, but also not reading the thread before posting. The answer is in Keevels post, but since you seem to require clarification: it's a racial trait. All races/classes get varying resists and other stats upon creation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grobobos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Just do some DON missions and buy two +12 all resists and two +10 all resists... you can do that 2 times at evil AND good side... if after that you stlill get AoE then you'll know it wasn't only your racial stats but also your stuff.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hehe, its known that trolls in some fantasy lores such as D&amp;D are regenerative race who really hate fire the most of all cuz fire alone can kill them off and stop their regenerating power. You are troll who really hate fire. Live with it. ;)</div></div><hr />
