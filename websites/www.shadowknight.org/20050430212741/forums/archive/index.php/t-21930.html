<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So, I'm flagged for tactics, I can tank in the pit (though the adds will get me eventually) with my bot shaman.<br />
<br />
I don't raid, I don't want to flag.<br />
<br />
I do want to see some new content.  That rules out PoP since elementals require flagging.<br />
<br />
What I'm looking for is an exp zone where I can survive with a 65 shm 2 box (may be able to add 62 cleric and 61 enchanter at random times), find something a touch difficult to do, but not so difficult I spend all my time dragging and rezzing.<br />
<br />
Anything in GoD fit the bill?<br />
<br />
Failing that, is there anything that I'd find remotely more interesting than single pulling mob X and slaughtering it.  I'm not especially interested in getting the &quot;best&quot; experience, but I'm not going to spend 15 minutes beating down a mob to prove I can do it either.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What is Natimbi like for that sort of thing?  Also, is there a place to Solo in GoD for sk's?  Just curious.  I normally just solo in Dulak or Cazic Thule, small xp, but I get stuff for tradeskills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Talura cwn`Zeylon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Natimbi is about half blue at 62, a few animals are dark blue most are light blue (level range seems to be about 43-47), Pull the ghosts, mastruk and nocs and so forth, they seem to be 50 or 51. Several places to fear kite at -- the beach at the wayfarer camp is good, fear them south; jump across to the island and fear kite in the plain there are the two spots I've done. Can't fear the named so don't pull unless you can tank them down. Get about a % every 5 I think it was.</div></div><hr />
