<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kelefane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My guild is fixing to break into Phase5 and CT will be the first GOD we attempt and ive been assigned the task to tank him....I'd like a little general info on CT in Time...Max hit ect....Where he should be positioned while tanked.....AE's i should be aware of...Just general notes/strats would be ideal.<br />
<br />
Thanks!!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Pick a corner in his room, have PR resist, have your fearless AA if you don't uhh get MR buffed and use your fearless disc for a bit.<br />
<br />
the rest you can pretty much figure out ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Send one person to walk up to him and find all that out.  How else do you test out first-time mobs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ashrai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Where he should be positioned while tanked<br />
<br />
Take a look around the big room when you get into P5. There's going to be a limited number of places you'll want to be. <br />
<br />
.....AE's i should be aware of...<br />
<br />
CT will make you aware of them, no worries. His PR agent has also made sure he has his very own listing on Alla's.<br />
<br />
Seriously tho, different raid forces do him (and many mobs) differently. Your raid force should go through the learning process like you would with any mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ghismonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hopefully you have your Fearless AA.  If you don't, there's no real reason to use you over a warrior.  Also, you probably don't want to hear this, but consider using a Fearless paladin to tank him the first time.  Aside from his damage dealing AE, he also has an AE silence which will make getting (and maintaining) aggro a real sonofabitch.  Seems like the many times we killed him, I was always hit with the silence right off on inc.  Paladins have a discipline (Santification, I think) that makes them immune to spells for a few ticks and thus they won't get silenced on inc.<br />
<br />
Tank him in one of the two back corners that you zoned up into P5.  He and Bertox aren't leashed to their little areas like the other gods in Time are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Naubi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">We fought him in his corner thing, which works fine.<br />
<br />
But... make sure you tell ppl NOT to zone to pofear as CRing there is a major pain now.</div></div><hr />
