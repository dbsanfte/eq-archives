<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Daedrik Darkblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been searching for some decent quests to do (mainly armor related) and i've noticed that most of the ones posted around here are for 55+, with the exception of the eyepatch of plunder. So i was wondering, are there any good quests around that can be completed at lv44? Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Morgrist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You're in the right range to do your Comatose/Blood of Pain spells with a group. Head down into the tunnels in Dulak's and hunt the luggalds there for blood/bile/saliva/etc. <br />
 <br />
At 44,if you haven't done them already,go do your darkforge quests. Get yourself the decaying parts and such you'll need now,and if you choose to go for the epic later,you'll be able to do it legit (starting with Kurron Ni).<br />
<br />
Or,if you've got the hutzpah,see if you can get a group into Veksar,start collecting sets of 4 matching weapons to turn in for Iksar faction...once you've pulled enough faction with the right people,you can scavenge a newbie khukri from an Iksar and start working on Greenmist-I've seen people do that weapon in the mid 40's,and it's great for the level.</div></div><hr />
