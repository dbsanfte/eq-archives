<br />
I did the LOIO explorers and got to I was dubious to Vaurk. I turned in 6 stacks of knives and maxxed my faction with Legion of Cabilis, conned Vaurk and conned &quot;warmly&quot;. <br />
<br />
I was standing there next to Vaurk looking at my notes when, out of the blue, he attacked me. <br />
<br />
That's weird, I thought, and ran to FV zone. Maybe attacked him by accident or something.<br />
<br />
Decided to head into Cab via FoB. Stopped by the bone chip trooper dude to turn in some bone chips. No problem; he took 4 stacks with no issues. Ran into East Cabilis, conning everything. Everyone was warmly, dubious, or in the case of the sellers, indifferent. I shopped a little and then decided to head to the SK guild to talk to the librarian.<br />
<br />
Conned everything in the shaman room and everything conned dubious. So I was trying to figure out how to get up the ladder (I'm not very coordinated) when the shamans all play bean-pile-on-the-shadowknight and BOOM, I'm dead.<br />
<br />
What gives? First a warmly, and then a pile of dubious shamans, all playing &quot;kill the dark elf&quot;?<br />
<br />
Anyone else had these problems?<br />

Also, how would that explain Vaurk's action? He's not on Brood.<br />

He's Librarian something or other, but is on necro faction.  If that's where you were, that's the best explanation for the shaman vendors attacking you.  I can't think of a reason why Vuark would attack you though.  There isn't a single necro faction mob I can think of in think of in LoIO.  The crusaders are all on crusaders faction except for one, who is on Scaled Mystics faction, there are a bunch of Legion faction troopers, but as far as I know, no brood faction mob.<br />
<br />
I would zone into East cab and check my necro faction on the nihilists outside the necro tower.  You should be plenty far away from them to escape random aggro, and just in case, the WW zone line is right there.</div></div><hr />

I assume the fact that I don't have good Brood faction is bad news for the Iksar wandering around FoB and LOIO...<br />

<br />
Finally I learnt to invis up and look around. There's a a guy in one of the huts near the Guild house (can't remember his name) also on necro faction that the crusaders assist if he attacks you. I think he's at 2 or the next building south on the eqatlas east cab map. He doesn't seem to always be there either.<br />
<br />
 Just get your necro faction up and you'll be fine.</div></div><hr />

This guy was a different guy (unless Zimor came for a run outside of the guild house to bash me around a bit! ;) ) who sit's in one of those huts (pretty sure it was Tink n' babble bar...... he was standing in front of the staris to the upper floor of the bar).<br />
<br />
I'll go have a look for him when I get home tonight and can log on.<br />
<br />
<br />
*EDIT* His name is Grype and is located upstairs in the bar next to the barrels.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was ally to most of the factions, but the bankers seem to take a lot more knives than the others.<br />
<br />
I went to bank and they called the guards when i got to close...  Loading Please Wait... :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Groff Gorespiller</div><div class="date">07-16-2003, 09:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bankers are on Residents faction, as is a mob standing in a tent just outside the bank.  Most residents faction mobs are also merchants, and so can not be lower than dubious unless attacked.  However, the bankers and a very few other mobs are on residents faction and yet don't have the merchant faction modifier.  Always be careful around the bank if you haven't raised your faction with residents enough to buy/sell to any of the mobs in the center vendor section of east cab.  Until you get your faction up to apprehensive, you can't really tell by conning one of the merchants what your true cab residents faction is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But in the shammy guild, chances are good that your necro faction stinks, and the librarian guy aggrod you.  Once one mob aggros you, other generally assist it even if they like you</div></div><hr />

Bone chips like mad.  I think that's because I killed the alchemist in OT a couple times.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, even after chipping away at my faction forever and finally getting amiable to the sk's, I couldn't get near the sk guild because of the librarian.  He'd aggro through the floor and walls if I went the the second floor, and as you'd probably expect, I do have a riposte skill.  Mobs that like you won't necessarily join in with their friends to kill you unless you hit their friends, and riposte is just an automatic response.<br />
<br />
I died this way three times before figuring out to stand with my back to the main building, and if the librarian aggroed to just jump off the building and run like hell.  At least all the other mobs would leave me alone.  <br />

&quot;Dying is a hell of a way to check your faction.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cauchy</div><div class="date">08-13-2003, 02:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got my necro faction up by parking pet in the little caves in FoB on the north side by the water.  There's bandits or something in there that your pet can kill easily.  This was before the change where mobs wouldn't aggro on your pet though.  I just sat down at the cabilis zoneline and went to bed.  Pet raked in faction all night long, it was great!  Maybe you can equip a fungi or something and go afk in the caves to have them attack you and aggro your pet?  I'm not sure what'll make them attack you though, since you're so much higher.  I'm sure you can figure something out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I got my hands on an Essence of Iksar potion and finally went to turn in my six stacks of explorer knives. About half way through he attacked me for no reason. I feigned death with about sixteen percent of my health left. When I stood back up and conned him I was at ally faction. My illusion was still up. I then proceeded to turn in the rest of my knives without incident. <br />
<br />
Not sure what is up here but there is something up with Mr. Vaurk.</div></div><hr />

I was standing outside the Sk/Shammy guildhall, and I knew that I was still KoS to Zimor, so I didn't go inside.  I must have agroed him, because all of a sudden, I got harm touched by one of the crusaders.  I just ran toward the bank, FD'd, and got right back up.  No more agro (at least not from the crusader).  Of course, I kept my distance from the guild hall.  hehe<br />
