<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zarrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">With the introduction of the froglok race, and the simple fact that I can't make a SK one, I've come across a small dillemna.  I'm torn between starting either an ogre, iksar or euridite SK.<br />
<br />
I like the ogre for the slam, unstunnable reasons but I'm not so keen on the size.<br />
<br />
Iksar, I love the look, and I know the regen is sweet (I've got a 52 beastlord that is iksar).  The only reason for not going iksar immediately is that it seems a pain to find suitable armor and I'm curious how much of a nuisance it is not being able to slam while weilding a 2hander.<br />
<br />
Last option is the euridite.  I like them simply for originality.  They seem easier to gear up since they wear medium sized armor, and the look is nice.<br />
<br />
So there you have it.  Any advice from the ogre, iksar and euridite SKs out there is welcome.  Please no ogre &gt; all type posts.  As much as everyone loves them, I'm really only looking for suggestions on the best way to start up my newest toon, based by race.  Any pros/cons would be helpful too in making my decision<br />

The entire following is qualified.  At the end of the day, the differences are extremely small, so if you like a certain intangible qualities (looks, ability to roleplay, etc), then disregard the following in its entirety.<br />
<br />
Personally, if I was going to start all over again, I would NOT make an IKS SK again.  It has nothing at all to do with finding suitable armor though.  Nowadays, that just isnt that big a deal.<br />
<br />
The main thing that I have against IKS is that regen, which is probably their greatest attribute, is also available to trolls.  Trolls, however, have superior starting stats, but the same xp penalty.  Also, trolls get to slam and the size drawback is really minor.<br />
<br />
The AC bonus is pretty immaterial.  You can hit the alleged ac softcap fairly easy, so who cares if a few more points of AC are granted.  Sure, it will only help, but it just doesnt seem to yield that much benefit.<br />
<br />
I guess what I am saying is that if you want regen, Id take a troll, not an IKS.<br />
<br />
Personally, my favorites are ogres and gnomes, followed closely by trolls (yes, I said gnomes--I could care less about all the bashing that people do towards them).<br />
<br />
As stated from the beginning, however, dont even sweat any race you pick.  People are splitting major hairs when they talk difference between the races.  Pick the one that you like the most (yeah, Id include intangibles in the equation) and have fun.<br />

<br />
   Not picking on you Luna, but that was a good chuckle- EVERYTHING in EQ is intangible!<br />
<br />
<br />
   Race choice is just a personal thing.  There is no best, only favorites.  I like regen and slam, so I play a troll.   If you're not so keen on the size of an ogre before playing it, you will probably be extremely tired of it after you duck for the millionth time.   <br />
<br />
  If you like the looks, the rareudite sounds like a good chioce.</div></div><hr />

LOL--sorry.  You are correct.  I should have said not easily measurable.   :) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Graveseeker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Personally, I picked erudite because they look pretty damn cool easy to equip. the have good Starting INT. and they are Rare. There are WAY WAY WAY to many dark elf Sk's theres alot of troll sk's and i see some ogres but never ever do i see a Erudite. I put /who all erudite shadow last night there was me and this guy that is a mule so i was the only real erudite Sk that was on ATM. So i would pick Erudite. But the decision is yours <br />

It can certainly be annoying to miss out on some armor (blood ember, in particular, but also darkforge) as you level up.  Erudite SKs can use those armors, but they also have a set of newbie armor (http://www.eqtraders.com/quests/paineel_SK.htm) that they can quest as they level.  <br />
<br />
I did the newbie quests for my dwarf cleric, and it is pretty good armor for the levels 10-20 or so, maybe even further along than that.  The pieces tend to be pretty easy to procure for the most part (with usually one or two pieces that are a pain in the ass), and you can wind up with a full suit of matching armor by level 10-12 or so, or earlier if you have an alt get the pieces.  Heck, most of the pieces can be purchased off of merchants, except for the handful of NO DROP parts that are usually required.<br />
<br />
But as others say, think of what you value most, or what you would enjoy most.  I went with an Iksar because I prefer the way they look, and would choose an iksar just about every time.  If I didn't choose an Iksar I'd probably choose a human, for the same reason- I like how they look in plate armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Skurrge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Iksar have no armor problem.  If you want armor to last you into your 50s, go get a set of Rygorr Chain armor.  It should last you a good long time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shadowsoal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Iksar armor problom? the ONLY piece of gear I ever really wanted and couldn't use was IGS and I am working on Str of ele atm not a problem want good Iskar armor get blood runed + CC armor, or ryogrr if yer on a lower budget...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zarrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I decided on going iksar in the end.  I looked into the dreadscale armor quests and they looked like a major pain to do, so off to the bazaar and about 1k later, I've got an iksar is near full dreadscale with an ok 1hb.  (I was chomping at the bit too much to get around to farming Ry`gorr, hence the dreadscale since it was cheaper)<br />
<br />
I just dinged 16 with him today and I don't regret it one bit.  SKs definitely play better than a pally IMO but I suppose I'm biased from having a cleric main :) <br />
<br />

Thanks for all the advice.  <br />

Wow. Can't sum up the intolerance ignorance and racism any better than that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jupke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I wonder if new people ever bother to try and read a few posts.<br />
<br />
there are 2670 posts in the race discussion, lets say 1500-2000 are dumb posts about ppl asking the same question, ppl calling other ppl dumb for picking the &quot;wrong race&quot; etc.<br />
<br />
But there must at least be 600+ GOOD posts with good points. Still they keep asking what race they should play.<br />
<br />
If it wasn't for the occasional funny thread, good post/info i wouldn't even open this forum. Well i didn't open it for a loooong time.<br />
<br />
Besides i love to bitch to ppl for asking dumb questions :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kulaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">One thing most people forget about picking a race is size. <br />
<br />
  I have played an Ogre Warrior to 52 and a Troll Shadowknight to 45.<br />
<br />
  I can't count how many times my Ogre has gotten stuck in Thurgadin. It really sucks.  Oh, Fall in the pit in Tower of Frozen Shadow? Better find a Port! :P<br />
<br />
  At 35 my Troll Shadowknight got a Guise, so havent had much problem with him. But i do remember not being able to go into Solusek A with my guild at the time. nobody knew about the other entrances back then. <br />
<br />
  With the new ways to shrink, including the wood elf helmet, it isnt as bad as it WAS, but size can be a berdon. not only to you, but in large raids also.<br />
<br />
If i had to start over from scratch.. i would pick an Iksar most likely just to avoid the whole mess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Skurrge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Jupke, no one reads posts anymore.  I am amazed the admins of the board even keep anything older than a week online.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Daywalka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I made an Erudite because of the rareness factor (I rarely see more than 4 non-Anon Eru SKs on Xegony at once), high starting Int, they looked cool, and I wanted to use a name from the movie Blade and Wesley Snipes has the same skin tone as Erudites.<br />
<br />
That, and Gnost is my hero. :p <br />
<br />
Bloodbelch makes me wonder why humans don't do like other animals and kill their retarded young.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Mazziker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I have a 51 Iksar SK, and I really enjoy him. althought not as rare as the Erudite, they seem to thin out quite a but at higher levels. With PoP I think you will see more since one of the biggest problems for me was lack of friendly zones I could visit and restock up on. I disagree with the armor not being an issue for Iksar, because it is a pain and kind of sad that we are so limited. However it is not a critical factor by anymeans. Overall pick what you enjoy the most. DE and Ogre SK's are the most seen at my level, second is Troll followed by a tie for third with Erudite,Iksar, and Gnome. But that is prolly just my server (Tholuxe Palles).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Grimrod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">My main is 63 shaman.  My SK is an Ogre.  The immunity to frontal stun is simply addicting.  Put 5 pts into Agi and the rest into Int and you're set.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Cestodas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Its funny that humans rarely gets mentioned in discussions like this. They must be THE most rare race as sk, no?<br />
<br />
Seen from an rp perspective I would pick a human over any other since they are by far the most evil. I mean, they &quot;invented&quot; all the other races omg :)<br />
<br />
Edit: Oh, and if you chose ogre, I would put 5 in agi and rest in sta. Not int as Grim mentions, but that a WHOLE different discussion so time to use that search function hehe<br />
