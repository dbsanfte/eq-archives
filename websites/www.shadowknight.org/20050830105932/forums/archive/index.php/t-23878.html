<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xaxilis</div><div class="date">12-27-2004, 07:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm writing this with the hope that EQ 1 will benefit in the area of population as well find shelter against possible patches that may make it more like EQ 2. <br />
<br />
What follows is a brief overview of some of the features in EQ 2 and whether or not I found them to be positive or negative changes.  I tried not to come off too upset over being disappointed but, I think I lost it near the end.<br />
<br />
1) THE GRAPHICS ENGINE<br />
Pro's<br />
-Looks Great!<br />
<br />
-Will scale with technology very well<br />
<br />
Con's<br />
-There's a memory leak some place.<br />
After awhile, the screen gets to stuttering so badly that eventually you have to log out, close out and restart the client.<br />
<br />
-Rendering distance.<br />
Objects pop on to screen abruptly even if you drop all options and raise rendering distance to max.  This is by far the most annoying to me.  EQ 1 and WOW render far distances very well on my machine.<br />
<br />
-You'll probably need to upgrade your hardware.<br />
<br />
2) USER INTERFACE<br />
Pro's<br />
-The quest journal.<br />
It's  outstanding.  I wish this would have been in EQ 1.  I never would have left.<br />
<br />
Con's<br />
-It has an unfinished feel doesn't contain many of the features currently in EQ 1.<br />
<br />
-Spell actions and a melee action now both run off power.<br />
I think here again they gave into non casting whiners that it just wasn't fair that other classes got to take advantage of mana on gear but, they could not.  Again they made the game fair and... it ruins it.  Diversity, Individualism.  Living with the choices you've made.  You can't have it all doesn't detract from the game, it enhances it.<br />
<br />
-All buttons be they actions or spells, look like square icons.<br />
You basically end up with 36 buttons. Yay! Lots of ability.  Zero feel.  I liked having a spell bar and a hotkey bar.  I liked the fact I was limited to the amount of spells I had access to and that it took strategy and time to memorize and setup my spells.<br />
<br />
-Icons everywhere but, none that feel real.  <br />
The icons for items don't feel like objects at all.  First of all, they don't have transparent backgrounds so they all look like square pictures instead of objects.  Secondly, (this one is really irritating) they've restricted what you could do with icons.  You can't put stuff on the ground.  If you try to move an icon some place it doesn't go, it doesn't stay on your mouse it pops back to where it was before.  This really adds to the feeling that you are not really dealing with objects in the game and for me that is frustrating.  What's more upsetting is that this was clearly motivated by greed in that the less items lost to misplacement the less customer service they would have to perform.  You'll see this thinking in a lot of how things work in the game.<br />
<br />
-Hotkeys are not elaborate enough.<br />
I don’t' get how to make them so that they can do the things they do in EQ 1.  I don't get and I've been playing EQ 1 for 5 years.  If I don't get it, It's too hard.  And the manual is worthless even after is it was updated.<br />
<br />
-The Map is weak.<br />
(a) The map is not a scaled version of the actual terrain.  Even UO had this.  WoW has this.<br />
(b) No directional pointer so you know what direction you're going.<br />
(c) There's no creativity with the map.  Why not tie it to a mapmaking skill? Make it so the more you travel with that map skill on the more clear it is.  Wizardry 7 had this.<br />
(d) Some zones still have no map even after you've been in them a great deal and leveled past them.  This can make traveling to lower levels of those dungeons irritating.<br />
(e) There's no way to edit the map or make notes<br />
(f) Waypoints on the map don't work<br />
<br />
3) COMBAT<br />
Pro's<br />
-HO's<br />
These are very cool and really can make group combat interesting esp. at higher level's<br />
<br />
Con's<br />
-Kicking and bashing have time bars go across the screen.<br />
This detracts from combat feeling real time like it is in EQ 1.  This is basically a result of them meshing the combat actions with the spell actions.<br />
<br />
-Grouped mobs cannot be pulled individually.<br />
Again they took control away from the player and made a canned encounter.  BORING!<br />
<br />
-Encounters are locked.<br />
You cannot help someone unless they /yell for help at which time they do not get exp or any other benefits from the kill and neither do you.  I can use no other word here but, &quot;Lame&quot;.<br />
<br />
4) CHARACTER FEEL<br />
(This set of issues is the main reason I'm choosing to go back to EQ 1)<br />
Pro's<br />
-Support for odd race/class combinations.<br />
You want a Troll Paladin?  Dark elf Ranger?  You got it!<br />
<br />
Con's<br />
-There's no individualism or Class feel. <br />
They did a couple things here that caused this;  <br />
<br />
There's no Race starting cities. They piled all the good class's in one city and all the evil class in another.  So, right away any individual cultural feel is gone. This is more important to me then I ever thought.  I forgot how much I loved the culture and history of both my EQ 1 Chars.  Esp. my Iksar.  There was a rich heritage and cultural history that really interested me and gave me a certain pride in playing my Iksar Shadow knight.<br />
<br />
The Starting abilities are gone.  Trolls no longer Regen, Large races no longer get slam, etc.  What abilities are in the game are done through cheesy spells and do not feel like native abilities. There are slight venations in stats but, these mean very, very little as gear quickly makes up for deficiencies.  <br />
<br />
I really feel like they gave into whiners here.  If you make all the world fair then you take out the diversity and without diversity the game is boring.  Even with abilities there were still those who picked different races because they *liked* being a Human Paladin or other race class combo.  They liked it because it had a feel to it all it's own.<br />
<br />
Spells feel watered down.  There's no specifically &quot;evil&quot; feeling spells for my class.  They might have evil sounding names but, I could well imagine renaming them and assigning them to the paladin.  I haven't checked but, I'm betting this is what they did.  Gone are the days of Life Taps and skeleton pets.<br />
<br />
5) QUESTING<br />
Pro's<br />
-Awesome quest journal.<br />
-Very few broken quests.<br />
-Many quests are well thought out and have neat and or otherwise interesting story lines.<br />
<br />
Con's<br />
-None that I can think of.  <br />
<br />
6) MISSING FEATURES THAT SHOULD BE IN THIS GENERATION OF MMO'S<br />
(This one is a bit different.  This item is more about my disappointment rather then pro's and con's)<br />
<br />
-Voice communication<br />
I had high hopes for this.  The technology is there.  If it had this I might want to stay.  I know third party apps are out there but, everyone isn't using them.<br />
<br />
-Seamless zoning<br />
I know they claim that they can make more diverse environments this way but, I don't believe it.  I see other MMO games without zoning and they do great with this and once you play a game that doesn't have zoning you will really realize how much you hate it.  (WoW is my example here and not EQ 1)<br />
<br />
7) HOUSING<br />
Pro's<br />
-Neat idea<br />
-Can really be fun to decorate<br />
<br />
Con's<br />
-No windows<br />
This could have been done and would have helped to make you feel like your not in a box.  I'd like to go out on my patio and see the city.<br />
<br />
-Even the *very* expensive ones are shoddy looking<br />
<br />
8) SPELLS<br />
Pro's<br />
-None over EQ 1<br />
	<br />
Con's<br />
-Confusing.<br />
The spell descriptions don't tell you enough about what they do and upgrading the spells doesn't give you a clear enough indication what the advantage is of doing so.<br />
<br />
-Redundant<br />
Some spells are replaced with other spells and it's not clear if you should find upgrades for the older spell or if you're supposed to switch to the newer one.<br />
<br />
9) THE MANUAL<br />
Pro's<br />
It's a manual /shrug<br />
<br />
Con's<br />
-Lacks Detail<br />
The manual is not detailed enough and clearly shows signs as the rest of the game does that it was shipped before it was ready.  Coat tailing on Halo2?  Competing with WOW?  Nice work! You shipped a turd.<br />
<br />
10) GEAR &amp; RESTRICTIONS<br />
Gear is restricted by skill. At my level there is one weapon that is the best and I have no option of using a better one.  There is no chance of rising above the developer’s expectations and being better then what they designed you to be.  This makes for a canned setup yet again.  I understand you don't want to totally unbalance the game however, allowing just a few of the most dedicated to outclass their predicted status gives the rest hope and feels less like a canned experience.<br />
<br />
In the end, I would sum up the ruination of this game being caused by them &quot;balancing&quot; the game.  If you want balanced, Play EQ 2, If you want fun, EQ 1 gets my vote</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Josahd</div><div class="date">12-27-2004, 11:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Been screwing around with both games lately (yeah yeah I know I said I'd never try EQ2.... most my friends switched after fucking EQ2 killed my guild, and they begged dammit).<br />
<br />
I don't see anything real compelling to make me want to favor EQ2 over EQ1.  For one, my EQ1 SK is just damn fun to play, and I'm not a newbie all over again.  The graphics engine is nice, the questing system is nice, but there's still pathing, clipping, and visibility bugs galore.  I'm not crazy about how HO's function in groups.  Even low level versions of adept spells seem extremely rare.  I HATE the way alignment works.  If you want to be a shadowknight, you're forever bound in freeport.  All your friends are in Qeynos?  Too bad.  Roll a paladin.<br />
<br />
I like the huge open zones, but even on my cable modem network lag is always present in Antonica, presumably due to 100+ people being in those zones at all times.  Graphics lag gets bad too with more than 1 group around, and while I don't have the lateset and greatest, my comp smokes most games (over 60 fps at 1024, 4x antiasing in doom 3, for example).  Graphics is secondary to me anyways... I've been known to play ancient games with terrible graphics way beyond their time, simply because they were still fun.<br />
<br />
I don't like a lot of the arbitrary things forced on you for game balance reasons... but have no role playing basis.  Want to take a 1 group named at a lower level with a mini raid?  Too bad, it won't drop loot because you have too many people.  I can't stand the death system, either.  Die somewhere out of the way?  You can't summon your corpse/shard/whatever, if you can't get to the corpse on your own, you just have to suck up a ton of exp debt, and like it.<br />
<br />
Tank balance is pretty good how it's set up now, we'll see where it goes after a couple of expansions.<br />
<br />
No trains is a cool feature.  Most the dungeons in this game would be hellish if not for this.<br />
<br />
Lots of little nuiscance bugs that frustrate as well.  Like I set up my interface similar to EQ1... melee spam windows, chat windows.... and the window filter settings never save.  I have to reset them every time I log in.<br />
<br />
Just apply the good pieces of EQ2 to EQ1, forget the rest, and I'd never look back.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When I visit this site, I typically (unless I'm looking for something specific) just click the &quot;New Posts&quot; heading in the toolbar.  The problem I have is, I can't easily distinguish which of the threads listed are EQ or eq2.  There probably is a way, but I don't know it yet, as I'm not the sharpest knife in the computer knowledge drawer.<br />
<br />
Some times, you can tell from the title which game it is.  i.e. &quot;I'm throwing my tiled fruit bar at the green chili mouse, but am not getting the Wizard Schwaap skill, can any help?.....&quot;.  Obviously that isn't EQ, and so can be easily avoided.  But sometimes, you'll see a title like &quot;SK and most optimal 1hs/shield combo&quot;.  That looks like EQ, but when you open the thread it's more of.......&quot; So the other day, me and some other level three's went into Squamtilly, I was using my new Glistening Front Lobe because of the dps..........&quot;<br />
<br />
I was thinking of asking if we could better distinguish EQ and eq2 forums, or if folks could post with a I or II in parenthesis after their post (as a matter of courtesy).  But all of that may be academic now? or not?<br />
<br />
I won't hold you to your opinion, but what do you think the future holds for eq2?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since they added:<br />
1)  Portal systems - for those too afraid or lazy to travel through dangerous areas to get where they want.<br />
2)  Graveyards - hate corpse runs?  No problem if you're in a zone with a GY, just wait a few min.  (I've had a few situations where it would have been faster and easier if I had died instead of feign flopping out of a bad area - and I would have gotten all the exp I lost back and then some by the time I got out)<br />
3)  Maps - forget the old days of loc numbers and printouts from eq atlas (or just learning a zone the old fashion way).  Just pull up your map and you'll never get lost again... unless you happen to accidentally find your way into a real dungeon.<br />
4)  No more hell levels or staring at your spellbook all damn day (before level 30).  I actually agree with those, but of course I did my time in both.<br />
5)  New tradeskill interfaces.  Pretty sweet, but I got really good at ctrl clicking arrow parts before they put that in.  Definately made skilling up a lot easier, but in a good way I suppose.<br />
<br />
There's like a million other things, but I can stop complaining since I never renewed my subscription when I cancelled my credit card.  I guess I've finally kicked the EQ habit... again  ...for now anyway.  We'll see what happens.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Adus</div><div class="date">12-30-2004, 06:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Funny how these are things people used to complain endlessly about, now that they did something about it, people are calling it dumbed down.<br />

I guess I can't blame you. I miss the old days, even with those things.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leafweir</div><div class="date">12-30-2004, 10:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't see people complaining about lack of content. There's plenty of content in EQ2, it just all sucks.<br />
<br />
Conent in EQ2 is stupidly rigid. There is no &quot;outside&quot; the box. Oh look, there are 3 mobs ahead, they're grouped and white to our party of 3 people. Yay, we can win. Either that or oh look, there are 3 yellow ++ mobs ahead, they're grouped and we can't win. Crowd control in EQ2 is almost non-existant. You fight what they deisgned you to fight how they designed you to fight it.<br />
<br />
By comparison:<br />
<br />
WoW, same situation. There's 3 mobs up ahead, 2 casters and a tank and they're higher level than we are. Ok, Mr. Rogue run up and sap the tank (knock it out), Mr. Mage please polymorph the one caster. Ok, everyone else burn the third one before his buddies wake up.<br />
<br />
You don't always have a rogue and a mage available but both are common classes. As a druid I can mes animals or use root if we're outdoors. The point being that you actually have options as to how you deal with situations and exercising them properly makes it possible to win in cases you normally wouldn't.</div></div><hr />

&quot;1) Portal systems - for those too afraid or lazy to travel through dangerous areas to get where they want.&quot;<br />
<br />
Screw that.  I ran from Freeport to Qeynos just to see the sights, long after PoP came out.  I did it by both routes, too.  And I'm an Iksar who's only non-KOS in Rivervale because I enjoy beating the life from Pickclaws in occupied Runnyeye, because they say witty things when they die.  That said, screw that.  When I feel like running around, I run around.  When I want to go somewhere to fight, I find it much easier to jump a book-port than beg like a sissy from some soft-skin just because SOE decided that none of the noble race can do ports.  You can call me lazy for that, but I left Kunark the hard way, and I've done my time taking to my heels to get places, and the books just make it more fun to play since I'm not stuck blowing half of my time hoofing it to wherever I want to be, or spending time running endless faction so I'm not twenty minutes from the nearest friendly merchant.<br />
<br />
&quot;2) Graveyards - hate corpse runs? No problem if you're in a zone with a GY, just wait a few min.&quot;<br />
<br />
Since that's only a few zones, and since many of those zones would be impossible to penetrate without fully-geared forces, it seems they put it in so that a wiped-out Manaetic Behemoth raid didn't result in making some random necromancer independently wealthy.  Big deal that we don't have to spend two hours getting our corpses back from a failed raid.  It doesn't affect game balance in any realistic way, and it's easier on everyone involved.<br />
<br />
&quot;3) Maps - forget the old days of loc numbers and printouts from eq atlas (or just learning a zone the old fashion way). Just pull up your map and you'll never get lost again... unless you happen to accidentally find your way into a real dungeon.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cry me a river on this one.  I went through reams of graph paper playing _The Bard's Tale_ and other games, and I found that it was not fun at all, but necessary.  Now, I'd find it to be just a pain in my scaled ass to have to draw my own maps again, and I don't even have maps loaded for most zones, because I did learn it &quot;the old fashioned&quot; way.  That doesn't mean that I'd wish that effort on anyone else.  Having decent maps and the ability to tell what direction you're facing just means you can spend your time playing the fun parts of the game.  Wandering around the Greater Faydark for an hour and a half trying to find something other than a zone edge or your last three corpses is enough to put anyone off of EQ.<br />
<br />
&quot;4) No more hell levels or staring at your spellbook all damn day (before level 30). I actually agree with those, but of course I did my time in both.&quot;<br />
<br />
Boo hoo.  I had to sit though acres of suck, too, but I always felt it served no purpose to make someone stare at the spellbook.  With the introduction of camera changes, it becomes even less relevant (who meds in first person mode anyway?) so getting rid of this was long overdue.  Hell levels were just due to the math for gaining levels, and again it wasn't planned, it was just an unforeseen side effect.  New shadowknights still need to gain the same amount of experience to get to the same levels as the rest of us, it's just smoothed out more, so they don't seem to spend so much time in hell levels.<br />
<br />
&quot;5) New tradeskill interfaces. Pretty sweet, but I got really good at ctrl clicking arrow parts before they put that in. Definately made skilling up a lot easier, but in a good way I suppose.&quot;<br />
<br />
How could the Legions of Cabilis possibly expect to conquer all of Norrath if we had to waste time with the old way of tradeskilling?  It took away far too much time, and now I can just build my arrows and get back to spreading fear, instead of taking ten minutes to massage out my wrist.<br />
<br />
The short story for me is that there are things that make the game harder, and there are things that make playing the game harder.  I complain loudly when the first is interfered with, but I applaud when the second is fixed.  It's tough enough to become universally feared and loathed in Everquest without interface and gameplay issues getting in the way.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaotix</div><div class="date">12-30-2004, 01:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A little off topic, but I was thinking about EQ and its future/fate the other day and I couldn't help but think the game is destined to die a slow and painful death :(<br />
<br />
I mean, the game just keeps growing - which is great for most of the existing players, but for new players it is daunting if not intimidating.  The amount of information in-game as well as out is incredible, but over time, manageable.<br />
But how far can SoE go?  What’s to come in a year?  5 years?  100+ levels, 10,000 AAs, so much content it equals if not rivals the real world?<br />
What I'm getting at is EQ can’t go on forever without creating a realm that is too big to attract new players and therefore non-self-sustaining.<br />
The game will eventually see more people leave than it attracts.  People will either move to EQ2 (and EQ3 and EQ4...) or a competing game like WoW, or not play anymore.<br />
<br />
I like EQ1 and think it has a lot of potential.  I think it’s not too big to attract new players, and it offers a lot of content and gameplay for existing players.<br />
What I think SoE should have done (and maybe its not too late) is that EQ2 should have been a continuation of EQ1...a higher evolution (or for the role players a &quot;reality shift&quot;) so to speak.<br />
Some ideas would be to:<br />
1. Allow free transfers of EQ1 characters to EQ2.<br />
2. Do not allow character creation on EQ2.  Only allow transfers of lvl ~65+ toons to EQ2.<br />
<br />
Anyhow...that's my 2 cp worth.  Think I'm gonna go work on my sig or something :)</div></div><hr />

well, if it does, it's SOE's own damn fault due to their branding strategy, imho.  Gamers (let alone, the general public) are conditioned to perceive  sequential branding as the &quot;next product&quot; that renders the previous product obsolete (Diablo vs. Diablo II comes to mind). SOE has said that they wish to keep EQ1 in play and will support it, yadda yadda, and that EQ2 is a different product. So, they should have named it Everquest Lite, or some such, and come up with greater differentiation of the product, or a totally different concept altogether.<br />
<br />
I, for one, will probably end up playing EQ1 until SOE asks me to turn out the lights when I'm done.</div></div><hr />

Many of the new innovations are good overall, just implemented pooly. I still think that a new character should be restricted from using the PoK books till level 20. The problem is that they would then have to fix the many Newbie areas that do not stand up to Shadeweavers and Everfrost. Most Newbie zones just do not have the number of mobs, or convience of Merchants, Bankers, Trainers etc. It was easier to make all newbie zones accessable to all newbies, so everybody zoned to Shadeweavers, then Paludal Caverns. <br />
<br />
There should be a way to be productive during medding. Starring at the spellbook wasteful, and kept me from playing a caster till it was changed. <br />
<br />
As to aspects of EQ2...........<br />
<br />
The inability to buff, heal or help out a group or individual you are not grouped in was the killer. I will not play EQ2 for that reason. I love the interaction of people in EQ, and much of that comes from spontanious encounters. I get a thrill giving drive by buffs and heals, as I used to receive as a new player. The generousity and kindness of other players is what hooked me on EQ. That has been removed from EQ2, and kills it for me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Um.. because the same people who release content for EQ released EQ2?<br />
<br />
Fuck a lot of EQ2. IMHO anyone who wastes time on another SoE venture deserves all the frustration and irritation they get. I don't get it.. it's like a girl dating a total asshole who abuses &amp; ignores her, but she won't leave him when a better guy comes along.<br />
<br />
In case you haven't noticed, the MMORPG team at SoE sucks - they care about whiz bang &amp; doing whatever it takes to attract the highest number of players, string them along as long as they can, then just release $NEXT_{PATH,EXPANSION,GAME} which is supposed to make everrrrything better.. achieve class balance, spiritual harmony, all the women will want you after this next patch..just stick with it!<br />
<br />
I'd just as soon not play a game where everything I do is controlled by what the gaming company thinks I should do. SoE needs to learn that what their expectations of player actions are vs what players will do with the environment presented are usually diametrically opposite &amp; just roll with their community, not try to force their vision down people's throats.</div></div><hr />
