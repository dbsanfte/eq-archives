<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Elviscerat0r</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Why doesnt Extended Enhancement 4 increase duration on Aura of Hate attk buff? Is this a bug with recourses or is it really supposed to work that way? Oh yay the 100 pt dd component gets focused with ID4, big whoop.<br />
<br />
Am rather annoyed I spent a lot of raid points on a Cloak of the Wrulons thinking it would extend duration on AoH and all I did was buy an expensive resist item. Oh yay, duration on Cloak of Luclin and Shroud of Chaos is extended. Big whoop. Anyone know if it works on Harmshield duration? That would at least be nice, but somehow I doubt it. Actually I know the answer, HS is 18 second duration and EE requires a 36 second duration doesnt it? BAH...</div></div><hr />
