<br />
I see a lot about Bracers of Benevolence 'n' such.  Anyone know any other Bracer or earrings quest that they could possibly link me.  Preferbly something i can do on my own or with 1 cleric (or healer type).   Or mebi even something campable with the same force.  My bracers are THE suck :p <br />
<br />
thanka,</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">TY :) <br />
<br />
after a bit of research i did find that quest,  i was gonna start on it last night but i needed to get my Baroness aa title desperately hehe.  Hope fully ill be able to start it.  it seems to have decent ac and hp for something i dont need groups of people to obtain.  The effect is laughable tho :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xygoz Shadowreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Was about to say that you prolly wouldnt wanna do that quest at level 45 solo because holgreshes suck...even at 54. But then i noticed your a lot higher with a cleric so nm...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Jeez did the bracer quest solo in about 3 hours :) <br />
Bought an imperial wardog collar to full the sta void in my other bracer slot, now for an earring.  heh prolly end up questing my own solstice if possible. no way in hell im paying 5-6k for a quest mq (unless it was the decrepit hide of course id pay more for that:p )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thacker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you are talking about the solstice earring, you will find it's cheaper to pay the 5-6k to do it that way than to do it yourself.  Solstice earring is about tradeskills and unless you have a bunch of tradeskills over 200, then you are going to spend a heck of a lot more than 5-6k plat getting it up there. :)<br />
<br />
Go to http://www.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2420 for the quest, then go to eqtraders and look up how to make all the items needed.  :)  Preferably find a guildie that has high skills and buy the stuff he can make</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vaelenu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Source the 9 items required for the Earring of Solstice in the bazaar, you should be able to put it together for around 3k these days. Just combine them in any forge and take the result to Rebeca Cabbage leaf in Fungus Grove to turn into the all/all earring.<br />
<br />
Edit: omg do the draconic pauldrons!<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2277<br />
You can definitely duo this (I did) with careful pulling or a harmony/pacify puller.<br />
<br />
Eyepatch of Plunder<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=932<br />
result<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=4431<br />
<br />
Undead snake organs<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1301&amp;start=75<br />
results in a handy EB necklace http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=7557<br />
You'll probably need a illusion potion or chanter to help you with the final hand in.<br />
<br />
Other quests you might want to look into starting, even if you can't complete them just yet you'll be glad you put the ground work in:<br />
<br />
Sigil Earring of Veracity<br />
Starts with http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1667<br />
result is (one of the) best earrings in the game http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2299.<br />
<br />
Ring of the Shissar<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1999<br />
resulting in http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=11836,<br />
a nice ring even if you never plan to see the Emperor. Compared to Valorium rings of Galantry, fully raid buffed the Shissar Ring gives me more HP and AC, and it's a good thing to get out of the way. You'd need a raid to get the 3rd floor comms though.<br />
<br />
You might even want to look at gathering lucid shards for a VT key, if you think you might ever be in a high end guild. You'll be getting decent xp now and you'll thank yourself later. If nothing else you'll be the envy of other shard hunters ;)<br />
<br />
This page has quite a lot of ideas for quests, you need to be logged into EZBoard to view though<br />

<br />
hehe, I did actually hesitate before posting that, I'll edit if you like. I actually stumbled across that page via google so the knowledge is out there ~<br />
<br />
Today I found (google is my frnd!) another good site for quests http://kyrah.com/highres.html It's a cleric site but lists many general quests for all levels as well as stinky cleric stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Duecey Dooce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">No worries Vael, just teasin ya ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Oh wow thanks for the great ideas.  I was lookin at the Solstice quest today i think i can get my guild to do the combines to get the 9 items for the final combine.  I think everyone has one but me in my guild :(  but my earrings are lookin pretty lame compared to some of the stuff thats out there for a decent price.  Thing about jewelery is it always seems when we hit a decent named somewhere all the Jewelery and Mantles are caster gear or DRU/SHM/CLR only.  Id like to hit some of the high end quests like the signet earring of veracity, and maybe do the quest for the Strength of the Elements.   Oh well with those and my epic i should be busy enough.  I dont think my gear is like really sucky but some of the items i wear ive had since i could kill a mob that dropped FS weapons, and i know now theres lots of 55+ quests out there to be had its just finding them. <br />

Thanks a lot for the info,<br />
