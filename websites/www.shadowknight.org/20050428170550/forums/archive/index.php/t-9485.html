<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Akeikyl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm a Iksar SK I like the AC bonus and regen and forage sure helps my food last longer. Haven't really noticed the exp penalty at all but I'm usually grouped with some friends and i think grouping changes the penalty some how. I recommend a combo of Rygorr's, Sebilite, and Dreadscale armor. If your just starting grab a Nathsar Greatsword its 17/30 +10str this is a awesome ratio for many lvl's. Other then that spend all your points in sta and read over all the other posts here you will gain alot of info all this has been discussed before.</div></div><hr />

How about an Iksar Sk? <br />
You ask that as if there was any question that they are the best choice. :)<br />
<br />
Let me say this, once you get used to the better regen, playing a non-regen race seems almost unbearable.<br />
<br />
It sucks to not be able to use plate armors, as some of them are quite nice.  But once you get to raiding levels most plate armor suddenly becomes Iksar-usable, or you get an equivalent alternative (ie, Greenmist instead of Umbral in Fear).<br />
<br />
You have some terrific hunting grounds, I believe it is possible to get to 50 or 55 without being more than two zones away from Cabilis.  This isn't a big deal anymore with PoP, but there was a time when it was a great convenience to have your hunting grounds just a zone or two away.  And with people flocking to Luclin zones for exp, places like LoIO and the Overthere aren't overcrowded.  And some decent zones like Warsliks and Swamp of No Hope and Burning Wood never are.<br />
<br />
Most importantly, you look better than any other SK.  And they all hate you for it.  Which means you can be smug and condescending and actually have good reason to be so. :p</div></div><hr />
