<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gokil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello All.<br />
<br />
After playing everquest for 2+ years a wizard to 64 and now a SK to level 50+. I dont understand the balancing of neg 25 percent on a troll vs only 20 percent on a ogre.<br />
<br />
To me regen is not that uber of a benefit to justify  the worst exp penality in the game Troll/SK<br />
<br />
Ogre's have the best total stats for a SK + unstunnable. Trolls have less total stats then a ogre + regen + neg to fire resistance  At 50 I dont see regen kicking in.. possibly at 60 its a benefit but does it warrent 25 percent exp benefit?<br />
<br />
We should demand to at least give trolls same exp pen as a ogre!!<br />
<br />
Gokil 50 SK</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Regen works fine for me, always has...<br />
<br />
Not as huge a difference as your HP goes up through the levels, but still it's nice.  As far as Ogre xp penalty, what is it for?  The unstunnability?  On one hand, I think that's stupid, because it's not that big a deal to me not to be unstunnable... but I guess they do get a benefit that no other race gets.  As for Trolls, I agree that our xp penalty being the same as Iksars is a bit off... sure we have regen, which I think is a pretty nice benefit, but at the same time Ikky's get natural AC too, and we have shit for SvF.<br />
<br />
<br />
Either way, it's not important enough to me to make me want to petition on it or anything, even if there was a chance in hell that someone might listen, which there isn't.<br />
<br />
Just go to a dungeon where there is an xp bonus and level as if you didn't have the penalty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jupke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">it's 20 (troll/iksar) vs 10 (ogre) if i am correct :p<br />
<br />
And trolls dont care about XP penalties :p<br />
like i said in another thread, and i quote<br />
<br />
Playing a troll is a state of mind, a feeling, lots of players will never understand, hence the expression when somebody asks what race to play &quot;If you were a troll you wouldn't be asking this question&quot;<br />
<br />
Trolls are the seksies and best looking chars around...Verant knew that, and probably knew about the troll state of mind so they gave them 50% xp penalty when playing the true troll class (SK :p) <br />
SOE on the other hand are a bunch of whinny pansy ass pussies and listen to the majority of the non-troll players and removed class penalties so they could have an easier time playing there troll twinks :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rajak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's still the save against fire that get's under my skin.<br />
<br />
Other than that, agree with Jupke.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Xikuliz Litecleaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I play an Iksar SK and the XP penalty does indeed suck.<br />
<br />
The 3 XP taxed species have some different qualities...<br />
<br />
Trolls=regen, infravision, freeslam, great melee stats, plenty of cities to buy food in, cons: poor fire resist, can't fit in Sol B<br />
<br />
Ogres=infravision, freeslam, best melee stats, unstunnable from the front, plenty of places to bank, cons:  can't fit in SOl B.<br />
<br />
Iksar=Infravision, regeneration, slightly enhanced AC, cons: poor cold resist, can only bank in cabalis without faction work, gets the shaft on most plate armor...if it can fit a Gnome AND an ogre, Iksars should be able to find a way to wear it.<br />
<br />
I picked Iksar because i dig the race, the idea of being able to kill anywhere but cabalis kinda appealed to me.  My buddy plays a troll warrior, and at 52 his fire and my cold resist are similar, not sure how class plays into the equation.<br />
<br />
Regeneration does indeed kick ass.  The AC sorta balances out in the end.  All in all i think i'd rather have freeslam than regen since its such a badass skill, but now since it can be purchased with AA (along with regen), i'm not really worried about it now.<br />
<br />
Ogres have a better advanatage than Iksar with their massive melee stats and unstunnability, but Iksar get taxed more XP. <br />
<br />
My conclusion.  The 3 best SK races should get the same XP penalty either way, either ogres bumped up with trolls and iksar, or trolls and iksar knocked down to ogre level (preferably).<br />
<br />
Or, let the cons set by Sony be balancing enough, really, besides the XP penalty, i can't count how many times i've lost XP because some dragoon or bouncer caught me running by before i was powerful enough to kill em.<br />
<br />
<br />
My thoughts anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Manslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The faction issue is basically meaningless anymore since you can use the same spots as everyone else in velious/luclin/pop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ghorz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I agree. Faction was never a big problem for me. And since Luclin it is not problem at all.<br />
<br />
But the troll/iksar 20% penalty does hurt. Especially since lvl 50. That is one bubble more xp than your darkelf friends for example. What means a lot of extra killing. Really a lot.<br />
Every level, every AA point. 20% more xp. So if others kill 250 dryads for lvl 54, you have to kill 300.<br />
<br />
And regeneration is not so important for soloing (and utterly useless in groups), since you fearkite anyway.<br />
It helped in the early levels. But now I often wish, I had a larger mana pool instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Manslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">AA is unaffected by racial penalties.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Xorraz Shadowscale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have played an iksar for a while, and i find it annoying with the xp penaltie, and we have cons... we cant wear crusacean shell armor (good STA and can be bought by level 20 non twink) or other plate pre vel (all the cheep stuff) we got Sh!t cold resistance which is a pain in vel...(on the other hand we get higher fire resistance) we need a sheild to bash and we cant slam... i personaly think that trolls are a little better off, the reason i play an iksar is because its fun,  but has any one noticed that dark races, in general, have a higher xp penaltie than lighties (i sorta remember there once being a xp penaltie for pickin evil class or somthin like that...)<br />
actually i think to balance it iksars should get either a armor slot for tail... use of spikes in combat, or like a weakened tail rake... <br />
oh i also think trolls shoud be brought to like 15% (same with ikky) or... whatever works to make balance</div></div><hr />

Hehe, gotta agree.  You knew there was an xp penalty when you started, so don't start grippin' when you hit the higher levels and want it changed.  Or, reroll one of the weaker classes... :D <br />

Lizard and damn proud of it!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gokil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">What a lame argument, &quot;quit b*tiching*. Do you still use 'I know you are but what am I' type of statements when you get into a argument?<br />
<br />
I know the facts of the race they didnt bother me when I hit the create button nor does it bother me now. However after reaching now 54 levels, I still dont see what scale the developers used to balance the classes.<br />
<br />
LOL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Hsystah Shadowspawn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">All in jest, Gokil.<br />
<br />
heh, I know you are but what am I.    <br />
<br />
Also, looking for logic from the developers isn't healthy for the mind. Sometimes things look like they are in place simply because they were there to begin with, no logic at all. :cool: <br />
<br />
To be honest, I am only level 19 with my Iksar but I've been seriously contemplating starting over as another race.  Gonna depend on who I want to get higher (already have several toons in the late 20's/early thirtys and one at 50).  What I've been hearing is post 50 the xp sucks REALLY hard.  Then again, I could spend a whole lot of time in dungeons with the xp bonus's to counter it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hsys<br />
Don't hate me because I'm Scaley!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Darko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">As i remember ogres have 15% pen and trols have 25%.<br />
<br />
IMO both lizards and trolls get screwed, 25% exp for that little regen is really a joke, regen can be atained in other ways, and doesnt even have a nitcable effect int he end game.<br />
<br />
On the other hand IMO ogres have the best ratial ability in the game,  when playing for power, if you can pick ogre you should, its just simple as that.  Being unstnable from front is pricelss, its a skill you cannot get, warriiors get a simular skill that doesnt work all the time, but even ogre warriors get great benefit from training it since they gain the abiluity to avoid stuns from all sides.  <br />
<br />
Basicly what it all comes down to is, in the end there are 2 races of ppl, there are ogres, and there are the rest.  Starting stats faction cities religion etc etc etc all mean nothing, but unstnable from the front is priceless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Shredderr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">well ya allready started your peenalized knight so just deal with it as if it weren't there. hit 65 and be proud. personally i think its cool that there's less of us troll sk's than the ones with faster levelin. i also like the idea of the iksar tail attack deal, first i heard of it and it does make sense. they kinda deserve it for the lack of gear they get and the fact we can allready bash.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Keyan Aubaine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Ogres get slam and unstunability, trolls get slam and regen.<br />
The reason why trolls' is higher is because unlike ogres' theirs work all the time, in combat and during downtime, unstunability only works when you are the center of attention of a mob, and when it's hitting you from the front.<br />
<br />
As far as itens making up for the regen... until you reach the regen cap with high atk/regen items, you have to sacrifice stats to do it, and trolls still regen more, especially since they can make the same choices. Remember thei regen doesn't count against the regen cap.<br />
<br />
In short.. quit bitching.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Krushum Gudended</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">here, I have to agree with the jaded asshole... the penalty weeds out the weaker races such as dark elves, humans, gnomes, and erudites</div></div><hr />

The XP penalties should not be removed by any stretch.  They are in there to balance the races.  Does it balance them out 100%?  Probably not, but without them, it would be vastly worse.<br />

I quit Gorb cuz i got to caught up in the grind and EQ wasnt any fun, i came back when gnome SK's were put in game and played one up to 51 - the lvls went by quicker but i couldnt get out of the ogre mindset heh...now im back and having fun.<br />

in short, just play the game and have fun. If its really that big of a pain and EQ isnt fun, why play?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm still in favor of putting the old penalties back, but wonder what it was that would be vastly worse.<br />
<br />
Balance has pretty much been out the window for a while now. The player is defined by his equipment, everything else is just a minor variable.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Wolff-Kishner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I also like the idea of being one of the few Trolls.  We are by far much prettier then Iksars and Barbs, as for Ogres we smell much better.  I for one hate my exp penalty, but I chose my Troll cause I love being able to bash without equiping a shield.  I could've rolled an Ogre, almost did, but the idea of wearing their plate helm without Luclin graphics was enough for me to go the way I did.<br />
<br />
I disagree that they should remove the penalty.  I would hate to see my server with as many Trolls SK's as there are DE's.  Plus it doesn't effect just us, it effects the shaman and warrior class too.  So my solution would be, for SOE to remove just my exp penalty.  That would be ideal.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Kuvak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I play a Troll SK, and have ground hard all the way to level 59. I knew going into it that I had a 20% exp penalty, but I chose that path anyways. And do I regret it? Not in the least! Some people say that regeneration has little effect, but I quite disagree. I rarely solo, but normally duo with a necro, and I have to say, the regeneration bonus I get is HUGE! I have rarely had the company of a cleric except for on raids, so I need to rely on lifetaps and regen to keep me alive. I am working on getting my regen as high as possible even now, with a belt of the great turtle, and soon (after I get 60) the regen AA's (already have Regen 3).<br />
<br />
My advise on choosing a race for an SK is this: If you are making a primary character that you plan to sink a LOT of time into, then go ahead and eat the exp penalty, make an Iksar or Troll (Only reason I'd choose ogre is if you plan to group with a cleric pretty much ALL the time) for the nice regen effect. At 58 you get a lich spell, which gets upgraded at 64 and then you can get a steady stream of mana to tap/nuke/dot with and not have it kill your hp's too much. On the other hand, if you are making a twink, or even just an alt that you do not plan to spend a lot of time on, and want to hit 60 or 65 quickly with, then by all means make a gnome. From what I have heard they actually get an exp bonus (cannot confirm this, but Castersrealm said so).<br />
<br />
Just my 2 cents,<br />
Kuvak</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Calamity_Daemon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Personally I think that the regen is just a crappy excuse to nerf us Trolls ;P Actually to be serious I was sitting with an old time guildee the same lvl as me ( He was a Vah Shir Warrior  and I a Troll SK of course )) SO we had exactly half health (50% for you math losers ) and I regained so much faster than him that when he was at 63-4% I was draining my HPs to give to him. I still give hum a hard time about regen ) But it isn't really a good reason to bust us Trolls for. It's nice but honestly if you think about it we should get a XP bonus cuz we can gain hp faster and in an RP world that means we kill more=faster XP but I guess Verant can make stories but not follow through....I hope you guys caught my little train ride there....But as most other trolls I am PROUD to be the few (becoming increasingly more due to the Gukta thing ) and mighty Shadow Knight from Grobb! I like the sense of accomplishment I get when I hit a level and then groan as I lose double the xp ;P</div></div><hr />
