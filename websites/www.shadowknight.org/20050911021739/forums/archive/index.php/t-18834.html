If I switch targets the one I'm on can't be mezzed because of the dot I put on them.  Should I just stick with the first mob that came in and let the others in the group worry about protecting the cleric or chanter or should I switch targets?  Chanters seem to wilt pretty fast in the mid 50's when they are being clobbered by 2 unslowed mobs that resisted the aoe mezz spell.<br />
<br />
Alot of times you get that cleric hotkey that they can't heal you if they are being hit message.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arlevia</div><div class="date">12-10-2003, 08:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well really i think it depends on your group configuration, and how well the people know their classes. Normally i would stay on the mob that i had cast CD on, and let the cleric and chanter worry about the adds.  A good chanter shouldnt have much problem dealing with 2 mobs.<br />
However, assuming you are killing mobs above level 55, you could use fear to try and pull them off the chanter. this is fa irly decent aggro and wont damage or dot the mobs. if your fighting mobs below level 55 you could try the terror line, but i havent had much luck with those.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But the times I have switched I have done more harm then good.<br />
<br />
<br />
I usually tell the chanter not to try to mezz the ones I am on.  Good chanters know this and will always mezz the one I am not on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evilspawndark</div><div class="date">12-11-2003, 01:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First rule is dont pull more than the group can handle.  Ya there are accidents and the puppy dog monks &quot;can i pull...can i pull... with tongues wagging  &quot;..<br />
<br />
But, I wouldnt swtich targets...your gonna  get a tard in your group who assists to late and targets wrong mob, breaks mez etc...<br />
<br />
You should have it planned out who helps the chanter with CC if needed, IE.  have extra mobs rooted, or offtanked (without dmg) till mezzed.<br />
<br />
If you know your gonna pull 2, have the enchanter mez one on inc, and you grab the other. I usually wait to see which one is mezzed before I target - makes it much easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dakkin</div><div class="date">12-11-2003, 04:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Taunting off chanters in groups is usually a bad idea; by the time you've done it he's usually either safe or dead already.  As you say they wilt quickly at high levels.<br />
<br />
For your second question: If a cleric yells for help after a failed mez I'd go for it and taunt the mob off him, but turn attack off and follow taunt with a terror immediately (terror works much better after a taunt) so the mob's safe to mez.  I have a hotbutton to say I'm doing this and it's safe to mez.<br />
<br />
This is because if the cleric's yelling for help it usually means he's decided there's not much chance the chanter will save him.<br />
<br />
It's a bit situational; a bad cleric will throw large heals on inc then spam the group for help in the 3 seconds it takes the chanter to mez the add off him, so you have to watch out for healers crying wolf too.</div></div><hr />

I use them if needed, but if the chanter knows what He / She is doing then you should just focus on the mob you are fighting.</div></div><hr />

If you pull a mess, you are responsible for locking down that mob.  Let the CCer do their job.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Siilvir</div><div class="date">12-11-2003, 01:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We have the ability to hold non-damage aggro on multiple mobs. <br />
<br />
With a little bit of practice you can have the entire pull on you, allowing the enchanter, cleric and everyone else to do their jobs that much better and faster.<br />
<br />
Create a button that tells the group which mob to target, then switch as you need to. If the DPS classes are spamming assist without you calling for a switch, then explain to them what they need to do.<br />
<br />
Subtle things like this are the differences between a good SK and a great one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheOnlySanae</div><div class="date">12-11-2003, 01:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been playing a wizard for a long time...  I finally created a SK and enjoy her much more than I ever did the wizard.  I learned by watching other SK's while I was playing my wizard.  If a mob is coming after me there is no use for me to stand there and shout for help because I have root and snare and can take care of that without interfering with the CC.  <br />
<br />
Carrying my lessons over to my SK I have been able to keep all the mobs aggroed on me while my partner (or other groupers) can do their part and it does work....  but it can confuse the other players.  I would not switch targets unless I had absolutely no faith in the CC set.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DConquest</div><div class="date">12-11-2003, 02:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's all situational imo.  First you have to look at your circumstances.  Are you doing a LDoN Normal mission with a Chanter with as much hp as your normal Warrior?  Are you on a Hard Mission where you chanter is going to get 1 rounded?  Do you have another tank in the group?  Is this a raid situation?  How's the resists on the mobs?  Are there mixed mezzable / unmezzable where you are fighting? What's the style of play of your Enchanter?  These factors can make you have to adjust from the &quot; norm &quot;.  <br />
<br />
In groups, if it's normal LDoN I usually just charge the room and let the CC do their thing while I make sure everyone is assisting me on my Target.    Nothing too complicated, LDoN normal is pretty easy for any group set up imo.  <br />
<br />
For Hard Missions, things get a little more complex.  Higher lvl mobs = more chances for resists.  2+  mobs beating on you for 980+ involves a bit of healing and potential heal aggro.  Most Chanters / clerics aren't going to survive long if they get aggro.  That's why on Hard missions I try to keep pulls to a max of 2, and I have fear up.  If I have to pull via Promitiy aggro I won't have time to establish aggro with snare.  So, I call target, make SURE everyone understands this will be the target, melee / snare when it gets to me, then I turn off auto atk and fear the add.  This is done very quickly, I don't want a loose mob to eat my healer / chanter, and I don't want issues with mis assists so I explain to the group what I&quot;m doing.   <br />
<br />
If I know it's only going to be 2, I usually pull my target with Festering.  The group knows that the 1st mob inc will be the mez target.  That's usually a non issue.   <br />
<br />
If the pull is going to be 3, I give the chanter the targets and I pull mine with snare once again.  <br />
<br />
This is all assuming melee mobs that will charge you.  If you have casters you don't even need to snare, they'll stop and try to cast while the melee charge.  You can use your pet to single pull Casters in Hard though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kromglon</div><div class="date">12-11-2003, 10:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Depends on how well you know the enchanter and how you can time it to turn off attack. If hes getting resisted you can terror, slap it once or twice inbetween him casting. Good enchanters have a message that tells you which mob they are attempting to mez. For the most part though let them do their work, only in emergencies do you jump in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elviscerat0r</div><div class="date">12-12-2003, 05:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i generally call my target on incoming and give chanters a chance to do their thing, if i see chanter life dropping below 75% i will use terrorline and taunts on the adds but i NEVER do dmg to those mobs so chanter can mez again<br />
<br />
you have to be clear with your grp whats going on tho or the dps classes will just spam assist you and wind up attacking mezzed mobs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oagan</div><div class="date">12-13-2003, 07:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A good chanter shouldn't need help, other than heals to keep them alive.  I regularly partner up with an officer buddy and the 3 of us (65 SK/65 Shaman (me) and him 65 Chanter) go have fun.<br />
<br />
We went to Seb last week and decided to do Juggs, which was no problem.  The damn shrooms were a pain, though.  He had six mezzed at one time.  Thank god he regens mana like crazy, but has the UI with the timer, and knows his job well after 4 years.  Shaman kept him healed and the mezzed mobs slowed (refreshing occasionally), while  me and the pets just chewed on  mobs.  It was hella fun, actually.  <br />
<br />
He is an AC/HP Chanter, with no Ornate or Elem gear, but has close to 5k hp's fully buffed, plus his runes.  Good chanters are bitchen to watch.  They don't panic, they keep going for it.  All you need to do is keep them alive.  <br />
<br />
If people know their jobs, it's just a matter of keeping things going.  Don't switch.  Let the chanter mez, the healers heal, and the slowers slow.  You or someone decide which mobs to take next.  Take out the healing mobs first, and save the melee mobs for last.  <br />
<br />
The two of us rarely lfg anymore.  We just go around the game trying different encounters/zones where we once took several groups/raids a year or so ago.  Yeah, we wipe ocassionally, but we've got access to a clicker cleric when he's not also on, so it's no big deal.<br />
<br />
Once you get over the &quot;death&quot; thing, regardless of your class, this game becomes a lot more fun.  Shit, a couple of mobs in PoV or BoT, and we're back to where we were.  <br />
<br />
Let people do their jobs, and when you can, play with people that KNOW their class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Berren</div><div class="date">12-13-2003, 10:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been grouping with a chanter for most of my career.  We started when she was lvl 6 and I was lvl 8.  Now both us 65.  In most cases you shouldn't have to worry about a chanter.  They do their job and you do yours.  It just depends on the situation.  Example:  In Ldon now if we don't have a bard single pulling, I'll just pull a room of three or so, one snared so it can't be mezzed.  I bring them back and she WoM the group.  I terror the one I've already called to the group as the kill target.  It then gets pulled out of the cluster.  While I hold aggro and the DPS finish it off she mezzes the rest.  Means I have to fight the first fight with an unslowed mob, but this is not a problem if I'm doing my job with lifetaps and the healer is watching.<br />
<br />
As said before the only time you have to grab one is if high resist or some DPS class gets trigger happy and wakes one up.  Then I just use fear to keep it off her till she gets it remezzed.  Have a lot of practice with that, cause she loves charming pets, and then hasting them.  That's the fun aggro game of keep the pet when it breaks mezz from killing the chanter.</div></div><hr />
