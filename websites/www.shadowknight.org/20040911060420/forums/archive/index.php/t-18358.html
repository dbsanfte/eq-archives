<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ruuti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ok been up in  plane of sky for going on my second day now.  I killed all of the fearies on one half of the island.  Slowed the princess and killed her on that side.  Worked great the first spawn when I first got onto the island.  Then camped and went at it again.  The second time I tried it the entire Djarn island showed up and ruined my parade.  Not using any type of AOE.   The only other spells I was using was blood of hate and my highest life tap.  Oh yea and heal and slow from a 58 shammy bot.  If anyone has any suggestions as to what I am doing wrong I would love the input.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Phyro Soulstealer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">When i was doing the BoA portion of epic in sky, i simply made numerous trips up to clear island 1.  It is easy to do with a single group or even less.  I think it took me about 10 clearings of the island to finally get the sword.  And the princess was showing it when we ported up.  Gets expensive, but very easy to do.  Hope this helps.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ruuti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">it is the first Island that I am talking about,  I think that my lifetap, or my shamans heal is getting some kind of skewed agro.   Not sure but the zonewide messages don't usually come till after the mob is half down</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Phyro Soulstealer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Not sure if you're using hotkeys for your shammy spells, but if you are, check to make sure they dont' have a /say component.  We had a wipe one time because someone had /say as part of their heal spell.  Just a thoght.<br />
