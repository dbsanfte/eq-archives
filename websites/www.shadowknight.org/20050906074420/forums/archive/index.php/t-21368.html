<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">noobsk</div><div class="date">05-10-2004, 02:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I tried pulling a hard LDON guk adventure tonight with the following group<br />
<br />
Me (a 65 sk with all the tanking aa's and 5400 unbuffed hps and 1500 ac unbuffed)<br />
<br />
65 war<br />
 65 cleric<br />
65 chanter<br />
65 wiz<br />
65 shaman<br />
<br />
we had 15 out of 29 done on a collect mission when i got to this room with 4 or 5 mobs in it with at least 3 casters, all who aggroed as soon as u got near the entrance to it.<br />
<br />
I could not for the life of me split them up, i tried running behind walls and timing my FD etc and they would not split up, my fd kept getting broken by spells landing on me.  <br />
<br />
The only thing i can think of is that i should have given myself more space between the mobs and the group and had the warrior tag them, but the group was gettin impatient and kept inching up closer to me leaving me less space to fd.<br />
<br />
/shrug any suggestions?<br />

FD short of your group, and allow the mobs to reset, leaving the snared one behind.  stay FD and have the warrior tag your snared mob.<br />
<br />
its simple, kind of trivial, and allows you to break the room if they dont want to behave.  do this once or twice and you should be able to split the rest with just a bow and FD without much trouble.</div></div><hr />

Pet's take a beatings in LDON Hards, but they tend to do very well splitting casters. When I pull an LDoN hard I tend to use the pet usually on 3 rooms an adventure. If you try to use the pet every pull it will get very tedious, but on those few pulls an adventure, the pet is invaluable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Catharsis</div><div class="date">05-10-2004, 11:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. Snare split, old classic, takes too long<br />
2. Pet<br />
3. What I would have done ... War agro the room, let the chanter sort it out.  I vary rarely split things with a chanter in group.  They need something to do.  Would have been extremely easy with most of the mobs being casters because they'd come staggered to the party.  For all melee mobs, might need the war to flip a disc and back up as they get mezzed to help out the chanter, too often people in exp groups forget they have disc available.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boodadar</div><div class="date">05-10-2004, 12:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i'm only 52 so maybe i don't know but i always just let the chanter sort it out, have the warrior tank one mob with everyone assisting him and you get as much aggro as you can from the other 4 so that they don't all run after the cleric or chanter. when i do this i usually drop below 50%hp but i'd rather come close to going down then let one of my casters take aggro and take a dirt nap<br />
<br />
then again i usually feel its my job to make sure the casters don't get touched when i'm the tank</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dkhar</div><div class="date">05-11-2004, 02:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pacify. I ask for it sometimes when pulling. Say in the room you were trying to pull, I would have called pacify on the ones in the middle and then pulled the ones on the right, leaving the center and left in the room and bringing only 1-2. No splitting casters, screw that, there's no time in LDoN's for SK's to be laying on the ground.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Josahd</div><div class="date">05-11-2004, 07:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Depending on the zone, pacify is often death for the chanter or cleric in hards.  It can and will be resisted fairly frequently... although sometimes we use it on the odd pull.<br />
<br />
Unless you've got a badass group, 5 hard mobs in camp at once is a quick death... the cleric would get eaten before the chanter gets them all locked down.<br />
<br />
I like hards with bard pullers.  I just sit back and let them do the work.  If that fails.... same old snare and pet tricks do the job.  You just won't do it as fast as a bard or a monk.<br />
<br />
If you think hard's are bad to pull... try an ldon raid =p.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Airamwu</div><div class="date">05-11-2004, 09:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pet pull is the best way to split them.   Make sure you pet pull the casters and not the melee.   The casters will cast spells at your pet but will not kill him.   Run far enough after so that your pet is not in the targets line of sight.    This will force the caster to run towards you and away from the mobs.   Do this to all of the casters and you have yourself a split room.   BTW 5 hard mobs in camp and 1 mez resist = dead chanter, too much heal = dead cleric, slow resist = dead shaman.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With the group I LDoN with, I'd have to leave at 80% to give me enough time to Snare split and get the mob back to camp in time.  Even then the group would be waiting awhile. Much better to just use your pet for those few pulls where you would get over 2 mobs, and just pull two's other than that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenar</div><div class="date">05-11-2004, 06:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You pacifier is getting resisted fairly often?  Maybe they should work on some CHA.  Personally I rely on nothing but pet pulling unless I trust the chanter.. In that case I let him have some fun too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dakkin</div><div class="date">05-12-2004, 10:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Guk is a pain.  Unless you badly need named drops from there or want excitement, avoid it on hards.<br />
<br />
Pet pulling casters first works so long as there's no hasting or sowing mobs in the room, and you trust your group to stop the mob gating, and you're not doing it all the time in which case you'll have to keep recasting the pet when it dies.<br />
<br />
If all else fails, put your group in a side room, then snare one non-caster and train the rest to zone or far enough away you can guarantee to FD safely.<br />
<br />
Warrior tags the snared one and group kills it (with maybe one add or so unless you're incredibly unlucky) in the side room while you zone out and back in.  Rinse repeat till the room's clear.<br />
<br />
The logic of pulling non-casters first is they don't gate, so since you've trivialised the pull you get down to max. 3 mobs if one gates on you.  (That's the way bards usually do it.)<br />
<br />
Sadly Guk is full of unsnareable eyeballs so again, one more reason to avoid it.<br />
<br />
Incidentally, if you're not tanking and the group has plenty of DPS you save a LOT of time if you reduce your role to lining up the next snared single mob just out of camp for the warr to tag the instant the current one dies, while keeping one free room to FD/tag in between the group and mobs.<br />
<br />
I tend to get complaints when I do this though because it makes hard LDoNs so trivial (even bard pulling is exciting compared with tagging pre-snared singles for zero risk constant killing).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Klotar AngedeMorts</div><div class="date">05-25-2004, 05:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll also chime in that Pacification on 65 hard adventures is a crapshoot.  It may differ on hards for under 65's or 65 normals but it's easy to get 12+ resists on Pacification on a 65 hard.<br />
<br />
As most of us know, CHA does not affect resist rate but rather whether the mob will aggro on resist.  The chanter usually has ~300 CHA during these adventures.<br />
<br />
Edit: to clarify, I meant 12+ Pac resists on a single mob.</div></div><hr />

(i'm joking)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Holog</div><div class="date">05-26-2004, 11:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Worse case take one for the team and snare whatever is in the middle of the room and if you can get FD off just die they click you back in rinse and repeat till room is broken up. or do what i do and dont pull Guk's anymore.</div></div><hr />
