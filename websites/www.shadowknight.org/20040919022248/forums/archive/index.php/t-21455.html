I have a very similar AA setup that you have listed there. I just finished up the KA/SoTK line a few days ago. I'm pretty happy with the results. I can't give you exact percentages on improvements with it max'd because I only recently started parsing but it is noticable.<br />
<br />
If you're gonna do that line, I suggest you max them out though.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Krushum Gudended</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">swift journey 2, mc3, ka and sotk3, channeling 3<br />
<br />
should keep you busy for a while</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'd definately go ahead and do Swift Journey.  <br />
<br />
KA/SotK are your best source of improvement for melee DPS, but being limited to 2h starts to become more problematic as you progress and 1h/shield becomes more and more required for tanking.  Overall, it's a good AA choice for you.  <br />
<br />
Weapon Affinity is nice, but it's expensive and has a negative (albeit not large) effect on innate procs.  <br />
<br />
MC is good - it's a cheap way to get mana-regen not effected by the cap - always a good thing.  It's got deminishing returns, however, being a progressively worse value after each level.  <br />
<br />
I'd probably do something like Swift Journey 2, MC1, KA/SotK3, and go from there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Belyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">MC1 was the first archtype aa i bought.  2 aa is pretty cheap for ft1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vezax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Pet hold.  Its great, it make my pet a much easier to use tool, and I never really have to worry about it dying unless im not paying attention at all.  Especially nice for pet pulling, pulling pet off mobs, stoping your pet from getting eaten from DS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you're likely to keep using SEWS for a while, the 2h dps AAs are going to up your dps whereas WA won't (although the rune3 will proc a bit more). Combat Fury might be worth revisiting at some later point in combo with completed SotK/KA...the parses are somewhere on this forum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">From what I've read on this forum, if you want to do more melee dps, the correct order for the aa's to maximize the dps per aa is:<br />
<br />
KA 1<br />
SotK 1, 2, 3<br />
KA 2, 3<br />
CF 2, 3<br />
DR 1<br />
FotA 1, 2, 3<br />
<br />
So if I decide that more melee damage is the way to go, this is probably the course I'd take.  Swift Journey is tempting too since then I could catch up to the people that are otherwise running at the same pace, making it easier to slash them.  I've heard (and seen true) that a small advantage in run speed equals a big advantage in pvp.<br />
<br />
But probably the deciding factor is that I'll be using SEWS for quite a while, that I want to get a ton of aa's, and that more dps will tend to hasten the rate at which aa's come in.  MC1 is tempting just cause it's cheap.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Rhumba_Kween</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If I were on PvP, I would probably get Swift Journey, then I would probably get Touch of the wicked, that lowers the reuse time on HT. It pretty darn nice having it available more quickly in PvE. Even if its without the /disc. I'd imagine it'd be even better in PvP.<br />
<br />
Also does Imobilizing bash work in PvP? Might be a good option to look there also.<br />
<br />
But thats just me,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Swift Journey as priority.<br />
<br />
Then immobilizing bash, pet hold. After that Weapon Affinity or the dps AA depending on the proc of your weapon. Then bank 30 for Omens.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Why pet hold, silvir?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I kept putting off getting pet hold myself, and now I wish I would have got it sooner than later.<br />
<br />
Your pet is free dps the longer he stays alive and allows you to pet pull easier. Keeping him up at all times and under control with out pet hold is annoying to micro manage and for everyone else while you spam back off.<br />
<br />
It may not help you in PvP, but it will help against everything else where you can use your pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Everything Vici said, especially for pulls, and better control under AE conditions on raids. <br />
<br />
For me it was kind of like the the Unholy Steed AA. I put it off for a long time, but once I got it I don't know how I got by without it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">pet hold is by far the best AA you don't have, unless you never use your pet... and if you never use your pet, then i'd have to assume you don't really care about efficiency, and recommend you max out the finishing blow and the double riposte lines as soon as possible.<br />
<br />
other than that...<br />
<br />
swift journey 1, possibly 2 (just because PVP, otherwise its really not _that_ useful for the cost considering we have unholy steed for outdoor areas)<br />
<br />
i personally did and recommend MC1 and MC2 before starting the KA/SotK line.<br />
<br />
if you use clinging/fear for agro, spell casting expertise 1 is definitely worth the 2aa. not fizzling those is useful.<br />
<br />
immobilizing bash might be useful in PVP... i don't know if anyone has done any calculations on how much of an improvement it is though, so i really can't say if its worth the AA.<br />
<br />
critical affliction 1 is only worthwhile if you consistently use blood of hate... overall i'd still rank it below the SotK/KA line assuming you use both a 2h and blood of hate all the time. with SoTK/KA you're looking at about a 0.33% per AA increase in melee DPS with a 2her all the time (so if you do 50 melee dps (low for elemental+), that's about 0.166 DPS per AA). critical affliction 1 is about 0.16 DPS per AA only when blood of hate is running.<br />
<br />
intense hatred 1 is actually an okay deal for DPS when tanking, especially if you do stuff like tanking multiple unslowed mobs at a time in regular ldons. 2nd level is half as good of a deal, so stick with first level.<br />
<br />
weapon affinity 1 is an okay deal (depending on how good your  weapon proc is). with a sews i'd go ahead and get the first level before KA/SotK. WA2 is half as good of a deal, WA3 1/3rd, etc, so i'd just stick with the first level until you have KA/SotK/CF2 done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Well I did KA1 and SotK1 already...  got a lotta time on my hands, so a lotta aa's to do.<br />
<br />
Now looks like I'll hit a few other things at level 1.<br />
<br />
Mental Clarity 1<br />
Intense Hatred 1<br />
Weapon Affinity 1<br />
<br />
Then decide if I wanna save up for something bigger like Pet Hold or Swift Journey, or just finish out the SotK/KA/CF stuff.<br />

When lacking such AA's as pet hold and swift journey, which will make a noticable impact in terms of what you can/cannot do/how well you can do it, SCE can wait.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">there a particular reason you think SJ is so valuable? The two cons ive though of so far for it is the cost... and the fact that i bot a cleric full time with other aa to work on and dont like the idea of the cleric not being able to follow me and keep up. Oh and i also use jboots for a instant click outdoors in pvp, now i heard mixed results about if jboots slowed you down when you had SJ2?<br />
<br />
My magelo isn't up todate and neither is my sig but anyways doing Channeling Focus 3 atm then gonna start working up intense hatred probably to lvl 2. After which im probably honestly gonna quit my SK except for raids+ldons and duo with bst when bored heh and work up his aa's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Run 4 &amp; 5 or Swift Journey are terrific in many ways, depending a bit on how and where you are playing mostly. Content in PoP is really slow you will find vs. Run 5, and the advantage gained is welcome, especially in indoor areas or even no-lev zones like Time.<br />
<br />
I would sort of think that it would be nice on a pvp server to remain fast even if you get your buffs dispelled, and that a slight advantage over jboot speed would be usefull...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">oh yah i'd imagine it too, just the cost to me doesn't seem worth it im not EP flagged so aa's dont come in very fast for me in say an ldon, or pov, hoh, bot. Then again the majority of the people i fight are EP flagged or Time flagged who would have the potential to have said aa's and yet i seem to keep up with them fine... Im thinking its kinda like fighting a sow'd person when your not sow's its nice but its not a must. Its definetlly not the difference between fighting a selo'd person when your unsow'd hehe :).

On a PvP server, the difference between Tier 3 and Elemental+ players must hit home a bit more dramatically. Resists on Vt, Elemental, Time, then Time+ GoD gear make it so that L 65 means nothing without progression. Surely you might have more fun expanding your options through finding a different guild? Run 4/5 really mean fuckall with poor resist gear and a low mana pool and hp/ac base...<br />
<br />
Quiting your SK is your own decision, but I'd quit whatever guild that you are in first. Don't you want to follow the effort you've expended on that character to more challenging and new content?</div></div><hr />

Aside from that though, you could probably do run 4 &amp; 5 in 2 or 3 good days' grinding in tactics.  That's not bad when you consider all the applications and little advantages it gives.  Nothing game-changing by itself, but it's quite worthwhile, especially considering the alternatives.</div></div><hr />

To do that i'd have to switch servers :). And actually i want my guild to succeed at its progression just takes forever and is impossible to motivate people etc. My guild choice especially on my server is a moral issue.

Hehe yah the plus side is my SK has enough resists to do his job :). 250 mr unbuffed with pvp gear on and i can change into in about 5secs heh, decent jousting skills and i know how to use my spells. I honestly have had the most fun fighting time geared SK's with VDD's or planktons/sews etc :). Last night me and my cleric bot (terrible resists/hp/manapool hehe) managed to survive in mass pvp with a post time/GOD guild for a good 30mins. Kept cleric alive much longer then im sure the majority of skilled cleric with his gear would of been able to do :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">If I have a good weapon proc -- my weapon procs Rune III, it's a Stone Etched War Sword.  That worth getting Weapon Affinity?  I held off on getting weapon affinity since I kite a lot in PoFire and for running behind mobs beating on them, WA with a runesword = less dps, since occasionally some rune3 procs would take the place of shroud procs (195 points with soul abrasion 3).  So I'm waiting until I have some other aa's done or until I have a weapon with a beefy lifetap proc to get weapon affinity I think.<br />
<br />
If I tank a lot... well.. I tank a lot.  I'm the highest AC in my guild and #4 on the server for AC for shadowknights.  Top 20 for hp (working on this as I progress, of course).  I can tank vxed and tipt as well as any warrior in the guild that's not using a disc (defensive or riposte or whatever).  So maybe getting intense hatred 1 would be good.  I also need to do a couple other things to get more damage shield -- Bone Chill Shield (our guild blew off this mob in VT *sob*) and the chain armor with clicky bramblecoat (or whichever clicky) from Servitor of Luclin in Grieg's End.  Yeah belt from Tunare would be nice, but I don't see this happening any time soon.<br />

<br />
i see that you have fabled jboots, and i'd guess you have them clicked on as a buff when outdoors most of the time. if that's the case you might want to hold off on getting swift journey 1 even.<br />
<br />
anyway, swift journey 1 is a decent deal... if/after you've gotten that you have a while to judge the benefit yourself and decide if you want swift journey 2. i'd only get it right away if you're one of your guilds primary pullers, or if you think 150% base runspeed vs 140% base runspeeed would be really helpful in dungeons / dungeons PvP.</div></div><hr />

For the rest, if you're kiting in Fire you'll soon have 400+ AA so I wouldn't worry about it too much, just use horse sense not to go for the double riposte ones till after you've done resists etc.<br />

You tank a lot, and I'm not going to suggest you switch to fear/CD as your staple aggro combo but if you did, you'd probably like the aggro holding efficiency (especially when passive tanking with fear), so SCE1 would be invaluable.</div></div><hr />

With a Heavy Bludgon i found WA5 to be pretty useful it's really quite fun to see procs spam accross almost every other swing <br />
<br />
based on proc rate formulas... (http://www.shadowknight.org/forums/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=20180)<br />
<br />
heavy bludgeoner with black shroud comparison at full haste:<br />
<br />
proc dmg per min:<br />
<br />
		wa0		wa3		wa5<br />
siphon life	2*75		2.6*75		3*75<br />
black shroud	1.93*270 	1.91*270 	1.90*270<br />
total		671.1		710.7		738<br />
dps		11.185		11.845		12.3<br />
<br />
<br />
so, WA3 cost 12 AA total and netted you 0.72 DPS max (id4 included)... wa5 from WA3 cost 18AA and netted you 0.5 DPS max. the last levels of WA are not much improvement for a steep cost, unless you have a very very nice weapon proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">I guess the other things to think about are what kind of mobs am I fighting now.  <br />
<br />
I'm running behind mobs beating on them in pofire -- for that combat fury and fury of the ages would probably give the most increase in dps per aa, I'd guess (no idea really, but seems to make sense).  Also, I'd think more crits from melee would help out more than anything else for pvp, at this point.  Other than perhaps intense hatred 1.<br />
<br />
And I'm tanknig mobs in tipt &amp; vxed.  For this, I'd think intense hatred would give the most dps per aa and weapon affinity would help increase my ability to tank the mobs (due to additional rune 3 procs).<br />
<br />
Mental Clarity would help some in either situation, just to make sure I always had mana for tap or feign or whatever.<br />
<br />
Touch of the Wicked 1 seems like a good deal since then harmtouch would always be ready when the disc was ready, and it's only 2 aa's.  But I generally have harmtouch ready when I need it anyway -- first and last boss mobs in tipt.  So not sure this would help me with what I'm diong at the moment anyways.<br />
<br />
Spell Casting Expertise I would only use when I'm the kiter in pofire, and I prefer to not be the kiter if at all possible.  For vxed/tipt I use other spells for aggro typically.  So that wouldn't get much use, so I&quot;m tempted to delay that for a while, at least at present, and even when I do use those spells, fizzling hasn't caused me any problems to speak of yet.<br />
<br />
I have had problems with stuns from the lizards in tipt interrupting my spells, but not sure if the GoD aa to let you continue casting through stuns would make a noticable difference in that or not.  Same with channeling focus.<br />
<br />
Critical Affliction isn't near as good for shd as for shm/nec I'd guess.  But might still consider that at some point.  i do like using a lot of DOT spells, and with 30% less mana for dots due to bracelet of darkness, I can cast a lot of DOTS without running out of mana when kiting in pofire.  So that might be decent dps per aa... just not sure if it's as high as combat fury &amp; fota.<br />
<br />
Still not quite sure what to do after finishing pet discipline.<br />

Touch of the Wicked 1<br />

Intense Hatred 1<br />

Prolly gonna do the melee crits line next, to see the effect combined with bracer of the heartstriker.  Would be good to be a &quot;crit machine&quot; for pvp.<br />
