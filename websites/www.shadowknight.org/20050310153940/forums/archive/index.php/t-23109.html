<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">&quot;Easy&quot; is a relative term. Its a matter of ones particular progression in the game and what their guild (if they are even guilded) is capable of accomplishing.<br />
<br />
What might be easy to a very tight Txevu Guild for example might be exceedingly difficult for a loose unstructured family VT level guild. Those who have support will get their epics while those who do not will not. <br />
<br />
EQ however is a group oriented and focused game. It has always been and will always be. So those who have support amongst their player peers will eventually get their epics. Those who do not will go without.</div></div><hr />

So I have to agree with previous posts regarding the epic as bein easy for those with the resources to achieve it. I am afraid that although I have enthusiastically started my epic 1.5 quest, I will not complete it any time soon if at all. I have considered joining another guild but cannot bring myself to do it because I enjoy the people that are in my guild very much. I don't like the idea of doing a pick up raid for my pieces due to the fact that you never know who you are workin with and good get a wipe due to some newb or just plain retarded healers and so fourth. That is just my input and if anyone would like to give CONSTRUCTIVE input to my problem or just have a comment about my post, I would enjoy hearing anything that you have to say.<br />

<br />
Not really.. Its easy for me to say this because most of the epic mobs I've been doing for other people are 10x harder then ours. A lot of other epics have multiple kills that are way harder then the last boss of ours.<br />
<br />
Go try all-seeing eye in pom for chanter, or girplan guardian for wiz and youll see what I mean. I've also heard the last boss for cleric is a real badass, have yet to try it.<br />
<br />
Our 1.0 was rediculusly hard but that doesnt mean they need to make 1.5 easy to balance it out. This only shifts the imbalance to the otherside of the spectrum instead of the middle where it should be. Most people don't care. Game balance is more important then you becomming uber easier then other classes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have helped 2 friends with the paladin epic and with all the ground spawns and such involved the hardest part of their epic is the special instanced Vxed. Their epic is just as easy as ours IMO.<br />
<br />
I will how ever say that the cleric one is probably the hardest I have seen first hand. It is just down right crazy in comparison to our epic. But then again theirs Has a 6minute cast time compared to all other 10min ones. With prolly the best stats (for their class compared to others) on their shield.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If there is that much imbalance then perhaps the other quests could be toned down. You already have your 1.5 in your magelo so it is in fact easy for you to want the difficulty of the encounter beefed as you would not have to deal with it.<br />
<br />
These are intended for casual gamers and small guilds. Alot of people are going to have them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Trysbrina67</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">In my opinion epic 1.5 is right where it needs to be difficulty wise, even people i know in family / non raiding guilds believe they will have the epic within a few months.  This is a good thing and perhaps a few other epics need to be toned down so people who are willing to do the work and gather around 17 to 23 people for a fight or 2 can get them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Croix VorAbaddon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I agree on our epic being right where it needs to be. I'm having a bit of a challenge, but that's mostly becuase I'm unguilded, and relying on my alliance to help me out. <br />
<br />
However, I do think some of the other quests are extremely unbalanced. If you want a desctription, ask a bard about theirs. It's almost entirely raid force level, some difficult even for people around the EP level. Paladins, that I've seen, mostly have a problem with that last fight, more becuase it's in one of the most lagged out, train happy zones in the game, at the moment. We tried the other day ((Failed do to a random see invis pathing somewhere near the raid... the social aggro created about a 10 mob train, including a named, who tore through us like butter.)), and I spent about 2 hours before the raid even arrived watching the zoneline and scouting to ensure we didn't zone into a train or Shadowhunter on a rampage.<br />
<br />
I've heard necro's can solo most of theirs, and chanters can solo half, and then need a decent raid force for the rest.<br />
<br />
I'd say ours is nicely balanced. Nice mix of groupable, raid, and drop content. Not much, if anything, is soloable by a casual player, but we're not a class built to solo really.<br />
<br />
just my 2cp</div></div><hr />

Its a shame I just cant 2 box or solo it  :p <br />
One thing I wish would happen is that certain mobs could be engaged as part of an event that could only be started by the flagged player.  That way there are no more lame ass camps and you can still provide challenging content for a group or two ala Hedge Maze event.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>kharan_zechts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">but we're not a class built to solo really.<br />
Thats a gigantic load of shit, unless you really suck which is probably the case. Leech Curse, Lifetaps, and HT shine out more when soloing then grouping or raiding by far.<br />
<br />
I guess you casual peeps will never agree because its too hard for you as it is. But if this is too hard then imagine the others epics, they would be completely impossible for you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tell em its a Rune camp. There's 2 other named Murkgliders that spawn there and can drop Runes. There's some other named in the zone too that you can mostly invis and run to if you have a tracker.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Hehe, Thanks to OOW, we practically became best solo-tank in EQ via huge increase in lifetap proc power and lifetap dots plus lifetap dds to boot. I was able to solo-tank lot of things now instead of gay aggro kiting. I felt soooo good to solo-tank for a change all thanks to OOW for xp grinding. OOW is awesome to SK, indeed in terms of AA and spells and epic quest and easy access to nice knight only 1h/2h</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Yes, it's too hard to solo... so, if I can't solo half my mobs, it's &quot;too hard&quot;? You're not meant to solo most of your epic... hence it being EPIC. I can get the epic just fine and have already made a nice dent with the people I know, but I can't solo it.<br />
<br />
And I don't believe we're a class made to solo. We can, surely, I've done it, but we're not really MEANT to, in my opinion. Then again, look at the changes to snare, mob speeds, that fact that we don't get a new snare that I've heard of, summoning. Soloing isn't what a persons intended to do in this game at all, it merely can be done. And I'd rather work with a group then solo, any day, even if I'm earning less exp. It's an MMO... multiplayer, meaning intereact with the other people... last I checked.</div></div><hr />

Accordian to the ENC Epic 2.0 (not 1.5) thus far compleated thay need atlest 1 fight in Citadel of Anguish.. im sure most all the Epics will have atlest 1 pice from there.. And with Sony stating that Epic2.0 will be the an EndGame Wep for the given classes you can expect to see more fights / pices poping up there...<br />
<br />
Necro in friend was telling me that things are pointing tward Anguish for them as well...<br />
<br />
As for diffculty...<br />
<br />
I dont think thay need to make it in to a &quot;time sink&quot; i think thay should upgrade The SK fight some to make them 1 Full Time-Level Group (2 EP Level Groups) Also the Final battle some.. to be more of an &quot;Epic fight of Good and Evil&quot; as it was my guild went there after your Raid was over and .. well i was embaressed at how gimp he was comapred to .. ENC, Cleric, Necro, Mage, Warrior Or Even the Beast Lord Final fight for that matter... Hell Breeder was a bigger Pain then him.. I would be intersted to see if he is even 1 groupable by top end players<br />

I heard this epic 1.5 is cake pretty much, and I have helped with one, and it seems like cake because you only need 12 ppl for the part on killin the troll, then the Pally one was a Pain the Ass!<br />
<br />
I mean, The pain.<br />
We had 5 ppl:<br />
Me, a 58 sk<br />
My friend, a 66 sk<br />
A 65 Necro<br />
A 65 Shaman<br />
A 65 Cleric<br />
<br />
The Pally part was hard because for the 5 of us, we had to split them, and the split was hard as hell.<br />
<br />
Necro died about 8 times, Friend Sk died about 12 times, I died 2 times, and the Shammy died 2 times *grin*.<br />
<br />
I really disliked that part, but once we split the Pally's, it was cake.<br />
We quickly got the single mob pally, pulled to a safe spot, killed him quickly by slowing, then many ch's as well as hacking him.<br />
<br />
Total time to do it was like maybe 2 hours, but it was fun heh.<br />
