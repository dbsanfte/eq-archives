<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ashrai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know that the consensus is that it's possible to proc on a riposte but when I did a Search on this, all I came up with are that the chances are mathematically extremely low. Is there any proof out there yet one way or the other? I figured maybe the parsers and math pros here might have some data on it. I picked up a Bloodstone Sword the other night in Ikkinz and I like the bit of extra HPs and AC with my 1hander setup over my 2hander but don't want to take a chance on a proc during the times we're mezzing adds for whatever reason.</div></div><hr />

Damn, wish I had my log on the other day, I was attacked while afk by a Goo in CoM and was sitting at the time, I got back to my keyboard to find that I was standing and had proced Mental Corruption and got the message and everything. No proof now, but it did happen. I know I know like my word means dick.<br />
Edit, if I get time today, I will log on my shaman and my SK and just check and see, a quick trip to a PvP arena and a few hours of parses should do the trick and we will see. If not today, I will check it tomorrow. I have several weapons with innates and can do those and self buffs.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ashrai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks Window.<br />
<br />
Khat- yea I was wondering that, if the procs went off unrelated to the riposte.<br />
<br />
When it comes to selfbuff procs, in all the time I've been raiding and OT/TM'ing mobs, I have always had SoC up (sometimes MC) and have never once had either go off and break a mez. Probably should have thought of that before, there would be SK's breaking mezzes all over the place with their selfbuff procs if that were the case. <br />
<br />
My 2hander has an innate proc (Timeless Coral) and haven't had any problems with that either. I guess it's just the dot aspect of the Bloodstone that's got me nervous.  I don't turn attack on when offtanking unless it's clear that there'll be no mezzing of that mob, so my only damage to a mob in that initial stage comes from defensive damage- and have still never had it break a mez. <br />
<br />
Think I will just err on the side of caution and just be careful with the little Elf Shoe. Whatever possessed Sony to put a DoT on that thing, I'll never know....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ashrai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks for the extra log. That sure looks like that aug proc is going off from the riposte indeed. <br />
<br />
That said then, there's got to be some reason we all aren't breaking mezzes every time we riposte as mez lands- perhaps the game &quot;thinks&quot; the proc is part and parcel of the swing/miss and if mez lands just as you swing it doesn't let the proc break mez. I'm no math geek or parser so no clue if that's logical or not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
iif you just log with auto attack off. ripostes show the slash and then the riposte message in that order.<br />
combat rounds show proc damage, proc messages, then hit amounts.<br />
the second portion of your log makes it obvious because between your riposte and combat round someone else (warrman) got in a slash.<br />
<br />
proc messages always come BEFORE the slash damage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if you're like me and have all those messages filtered seperate from the actual combat damage, its very likely you had the message from mental corruption proc still up from whenever you were attacking.<br />
<br />
for the testing i'd suggest just /dueling someplace safe in a corner, SK holding highest delay weapon with a proc (or another with 2 procs), having your shaman slow your SK, and having your shaman attack with the lowest delay weapon he can find as well as pet from front. half an hour should be sufficient to disprove the naysayers =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>cames</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Window,<br />
<br />
However is the combat round that you have separated the automatic combat from the riposte?<br />
<br />
As I recall, riposte =<br />
<br />
- Other party does not land a blow<br />
- You get an automatic return attack - even if attack is off<br />
<br />
I think Khat is suggesting that she got the proc on the automatic return attack.</div></div><hr />

Yeah I have most of that turned off and filtered, thing is though I 2 box my Sk and shaman with EQW, the shamans EQW account has just about everything turned off, but I leave on spell emotes to my main window. The Sk account has it all off as well, but I leave on my spells so I can parse for DPS purposes and cause I am weird like that. The last fight I had been in was with a named skeleton there (was farming the runes for my baby beastie's claw quest, so I leeched some exp while my shaman basically wiped the area). Anyway, last fight was a named skellie, last damage I did was from a spear for something like 180 damage. The next message in that window was the message for Ghoule has hit a Gyrating Goo for 50 points of Non Melee damage. The goo beat on me for nearly 2 min before I noticed it, just lucky I didnt get my ass killed :p  In my main text box I had the emote for MC going off along with your mind fills with mana or however that goes along with a lot of red text. Like I said, I was AFK, seated, had a DIGS equipped. Yeah its not logged, but eh I aint THAT anal, but I will do the parse tomorrow with the reccomendations you have listed Window, I gotta mow the lawn today, wifey said so :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
you recall incorrectly.<br />
<br />
ripostes are recorded like this:<br />
<br />
you swing or miss<br />
(you possibly swing or miss if you have double riposte AAs)<br />
other parties riposted attack shows up.<br />
<br />
check your logs for any riposte while you had attack off, and you'll see this.<br />
and as i already said, even her log makes it obvious that that's how it done because in between the two different actions another player had their combat round occur.</div></div><hr />

We are talking about when we riposte a mob's attack.  What you described is a mob riposting our attack.<br />
<br />
When we riposte we get the free swing and why can it not proc?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">From TSW--<br />
<br />
Weapon procs (both player and NPC) only check once per round, as you have above.<br />
<br />
- Kavhok, SOE<br />
<br />
....<br />
<br />
The dev just posted on here saying weapon and buff procs are checked once per attack round. Since ripostes are not part of an attack round they cannot cause a proc for PCs.<br />
<br />
You can check it all you want, furious or not, you will never proc on a riposte.<br />

<br />
Reading comprehension is not your strong suit. Go back and read what window posted a few times, think about it a little bit. When we riposte a mob's attack, our riposte swing shows up in the logs before the message saying &quot;Mobby-mob tried to hit you, but you riposte&quot;. When window says something, don't question it, just believe it. Stop arguing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>ghoule</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Well I drug my sorry ass and my shamans sorry ass to an arena this week and did 3 seperate parses, each 1-1.5 hrs long, not a single riposte that caused a proc. Now I know that roughly 4 hrs of parses isnt exactly a huge pool, but it aint tiny either. For you anal types out there that want to know, I was maxed buffed on dex for my level (255 Dex), had Mental Corruption up and was wielding a DIGS with a Warm Emerald Shard (hey dont laugh too hard, gotta start somewhere), the shaman and the pet were both hasted with Swift Like the Wind, and the shaman pet was dual wielding. While I did manage to get a few skill ups in Parry/Dodge, nothing else happened of note. Guess I need to lay off the cheap booze before I PL next time...So yes Virginia there is no fucking Santa Clause.<br />
EDIT: forgot to say that I have them available if anyone reeaaaalllyyyy wants them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Razs Meows</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I could swear that you can proc on a riposte, except I don't /log stuff.<br />
<br />
Since my main is a bard, I am often pulling.  Some times I turn around and get hit as I am pulling (ie, I am turning around to mez, turning around to begin melee, whatever).  Bard riposte is only 75 (w/o skill mods) but I know I have proc'd here.  I've seen nuke messages, luresnare go off (Toetwister for those that care, used to use it), epic haste buff go up before I turned on attack.<br />
<br />
My best example though is when I was in a finished raid deep in some zone (think it was Akheva) and I /dueled a BST to get my OT hammer to proc.  I swung at him, his pet wasn't on /pet hold.  It attacked me.  I proc'd on the Warder with the BST himself targetted.<br />
<br />
Times like this I wish I kept logs :(.  Disbelieve me all you want, just stating my experiences.</div></div><hr />

Oh I am not saying that I dont believe, because like you I KNOW I have seen it happen,  but I am saying that I parsed near 4 hrs of straight melee dual wielding puppy power and Shaman l33t combat skillz wacking away at my SK and saw no procs on a riposte. I know that 4 hrs of parses isnt exactly long, but if it was gonna be happening, it should have by then. If it didnt happen by then, it must be hella rare.</div></div><hr />
