<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wyrdlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm starting to seriously hate this bastard.  He's not supposed to be a camp, but apparently he's not spawning at all.<br />
<br />
I've sat a tracker about midway between Cabilis and the LOIO bandit tunnel where he can see all the guards at Cabilis, the giant fort, and the bandits in the tunnels and nothing.<br />
<br />
I've killed 'a forest giant' during the night.<br />
I've killed 'a forest giant' during the day.<br />
<br />
I've petitioned with no response.  He's not under the world.  If he's in the wrong spot he's REALLY in the wrong spot.  Is there anywhere he could be that's outside of the tracking range I've described?  Keep in mind I've looked for him for literally hours, so if he's somewhere else, he's STUCK there.<br />
<br />
If an Iksar Knight is around on your server, go HT him for me, cause he's too pansy to show his face on Rodcet Nife.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Amphitryon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I duuno if hes moved or not since I finished Greenmist but if you just hang out in the central courtyard area of the Cabiilis ent in WW, he will just wander right up. He also tends to linger in this spot too.<br />
<br />
Didnt have to beat the bushes to find him BUT he does often wind up near the Giant fort on his rounds and if there any campers there, they will likely kill him since hell aggro.<br />
<br />
dont know what his respawn time is but if hes like alchemist Granika thens its prolly an 8 hour timer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Warpig</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have never seen him anywhere but in his &quot;static&quot; point! (On my server anyways).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Traxxn D'Sand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Is this the guy for Part III? If so, he was sitting straight out and to the left from the guards. He might be a triggered spawn when you finish the chat with the guy in Cabilis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Spylmann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I don't think I've ever not seen him near the guards, and I used to kill in WW all the time.<br />
<br />
edit- then again I used to commit mass giant genocide. Especially the &quot;a forest giant&quot; that has that agro message about holding a lizard. Oh well :D.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Saruton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">He wanders and gets stuck. I found mine near the bridge over the canyon near the Goblin Fort in the North. He was stuck there in the left side of the canyon not mveing an inch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Talonmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I could be mistaken, but I always thought he was a triggered spawn caused by killing one of the forest giants in the fort.  <br />
<br />
There is a message after killing him about an iksar knight jumping out and running off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sepcieulus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I used to hunt alot in WW and never saw this guy.<br />
<br />
I did the quest conversation ... when I exited West Calibis and entered WW ... he was sitting pretty much straight out from the guards at the entrance ...<br />
<br />
So he may be spawned ... not sure ... maybe I just got lucky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Wyrdlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">He must have been stuck somewhere I couldn't get him on track.  After patch he's reportedly back, although I haven't left Droga to check myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jobrill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">He seems to get stuck under the world a lot. If he's not there, you may wanna petition, or wait til after a patch.</div></div><hr />
