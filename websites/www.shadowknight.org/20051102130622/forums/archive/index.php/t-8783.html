<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Esclava_Detristeza</div><div class="date">11-29-2002, 10:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So the guild leader wants to take a couple groups into PoT to explore and maybe get some key parts to enter into Sarryn's lair. Being the eager little girl I am, I decided I'd join in. Little did I know I'd be pulling. I've always been very unsure of my pulling abilities...add to that, this was a new zone to me and all with me...and I was trying not to give the guild leader a bad impression of me since I have only been a member for about 5 weeks. <br />
<br />
I did fine till I got to an area with a lot of *a constuct of anguish* and a named.  I'd do the normal pull with festering darkness, move back a little and begin to cast FD.....then all of a sudden I am getting chain stunned. Basically I got single pulls by dying....not too efficient.<br />
<br />
I'm guessing that this would be a little easier for a monk to pull....I mean, it's really hard to FD/snare pull when you have 4 or 5 mobs casting stun on you or another that snares you.<br />
<br />
If any of you have had some experience pulling deeper in Plane of Torment, please share your techniques in case I have to do this again. I'd rather not have to die 5 times figuring it out again LOL.</div></div><hr />

At that point you can try to get an FD in or a snare if they're the sort of annoying mobs who won't hang about. My only real experience of lots of stunning mobs was in the Deep i'm afraid so i can't suggest a strategy i've used in Torment myself.</div></div><hr />

Outdoor zones suck for trying to split casters.</div></div><hr />
