<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Beyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Sometimes finding a group can take a while for me (no guild tag, at least thats what I tell myself). Anyways, wanted some advice on a few different soloing things.<br />
<br />
Now, I read that a lot of SKs solo in HoH, but I never see them when I'm there. They never say which part of the zone they hunt, and I've tried experimenting with different areas, but I seem to have the best luck, well, right at the zone in (the 2 entrance mobs, and the 6 down the road). I can straight tank these with virt/focus, but the downtime kinda sucks. I can kite them around with snare, pet, ignite, etc, but it seems to take too long to be worth it. What do those of you who solo there usually do, kite or straight tank?<br />
<br />
As for my other solo spot, Plane of Fire (I prefer pillars) well...kill for the kill the xp is obscene. Problem is, it takes me about 8 minutes or so to kite one of the bitches to death.  With just Festering up and asystole going, I can keep my mana pretty much evened out. If I start throwing in BoH, Bond of Death, taps, etc, obviously my mana suffers.<br />
<br />
What do you guys normally do? I had honestly never put much thought into soloing until my classes started picking up. I remember reading something Brael posted stating he soloed HoH, so I figured others would as well. Which camps did you use? Did you stragiht tank, or kite? Do the faster HoH kills net more XP than the gruellingly slow PoF kills? <br />
<br />
Thank you very much for any input.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The HoH soloing usually occurs in the basement as far as I know versus the entrance mobs you speak of. I think those basement mobs are higher level and give better exp then the ones at the zone in near the GY.<br />
<br />
The soloing in Fire usually occurs at the Tables. Your right the exp is very nice and I would say at 8 minutes per kill using only festering and asystole your doing pretty well. It takes me between 10 and 15 minutes to kite a single mob down and I throw in Blood of Inruku and the occasional Bond of Inruku.<br />
<br />
I hate using asystole there because of the resists I get. Those mobs can sometimes resist darkness 4 or 5 times at a stretch and the same can go for Asystole / Dark Constriction. I prefer Blood of Inruku + Blood of Hate as that never gets resisted and I dont waste any mana that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Beyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You hit the nail on the head with that one, thank you very much. Now I just need to get that Blood of Inruku, heh.<br />
<br />
Thanks again man.<br />

There's also the supposed &quot;safe hall&quot; in the south. It's not too bad, but be VERY careful. They've been toying with HoH and BoT, and the magic resist got a bump up a bit. Also, watch for random See invis mobs. Nothing there normally does, but I've seen chanters memwipe charmed guards and leave them, and some see invis afterward for some random reason. This may have been fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Meowbot Killdozer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Greeting Beyr. Well, I've soloed in HoH quite a few times and it just doesn't do it for me. I don't know if I'm in the wrong camp but tried many different ones. The basement isn't all that great because sometimes a valorian sentry will spawn that is immune to snare, maybe there is some trick to killing them but I haven't learned it yet. I used to kite them with my necro but it just wasn't worth the trouble. Exp never seemed all that great also, have no idea how it will be at Level 70 maybe I'll check it out. Resists were always a little better there than they are in Plane of Fire. There is another camp I can not quite remember where but once it is split its really easy to kite, long hallways with an intersection where no mobs spawn to close. This wasn't a bad place when I duo'd there a bit but I still don't consider it good exp.<br />
<br />
If you are killing tables in 8-9 minutes you are doing quite well for yourself, the only real problem with that is mana regen/mana preservation. When I kite there I run out of mana pretty fast otherwise I could kill them in 6-7 minutes but the downtime is far to much. All I know is that castle 1 (pillar) area is far less exp than the table mobs, and also magma guardians aren't as good either. There really is no advice to be given here, just kill them like anything else. I've done about 6 AA there in one session and I just lost interest because compared to my necromancer it was embarassing how long it took. I really can't stand exping anywhere now unless its Riftseeker's followed by Kodtaz/Tables so I'm probably not the best person to answer about soloing.</div></div><hr />
