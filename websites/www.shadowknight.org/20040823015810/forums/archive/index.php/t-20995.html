<br />
Is it funny that in a village 150 kilometers from Ho Chi Min villagers are coming all around to worship at the carcass of an 83 foot whale and when it decomposes they'll build a temple out of it's bones?<br />
<br />
<br />
Is it funny that in Sicily there is a town that has been abandoned because they believe the devil is starting fires?  All sorts of cars and electrical appliances are spontaneously combusting even though power was cut from the village weeks ago.<br />
<br />
I didn't think so<br />

<br />
The worshipping is true, though perhaps not in the sense that the West thinks of worshipping.  Earlier this year the same beach had a smaller whale wash up and the same thing happened on a smaller scale and they made a shrine out of those bones.  A dead beached whale is supposed to be a sign of coming good fortune to fishermen.<br />
<br />
The Sicily one is weirder to me though.  For weeks scientists and &quot;scienticians&quot; have been coming to the village all believing they had the answer and no one has been able to figure anything out yet.  The devil starting fires in their appliances is just seems silly, doesn't he have better things to do? ... like posting here?</div></div><hr />

Just another reason to kill lots of whales I guess.</div></div><hr />
