<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Akeikyl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">With all the Pure casters now being able to research many formally drop only spells and priest classes having their spells researchable by silk casters why can't Hybrids have some of our drop only spells researchable by our parent classes? Now I know other hybrids couldn't do this because their parent class is not a silk class but they could just use the same silk caster their parent classes use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jobrill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Or they could just add Mental Corruption to the Luclin Spell Vendor in PoK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Itzena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Isn't it there already? :confused: Anyway, necros will be too busy researching cleric spells soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Keyan Aubaine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Honestly while i'm not opposed to the idea, i don't really think it's important...<br />
<br />
While a few of our spells are kind of a pain to get (shroud of undeath and deathly temptation), all our other spells are easily attainable, in fact we are still much better off than any caster class for spells as both SoU and DT are easily replaced eventually with spectral parchments.<br />
The whole research upgrade was made to make the skill useful again while leveling the play ground for spells hard to get like malo torpor pox etc...<br />
They only added other spells for the sake of being consistent.<br />
<br />
While it wouldn't be a bad idea to do the same for us, remember most of the spells that would be concerneds are vendor bought, and the only 2 it would really affect are replaced by any SK relatively easily (taking the shaman example, pox is never replaced, malo and torpor are only replaced with level 65 runes).<br />
Our other dropped spells are easy to pick up in the bazaar, while rare shaman spells are worth 70-80k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Darko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I completely agree with keyan.<br />
<br />
Also i dont see whats with this, mentality of &quot;they got something we need it too!&quot;  Casters are casters, int casters have always researched their spells.  We are hybrids we dont research, it is true that some of our spells are the researched spells necros have but out class specific spells are not that of a caster so they shouldnt be researched.  <br />
<br />
Further more, priests currently dont research spells, if sk get researchable spells it will make both rangers and paladins whine, since we are much more like a pal/rang than a necro.  <br />
<br />
And finally there are many more important topics that will actually have a REAL effect on the class, things like more lifetap masteries (since pally/ranger still get more heals of taps than us to my knowelge) and fury of magic etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rezzbagg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">We get lucky enough that we share some of the spells with our parent class, and I believe all the shared spells are either vendor bought or reserchable. I agree, a few spells isn't really worth worrying about, but wouldn't be mad if they did it anyway, I just think there are about 50 things on the sk wishlist ahead of this..</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, It isn't. One of the few Luclin spells that didn't make it onto the vendor. Maybe the only.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Drakonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Theres always at least 20 copies of Mental Corruption on Bazaar vendors from 10pp and up anyways, in my experience...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kizzestra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Since we are 1/2 warrior and 1/2 necromancer I think that warriors should be able to research our spells for us too.</div></div><hr />
