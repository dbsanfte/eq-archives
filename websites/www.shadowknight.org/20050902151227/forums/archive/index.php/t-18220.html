That's my suggestions anyways. If you don't have enough HT AA's, you may have to work something else out.<br />

Fol is nice if you can land it. Many beasties have very good ac now however our spell selection is very good if you know use it. <br />
<br />
Your gonna want to have some type of dispell up too for the slow which can be pretty nasty depeding on the level. I believe they are disease based too so it might be harder to resist. <br />
<br />
You also want to dispell them if you can they can self buff very well, without spir rad kei or sow they will be at a serious loss. Dispell fast and hard. <br />
<br />
Send your pet to attack his (ya it will die but who cares you only need a short ammount of time to pummel his arse spear dark ht and if hes dispelled your in a good position.) <br />
<br />
If you get the dispells off and keep your pet on his for a second and resist fol you should be fine. If you dont keep the pet off of you it will be hard most likely especially with the stun procs and 150 or so damage can get pretty nasty.</div></div><hr />

Their pet has very efficient heals and straight up tanking one I think I would lose even if it did not get any heals (granted when I tried I had like 100 less MR then what I have now so the stun proc landed a lot). Dispel the pet, lure it away and festering it, then kill the beastlord by jousting and ToI (or use dots too if their resists are bad). You can't straight up tank the beastlord either, their DPS is insane (like monks).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">asguth</div><div class="date">11-10-2003, 09:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good point dispell the pet if you can. <br />
<br />
I dont have my beastlord past 54 so i cant speak for very high level beasties except what i see at hedges and stuff. <br />
<br />
Very easily my second fav class tho hehe!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dhantes</div><div class="date">11-10-2003, 10:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">defensive aa's own pet classes in pvp especially LR5, ignore the pet go for the beastlords throat, beastlord heals aren't very good so i suggest dropping ignite blood, boh if you can land them. Then joust him down using ToI to keep your hp up and to hurt him worse case just DT him but you can kill beastlords without DT. Dispelling the pet is very wise move to do also,</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
a few pretty good ideas tho, thanks and i'll have to try them out next time we are both on</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cirulik</div><div class="date">11-12-2003, 12:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a baby Beastlord, and expected to get owned by SK's, but so far that hasn't happened.   <br />
<br />
But I agree with the dispell idea, and getting a pet would be the first thing I did.  So far I've only dueled a few times on my BST, but the basic strat is to get my pet on the SK to screw up his targeting, and damage, and joust or if I can get the SK to engage pet, whomp a few rounds with my H2H until he turns, then bail and let my pet have him from behind.  Not rocket science, but well executed it seems effective.  <br />
<br />
And yes, kill the BST not the pet, if he lets you.  Pet heal efficiency is insanely good, but self-heals are wretched.  I carry Stinging Wort, though, which gives me better heals (esp at those lower levels).  Also be careful to keep pet dispelled by casting more than once - trust me, if you cancel my warder's proccing buffs, I will try to put them back.<br />
<br />
At higher levels, don't forget BST can also cancel magic and will dispell you if they have a clue.<br />
<br />
We should beat them, but it's not a walk in the park....</div></div><hr />

If he dispels you, click these to fill the spots instantly so your more important buffs are not dispelled.<br />
Use terrain tricks to get rid of the pet..example…<br />
<br />
If you are dueling in The Overthere, have levitation up and have the pet chase you to the edge of the big cavern in the middle. Let the pet drop over the edge while you come back.<br />
The pet will not be able to get back to the BL unless the he summons it.<br />
<br />
After you get rid of the pet, dispel the heck out of the BL.<br />
As for melee, always strafe behind him and whack him. This will confuse the heck out of him. He will spend most of the fight turning around trying to locate you. Use spears in-between swings.<br />
If he manages to outmaneuver you, Shadow Step, tap and try to melee again.<br />
Finish off with HT.<br />

<br />
He's a duelwield class, have as big of a DS as you can get.<br />
<br />
Most seasoned EQ players should know to put 2 or 3 clickies in the top slot.  Don't count on Dispell.  <br />
<br />
You do the same.<br />
<br />
No way a Beastlord is going to beat you in toe to toe melee unless there is a big lvl or gear differential.  <br />
<br />
Ignite Blood and ToI are your best bets for spells if he's VT+ equiped.  <br />
<br />
If not, lay in with spears / BoH / ToV.  Key is to waste him before he even knows whats going on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cirulik</div><div class="date">11-13-2003, 03:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">He's a duelwield class, have as big of a DS as you can get. <br />
<br />
If he doesn't know enough to use a 2HB and joust, he's going to be cake.  I swap quickly to H2H if an opponent is spending serious time facing warder, otherwise have a big-damage 2H in.<br />
<br />
As far as strafing behind him to confuse him --- once again, that's a matter of the more skilled at dueling.  That's exactly what I do when on my little BST and opponent is busy with pet -- get fast free attacks in and get away, and he has pet targeted instead of me.  <br />
<br />
Another thing to watch for if you decide to kill his pet --- he may stay pretty far away and not heal, and cast a new one before you can get to him.  How do I know this :D .......and of course pet attack on you is hotkeyed.<br />
<br />
.Key is to waste him before he even knows whats going on <br />
<br />
Right on, or at least that's my current perception.  The longer the fight is, the more the warder helps.  And at some levels the warder is a solid dark blue mob, and is always hasted with nasty procs.<br />
<br />
All the rest of the comments - also right on.  Unless I don't understand something, I would be toast on my BST to a skilled SK (especially if only one fight, with HT), because of the variety of things we as SK can do.  But against a good player, it's not a totally trivial fight</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ZarrosLivinglight</div><div class="date">11-13-2003, 04:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Beastlord slows are all magic resist.  Only shamans have disease resist.<br />
<br />
Unless you have your horse, don't count on outrunning a beastlord, we can take hits and channel a SoW if need be.  Disease and Poison dots can be nasty, but we inherit some of the best cures for both from shamans.<br />
<br />
Warder quads, and the 62 warder hits in the neighborhood of 50-70 per hit and hasted is a real nightmare.  Beastlords can pick procs, meaning dispelling a beastlord's warder can ironically be a bad idea, if they notice you are resisting the magic proc, they'll switch to cold, or to fire, or to disease...<br />
<br />
Warders not only quad, but they bash, make sure you have improved channeling focus, or can keep away from them.  Dumping mana on defeating the warder, or worse your harm touch, is exactly what the beastlord WANTS you do to do.  They get out of your range, wait for the pet to die (it will be sowed of course, and that sow will be at the bottom of a LONG list of buffs, pets can have up to 30 and we have a wide variety of crap buffs we can drop on them.)<br />
<br />
As far as dots on me go from NPC necros, I tend to ignore them as long as I am not taking melee damage.  Self-buffed I can get to over 3khp and with race regen, aa regen, spiritual purity, and chloroplast, I heal fast without having to worry about mana.<br />
<br />
Biggest risks are going to be getting blinded via FoL, so keep MR up.  Don't let the BL kite you, you need to kill them, and they are (if they are smart) going to stay sowed and stay far enough away from you that you have to focus on their pet.  Their dots, while not as nasty as yours, do pack a punch starting with Scorpion Venom at 62 (mind your poison resist.)  Be especially careful of beastlords who are level 64 and have that pet and suspend minion.  Mana dump to kill the first one and hope to defeat the beastlord can have you in for a very rude suprise.<br />
<br />
Have some means of curing disease is a must, because while its magic resist, slow is still curable via cure disease.  Be wary of Incapacitate as well, which can take an edge off your fighting stats.<br />
<br />
Basically the longer the beastlord can have you dealing with their pet, the larger the likelihood they will win.  Since the BL can sit safely and make new warders as often as necessary, and their warders will eat your pets level-for-level, for lunch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ganaith</div><div class="date">11-15-2003, 07:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its easy. Most bst's tend to duel wield, and know straight up melee is going to win them the battle. Make use of that assumption. A nice DS potion combined with our cloak line is a lot of extra dps.  make sure to pumice the shit out of him.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ZarrosLivinglight</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 10:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shamans get at least one post-60 slow spell that checks disease resist (and are the only class currently with a disease-resist slow at all).  I think the name of it is Cloud of Grummus or somesuch.  In any event, all slows add disease counters as a means of curing them without having to chain-dispell the person afflicted.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Winkles</div><div class="date">11-30-2003, 06:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">At level 55 I went against a BL in arena just goofing around.  He was lvl 65.  The bst slow bounced off me 4 times in a row with a mr of 116.  I had no spells up and his pet was killed off by a necro but I got him to 35 percent without using ht.  I do believe that if I had 5 more levels and some aa that it wouldn't have been too hard to take him out if I just focused on killing the master and leaving the pet alone.  Lvl 65 shaman on the other hand turned me into a pile of mush.  He kept up his q spell and just let me hit him once every 20 seconds it seemed after he landed slow.  After a nasty dot landed he was nice enough to kill me off with a critical ice nuke.  What a pal LOL.  I also took on a druid one on one and took no damage at all.  Druid was 56.  Root or ensnare didn't land once and either did some frost spell.  Took about 2 minutes to make him run at 10 percent health.  Could have ht them but didn't need to.</div></div><hr />

I just followed and dotted pet like crazy as well as here slam and my axe did the rest she never stood a chance.... but let e also say the next day i took on a 56 bst (also a friend) and they had better skills and managed to barely kill me.... regardless of that fact though a sk anyday of the week can take a bst regardless of lvl unless of course its a impossible match (1 sk vs 65 bst)</div></div><hr />
