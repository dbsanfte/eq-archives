<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Calamity_Daemon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Alright firstly I would like to state that this is MY view on the races and MY opinions. I will not say that I know EVERYTHING there is to know about SKs and all but I DO know quite a bit so bear with me. Now I made a Troll SK because I like Innothule Swamp (This was before the attacks on Grobb) and House of Decay (An RP guild on Inny server) would only take Trolls Ogres and DEs. Well my thinking was that hell if I am gonna make a char then why not make it one fun ride. So I make my troll ( I had tried to make many before him consisting of Ogres, Trolls, DEs, and even a human) right and I'm out killing stuff and before I know it I am level 40 and still kickin ass! Well here is what I think being sorta &quot;Up there&quot; ( I dont mean to sound snooty or ALMIGHTY or something newbish like that)<br />
<br />
Human: GAWD these guys piss me off. There are THOUSANDS of them almost matching the total paladin human population. They have NO night vision which UBER SUX to me (Perhaps it aint that bad to others) and they are so...basix! How the &amp;*%#(*$ do you RP a human? Thats what I thought.<br />
<br />
Gnome: ...I like gnomes ( I know most SKs mock the gnome) but i like em and I think they look kool. I like the newbie zone and stuff and they look so cute in armor ;P But they have crap strength BUT they got agi and dex and all that stuff so why not! I think a gnome SK is something odd and should be embraced<br />
<br />
Erudite: ON THE OTHER HAND we got these guys. In my opinion why someone would like to play a Erudite is either crazy or ULTRA N33BI3!!! Since Luclin they look better (Stronger and not pansyish) but CMON who wants to dress in an iron skirt (Yes thats what thy look like with armor last time I saw) They got a good zone tho actually if you have Paineel. Good till bout maybe 15 but I only got to 15 with my necro. But every SK Erudite I met is such a friggin twink its not even funny. and they cant tank. I am serious in a group they puss out IMMEDIATLY! But i guess SOME can handle it but...NO NIGHT VISION SUX (to me )<br />
<br />
Iksar: I like these too they look like dragons and got that nifty regen and an UBER newb zone. Good quests good weps but they cant wear plate witch sorta sux. Its funny they can wear chainmail tho (Cuz it would catch on their scales when taking it off ) They got nightvsion which is good and Kurns tower rulez. Only bad thing is that 20% XP penalty which sux but my troll has the same and its not too bad<br />
<br />
Ogre: I stand neutral with these guys. I like the str and the int is higher than trolls and you can buff the str and int so the int is higher than a Wood Elf. They got night vision and mass HPs and str is the best (I said that already...) But feerot is THE SECOND CRAPPIEST ZONE EVUH!!!! No newbie quest that are worth it but these guys are pretty rare. PLEASE DONT TWINK!!! Alll the OGSKs I seen wear like Armor of God and have equiped Sword of Uberness. Bothers the hell off me. O yeah they cant be stunned from from which means you get mroe hits it which means you kill dat tree fastuh! ;)<br />
<br />
Trolls: My fav cuz now they look BAD ARSE and I made it before Gukta (By like a week;P) and I had Innothule all to my lonesome pretty much. They got night vis and they gots nice str but the dumbest creatures in all of EQ what i did is pumped the int in and put the rest in sta and str ( hell i was stronger than a ogre now and smarter than a Wood Elf ) regen is nice to have at higher lvls when downtime is higher. I dunno this was the race for me (I dont care what you pick BTW) I just like the smell the taste and the look of a troll i guess )<br />
<br />
Dark Elf: TO MANY everyone and their little brother plays these dudes! I dont know why! The agi and dex are good and the int is even better for trade but honestly! I HATE the newbie zone. EVERYONE is there ( hmm reminds me of Gfay ) and higher lvls kill the crappy guards (Which may not be too bad for those dirty beggars) too bad the trolls had to move here... They do look cool tho <br />
<br />
Well, thats my take on all the races I hope I didnt forget one. But Thats what I think. Please dont flame me cuz o what I think. You can post your opinions against me tho I'd like to see what everyone thinks really soon. Please dont think I am newbish for what I think cuz that seems childish to me.  But please ROLEPLAY FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!!!! ACT EVIL THIS IS A RP GAME SO GOSH DARNIT RP!!!!!!!!!!!<br />

<br />
Yeah thats exactly where you  fail .<br />
<br />
You're attempting to critique the SK races based on your own opinions, which you can't do. When you review something you're supposed to remain as objective as possible. <br />
<br />
Good try, though.</div></div><hr />

If you don't keep your opinions to yourself you will get flamed.  Just because you say something does not mean that its right.  What you basically did in your post was insult almost every sk race out there for their minor flaws and try to justify it.  By saying that you've opened yourself up to some rude comments.  Some of us don't agree with what you 'think' so you will get flamed for that.  I also wonder what the other trolls will think of one of their kind who loves gnomes.<br />
<br />
P.P.S TWINKS MUST DIIIIIIIIIIIIIIEEEEE<br />
<br />
Jealous that you don't have good gear?<br />
<br />
P.P.P.S BUSH IS A MORON AND SHOULD UBER DIIIIIIIIIIIIE  <br />
<br />
Actually, your the moron half-assed liberal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Calamity_Daemon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">EXACTLY, these were my opinions! I am glad you guys disagree because this is what I was aiming for. I didn't want to get flamed but rather get other people to post their opinions like OGRES RULE or ERUDITES SUCK or ONCE YOU GO GNOME YOU WONT GO HOME or something like that. I understand that you people (not exactly meaning YOU but you know) will not (In most cases) agree with me on probably all of these topics, but remember two things<br />
<br />
1. This is a game let's have some fun with it and maybe some debates (I know someone is likely gonna quote this so I have a readily made comeback)<br />
<br />
2. You are also as free as I am to post your own reply's dont waste them on flaming me you might as well say your race and why you like it I happen to like troll because they are big and mean the deffintion of evil to me...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Cestodas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">C'mon guys, give Calamity a break here. I think its pretty funny to read peoples opinions on the races, and if you dont agree with whats being said speak your own views :)<br />
Your take on humans however I dont agree with the whole way. I mean... its hard to think of a more evil race is it not :D<br />
<br />
And lets not forget the Golden Rule, huh Drynnious?<br />

Golden Rule -- I have given Xilith the go ahead to lock or delete all Flame Wars between people. I don't want to read it and I'm sure most other don't either. Arguments about a topic are fine as long as person A argues the issues and doesn’t call Person B a dumbass for his views.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Calamity_Daemon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Thanks! (I dont mean this a little victoy screech) But thanks for understanding me. I am glad that you dont like my view on humans tho and I hope others follow suit in posting their fav race and why</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Toltanus Thule</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I don't think you have been playing this game very long.  Criticizing a race based on whether they have night vision or not is pretty newbish.<br />
<br />
In order to fix the whole vision thing, play with your gamma settings.  Turn it up to 70%+ or so and you can see in tunnels without much of a problem.<br />
<br />
In fact, I am in a training class and bored, so let me dissect this a bit more:<br />
<br />
Human: GAWD these guys piss me off. There are THOUSANDS of them almost matching the total paladin human population. They have NO night vision which UBER SUX to me (Perhaps it aint that bad to others) and they are so...basix! How the &amp;*%#(*$ do you RP a human? Thats what I thought. <br />
<br />
Thousands of them... riiiight.. on what server?<br />
<br />
The night vision can be easily fixed as outlined above.  Also, remember that we get Infravision (Deadeye) at level 22, and we get Ultravision (Shadow Sight) at level 49.  This applies to Erudites as well.<br />
<br />
As far as roleplaying a Human, ever thought of the fact that you are roleplaying a Human Shadowknight?  A Human Monk that worships Quellious is not going to be roleplayed the same way that a Human Shadowknight that worships Innoruuk is going to be played.<br />
<br />
Each character is roleplayed differently, and it has to do a lot more than just race.  The people on Firiona Vie, for example, have forums where they post backstories on their characters and even Human Shadowknights there are not cookie-cuttered to be like everyone else.  Some are honorable, some not so honorable.  Some are pranksters, some are serious.  It's up to the player's imagination.<br />
<br />
Gnome: ...I like gnomes ( I know most SKs mock the gnome) but i like em and I think they look kool. I like the newbie zone and stuff and they look so cute in armor ;P But they have crap strength BUT they got agi and dex and all that stuff so why not! I think a gnome SK is something odd and should be embraced<br />
<br />
This is where all respect is lost.  You can't go and give an opinion and use the word &quot;kool&quot;.  And if you think gnomes are cute, maybe your time might be better spent making sure your lipstick matches your pants or something.  In fact, maybe playing a bard is more up your alley.  :p<br />
<br />
Gnomes suck.  End of story.  The only thing they should be embraced with is a Harmtouch.<br />
<br />
Erudite: ON THE OTHER HAND we got these guys. In my opinion why someone would like to play a Erudite is either crazy or ULTRA N33BI3!!! Since Luclin they look better (Stronger and not pansyish) but CMON who wants to dress in an iron skirt (Yes thats what thy look like with armor last time I saw) They got a good zone tho actually if you have Paineel. Good till bout maybe 15 but I only got to 15 with my necro. But every SK Erudite I met is such a friggin twink its not even funny. and they cant tank. I am serious in a group they puss out IMMEDIATLY! But i guess SOME can handle it but...NO NIGHT VISION SUX (to me )<br />
<br />
What the hell is n33bi3?<br />
<br />
So Erudites suck because of ..... lack of night vision and because they don't look good in armor?  Go find Dregor Thule's Magelo profile sometime and let me know if you think Erudites suck then.  He's an Erudite Shadowknight in Fires of Heaven guild.<br />
<br />
They have Paineel till about 10 or so, then you move on out to Toxxulia Forest or to the Warrens Entrance.  Farm molars in Warrens and get some good xp.  When things start to green out, you can start doing the named circuit in The Warrens, maybe even up to the Bat Lord.  You could go to your 20s easily in there just doing that.  Then you can move on out to Stonebrunt Mountains, or maybe even go to Kunark and do some xp there and start raising Iksar faction.<br />
<br />
As far as looks, Erudites not only look pretty kick-ass in plate armor, but they also have one of the best sets of cultural armor in the game, so think about that.<br />
<br />
Iksar: I like these too they look like dragons and got that nifty regen and an UBER newb zone. Good quests good weps but they cant wear plate witch sorta sux. Its funny they can wear chainmail tho (Cuz it would catch on their scales when taking it off ) They got nightvsion which is good and Kurns tower rulez. Only bad thing is that 20% XP penalty which sux but my troll has the same and its not too bad<br />
<br />
Kurn's tower is accessible to just about anyone now.  Use the PoK books and run along the pit edge from the Field of Bone book to the Kurn's Tower entrance.<br />
<br />
Cabilis has 4 newbie zones: Field of Bone, Warslik's Woods, Swamp of No Hope, and Lake of Ill Omen.<br />
<br />
Is saying &quot;witch&quot; instead of &quot;which&quot; one of those things you learn in 7th grade when you are Instant Messaging each other in 4th-period class?<br />
<br />
Ogre: I stand neutral with these guys. I like the str and the int is higher than trolls and you can buff the str and int so the int is higher than a Wood Elf. They got night vision and mass HPs and str is the best (I said that already...) But feerot is THE SECOND CRAPPIEST ZONE EVUH!!!! No newbie quest that are worth it but these guys are pretty rare. PLEASE DONT TWINK!!! Alll the OGSKs I seen wear like Armor of God and have equiped Sword of Uberness. Bothers the hell off me. O yeah they cant be stunned from from which means you get mroe hits it which means you kill dat tree fastuh! <br />
<br />
Ogres have a pretty good zone, actually.  The noob area should take you to around 6-7 and then you can follow the path to Innothule Swamp and go to to 9.  After that, you can go to S. Ro to an orc camp with a friend, or you can book it to E. Commons and do some levelling there.<br />
<br />
Trolls: My fav cuz now they look BAD ARSE and I made it before Gukta (By like a week;P) and I had Innothule all to my lonesome pretty much. They got night vis and they gots nice str but the dumbest creatures in all of EQ what i did is pumped the int in and put the rest in sta and str ( hell i was stronger than a ogre now and smarter than a Wood Elf ) regen is nice to have at higher lvls when downtime is higher. I dunno this was the race for me (I dont care what you pick BTW) I just like the smell the taste and the look of a troll i guess ) <br />
<br />
Re-roll.  Your INT should be 75 at the most for a troll and the rest should go to STA.   Pumping all your points into INT is a waste.  More mana, yes, but you're not primarily a caster, so who gives a shit about INT, especially on a Troll?  INT will raise itself with decent gear anyway.  What you need in the early levels to survive is Hit Points, which means pumping up STA, which is a lot harder to raise through gear than INT anyway.<br />
<br />
Dark Elf: TO MANY everyone and their little brother plays these dudes! I dont know why! The agi and dex are good and the int is even better for trade but honestly! I HATE the newbie zone. EVERYONE is there ( hmm reminds me of Gfay ) and higher lvls kill the crappy guards (Which may not be too bad for those dirty beggars) too bad the trolls had to move here... They do look cool tho  <br />
<br />
Maybe they play Dark Elves because they think like you and they need night vision to be UBER KOOL and they need to look bad ass in armor.<br />
<br />
As far of the rest of the comments, I need to get back to training class here.  Suffice it to say that this is not a roleplaying game and any attempts to make it so have been pretty piss poor.  And saying that you want Bush dead could get you landed in prison if someone wanted to report you for it.<br />
<br />
Read the rest of the posts about race and try to learn that in the end, race is not that important and that you should play whatever makes you happy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>SorishMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Not a bad attempt... put more humor in it, and posted it in Rants and it probably would've gone over better as it is a semi-amusing read.  Rants is for strongly held opinions... other forums are for more reasonable discussions (well, usually...).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Vuloshek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Reasonable discussions are rare.  I think when you go to Shadowknight.org, there should be a big &quot;STFU&quot; next to a search button and nothing else, it would be more to the point.  Or maybe include a forum discussing the best ways to tell people to use the search button, and sticky step-by-step guides to shutting the fuck up.<br />
I'd just like to say that, while I agree on some points, when you called gnomes cute it was like dropping a bucket of lighter fluid in the grill.  I'm sure you knew the flames were on the way.  Hell, I played a gnome and enjoyed more than any other race, but I still don't want to be called cute.  And I don't meet enough human shadowknights.  And you're right, way, way, way too many dark elves.  What gets me is... I don't meet that many troll shadowknights, or for that matter, any sort of troll.  What's wrong, people on Firiona Vie are scared of exp penalties?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Calamity_Daemon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Alrigh to start off I have played this game for about 3 and 1/2 years thank you very much and I know just a LITTLE bit about EQ. Honestly though I dont really care what race you pick except humans because a human shadowknight reminds me of a barbarian rogue. For some reason it doesnt really &quot;click&quot; with me. I play on Inny server and there are MOUNDS of them. almost as many as trolls now ( more trols have come around because of the whole Gukta thing) I have a Erudite necro and I luv the paineel zone and Warrens and I never said it was a bad place in fact I said just the opposite. I admit that there have been a couple Erudite SKs that have had the power to woop me up pretty bad before and I respect them for that. Erudites dont have a XP penalty last I checked so they are good in some ways. They dont really &quot;click&quot; because they are not a physical group and more of a magical people. Humans can be evil but I dont really think there should be anymore for awhile because there are entirly too many</div></div><hr />

I understand this. But he's still dumb. Bush is a good president. People just generally don't like republicans, and it has been proven. (its amazing that they actually win)<br />

<br />
Whether Bush is a good president or not is frankly beyond the scope of this forum.  Everyone has their opinion on that, but I think if we start a flame war about whether Bush is a moron or not or whether people like him or not, this thread is going to devolve into something that doesn't need to be in this forum.<br />
<br />
I'm not trying to flame you or anything, I am just saying that we shouldn't keep bumping this moronic thread just for the sake of discussing whether Bush is good or not in a Race Discussion forum.</div></div><hr />

Welcome to the real world, where you can't control what people think or what they say, or whether they choose to let a matter drop (e.g. the Bush comment).  Would you rather that we let you bask in your delusional fantasies or that we tell you where we disagree with you (or your way of espousing your views)?  <br />
<br />
You're not in charge, neither are we - treat your readers like idiots, and like idiots we shall behave, if for nothing else but to spite you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A. I dont need a president who just wants to show how big his dick is.<br />
B. Look what he is doing! He can pretty much control congress because *Gasps* They are all (Mostly) Republicans! Where are the libertarians or even Democrats (only a small step above republicans though)<br />
C. I don't know if you guys have read &quot;The Art of War&quot; But one of the things it says is &quot;Dont attack towards the east. Why? The sun rises in the East. You will be BLINDED.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Chaitea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Hey Cal?  Just a thought, and here's to hoping that it doesn't fly right over your little head.  This is a Shadow Knight forum.  I typed that reeeaally slowly in case you're a poor reader (/grin).  I don't give a flying fuck about Dubya, this war, that war, Repo-blicans, Liver-tarians, Democraps, Tree Huggers, Elvis Fans, UFO Sighters, AA members, Dead Beat Dads, Boss Hog, or the Milky Way when I come here.  I'm here to learn about SKs.  <br />
<br />
I just so happen to play a gnome SK, and &quot;cute&quot; for a creature that boils blood, sucks life, screams in hatred, and has a living skeleton for a pet is probably not an operable word.  You want one hell of a fucking challenge?  Play a gnome sk, then try to find gear.  Not to mention you're damn near KoS to everyone (yeah yeah, lizzies too, whatevah), and add somewhat ok starting stats to the menu, and you have interesting game play.  And have you tried going up stairs with a gnome?  You make it halfway, and gotta rest for a bit.  /jump /jump /jump *wheeze, pant*  /jump /jump...<br />
<br />
So let's try an *educated* opinion, from someone (me) that has tried quite a few SKs in their time.<br />
<br />
Race...<br />
<br />
doesn't...<br />
<br />
matter.<br />
<br />
<br />
Every race that can be an SK has advantages and disadvantages.<br />
<br />
Eruds and Gnomes have more mana, but less tankage.  (but with KEI and chain-casting LT, who gives a shit?)<br />
<br />
Trolls and Ogres get more strength and hp, but less mana.  (but with more hp, who gives a shit?)<br />
<br />
Iksars have higher innate ac, but can't wear some plate. (but after lvl 20, who gives a shit?)<br />
<br />
Humans have the most even stats in the game, but can't see. (but with a GLS, who gives a shit?)<br />
<br />
Thank you, have a nice day.</div></div><hr />

We have helmets with tinted visors, and caps with bills.  Not to mention the ability to wear sunglasses.  If you note, the Art of War was written for a very different time period, for very different warfare.  And are you referring to the Italian AOW or the Chinese?  Did you even actually read them, or was that a quote in a video game somewhere?</div></div><hr />

I think Calamity Jane is just mad that people think he is a moron, not to mention that people are having a hard time believing he has a level 56 Troll SK, especially with that oh-so-tough swim schedule and the science reports he has to write, not to mention having to sneak around his mother who thinks that this is the devil's game..<br />
<br />
Three tips for you, Calamity:<br />
<br />
1) Don't lie about your characters-- if you had a level 60 character before and a level 56 one now, you would have been posting a long time ago<br />
<br />
2) Next time you want to be taken seriously, don't post a serious diatribe and then respond in all caps like a 4-year-old.<br />
<br />
3) Use a spellchecker.  I hope your science reports are not this stupid.<br />
<br />
By the way, your quote about Sun Tzu is wrong.  He never said any such thing.  What he said was:<br />
<br />
10.  (5) When you start a fire, be to windward of it.  Do <br />
not attack from the leeward.<br />
<br />
     [Chang Yu, following Tu Yu, says:  &quot;When you make a fire, <br />
the enemy will retreat away from it; if you oppose his retreat <br />
and attack him then, he will fight desperately, which will not <br />
conduce to your success.&quot;  A rather more obvious explanation is <br />
given by Tu Mu:  &quot;If the wind is in the east, begin burning to <br />
the east of the enemy, and follow up the attack yourself from <br />
that side.  If you start the fire on the east side,  and then <br />
attack from the west, you will suffer in the same way as your <br />
enemy.&quot;]<br />
<br />
It's nothing about facing East or the sun.  It's about not being downwind from a fire you started.<br />

I was joking at first. But now I really do hate you. This is the stupidest thing I have ever read. I'm sure you know Bush so well! Oh wait I remember! Jay Leno told you that!</div></div><hr />

Hello? How the hell should we know if we agree with you or not if we don't read your views first? Think, McFly!<br />
<br />
Sure, I wanted to gouge my fucking eyes out afterwards, but before I read them, I had no idea whether I would agree or not. Idiot.<br />
<br />
Oh, and I like how playing an erudite is a N33bi3 thing to do...That's saying 'Well, you gotta respect *my* opnion, but I can still flame people for theirs. Good thinking there. And guess what, assclown,  what race you play means jackshit in the end.  I had a glimmer of hope when you said you played trolls because they look cool, but that was quickly drowned out by a flood of hate when you basically said DEs suck because too many people like them. Guess what? DE is one cool race, they look cool, great town, cool background lore (like you care).<br />
<br />
Man, I'd be like the richest man on earth if I invented a device that lets people stab others in the face over the web. People like you would either act smarter or disapear.... Wow, I'd basically make natural selection work again...<br />
<br />
Oh, and on the stats thing.... I think I raised my int to 75. Human average sounded like a nice idea, plus I wanted to be able to cast my first pet right when I got it. I think I spent like 3 points or so on agi, and the few that were left on sta. Worked for me. Enough stat gear out there to balance things out...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, and if you buy that, get back on the short bus. :P<br />
<br />
Anyway, I noticed someone mentioned Iksar and the Plate Armor issue. I will be the first to admit, even at the higher levels, it still sucks. There are some nifty level 50+ items around (Luclin loot comes to mind) that leaves Iksar out of the mix. <br />
<br />
However, being limited to chain armor does not mean we can't tank or that our gear will always suck. It just means we have to be a little more creative about our armor choices. I mean, look at my BP. It is far from uber, but it's also semi-rare and people seem to dig it.<br />
<br />
Besides, we don't have to do that ungodly faction work for Cabilis to do the Greenmist quest. ;)</div></div><hr />
