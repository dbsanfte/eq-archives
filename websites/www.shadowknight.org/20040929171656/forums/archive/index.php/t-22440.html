<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xanther</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Im fairly new to the SHD class, but when I have time, I really have a great time with my alt knight.  Its a few levels off but I like to plan ahead, on items and spells.  The quest for Life Leech looks to take a bit plat and not too much work and on the surface seems like a good spell, but the few people with SHD's as their main from my server had not gotten the spell.  <br />
<br />
Worth taking the time to complete this quest?  and, any tips on completing it would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Life Leech isn't an awful spell for its level, and if you're not going to level up quickly to get the higher level, better spells, I see no reason not to do it.  I know I used it quite extensively in my low- to mid-50s and I certainly didn't regret getting it.  It's not a terribly difficult quest, so I would say just go ahead and do it.  Besides, it's always neat to have something other people don't.<br />
<br />
-edit- Besides, it gives 280 HP and you won't get a single lifetap to beat that until level 60.  Granted, it has a 2 minute recast, but only a 2.5 second cast time.  It's not overly mana efficient, but our lifetaps never have been.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xanther</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks Sesshou, thats what I was wondering exactly.  I am a main mage, raiding 6 days a week and my SHD is for having fun on off day and after raids.<br />
<br />
I dont PL him at all I just go group or solo with no guildtag so I can enjoy not seeing 5 channels of chat.  So, I dont level terribly fast and it sounds like if the next best spell wont be til 60, then I had better get this one, cause that might be a long time for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Belyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You can solo the entire quest in a day with your mage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I would hesitate to label it better, as in some instances the 223 point lifetap at 57 is better because it can be chain cast, but has a bad cast time.  The level 57 one is also more efficient.  That said, Life Leech was often the only lifetap I had to cast in my low- to mid-50s.  For how easy the quest is, no reason not to do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Velnarin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I wasn't sure if it would be worth it or not myself.  Then again, my SK was my highest character and didn't have 3k to just throw at a spell.<br />
That said, there hasn't been a day I've regretted getting it yet.  I did the quest at 51 with the help of my 45 rogue friend.  For the final battle I had to recruit a few people to take out the zombie, but he was a lot easier than I was expecting.<br />
<br />
At 56, Life Leech is usually the only tap I keep memmed when not soloing.  Definately useful when waiting for a CH to hit me and it looks like it's gonna be a close one.  :p  So with a  65 mage, I wouldn't hesitate to quest this spell.</div></div><hr />
