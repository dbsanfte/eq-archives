<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wyrdlan</div><div class="date">02-10-2005, 12:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is probably a pointless post, but I'm curious what people will think.  I'm aware of the level versus all from a macro prespective, but what about when it boils down to one level.  I had to quit EQ for a while, and even now my play time is pretty limited.  My guild is doing low-high end content (Time in one night/Uqua).  We raid three nights a week.  I can usually sneak in maybe one extra day of grind time, to utilizing that grind as effectively as possible is crucial to me.  Fortunately, I've got access to four accounts, basically an instant group.  I run SK/ENC/CLR with either a lowbie necro or rogue depending on my mood.  I can of course drop the necro/rogue if I get actual dps that feels like coming to join me.<br />
<br />
Now my question is this.  I devoted myself fully to level and I've finally kicked over to 69 (7% in) by volunteering to skip out on the 54 man raids in order to grind for exp.  It took me, I'd estimate, about 12s hour to get from 68 to 69.  Now when I left EQ in November, I was already behind on my AA, now I'm really behind.<br />
<br />
My question is this, I figure it'll take me at least another 12 to 15 to reach 70.  If 15 hours I could easily get 20 AA.  I have LR5, but only ID1.  My magelo is mostly accurate, but it's behind exp wise.  Gear and AA should be right.<br />
<br />
What I want to know is if there is a strongly compelling reason to keep going for 70 as opposed to finishing ID5 and maybe shield block before moving on?<br />
<br />
The list off AA I need is getting so dang long, heck right now I'm debating getting buff slots before I even get the ID5!  I have my DP AA because I bought it with the freebies from my epic 1.5.  I run 11k/2K fully raid buffed, can hit 12k with that fun warrior click and tribute all on.<br />
<br />
Thoughts?</div></div><hr />

(took breaks, not full 18 hour grind)  She gained 15 aa's, I got 5 % into 70.  I gained Over 200hp for leveling.<br />
<br />
15 aa's for that defensive, or brag rights for that 200 hp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Aside from the hp...you'll have better resists, hit mobs more often, dodge/parry/riposte more, your ability caps will go up, and you'll have access to level 70 spells.<br />
<br />
The combination of those benefits is so much better than 15aa it's not even funny.</div></div><hr />
