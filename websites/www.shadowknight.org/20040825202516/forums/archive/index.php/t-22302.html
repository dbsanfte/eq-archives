<br />
its good.  And you won't really need a super-computer to enjoy it either, despite rumors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Derraj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I haven't played it yet, I might rent it some time though. I'm not to big of a fan and been checking release dates, graphics, etc what systems does it run on?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kebsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Minimum specs are listed as a 1.5gig processor, 512 megs of RAM and a 64-meg graphics card. <br />
<br />
I ran it with an Athlon 64 3200 processor, a Geforce-FX 5200 128meg card (sucks) and 512 megs of ram.  It runs smoothly on medium settings at 800x600.   It only ever slows down when there's a lot of flames on screen throwing shadows everywhere (and that's fixable if you want to turn shadows off).  For some reason, the lower resolutions dont look very jaggy at all in the game, even with AA turned off, much smoother than any other game I've ever seen running at 800x600.</div></div><hr />

Also, it is true that id software put a lot of effort into making the game look great on almost any system.</div></div><hr />

Too bad they didn't put more effort in the game so doom 3 turns out to be not much more then the best engine demo around. It's scary, it's spooky, it looks great, the end. That's about all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Yeah, but that's exactly what I wanted it to be.  Also, there are few games that I've played that come close to D3s level of scaryness, the first Aliens vs. Predator is the only thing that comes to mind really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Paynreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Likewise, I bought it purely for its scare value. Was worth the money to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>vilesoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">actually I found the playability pretty good...you ahve to be very smart though else you won't find all teh ammo you need.<br />
<br />
Very tough, but damn fun.  And its beyond just killing shit for the sake of it...its more like it freaks you the hell out and your just reacting....exactly what I was looking for in a game like this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">badass game.<br />
<br />
And it does run reasonably well on any system they list.  The minimum specs aren't just 'barely creeping by sort-of-playable' with the graphics at butt-ugly.  They actually mean you can play the game on those systems, have it run reasonably well, and look fucking sweet.<br />
<br />
I'm running it on an Athlon XP 2500, 1 gig of ram, and a Geforce FX 5600, and it runs pretty smooth at 800x600, medium graphics.  But for shits and giggles I loaded it on my 2 boxing comp, P3 1.4 GHz (tualatin core celeron actually, shitty 100 mhz bus), 640 megs, Geforce 3 Ti200.  Yes, that box is *below* min spec (the pentium 3 isn't even a supported processor)... and it's actually sort of playable at 640x480, low graphics, and still looks pretty damn good.<br />
<br />
And yes it's scary as hell.  They put a lot more effort into playability and gameplay than they have in earlier single player games imo.</div></div><hr />

AvP marine was fcking scary. &lt;3 that game.</div></div><hr />

I wish they would make AvP in the doom engine, now that would rock. Not that the atmosfere in doom is that bad.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some modder might, its a good idea.<br />
<br />
I just wish Doom III had the chaingun weilding brain spider from Doom II - among a few other things that I personally miss - but overall I &lt;3 D3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kebsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">One thing that irks me about D3 is the lack of oxygen in the oxygen tanks.  I mean I know they wanted to make getting back inside urgent when you're outside, but each tank only has like thirty seconds of air in them...its silly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>vilesoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hey....they are after all tnaks just randomly sitting out there....I found some that have only 10 seconds of air in them...i think  they are supposed to be partially used or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>vilesoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">On another note....the chaingun in this one owns...sooooo easy to hop the barrels now that I dont even have to think about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Khat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Installing Doom3 now and I hope it's got the creepiness factor of AvP cuz that creeped me out when I played in the dark with the sound up.<br />
PS.  The AvP movie comes out the 13th of this month, I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kebsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Hey....they are after all tnaks just randomly sitting out there....I found some that have only 10 seconds of air in them...i think  they are supposed to be partially used or something.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah but even the one you start out with at the beginning only has a few seconds of air in it.<br />
<br />
I hope they don't retarderize AvP the movie.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Azudno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">i'm preparing some ritual sacrifics of orphans to redeem earth for producing AvP:the movie. <br />
<br />
You can commit such blasphemys with games, but movies, no. What's next? Batman fighting Darth Vader riding Godzilla? Shit, don't want to wake Cerberus ...</div></div><hr />

BTW, when you encounter your first true boss...he cant be hurt directly.  Took me 10 deaths to get past the &quot;holy fuck, what teh hell is that thing!&quot; reaction and to actualy start using my brain.</div></div><hr />

<br />
agreed...I found a bug in there, where I coudl not get out f one of the first few chambers...it involved a problem where  for some reason i could not trigger one of the flags that signaled the opening of that chamber to advance in the level.  I had to noclip it and move on.</div></div><hr />

Actually i didnt steal doom 3, but in the interest of the DOOM legacy, I think we should all be trying to crack the shareware-demo, just for old times' sake...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>vilesoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">The original doom shareware didnt have anything to crack...what happened was you sent in your money, and they sent you the floppies.  I know, I've edited teh  fuck out of the old datafiles back int he  day...only the stuff for  episode 1 there....2 and 3 were int he mail once you bought it.</div></div><hr />

Pretty lengthy article and doesn't get into the actual in-game tech tweaks until page 8+ but something to look over if you want to try for best performance.</div></div><hr />
