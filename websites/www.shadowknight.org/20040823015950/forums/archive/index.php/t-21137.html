I like blue butts and I can not lie<br />
You other inkies can't deny.<br />
When a rogue walks in with an itty bitty waist<br />
and a blue thang in your face,<br />
you get sprung, wanna pull up tough.<br />
Cause you notice that butt was in the buff!<br />
Deep in those chaps she's wearin'<br />
I'm hooked and I can't stop starin'<br />
Oh baby, I wanna git wit'cha<br />
and take yer picture,<br />
My guildmates tried to warn me<br />
But the butt you got makes (me so horny)<br />
Ooh, rump-a-blue skin<br />
You say you wanna get some twinks?<br />
Well, use me, use me<br />
'Cuase you ain't that average guildie<br />
I've seen them /dance'n<br />
The hail with roleplayin romancin'<br />
She's wet, wet,<br />
Got it goin' like a bardic jet.<br />
I'm tired of magazines,<br />
Saying woodie butts are the thing<br />
Take the average Necro and ask him that,<br />
She gotta pack blue back.<br />
So, fellas! (Yeah!) Fellas! (Yeah!)<br />
Has your girlfriend got the butt? (Hail yeah!)<br />
Tell 'em to shake it! (Shake it!) Shake it! (Shake it!)<br />
Shake that healthy blue butt!<br />
Baby got (blue) back!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Mutton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Yo Yo Yo how about dis phat ryhme playas!!!<br />
<br />
Yo VIP let's kick it <br />
<br />
Blue Blue baby (x2) <br />
All right stop collaborate and listen <br />
Blue is back with my brand new invention <br />
Something grabs a hold of me tightly <br />
Flow like a harpoon daily and nightly <br />
Will it ever stop yo I don't know <br />
Turn off the lights and I'll glow <br />
To the extreme I rock a mob like a vandal <br />
Light up a zone and wax a con like a candle <br />
Dance go rush to the speaker that booms <br />
I'm killing your magelo like a poisonous mushroom <br />
Deadly when I play a dope melody <br />
Anything less than the best is a felony <br />
Love it or leave it you better gain lvls<br />
You better hit bull's eye the kid don't play <br />
If there was a problem yo I'll solve it <br />
Check out the loot while my Inkie revolves it <br />
<br />
CHORUS <br />
Blue Blue baby Inkie (or vanilla yo!!) (x4) <br />
<br />
Now that the Raid is jumping <br />
With the bass kicked in and the vegas are pumpin' <br />
Quick to the point to the point no faking <br />
I'm cooking RZ's like a pound of bacon <br />
Burning them if you ain't quick and nimble <br />
I go crazy when I hear a cymbal <br />
And a hi-hat with a souped up tempo <br />
I'm on a roll and it's time to go to Sol Ro <br />
Rollin' in my 5.0 (or unholy steed!)<br />
With my rag-top down so my hair can blow <br />
The Inkies on standby waving just to say hi <br />
Did you stop no I just rode by <br />
Kept on pursuing to the next stop <br />
I busted a left and I'm heading to the next block <br />
The block was dead <br />
Yo so I continued to A1A Beachfront Avenue (Neriak Foreign Quarter!)<br />
(Troll) Girls were hot wearing less than bikinis <br />
Fat chick lovers driving Lamborghinis (expensive horses!!!!) <br />
Jealous 'cause I'm out getting mine <br />
Shay with a guage and Inkie with a nine <br />
Reading for the Ogres on the wall <br />
The Ogres acting ill because they're so full of eight balls <br />
Spells rang out like a bell <br />
I grabbed my wmbs all I heard were shells <br />
Falling on the concrete real fast <br />
Jumped on my horse slammed on the gas <br />
Bumpet to bumper the avenue's packed <br />
I'm trying to get away before the jackers jack <br />
Guards on the scene you know what I mean <br />
They passed me up confronted all the dope fiends <br />
If there was a problem yo I'll solve it <br />
Check out the hook while my Inkie  revolves it <br />
<br />
REPEAT CHORUS <br />
<br />
Take heed 'cause I'm a Inkie poet <br />
PoK on the scene just in case you didn't know it <br />
My town that created all the blue sound <br />
Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground <br />
'Cause my style's like a chemical spill <br />
Feasible rhymes that you can vision and feel <br />
Conducted and formed <br />
This is a hell of a concept <br />
We make it hype and you want to step with this <br />
Shay plays on the fade slice like a SK<br />
Cut like a razor blade so fast other SKs say damn <br />
If my rhyme was a drug I'd sell it by the gram <br />
Keep my composure when it's time to get loose <br />
Magnetized by the mic while I kick my juice <br />
If there was a problem yo I'll solve it <br />
Check out the hook while dis inkie revolves it <br />
<br />
Blue Blue baby Inkie<br />
Blue Blue baby (oh-oh) Inkie<br />
Blue Blue baby Inkie <br />
Blue Blue baby Inkie Blue<br />
Yo man let's get out of here <br />
Word to your mother <br />
Blue Blue baby too cold <br />
Blue Blue baby too cold too cold (x2) <br />
Blue Blue baby</div></div><hr />

Wow...that sucked<br />
Can't wait for this board's idiots to come up with words for Can't (Harm) Touch This  <br />
<br />
Can't (Harm) touch this (x2)<br />
Can't (Harm) touch this (oh-oh oh oh oh-oh-oh) (x2)<br />
<br />
My-my-my-my melee hits me so hard makes me say oh my DarkLord<br />
Thank you for blessing me with a mind to camp and two SOWed feet<br />
It feels good when you know you're down<br />
A superdope homeboy from the INKtown<br />
And I'm known as such<br />
And this is a toon uh u can't (Harm) touch<br />
<br />
I told you homeboy u can't (Harm) touch this<br />
Yeah that's how we're livin' and you know u can't (Harm) touch this<br />
Look in my eyes man u can't (Harm) touch this<br />
You know let me bust the funky lyrics u can't (Harm) touch this<br />
<br />
Fresh new kicks and pants (TIME TO UPDATE MAGELO!!)<br />
You got it like that now you know you wanna /dance<br />
So move out of your seat<br />
And get a fly girl (I LOVE FAT OGRE CHICKS) and catch this beat<br />
While it's rollin' hold on pump a little bit<br />
And let me know it's going on like that like that<br />
Cold on a (LDoN) mission so pull on back<br />
Let 'em know that you're too much<br />
And this is a toon uh u can't (Harm) touch<br />
<br />
Yo I told you u can't (Harm) touch this<br />
Why you standing there man, u can't (Harm) touch this<br />
Yo sound the bells school is in sucka u can't (Harm) touch this<br />
<br />
Give me a 2-h sword and Bard's rhythm<br />
Making 'em sweat that's what I'm giving 'em<br />
Now they know when you talk about the Inkie<br />
You talk about a show that's hyped and tight<br />
Swingers are sweatin' so pass them a mic<br />
Or a tape to learn what it's gonna take<br />
And now he's gonna burn<br />
The charts legit either work hard<br />
Or you might as well quit (AND DONT POST ON EQ BOARDS ANYMORE)<br />
<br />
That's word because you know<br />
U can't (Harm) touch this (oh-oh oh oh-oh-oh) (x2)<br />
Break it down<br />
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh oh-oh oh) (x4)<br />
Stop Inkie time<br />
<br />
Go with the flow in a sin if you can't move to this<br />
Then you probably are LOADING PLS WAIT...<br />
So wave your hands in the air<br />
Bust throught the moves run your fingers through your hair<br />
This is it, for a winner<br />
Dance to this and you're gonna get thinner<br />
Move slide your rump<br />
Just for a minute let's all do the bump<br />
Bump bump bump yeeeah<br />
<br />
U can't (Harm) touch this<br />
Look man, u can't (Harm) touch this<br />
You'll probably get hyped boy<br />
'Cause you know you can't, u can't (Harm) touch this<br />
Ring the bell school's back in...break it down<br />
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh) (x4)<br />
Stop, Inkie time<br />
(Oh-oh oh oh oh-oh-oh) (x2)<br />
(Oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh)<br />
(Oh-oh oh oh oh-oh-oh) u can't (Harm) touch this (x3)<br />
(Oh-oh oh oh oh-oh-oh) break it down<br />
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh) (x2)<br />
Stop Inkie time<br />
<br />
Every time you see me the Inkie's just so hype<br />
I'm dope on the floor and I'm magic on the mob!<br />
Now why would I ever, stop doing this<br />
With others campin' spawns that just don't hit<br />
I toured around the world from Freeport to the Moon<br />
It's Inkie go Inkiee<br />
SK Inkie yo Inkie and the rest can go and play<br />
<br />
U can't (Harm) touch this (oh-oh oh oh oh-oh-oh) (x2)<br />
U can't (Harm) touch this (oh-oh oh-oh-oh)<br />
Yeah u can't (Harm) touch this<br />
I told you u can't (Harm) touch this (oh-oh oh-oh-oh)<br />
Too hype can't (Harm) touch this<br />
Yo, get me outta here u can't (Harm) touch this<br />
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)(until fade..)<br />
