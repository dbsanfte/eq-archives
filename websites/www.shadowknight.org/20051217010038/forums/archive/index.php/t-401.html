So I was wondering, does anybody here know a good spot for a 51 SK to solo?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zemi</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 03:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you park in Burning Woods on the SW corner of the giant fort crater, the exp is fairly nice.  If you watch what you pull (no tatterback gorilllas, greater warbone skellies, sarnak zealots/champions, forest giant ancients), then you can make some nice exp there.<br />
<br />
Bloodgills in LoIO maybe?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valkyria Grymreaper</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 03:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I soloed in DL at the FM zone killing dogs and chickens alot when I was 51 and 52. <br />
<br />
Good thing is you can zone fast if u get adds and there was a lot of traffic through there so I could beg for sows and clairty often.<br />
<br />
Just be a nice SK and let the people in FM know you zoned a train from DL  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frued</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 03:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah the entrance to FM tunnel in DL is not bad. But if you zone in from FM and then go left you will see some ruins with undead.<br />
<br />
 I spent some time XP'ing in DL but on the south side of the building. Set up camp tell Jaboner guard here and go pull from up front including the entrance to KC. Now not everything will be blue but I suggest just getting what you can. See a high green &lt;light blue&gt; and nothing else then pull it, med up, and go look for a blue.<br />
<br />
 You can go to Velious and do the Walruses and later try the Man-O-Wars in Eastern Waste. After zoning in from IC go left after leaving the bridge. You don't have to hug the shore line but keep it in view eventually you will see 2 small huts with a fire and then boocoo walruses. Area around the Huts is a safe area. Of course there is a dorf spawn there I believe its for a quest. I do know he hates giants and will assist you if you pull one to close.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">yuggoth</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 03:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I didn't find anything to solo at 51 that beat the bloodgills in LOIO.  Pull the west side singles, fear kite them on the beach, I could do 3 or 4 before having to med/rest - and if you can get clarity/regen you can chew thru them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Skanis</div><div class="date">04-04-2002, 10:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the quick responses guys!  I think I'm gonna head over to LoIO and try the bloodgills, the lure of add-free fear kiting is just too compelling.  If that doesn't work out as good as I'm hoping, it looks like Kunark is the place to be anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarkWyld</div><div class="date">04-04-2002, 11:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a problem with hunting Bloodgills in LOIO, though, and it has nothing to do with the goblins themselves.  This spot is so well known that it is usually camped by 1 or more monks during peak periods.  It is a sweet spot for XP but too many people know about it, making it difficult to get an opening.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neq</div><div class="date">04-04-2002, 11:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What level are those bloodgills good to?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pheargore</div><div class="date">04-04-2002, 12:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Was doing DL myself at Burning Woods line, similar to above<br />
<br />
The best thing about this spot is the pathing the MoB takes. This saves me alot of MANA, thus more kills per Med.<br />
<br />
Pull the MOB to near the zone line where the ground is flat between tree lines. This is the wide passage area between zones. I pull with Darkness so I can run to this spot and wait for the MOB, as this spot is a little ways from where the MOBs chill.  Fear, and the MOB runs straight for the invisible Wall withing the passageway between BW and DL.  When they hit the wall they slowly start moving towards the main area of DL because of the angle they are walking into the invisible wall. By now my Darkness spell has worn off (only level 48), but because of the pathing, the MOB still moves as if it is snared/darknessed. So I cast fear when neccessary and use my MANA Free Snare(Zone Wall)  to keep them contained =)<br />
<br />
When I get bored of Soloing, there is always a pickup group in DL<br />
<br />
Not that DL is that exciting anyway, often my pickup group will decide to run inside KC which is also good XP.<br />
<br />
- Peace</div></div><hr />

Same problem as with the bloodgills, fighting for spawns, but the xp and loot is nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dolaan</div><div class="date">04-04-2002, 03:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I spend 51-52 in CC killing geonids solo.  No fear kite just get pet up and straight up fight with occational tap.  Worked great and got great pp.  I set up at the top of the geonid tunnel right near the zone.  I would anounce that you are there and to plz shout if anyone was planning on training you cause that was the only problem I remember having.  Started to green out at 52 I think but it was before light blue existed so I am not sure what you will get.  Good luck<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nasiir</div><div class="date">04-04-2002, 11:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tower of Frozen Shadows, 6th Floor has been insane experience for me in the low 50s, and great loot as well. When I get into a groove I can get a blue bubble of exp at level 53 in about 40 minutes. Last time I left to bank I had about 1kpp in coin and items, with around 80 percent of it coin.<br />
Fyi, I'm an iksar with greenmist and an iksarbp, but aside from that, nothing too special gearwise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Skanis</div><div class="date">04-05-2002, 11:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nasiir, can you fear kite there or do you fight straight up?  Ever get any adds?  How many can you kill before you have to rest?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nasiir</div><div class="date">04-05-2002, 10:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can fear kite at the entrance of the floor, but since the pathing is quite &lt;ahem&gt; favorable, I believe fear kiting may warrant a warning if a GM comes by the zone (I see people doing it all the time and none of them have been warned away, so...). I prefer fighting normally vs the shades near the exit area. How many I can kill really depends on a number of factors. I have regen3, iksarbp, and normal iksar regen, plus greenmist, so I usually don't have to sit for long. I had about a 40 minute period of constant pulling the other day, but I have had to sit after a mob, get near full, tank another mob, and have to sit down again for a bit after the next. Even so, normally, I can get a blue bubble in 40 minutes. I did 53rd and made probably 3kpp or more while doing it in coin. I just went back today after hitting 54th and more mobs are light blue than blue, so I may end up moving to BW instead of staying in ToFS.<br />
<br />
Also, I forgot to mention, that you can easily single pull, so never get any adds since there are a number of safe spots and I don't think any wanderers on the floor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fubartic</div><div class="date">04-05-2002, 11:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ToFS 6th floor is a great place to solo if you can figure your way out up there.<br />
<br />
at 54, i solo'd quite nicely in the hole at the entrance and hit 55 in there. its not that bad soloing experience and sure beats sitting with a lfg tag all day</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">frotty</div><div class="date">04-08-2002, 02:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've tried out all of these ideas here, and heres a few notes - - -<br />
<br />
need tips for soloing out of 51, not 53, not 55! hehe great tips but some of them just don't work at 51. . .<br />
<br />
CCaverns Geonids are all light blue at 51, its very safe (and slow) experience and you get some gems.... if you comb up and down this corridor you will eventually spawn Gem Collectors and Focus Gems which drop chipped stuff. In the end you get nearly as much money out of these things in the same amount of time killing rathe giants, especially if you wait for the chipped stuff ... (SKnight with high CHA? to me 40cha is high) AND you get easy &amp; safe light blue exp. <br />
<br />
Wyverns in CScar are great depending on the gear you have. I use the manaless darkness (time on it really sucks tho) and invoke fear. I am also wearing a fungus covered scale tunic, so that might be what's letting me pull down to the beach and wack these things?<br />
<br />
Dlands is not good enough EXP to warrant sitting in DLs for another level :rolleyes: ... KC runs aren't worth the loss of faction in overthere (especially with the teleport hammer) in my opinion.<br />
<br />
BW giants fort hasn't worked out for me on saryrn, there are always people pulling and even a few ballsy quadders... it's high traffic on saryrn, at least but the few times i made it it worked out great.<br />
<br />
LOIO goblins are great, and you get to use your enduring breath spell, too :D ... but yeah lots of people know about it on saryrn, especially quadders....<br />
<br />
<br />
So, all this said, are there any dungeon spots that are great soloing at ****51**** (not 50, 52, 53, etc.)... even for loot?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">frotty</div><div class="date">04-08-2002, 02:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ToFS is great exp due to the obvious fear exploit. Too bad verant can't figure out a simple &quot;if PC is standing on track, mob runs AWAY&quot; routine. . . <br />
<br />
I myself don't like exploiting these sorts of stupid game errors. But geeeez, it's so tempting when you have such a cheap Fear Undead spell... <br />
<br />
and yes, I have chain &quot;fear undead&quot;ed the entire library with another SKnight while the rest of the group group AOEd about 30 mobs at the exit.<br />
<br />
:rolleyes:</div></div><hr />
