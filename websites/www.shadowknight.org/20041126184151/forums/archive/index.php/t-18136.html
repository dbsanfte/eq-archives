<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kromglon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Stromm if you want to find people to group with at the lower levels. Course the older servers have cheaper bazaar prices on gear. I would say Stromm, unless you like to solo all the time.</div></div><hr />

I played EQOA for a while, (have a 23 DE Cleric on Hodstock), and it just didn't have enough depth to keep me interested.  It was however neat to see EQ history come to life.<br />
<br />
Like seeing Befallen before it was befallen (Temple of Marr), seeing Sol A before it became Sol A (Klik-Anon).  <br />
<br />
My fiance plays my EQoA account now, he's got a level 50 Shadow Knight.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Isn't anyone else a little appalled at the influx of &quot;console kiddies&quot; into this game?  I mean, I know it hasn't been a real RPG for years, but hell, it seems to me that all of the recent &quot;dumb downs&quot; have been due to SOE looking to tap the console gamer's market; a market that has here-to-fore been known for it's short attention span and unwillingness to develop actual skills through actual practice.  Enter hand-eye coordination &gt; thought, strategy, imagination and talent.<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm being a bit elitist, but I see the recent push as one of the greatest contributing factors to the huge influx of l33t-sp33king, bad attitude, no skill, no patience, no courtesy idiots, and it makes me a little mad.  I don't care if someone likes the way console games work.  I like some of them.  But I do think that playing an MMO well should be a more serious undertaking than the latest version of GTA or Resident Evil.  <br />
<br />
I suppose it's no use griping about it, as it's an opportunity for SOE to make more money, but I feel like this game was built on the backs of gamers who took their fantasy very seriously and wanted to play because it was an immersive and complex world full of wonder, and recent changes (including the influx of previously console-only gamers) have taken away a lot of the mystique that the game once held.<br />
<br />
/sigh<br />
<br />
My advice to you, Zatzu, is to speak rarely, listen well, learn to play your chosen class on a new server (very good suggestion given by the others) and try and develop the patience for a game that doesn't end in 60 hours.  Remember, there is no END to this game, so don't get impatient to get there, just enjoy yourself and try to make not only your own gaming experience but also the experiences of others the best that they can be.<br />
<br />
You'll make a lot more friends and have a lot better time yourself doing this than by following the typical console-only gamer mindset and rushing around trying to &quot;win&quot;.<br />

Oh, and please check your typing.  :)<br />

<br />
<br />
But as for things to know<br />
<br />
<br />
-Auto Attack is hitting the Q button on youre keyboard, ( i got sick of this when they changed it and changed it to A again)<br />
<br />
-You wont get a horse most likely especially if youre a shadowknight until level 59 and you get a very fast steed for the cost of 1 AA point, which you can get at 51...<br />
<br />
-Spells...Well, you get spells at level 9 and you can find them at you'r guild in Neriak...<br />
<br />
-Neriak is a very confusing city and youll probably be able to find someone to help you explore it.<br />
<br />
-Do your newbie armor quests, you hail one of the blue dudes in shiny white armor (:D )...And they will say things in [brackets such as this]...You respond by answering there questions or repeating back to them the things in [brackets]...<br />
<br />
-Not much else to know because they tailor the game to newbies nowadays but only about 1 in 10 lvl 1-10 characters are first characters...Mostly twinks<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Jargon to explain...<br />
<br />
twink-High end players lower lvl character that they play just for fun and am,usement or to help there guild...Also usually has damn nice equipment... These can range anywhere from lvl 1-65 :p<br />
<br />
newbie armor quests- low lvl armor, around lvl 5-20, that youre guild master gives out quests for, he will tell you to collect and ocmbine in this magical thing or whatever, take those things combine them then take them to the forge and you get your armor...Youll think you're real hip an cool when you get the whole thing done, until you get a lvl 65 uber time raider link his weapon...then you'll feel like pure shit...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: grammar also!:cool:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Err, k... <br />
<br />
I've never played EQoA, don't even own a console at the moment, but nearly all console games have an end.  I don't know how this one would be any different, but I'm not really up on the newest console online technology, so I suppose it's possible.  That still doesn't address the &quot;fast track&quot;, &quot;get to the last level as soon as possible&quot; mentality I was talking about, but whatever.<br />
<br />
The reason they moved auto attack off of &quot;A&quot; and to &quot;Q&quot; was that newbies would hit the &quot;A&quot; key as a part of the /say command when responding to quest npc's... without remembering to hit the &quot;/&quot; key first.  Auto attack on with red NPC questgiver targeted = instant noob port.  Most people already had that key remapped as a matter of course. <br />
<br />
The AA horse does not cost 1 AA point.  It actually costs 5.  There is only one ranking in &quot;Unholy Steed&quot;, which costs 5 points per ranking, or 5 points for Selo+ speed horse.  Paladins also get an AA horse for the same cost, at the same level.  Otherwise, he can buy one of the vendor sold horses or drogmors, which are ALL/ALL.  I've seen plenty of lvl 5 twink casters riding around on chain and higher bridle horses, so depending on situation, it's not totally out of reach.  Hell, even my duoing partner has one of the slower drogmors, and we're both perma-poor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ziglug D</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well im SORRY lol, I got the AA cost wrong so what lol? Hell figure it out qwhen he gets there...And NO it does not have an end...And I never said he should move the Q key to the A key, I personally dont care what he does =P, But I am used to A for Auto attack, so if he can get used to Q for his Auto Attack then good for him, but dont be an ass Groff...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Mynka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Actually EQoA, just like EQ, has it's share of l33t sP3ak3rz as well as normal folk.  I do think however, that most of the short attention span crowd has moved off EQoA by now and onto the latest and greatest, what ever that may be.  <br />
<br />
The first Expansion for EQoA is due out soon.  They are going to open the continent of Odus, introduce Ogres as a race, and add a new class that does not exist in regular EQ.  Since it's launch they've added traidskills, an auction feature (I think it's supposed to be a bazaar type thing but I'm not sure, it's been a while since I've played EQoA), and a couple more servers.<br />
<br />
One thing I disliked about EQoA (A LOT) was item decay.  As you fight your weapons/armor take damage.  You can have them repaired at a smith (located at most towns), for a cost.  The problem is it is VERY costly to repair items.  The result is, in most groups, tanks are given all vendor loot to pay for repair costs.  Apparently this is often not enough since I often see my fiance running around without any armor fighting green cons to try to get Tunar (the currency in EQoA; there is no Plat, Gold, Silver, Copper...just Tunar) to repair his equipment.<br />
<br />
There is no Experience loss in EQoA (no level loss), instead you gain an Experience Debt.  Experience is represented numerically (i.e. instead of just seeing &quot;You gain experience!&quot;, you will see &quot;You gain 434,957 experience!&quot;).  After a death half of all your gained experience points goes towards paying off your debt.  Rez spells can help pay off a certain percentage of your debt (interesting note, Druids and Shaman in EQoA can also rez, though their rez spells are significantly less than a Cleric's).<br />
<br />
There are no corpses in EQoA, upon death you respawn with all of your gear and half of the money you had on you when you died (it is popular to bank money often for this reason, if you have no money on you, you won't lose any money upon death).<br />
<br />
Warriors/Rogues/Monks all have &quot;Abilities&quot; that work exactly the same way spells work.  As a matter of fact, some &quot;Abilities&quot; are shared between SK's, War's, and Paladin's (i.e. the Taunt spells).  It is almost as if there are no &quot;Pure melee&quot; classes in EQoA. <br />
<br />
Anyways, I know all of this wasn't asked for, just thought I'd share the knowledge. :)<br />

<br />
You haven't been here long enough if you think I'm going to take that advice...<br />
<br />
But I wasn't intentionally being an ass, I was correcting you because you were wrong.  Get used to it.  I'll also correct you when you post something stupid.  So will many others.<br />
<br />
:rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Pohsib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I really enjoy EQOA, however I miss my EQ PC buds.  It is tough to find a good group, but once you find the folks who understand how EQ works, it's a blast.  I find it more relaxed.  <br />

Anyone play on CLW server around here?  :)</div></div><hr />

OK.. this would explain some of the attitude warriors seem to be copping towards our aggro spells lately.  Wonder how many that are complaining are EQOA refugees?</div></div><hr />
