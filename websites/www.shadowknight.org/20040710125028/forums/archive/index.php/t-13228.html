<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Miliza2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Shadowknight spells wont take effect on people. All those atk/ac/sta/str debuffs and our DoT lifetaps say &quot;Wont take effect on target PC&quot;. I asked gms and they dont know a thing one wanted a GM to play my character but I said no. Anyone else experiencing this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Darkenesis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I can't see all of them being removed from use, but they did remove some of our spells from being cast in pvp situations to prevent use of the spells when they weren't 'meant' to be used.<br />
<br />
Such as Zevfeer's Bite.  200hp/100mana group recourse.  Doesn't land on disease resistant mobs... AND you need to cast it in combat.  No mobs/disease resistant mobs = no Zbite.<br />
<br />
So /duel'ing someone and hitting them off of it is technically considered an 'exploit' I guess... Sucks ass and really fucking stupid they limit us like that when we find an ingenious way around, but what can the average Joe do about it but piss and moan about it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ainya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">usually its the group spells that have been diabled, like our torrents and such.  Last I checked the shrouds still worked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ueuelr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">As a SK who enjoys killing palys in duels (because of all the stupid brells they keep casting) I can say that there are a few spells that will not land on other PCs, mostly the 60+ spells, eg Bond of Death, Blood of Hate, Aura of Pain. Also torrent of hate does not seem to land, but can't remeber for sure. However asystole, vampiric embrace, touch of volatis lands. Ignite blood should land as well. Just expriment as see how you go.<br />
<br />
Either way, don't forget to use a buffed pet in duels or else you're not using your full abilities. Against a paly does not realy matter, they die anyway, but a mage or another pet class is easy killed if your pet keeps their pet busy, and a pure caster has problems casting with both you and a pet on him.</div></div><hr />
