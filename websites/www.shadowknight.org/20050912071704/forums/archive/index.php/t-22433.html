I've had procs interupted.  Granted thats only happened 2-3 times in 4+ years, but it has happened.  No doubt its possible for HT.</div></div><hr />

Me: Oops, looks like you missed the interupt bud, oh sorry man, did I just cast SoD and BoH on you? ;p</div></div><hr />

Only had one interrupted in 5+ years and that was while fear kiting. I was moving and hit HT and it didn't fire, though it let me hit it again in about 5 seconds. I've had MC/SoC procs interrupted a few times though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There was a time period (I'd guess somewhere in 2002?) where the interrupts on Scream of Death (lvl 39) were so bad, I went back to Vampiric Embrace from a BE piece -- which for some reason didn't seem to interrupt as often.<br />
<br />
Lately I don't think I've had any memorable interrupts on self procs but at one time, though only for a few weeks if I recall, it was really bad.</div></div><hr />
