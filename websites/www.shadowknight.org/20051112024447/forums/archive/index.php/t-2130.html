<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Szandor</div><div class="date">05-31-2002, 04:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I became the second &quot;soft skin&quot; on my server, Terris-Thule, to complete Greenmist, early this Friday (5/31/02) morning, though due to the fact that the first person who did it moved to Stormhammer, I am now the only one . . . There can be only one! Hehe, it sort of looks like the sword from Highlander, too. ;)<br />
<br />
I extend my deepest thanks to Ezele, a fellow Shadow Knight, an Iksar, who helped me along my path, with answers to my various questions and who organised a group to take down the glowing cliff golem. I would also like to thank Dogge, Enchanter, who had a Mirror of Self-Loathing somewhere in his bank, which was the final piece I needed. And last, but certainly not least, my good friend Mathus, who helped me all throughout the way from the spectral couriers in the City of Mist to the 'smith in the Lake of Ill Omen.<br />
<br />
Quests like this are what bring people together. I was fortunate to meet some very kind people along the way.<br />
