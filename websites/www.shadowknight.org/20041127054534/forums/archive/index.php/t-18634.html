Where would be a good place to AA at when my friends arent online?</div></div><hr />

However, you can aggro kite PoV golems if you're willing to spend 10 min per mob.  The exp really is ass compared to even a mediocre group though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zulpel Bonstalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">hm...i see... thanks for the reply :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Makkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">you can aggro kite in hoh too, basements (sents cant be snared) or zonein mobs in gy. very very slow though, i don't think soloing as an SK is worthwhile anywhere for xp at like 62+</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Also in the &quot;kite room&quot; in plane of tactics is decent exp solo.  Use a pet with pet buff.  Dark the mobs, dot them like mad, run in circles.  Mobs can be snared, don't summon, can be single pulled, and you have enough room to work there without problems getting adds.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>DConquest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I agree, at 65 it just isn't worth it.  Being a part melee class, a large chunk of our DPS comes from it and without our Melee it's pretty slow to kill anything.  <br />
<br />
I do solo sometimes in PoDisease though, if I'm trying to finish off an AA or really bored.  The rats are just low enough to fear kite or even straight up tank if your hp / gear is good enough.  It's about 3/4s a blue per kill and the mob is usually dead before Festering Wears off.  <br />
<br />
If I'm going to solo I rather do it the SK way, rather than trying to solo like a lvl 49 Necro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Squigle D'Muerte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Exp is definitely better in groups.  Best fear kite I have found gives about 2 AA notches (not bubbles, notches) per kill.  This aint great exp but if you have less than an hour it sure beats trying to get in a group for that long.  Personally I hate aggro kiting (too much down time) unless mob is going to drop something good.<br />
<br />
You can still Fear Kite for exp straight up to 65 in a few spots if you can find mobs just below the immune to fear level (54 or 55) in a zone with a good exp modifier and room to kite.  For example the goos and feeble rats in PoD can be single pulled to the Gateway and kited there assuming some Necro isn't training the area.  There are few spots like this though and you basically have to find them yourself through trial and error.  That is what I did.<br />
<br />
Sadly when there are so few choices no one is going to post the one they found here and risk seeing it camped all the time.  Lower level camp sites are fine to give away because you are done with them, you are never done with a level 65 spot though.  Good Luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zulpel Bonstalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks very much for the info. Looks like i'll just play alts when i dont have the time..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If you are waiting for friends and just want to solo, try the red cons at the tables in PoFire. Single pulls, snarable, and a rush to solo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>neferaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">When no one is online I solo sometimes but the xp is not that good even with affliction efficiency 4 and FT12 + Bot9 + VoQ or pact it takes a long time to kill a mob (using dots and pet) and I found group xp to be better. Didn't try out fire yet though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zulpel Bonstalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have no flags whatsoever so i dont think i can go into Pofire :( <br />
