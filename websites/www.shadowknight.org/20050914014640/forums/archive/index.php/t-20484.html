I intend on trying it.  If not ill enlist the help of a few clerics and a shaman.  I think that will do it.  Any ideas? im only 42 but im working on getting to 52 before i even try.  Im twinked pretty good imo, but you guys may think otherwise.  Str, dex, agi, sta, and int are all above 150.  Resists are near 100, Hp near 2k, and AC is 1035 atm.  and im using that 2hp which is 26/22 i think....its only 21/22 for me atm.  I plan on having my epic and Greenmist soon too....i have all the stuff and paying someone to MQ the epic for me.  what else should i do?  Also for the record....SKs rock.  I wish i would have played a SK first before I leveled my rogue to 65.  I would be using a windblade but after playing my rogue for 2 years now i cant get used to them slow ass 2 handers.</div></div><hr />

That's funny, I'm fairly certain that most of us wish you'd never found the Shadowknight button on the creation screen.<br />

Oh, and FYI, TTCP isn't 21/22 for you, you're getting the full effect.  There's a bug that doesn't scale dmg/delay on level reccomended weapons.  Lucky you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At 52 the ratio of TTCP makes it a better weapon than any other droppable weapon for sk pre Gates of Discord.<br />
<br />
Its above lvl 54 that the other weapons shine with delays over 27.</div></div><hr />

He used healing potions to do it.<br />
<br />
I have heard that they made it so you can only use 5 potions.<br />
<br />
If that is true he probably can't do it again.<br />

A lower dps toon will have less chance of doing it.<br />

and to all you guys out there stop flaming me cause im multiquesting and twinking my Sk.  I started my rogue from level one with crap like most of you guys/gals did with your main chars and I EARNED everthing i have now.  Gimme a break...im just having a little fun until WoW comes out anyway.

The only issue is the potions and one rounding.  I could de-level to 52 and tank naggy naked if I had unlimited potions with instant click.  So if the potions still worked someone with less equipment and dps could do it with more potions.  Assuming that naggy can't one round them.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT:  And that they could carry all the potions</div></div><hr />

Level 50, around 4k HP, 180ish FR, 1Kish AC and ATK. Chanter and shaman couldnt get a slow to stick, apparently. Dropped me in no time flat. A bunch of tripples for 200ish, a few AOEs for 500ish, and I lasted until the cleric couldnt CH me anymore.  Not actually sure what happened to him. We got him to 90% True, was with a  group of people I hadnt grouped with before, or at least any amount to speak of. Cleric just couldnt keep me up for some reason. SHammyw as too busy dying from AOEs.</div></div><hr />

Honestly, there is no way you have a 65 rogue.  I have a 63 rogue and I barley play a SK and I know waaaaay more than you do on.....Everything.  Breastplate of Eradication at lvl 15?  Get a life, you prolly ninja lewted it. <br />
<br />
Or, you Ebayed your 65 rogue.  Feel sorry for your server.</div></div><hr />

Quarken was a big PoM fan.  Please note what they do.  He went in 65 raid buffed all the time as far as I know.  So, at time of battle he would have had closer to 5200 hps.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">quickling1</div><div class="date">03-10-2004, 08:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hah...for your information i was on a pick up raid that killed Statue in Kael and 3 Breastplates dropped and one was rotting cause no one needed it.  I had a SK since my rogue was like level 20.  since traveling is a snap now i logged my SK, used the book in Nektulos forest, paid a Druid to port me to wakinglands and ran to the corpse to loot the Breastplate.  Since then I have decided to level him up only cause he had some ok gear and I dont even wear the Breastplate unless im in an LDoN group.  I use my Fungi tunic atm for soloing.  Whatever....<br />
<br />
As for the statement that I don't have a clue how to play my rogue?  I laugh at that since I think I play a rogue very well and Never Die or get hit much on raids or Hard LDoNs.  I don't have a Guild so you can imagine the gear i have..blah,blah,blah.  Dude STFU before you make a statement about someone you dont even know.  I use my rogue to his full potential SOLO.  I Pick pockets in Seb Solo for gems...the only AA i have is SoS so i can pick Naggy for the 100% weight reduction Bags.  My poison is Maxed and i have the GMAS and GMAV.  If anyone knows how to play a rogue it's me.  I don't depend on groups to level up make money or get augs for my armor.  I even get 2 65s to join a LDoN to start a hard  LDoN adventure with me so I can drop them and go on the adventure solo so i can raid any chest i can find.  So far I have done this 4 times and Have gotten about 7 Ancient augs without a death.  Sometimes i get agroed when i do this but i hit nimble and use my trusty gate potion.  I go to hate solo so i can get the book for some of my rogue friends who need thier epics.....man the list of shit i do as a rogue goes on and on.... and after playing My SK i see soooo many possiblilitys there too.  someone's earlier post is very true...i don't have a clue...but i am learning.  I am 40ish and just leaned that I can pull singles even if there are 100 mobs standing elbow to elbow....so whats that mean? I have a clue now?  hahaha.....You guys are the ones that's clueless......Im only talking about the people who don't solo because to solo and solo well you have to understand ALOT about how the game works...agro and what you can and Can't do with the Class you are playing.  I bet the rogue who posted earlier has played his whole career depending on groups to help him level.  Many of you may not think so but a rogue is truely a solo class if you know how to play them(poisons, backstabs, fighting casters...etc..)  <br />
<br />
Anyway to everyone else....Thanks!!  I enjoy your input.  If there are any other tricks you can tell me about using my SK I will greatly appreciate it.  Until I learned the single pull trick with my SK I was relying on FD ALOT.  Now when I do group for Ldons(for points for spells) I can be much more of an asset to the group.:D</div></div><hr />

Is this guy for real?!?!  If this isn't a joke I think you seriously need to get some help man.  Reading the class description on the character creation screen does not equal having a 65 rogue. <br />
<br />
the only AA i have is SoS so i can pick Naggy for the 100% weight reduction Bags <br />
<br />
Going on about how his 1337 pick-pocketing skillz equate to knowing how to play a class...Rofl</div></div><hr />

You first of all go on a PICK UP raid on statue albeit statue isn't that hard but the fact is you kill him of all luck 3 BP drop i've never seen that before and i've killed statue 30+ times. Whats more unbelievable is that in a PICK UP raid 3 people doesn't need bp and they decide to let a level 20 sk loot it? ROFL give me a break .<br />
<br />
Leaving your group to pick chest? your only screwing your group i would rather do the hard mission and get chest as we progress you earn yourself a rep of being an asshole. jeez it's not like hard ldon is that &quot;hard&quot; rofl</div></div><hr />

<br />
Solo Naggy? DuDe what a GREAT idea! Your L33T twink will own Naggy. You will go down as a Legend for just comming up with the idea, and the MQ of our epic at your level is just DAMN!!<br />
<br />
The &quot;Bling Bling&quot; picking of weight reduction bags off Vox added with the fact of losing your group to pick chests in &quot;Hard&quot; ldon is unMATCHED in history. Your Rogue must be common name on the safehouse eh?  Our hats off to you and best of luck. We are all holding our collective breath while you attempt this EPIC take down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">quickling1</div><div class="date">03-13-2004, 02:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks  Assazzin.  When I posted that my Sk wasn't even close to level 52 and after a few more levels I don't think that soloing naggy is possible even with the help of a few clerics.  I joined a Naggy raid and we killed him with 16 people and I MTed, but still I know I don't have the dmg output to hang on like that in a toe to toe battle even at 52.  What I think is funny is how people on this site try to flame others for thier questions and ideas.  IMO so many people love EQ because there are many ways one can advance and play the way THEY like.  Like me for example, I can spend all day with my rogue running around in Mistmoore(my favorite zone) and help out newbies and farming the place for lowbie items or start an LDoN adventure to get some augs real quick.   I don't like to group much, but I enjoy soloing.  And what's so hard to believe that Statue dropped 3 breastplates?  It was my first time killing statue too.  Why can't you people just say cool good for you instead of I hate your guts die, die, die?  Also on my server everyone has a level 65 guy or 2 or 3 and having a super twinked out level 50 toon is the norm too.  Does it hurt you haters feelings that much to play my SK the way I want to?  At first I was wondering why I got flamed so bad then after reading a few posts on this site I see Im not the only one.  Many people ask questions to things that you high level guys done or known the answer to since level 2 so you flame the hell out of the person.  Wow, you guys are awsome!  I can't wait until im a cool high level SK so I can get a cocky I-know-it-all-holier-than-thou attitude =/</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">quickling1</div><div class="date">03-15-2004, 07:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I haven't been playing a SK for as long as you guys so why do you say Im dumb? Be specific because I would like an opportunity to defend myself any any of these matters.  I guess I shouldn't care what anyone thinks, but I do want to know why you think this way because if there is a way I can improve my SK game it would be helpful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Groff Gorespiller</div><div class="date">03-15-2004, 08:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, Quickling, I'll help you out.<br />
<br />
Let me give you a rundown of what you're doing wrong and why you're getting flamed.  I'm betting that you still won't understand, and you'll get upset by this explanation, but hey, I'm not here to grow you as a person.  Shrinks get paid a lot to do that, I won't do it for free.<br />
<br />
First, you're young, and as all young people do, you think that you know everything.  You come here and throw your &quot;knowledge&quot; in the face of the folks who did it originally, without help and without the walk throughs, you refuse to listen to them, demand explanations and long winded discussions on why you're wrong, then refuse to believe those explanations.  You are the quintessential teenager.  Now, when I call you a teenager, that doesn't necessarily mean that you were born 18 or fewer years ago as the term is typically defined.  It's possible.  It is also possible that you are a 45 year old who still thinks like the average teen.  I've seen it happen, and the problem isn't age, it's thought process and attitude.  You want respect, yet you don't give respect to anyone.  You feel as if you deserve respect from every one straight away, but you think that, because you're so &quot;knowledgable&quot; and &quot;wise&quot; you are allowed to determine who deserves respect and who doesn't.  And the folks you think are deserving happen to coincide with those who agree with you.  It's a common logical fallacy, but you're not thinking deeply enough to understand that your reasoning is false.<br />
<br />
Second, as a typical teen, you're a braggart.  You back up your &quot;knowledge&quot; with self-aggrandizing anecdotal evidence which proves nothing and aggravates.  Trust me, we know what &quot;can be done&quot; here.  If it can be done, it probably has, and in that case your personal quest to do the same isn't really anything new or spectacular, no matter what you think of it.  Furthermore, most of us know that you can open a tin can with your teeth if you must, but none of us want to go that route when we can just use a can opener.  It's stupid juvenile hubris to continue to try to use your teeth on that can rather than go two extra steps and do it the right way.  And it's annoying to have some kid come here and scream that he's going to do it with his teeth because he's uber and he's cooler and smarter than the rest of us.  Whatever chief.<br />
<br />
Third (and this is a small point, but a personal pet peeve of mine), your spelling, grammar and punctuation is attrocious.  If you don't type it so I can read it, don't expect me to respect whatever you have to say.  <br />
<br />
Fourth (again, a minor point, but one that influences the attitudes of some around here), you are admittedly twinking an SK.  You play a rogue, Rogue is your class.  You started an SK because you think that they're hip or cool or powerful, and don't really have much tying you to the class.  Many of us here play Shadowknights as our one and only class.  It is often take as an affront when someone comes here talking about what they're &quot;going to do&quot; with their ubertwink, simply because they've not put in the time, not put in the effort and not dealt with the things that have happened to and with this class.  If you're playing because you think SKs are powerful, or because you think you're dark and mysterious and angry and evil, please, take my advice and just play whatever you want however you want without trying to be a part of this community.  You're not going to be welcomed with open arms.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, those are the four big problems I see.  Take my advice how you like, flame back if you must.  <br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />

i think it should be &quot;your spelling, grammar and punctuation &lt;b&gt;are&lt;/b&gt; atrocious (with 1 t)...i don't know if that was intentional or not, but you should really watch that before you hammer someone on grammar...<br />

If you take &quot;spelling, grammar and punctuation&quot; as a whole (read as &quot;writing skills&quot; or whatever), then using &quot;is&quot; works.  If you take them as individual points (which is entirely valid based on context, though not what I intended) unrelated to each other, then yes, &quot;are&quot; would be grammatically correct.  In either case, really the point was that his posts should be readable, which mine was.  Though I added an extra &quot;t&quot; in atrocious and used a verb in a conjugation which didn't seem absolutely correct to you, you understood the message.<br />
<br />
I'm not trying to bash anyone, nor come off as &quot;holier than thou&quot;.  I don't get off on hammering people about grammar, spelling or anything else.  I simply try to point out irrational behavior and thought patterns.  Stupidity and ignorance annoy me, and if I can make the world around me a little less so, it gives me satisfaction to do so.<br />
<br />
If you'd prefer to see me make someone cry, I'll do my best to appease you next time.</div></div><hr />

i can understand that.  You must be pissed all the time though, b/c in my experience almost every single person i come into contact with is either stupid, ignorant, racist or arrogant.  On the internet it's even worse, there's no true way of exposing most of these idiots' lies and bullshit.  Random mass murder sprees, for me, is the best way to go as far as releasing tension and built up aggression from dealing with the cattle (people) every day..<br />
<br />
i'm interested in your input on this subject.<br />
<br />
edt: absolutely try to make them cry next time, it always feels good to belittle and humiliate others for shits and giggles.</div></div><hr />

I for one have been playing my SK for a while now, I can solo stuff, but its not as easy as you think Most of are soloing comes the way of are PET DD'S and DOT spell's and fear kite If it is safe to do so.<br />
