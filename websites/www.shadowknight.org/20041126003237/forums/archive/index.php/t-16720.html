<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is this supposed to give you ultra vison ?  Its listed on the menu under vision spells.  EB and Lev seems to work but the ultra vison does not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Spylmann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think it's see invis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I dont think Bobbing Corpse has see invis on it either.  Its great for running around The Grey tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Azaryl LVeldrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">No see invis or ultravision on bobbing corpse.  Underwater breathing effect, increase PR by 40 and levitate effect only.<br />
<br />
In darkness,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Khat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Azaryl is correct.<br />
<br />
The only effects that BB has are:<br />
Enduring Breath<br />
Levitate<br />
Increased svP by 40.<br />
<br />
This is the SK version of the 44 Nec spell Dead Man Floating.<br />
DMF has See Invis while BB does not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yes but it is listed under vision spells so I think its supposed to have ultravision but its broke</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Khat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Listed under Vision spells where?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Liabach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">not able to log on an look but i think 'e means if you r-click an empty gems and bring up the new spell tree, under probably beneficial, and vision, is bobbing corpse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Khat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Gotcha.<br />
As far as I know, BB has never had a See Invis effect since it's inception.<br />
<br />
I'm guessing it never was meant to either, to keep a balance issue between the Necs and us.<br />
<br />
Sure wouldn't mind if they would throw it in though.  :)<br />
<br />
As far as showing in the Vision line, my only guess is that BB was a cut-n-paste directly from DMF with appropriate changes applied.<br />
If that's the case, it would probably inherit the same attribute that the Spell Book pulls from.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I think its just there because of the spell family.  Most of the similar necro spells do have vision buffs.  Not really sure honestly dont care why its there.  if they move it im gonna be hella pissed tho, im used to it being where it is now ;p</div></div><hr />
