<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dracsoul</div><div class="date">03-30-2002, 05:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Need some information that was lost on the old forum. My Guild is starting to strech into WToV and the First Blood Dragons. <br />
<br />
Recent kills being:<br />
Dozer<br />
Gozzrem <br />
Telkorenar <br />
Klandicar<br />
Vindicator<br />
<br />
My problem being I don't know what's tapable/HTable or not. I make a lot of agro experamnting to find out.  I found with Dozer that I can tap him when he's debuffed, and I was actualy the redebuffer called. When my taps stoped landing I would yell out to debuff him again.  I also noticed that LL would hit, when my normal tap would not?  just dum luck?<br />
<br />
I normaly test mobs with DC to see if Disc HT will work, but that gets REALY tricky when I'm not suposed to be getting agro. <br />
<br />
There was a list on the old forums that I think Breal put together for us, can you Vets put that together again?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I usually don't use SoH on raids cause of its stacking issue with CoP, but I do use ToH when I can.</div></div><hr />
