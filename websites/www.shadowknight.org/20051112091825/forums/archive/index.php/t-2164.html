<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Razaduuul</div><div class="date">06-01-2002, 02:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am currently playing an iksar SK, and things are pretty good but hunting grounds are sparse with faction and on Tallon Zek the dark team gets singled out a lot. So I was considering starting an Erudite, since the MR would be nice in pvp. Also the xp penalty is a little annoying.<br />
<br />
But my question is whether the lack of regen is noticable, I plan to solo primarily, it would be nice to hear from anyone who has played races with regen and those without.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anuin</div><div class="date">06-03-2002, 12:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It does matter at low levels, a lot.   Though as you get higher it matters a lot less.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Razaduuul</div><div class="date">06-03-2002, 01:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Does it tend to matter less because you get other regen items, or are grouping? <br />
<br />
or does it stop being a problem when you get a bigger lifetap?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KaeruWak</div><div class="date">06-03-2002, 06:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your regen in comparison to total HP gets less and less.  Basically you can regen to full life in 5 minutes instead of 8 or 9, big deal.  In fight, regen is negligible, and your lifetaps will become a more significant way of stay full life.<br />
<br />
at 1 to 20, I find it a pain to level with out regen or a heal spell, at 40+ It didnt make much of a difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Razaduuul</div><div class="date">06-04-2002, 12:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks, although it looks like I'm gonna reroll as a troll, since I still get plate, good stats, and as a troll I get slam, so no erudite for me, I thought about it for a while, and I think I will need the regen for pvp, after all if I recover faster, after running in a close battle, then I can come back with the odds in my favor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Groobash</div><div class="date">06-04-2002, 02:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">if you solo a lot, regen matters a lot more<br />
<br />
if you tend to group all the time, it doesn't matter near as much</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Razaduuul</div><div class="date">06-04-2002, 03:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">heh 1-32 with this guy never considered grouping except at lvl 18 and 19, before my dmg cap came off and I got hit for 32 by a low blue con, while I could only hit for 29 =/<br />
<br />
I guess it's decided, after I farm a little cash for some more weapons to train with I am gonna start a troll SK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krazaak</div><div class="date">06-04-2002, 10:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Curious as to why you'd switch from Iksar to Troll?  Both regen the same and both have the same exp penalty.<br />
<br />
Trolls also suffer from miserably low FR.<br />
<br />
I definitely agree that regen makes a big deal, I love mine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Razaduuul</div><div class="date">06-04-2002, 11:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm switching because I don't find I have enough armor choices as an iksar, and a few other odds and ends, basically a few things I would prefer for pvp purposes, and I suppose a bit for pve:<br />
<br />
1. weighted axe, at lower lvls will make my opening attacks in pvp (or pve) more devastating giving me a psychological advantage as well as an actually advantage.<br />
<br />
2. Skull shaped barbute, 10 MR and good stats on a helm, I need the MR every bard I fight does nothing but run their snare song all day long, takes about 80+ MR to resist that consistantly enough.<br />
<br />
3. more armor choices, it's much easier to find a person selling sentient or darkforge armor than it is to find dreadscale armor. And several other armor sets that iksar can't wear, such as validus custodus and crustacean shell.<br />
<br />
4. I'm planning to buy some shrink potions, it would just be awesome to have a mini troll running around killing people =) more awesome than a mini iksar.<br />
<br />
5. In the future iksar cannot use blood ember armor to my knowledge, and I would certainly appreciate some of those effects.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pheargore</div><div class="date">06-04-2002, 01:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Trolls can't wear Validus Custodus either, but Crusty sure is nice on a Troll =)<br />
<br />
Another nice thing about Troll for me is the location of our home city. It rules.<br />
<br />
Guk, really close<br />
Cazic-Thule, close (since 55+ change not as much of a factor)<br />
EC, fairly close<br />
Sol A &amp; Sol B, not too far away and next to DE allies<br />
Rathe Mountains, Close to HG farm central<br />
Boat to Kunark, close enough<br />
<br />
Only thing that would be nice is if they moved the Nexus Spire from NK to South Ro =)<br />
<br />
- Peace</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Razaduuul</div><div class="date">06-04-2002, 08:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah I figured guk would be a nice spot to be around, good xp, I can camp anotehr RBF, but the lack of any nearby nexus spire is harsh... Especially on my server where no matter what path I take to the SK spires I will be attacked by other players on enemy teams for certain.<br />
<br />
So it's a bit hard to leave the center of antonica as a dark race without a port..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jounar</div><div class="date">06-10-2002, 06:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personaly Iv found regen to be very handy in my journey from 1 to 60.I soloed a good 50% and it DOES help out in groups later on as well as with a top regen buff from a shammy you require a lot less healing in the group.<br />
<br />
As for the armor thing with Iksar,yes its hard at the early levels but rygorr is cheep and you can get in a group and get some yourself.Seb scale is nice as well but alot harder to get due to the wis on certain parts that rangers/druids seem to go nuts for :(<br />
<br />
Stick it out for the Velious armor as its the best in game apart from the uber peices the the boss mobs in Velious and Luclin drop,but these will take you a while to aquire :)<br />
<br />
Trolls have some nice hunting grounds now but Kunark owns them and you can get to mid 50's if not 60 there easily :)<br />
<br />
Iksar and armor is not an easy road to travel but in the end it works out so we own the lower races :)<br />
<br />
Sadly the lower races look so much cooler with the luclin gfx tho :(</div></div><hr />
