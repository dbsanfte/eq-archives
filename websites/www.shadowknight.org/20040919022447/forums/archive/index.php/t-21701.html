<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mehatesu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My ogre is fast approaching the time when he will begin his epic..Having allready completed the shaman epic and being very disapointed in that I was wondering if the SK epic was worth doing and how does it rate on the difficulty chart as compared to the other classes..If its not worth doing are there any other blades out there that are worth having as a SK, preferably 2h slash...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">its worth doing cause its fun, and a decent accoplishment...but theres better buyables nowadays for less then 10k its your choice really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Compared on the difficulty chart to other classes', our epic is retarded hard. You can buy a better (much better) weapon in the bazaar for probably about 4k (or abouts there, on Tunare server), but having the SK epic is more of a status symbol. I wish that I had more time to try to go out and complete my epic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mehatesu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ok, that being said, what are some of those other options..Im on the Drinal server and its wicked expensive there..I think PC gamer at one times listed out servers as the most over inflated of the eq servers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well, you missed the fableds, so that's out of the question.... if you're beginning your epic, then you're probably not high enough to get any PoP raid drops..... If you have a guild that raids, try to get something there, if not, try to get on open raids, maybe you'll get lucky, or lead a raid yourself.... Greenmist is also an option, its a decent little quest to do (though time consuming, but about 1/10 of what the epic is), though its 1HS, not 2HS... try to find someone with a deal on a Widebladed Greatsword, War Marshall's Bladed Staff, Argent Protector..... any of those would do you well (except for possibly the last one) until 60-65. Unless you're right set against the idea, maybe look into some Piercing weapons like Narandi's Lance or Two-Tined Pitchfork, usually piercers are a bit cheaper than 2HS are. Other than that, I don't know what to suggest, I don't have the old world/kunark/velious knowledge that a lot of others do, as I didn't get the chance to play EQ back in the day. Luclin has some damn good weapons (SSRA, VT, even just some named), but you'll either need a guild or else a very strong group of friends to take most of them down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">planar lance of torment is wicked cheap also, and fairly decent.... i think i had one on my twink iksar sk once and liked it,  but for all obvious reasons... for cost and what you get war marshalls is a great option and usually doesnt cost more then 5k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kilkulan Darkwarrior</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">War Marshall's Bladed Staff is cheep as hell.. and better DPS than a windblade</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mehatesu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I was currious, you listed sevel options on the 2hslash..I have the Argent Protector now, and so far Im pretty pleased with it, but I get a lot of flack over it..I do have the silver chiten hand wraps to offset the slowness of the blade..I got it on a off chance roll on a guild raid.  I do plan on getting the soulscream belt soon.. Since Im not the MT I shouldnt be to overly concerned with DPS right. I usually end up at the puller and then FD to let the MT take the job of getting beat on..Let me know what you think..Id get a WMBS but on the Drinal Server they go for like 10-12k..Pretty over priced in my opinion..</div></div><hr />
