<br />
I will be sending a submission to the dev corner on Monday. These are the points I will make as far as why I think it should be changed.<br />
<br />
1) Monks that worship Quellious only get to indifferent and are able to do their quest.<br />
2) Cazic Thule (maker of the Iksar) is allies with Rallos Zek and Innoruk. Why is it then that Bertrox SK's can get to warmly whereas Rallos Zek worshippers can only get to Indifferent. Why would Cazic be able to like a non ally more than an ally? This does not make sense and hopefully we can get it changed on this point alone.<br />
<br />
I would encourage others to also send in comments to the Developers Corner...<br />

Disapointed... :(</div></div><hr />

Go kill Julian Lockheart in Icewell keep...  Keep killing her until you get a necklace..  Try it.  I'd boost you +100 faction with him.  I donno if +100 is enough to push you into the next faction bracket or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rartawk</div><div class="date">05-05-2002, 03:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess something like this could work, if an indifferent faction cap means you can't get out of indifferent to amiable, rather than just stopping the moment you get indifferent.<br />
<br />
I'd rather see Verant give us Rallos Ogres a fair shot though and up our cap :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taeren</div><div class="date">05-05-2002, 03:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Have you actually tried multiquesting the first quest yet? It could be that the NPC is saying you can't do the quest, but will still let you complete it. The Arch Duke said the same thing to me when I asked him about the Lord's Khukri, but I took a chance and handed in the items anyway and he gave me my reward. &lt;shrug&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ardrick</div><div class="date">05-05-2002, 08:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah do the MQ and see if it works</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rartawk</div><div class="date">05-06-2002, 01:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">you guys are right, that couldn't hurt to try :)<br />
<br />
mind you, if it worked all the way up to the lord of pain khukri and THEN didn't work, well I wouldn't be a happy ogre that's for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rhumba_Kween</div><div class="date">05-06-2002, 09:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For the first quest, you have to mq back the bag of sarnack heads. You cannot get the bag from him when he wont talk to you. :( I got my faction high enough to try this weekend and was sorely disapointed.<br />
<br />
Very Discouraging. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rartawk</div><div class="date">05-06-2002, 11:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I realise that most of the early Khukri quests have some nodrop component along with the previous Khukri. But, I was figuring that if i was going to kill a whole bunch of greenies, I might as well PL a new char while I'm doing it, not another SK but maybe a shammy. Shammies start out indiff to crusaders though, so I might use bone chips to get his faction up enough, MQ the first khukri with a mule, and do the rest from there.<br />
<br />
Doing the lord of pain quest is from a different Iksar, and doesnt require getting anything from the him, so &quot;maybe&quot; I could do it this way ( though at some risk )<br />
<br />
I figure if I get started and get to the point of collecting a Hero Khukri, by that time VI might have fixed this up for Rallos Ogres anyway :)</div></div><hr />
