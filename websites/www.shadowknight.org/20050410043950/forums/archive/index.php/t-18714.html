This is what I planned in doing. I wanted go to where the king was located cast pet. Have my pet attack the king and have a mage CoH to the zoneline.  There our guildies kill him. Do you think this strategy will work?<br />

2nd : Coh at this distance will wipe aggro (so I don't see the point)<br />
<br />
Non kos sk or monk can pull queen to ZI (easy for a sk with circlet) just tag and run make sure you know the layout of chardok, move her to ZI then just zone out while another non kos player hail her (since she's a quest ncp she won't move and repply to the hail). I don't know if this is possible for the king.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">if mage is non-kos, you can coh in near the library.  Easiest way to pull is pacify.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kuvak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I am planning to do the Overking in Chardok for my wife's cleric epic this weekend. All of us are KOS in there. I was planning to clear the roamers, then pacify some of the mobs in the King room (there are so many, I didn't think you could pacify them all at once) then sick pet on King and try to get him single that way and pull him to the hall outside his room. Would that work?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>cauchy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You basically described the way that King raids have been going on for years.  Instead of pacifying and junk though, just kill all the mobs in his room.  He's an infamous gater.  And unless you have 7.2k HT or some other kind of big nuke to drop on him, you're gonna wipe when he gates, summons you to his room and all his friends who aren't pacified anymore use your spine as a pogo stick.<br />
<br />
There's an easier way if you have non-kos people.  I'll PM you how.</div></div><hr />

coh wipes agro, coh kills pet.<br />
<br />
if you have a non kos enc or cleric or bard in your guild, they can drag him to zoneline. they pacify the mobs in the room except the king of course, pick one near the king, and cast root or mez on it. king assists and agroes, but since he isn't directly agroed nothing further will assist him. the person who rooted the mob proceeds to run to the zoneout with the king trailing behind. assuming their root doesn't break immediately, there will be no train.<br />
<br />
alternatively, if you have a nonkos mage you can get CoHed wherever you want near the king and kill him how you will. i've killed him a few times being summoned into the flat hall outside his room. there are 5 wanderers in that area, but none see invis.</div></div><hr />

LMAO!<br />

Seriously though, you can just DoT him with some low damage spell that will not damage him enough to summon you then get a COTH to zonein. Next tick you have aggro again and he should warp onto you. Get a few big nukers and tell them to go nuts at 30%, he shouldn't have more than one chance to gate.</div></div><hr />
