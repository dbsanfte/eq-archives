<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tescin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Looking for the same here on Karana.  Would pay WELL for MQ of the mirror.</div></div><hr />

Great name... <br />

You should be on my Server.  My Guild is a DE based Role Play Guild.. loosely based on the Drow.<br />
<br />
We use the language for special Member Titles...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ssinss De'Streea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Good eye Nazgaull, and Seduction of Death is the closer translation. I 1st learned about the Drow, or dark elves, in old pen and paper RPG's. But my interest really sparked years back when I played Never Winter Nights on AOL . <br />
<br />
ToL and Bregan D'Aerith were active, and thier members spoke almost entirely in Drow. <br />
<br />
That craptastic game that was trully the best roleplaying environment I have ever experienced. Nothing has come close since.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>tyrrax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Send me a tell in game.  I know someone who has a mirror to MQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ssinss De'Streea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Much thanks for the offer Tyrrax, but I have completed it now :)<br />
<br />
A kindly wizard in my other toons guild got one, and quested it with me. I am now the proud owner of Greemist.</div></div><hr />
