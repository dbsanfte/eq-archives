<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Awaon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A search didn't turn up much. :confused:<br />
<br />
Any suggestions or info regarding this encounter?  I've seen a few people mention &quot;2 groups,&quot; but what classes should those groups consist of?  And how beefy does the MT need to be?  Are casters of any use?  Any adds to worry about?  What's the spawn time?<br />
<br />
I'd really like to see my SK wearing a Wormhusk Harness, so any and every bit of advice I can get would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Awaon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The lack of responses means one of three things:<br />
<br />
a. No one knows (highly unlikely)<br />
b. No one cares (possibly)<br />
c. No one wants the give up the spawn (likely)<br />
<br />
Guess I'll camp it old school and find out the hard way. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Oagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I don't think he's two group.  There's plenty of people that have 2-3 boxed him.  He's a pain in the ass spawn, though, since his morph stage is always up until he's ready.<br />
<br />
I'd be surprised if he took more than one group.  I have thought about trying him 2-boxing, just never found him fully developed.  With a 65 shaman/SK combo with proper aa's, I bet he's more than duoable.<br />
<br />
Inner AC used to be one of my favorite places to two box, because the mobs are frikken easy, and the loot isn't half bad.  However, with the Droga revamp, I find myself there more now.  It's easier to get to, the mobs don't see invis, they're spaced so you can camp, and as long as you can handle more than one, you're in business.  The drops in Droga are better, as well.<br />
<br />
The Burrower drops some nice stuff.  Maybe camp a ranger or druid to time him at the zone-line.  He's frikken close, and the fish adds are no longer a problem.  Read up on him in Alla's.<br />
<br />
Plenty of info on Inner AC on the Shaman Boards.  It's one of their favorite farm spots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Awaon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for the response.<br />
<br />
I saw one of my server's more infamous loot/spawn farmers camping it this morning while it was big, then came back later to see it small.  So I guess I know now when to look for a repop.  It's a five day spawn, correct?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>cames</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">To answer the basic questions, you fight him in the water if you turn left at the entrance to AC.  He is in his room alone, although you might drag the odd Grimling with you to the setup area (if these worry you don't do the encounter).<br />
<br />
He Flurries and Enrages.  He does not Rampage.  I don't remember what he hits for but if you can tank in NToV you can tank him with ease.  He has no AE.<br />
<br />
Whenever he is up my guild kills him, because we are at a stage where his drops are an upgrade for many.  Farming him 2 box or 3 box will not go very far unless you are a) just trying to see if you can do it or b) like to sell Luclin era spells or c) equipping an alt.<br />
