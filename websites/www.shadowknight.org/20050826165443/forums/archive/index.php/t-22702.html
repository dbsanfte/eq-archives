Kinda wondering myself since most groups I joined died fast (people didn't feel like grinding xp etc.)  Dranik's Scar had alotta greenies, but a few deep blues which weren't bad xp.  From what I saw didn't seem like enough xp to match elementals and such though.</div></div><hr />

There is also a raid event there, &quot;Muckglider School Leader&quot; which i can detail if you want. Other than that i didnt' really do much execpt for experiment w/ AA's ;/</div></div><hr />

<br />
heard proving grounds was harder/better. someone explain to me why they didnt make some zone where there were white/yellow/red cons to exp on on your way to 70? PoF c2 = teh ghey. If there is such a zone in OoW, please share~<br />
<br />
edit: logged in just now and there were 63 people in WoS, so seems everyone knows about it by now.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Inevub</div><div class="date">09-16-2004, 04:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Exp'd tonight in Proving Grounds for a bit at 66.  Mobs seemed about KT level in difficulty, like most OoW mobs ran fast as all hell.  I was mainly pulling but tanked some and didn't really have any problems with my gear (was at about 8700 hp when we were there).  Didn't try any named though.  All mobs were at least yellow to me and some red, we didn't get too far in though and didn't try any named, and almost nothing saw invis.<br />
<br />
Definitely agree with Maicom about WoS (especially since I was there with him, fear I'm guilded with that green helmed nut~), were a lot of people in there and zone was getting trained a lot, and mobs were getting pretty scarce with 50+ people.  Other than that was ok, and once you figure out which named arent the really hard raid type ones the other named are gimp and drop spells and stuff, got rune for 69 pet buff off a very easy named.<br />
<br />
Couple things...interested in hearing from other people who have exp'd in proving grounds, we didnt get any spell or loot drops while we were there, do regular mobs drop stuff?  <br />
<br />
Also, killed a Dragorn Warlord in WoT, took about 2.5 groups, and dropped some thing that sounded like a key piece or a epic piece, anyone know?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd probably liken it more to Dreadlands than BoT. There are not really any set camps per say, and going to be unlikely many of the spots will get a camp spot per se. The big difference being that there are 1/10th mobs of DL, so if you get more than 3-4 groups, mobs start getting very scarce.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">grosbras2</div><div class="date">09-17-2004, 04:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I tanked in wall (LDON/preelemental equipped 7khp... 8k with FO7and druid/cler buff), I even tanked a slowed red named (dropped a 68 rune) and an unslowed yellow one... I had a good cleric and good dps but honnestly it was easy as hell... and at least an expansion where I can tank again ;) as you can see I do not have many defensive aa ... will do them now that they can be of use ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maicom</div><div class="date">09-17-2004, 06:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">proving grounds seemed nice to get away from the tards, would recommend bringing a bst/bard/shaman to slow... chanters are completely useless there aside from having a convenient voq/vq station with you(past the zone in all the mobs are 69+, bliss mezz's up to 68 mobs). We were able to crawl through the zone and kill 2 named.<br />
<br />
One thing we had a problem with: got an ikaav, noone in group could interrupt her casting(sk/chanter/cleric/wiz/mage/rogue). Gated, and brought back a shitload of mobs, only made it cause i managed to train em away and the cleric backed up to a safe spot and camped out. That's a pretty serious design issue imo, i have the immobilizing bash aa maxed and haven't had it interrupt any caster in like KT+ content, maybe at 70 that will change though(68 for the past day or two). Soooo, unless you bring a bard/paladin(think bellow/divine stun can interrupt) you're kinda shit-outta-luck if you get a gater. Anyone know any other way to get around that?</div></div><hr />

Deep PoWater (Regruas, etc) when I was able to get a group down there for 3 hrs was almost 50% of a level. (L67 at the time)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Standing before clear will usually result in the mobs spinning around outside the geography and aggroing a good chunk of the zone before they warp where they can kill you.</div></div><hr />

Spend nearly 4 hours yesterday hoping for nameds with runes and the only named that popped was Shadowhunter, which roams now very close to zone, so sometimes you even have to hold pulls to let him pass. Anyone else experienced that or maybe that was just a bad luck? 4 hours, no nameds :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ninx</div><div class="date">09-24-2004, 10:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">due to some punk giving me advice to go to WoS to level i decided to go there...bad idea, but much to my delight i heard TRAIN manytimes in /ooc..now you are prolly asking why i was delighted to see this right?? well i had fun running around trying to find the person running with 3 mobs right on their ass and die before they got 2 feet away...sadly the other day i saw a bard make it =/ o well cant win em all /feign death<br />
<br />
The named dont seem to have a specific spawn time or anything but they wander often enough, i got 4 in one hour in a day losing all the rolls i was going to log when we killed a fifth and i got benevolent girdle and a rune, the best loot of the night. its a belt with 1 FT bash damage and attk, unfortunatly its pally only /sigh WTF is soe thinking??.this was by far the best named day other than beta but then again there were only 38 peeps in zone  other days ive been there i have had no named's spawn this is partially due to the fact that when i log in there is an average of 80-100 people in the zone in my server, o well happy hunting my advice stands as go there to farm spells not to XP, proving grounds was pretty nice, i can tank there easily with around 10k hp fully buffed, the XP was about as good as earth when i was there killing reds and yellows for 4-5%AA per kill<br />

Was getting about a blue AA per kill at 66, maybe a touch less. Lv 70 was happy with the XP too.<br />
<br />
Maze Runners Ring dropped of a trash mob, and I won my first random in more than a year:P  Yay me:)  Got it from one of the big, white, two-headed guys, just a random mob.  Judging from Vici's post regarding ring, its prolly a random drop off anything in zone.<br />
<br />
Oh, watch out for the proc/spell the ugly yellow spikey alien-looking guys cast(can't recall offhand what they are called, its late).  Spins you around for 10 secs or so and makes you barf IRL:P  <br />
<br />
A real bitch when pulling and you don't have the hps/AC to tank well there.<br />

Fun place though:)<br />

Sorry i have to disagree with you on that,Rangers,Bards make best pullers since they can track down , and know what in the vicinity of them that can kill em and how close they are,SK's yeah we can FD but that slows down the pulling<br />
<br />
And i like to make those tree huggers and fiddle players work for their keep,<br />
I would ma/mt and get snapback aggro as soon as it gets in sight, those baku mobs are freaking huge lol<br />
<br />
another thing ive failed to see as a good spot to hunt in wos, where noone really likes to hunt is the Tunnels, with Murkgliders, there is no loot, but 67-70 you can get good exp there, and if youre lucky most likely there will always be a tunnel open</div></div><hr />
