<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nevlo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just made a Human SK, im not new to eq so i know quite well what im doing, well ok no i dont know what im doin. Got my SK some nice lowbie armor weapon etc the usual :) Im gonna get him to 65 for sure and wont stop exping unless i have to sleep so he wont take long to hit the 40s so i just wanted to ask what quests i should look out for. Neriak quests are ut of the question (if there are any) cos to get from 6-16,17 im heading to CB to get some easy exp as a tank :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Putrid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">To me the only really important quest until 50 is the gate hammer quest from overthere.  Darkforge is fun to do, but not essential.  Paludal caverns will give you quicker exp than crushbone apparently and you wont hurt your neriak faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Satist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">you'd be better off heading to kurn's, better xp, plus bonechips.  i have a troll, and solo, i've gained 1 to 1 1/2 levels per day in kurn's.  (playing for an hour and a half to 2 hours at a  time)  then, at 17, head to PC...   that is, if you are trying to got the fast xp route.  from 6 to 10/11, do befallen...  you can stay there to the mid 20s, but why stay that long, when there's kurns and pc?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ranaz Asmogian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Kurn's is the way to go.. bonechips, and it is normally empty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Faulse</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The only thing I can suggest is please take your time, and learn how to play your Shadow Knight.  Power Leveling him/her to 65 is maybe the worste thing you can do.  The art of playing a shadow knight comes from a lot of practice and know how.  If you jump into this you'll just be another one of those people who was leveled too quickly, and doesnt know how to play there class.  And trust me there are a lot of those out there.</div></div><hr />
