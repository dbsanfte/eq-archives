<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">August, 11th Update 3:00pm<br />
<br />
- Wake The Dead code has changed to allow for future improvements. You shouldn't notice any changes but please /bug if you do.<br />
<br />
- Changed proc'ing so that you can now proc for an item and from a contact innate buff in the same round.<br />
<br />
- The switch to Aerin Dar's lair now has floor collision. You should no longer fall inside of it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not sure if I am reading it right but we can now proc our inate buff in the same round as an item proc?<br />
<br />
At least on test</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">:)  :)  :)  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Parasite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Win!1<br />
<br />
But... Is an &quot;Item proc&quot; the augment proc or the proc on the weapon itself? Or both?. :confused:<br />
Well.. anyway, slight improvement is better than none at all, so won't complain. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kamiken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">the only thing I can think of now is mobs procing 2 procs off one swing now.....I can definately see them adding that for kicks and giggles<br />
<br />
mobs first proc 4k dd -350 chromatic resists<br />
mobs second proc 2k unresistable<br />
<br />
while hitting for 3k+<br />
<br />
I can just see one unlucky round dropping any tank and I wouldn't put it beyond them to do it.<br />
<br />
But heck if I can proc off an item and an imbue in one swing I don't mind at all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I can't think of alot of mobs that self-buff contact procs...<br />
<br />
What I'm curious to hear though is how the proc rates for us end up parsing out on our self-buffed ones now, it's not hard to imagine the rate getting screwed up in this change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shredderr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I didn't read it that way at all. It kept telling me to burn things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I am having an heart attack! That will solve everything related to WA that benefits everyone!! We asked for re-order proc sequence but this one is EVEN better!! Innate proc is now fully independent from weapon proc!! Means our innate won't even get affected or reduced in frequency as WA goes up.  Cannot wait for it!! With or without WA, our innate proc will just stay the same...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">yep...happy here...now we just need to ask for a AA for <br />
<br />
Self Imbued Proc Affinity.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Rueeliar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">What I'm curious to hear though is how the proc rates for us end up parsing out on our self-buffed ones now, it's not hard to imagine the rate getting screwed up in this change.<br />
<br />
Good question.  Hopefully, it will be at a proper rate, and not at some fubared bugridden rate like MC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Elkar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Wondering here...if WA does affect innate procs, (i.e. innates proc 50% more with WA5, less the times weapons proc first), but now is a seperate check NOT affected by WA5, we could actually see a mathematical decrease in the number of innate procs.<br />
<br />
Is the assumption correct on WA currently affecting innate procs?  We don't know if the second innate check will use a WA modifier or not, but could run some math (probability, uggg) to figure it out.<br />
<br />
But of course, you'd have the advantage of 2 procs possible in a round, which would probably be worthwhile regardless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Vaclav</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">WA is supposed to get a 20% increase per level I thought?<br />
<br />
And yes, currently, due to the coding on &quot;proc order&quot; and the limitation of 1 proc per swing WA reduces combat innate procs - which I'm 99% sure don't get effected by WA.<br />
<br />
&quot;Proc Order&quot; is:<br />
1. Weapon Proc - Natural one<br />
2. Weapon Proc - Augment<br />
3. Self Imbue Proc Buff<br />
*4. Imbue Proc Buff - Katta's Song that no bard in their right mind ever mems.<br />
<br />
Note, 4 is a guess - I know the order applies to the other 3 for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Krushum Gudended</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">wa does not currently affect innate processes<br />
<br />
unlinking procs on swings only benefits us</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Parasite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">WA5 does not affect the SK self-buff procs.<br />
Easy to test/parse with a weapon like Lance of the Flame Knight that doesn't have a proc..<br />
And I didn't see any upgrade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>vilesoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Very cool....I woud definately start using my sword of the crypt creeper more often if that's the case.  having a chance of a 50hp/50mana tap in one round is very nice :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Now the question arises, assuming that they don't change this, when will it go live?  At the next big patch, which could be a month away when OoW goes live?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>cames</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I have checked my parses for the last couple of nights.<br />
<br />
Have not seen any double proces.  Has anybody seen 1?</div></div><hr />

<br />

Checked mine as well, didn't see any.  Was running with Mace of Dark Glory (procs knight's blessing) and MC.  111 minute parse (LDoN+30 minutes of named hunting after the win).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Rueeliar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Probably because the changes were on Test and not on Live servers?<br />
<br />
If you want to test, use a slow as hell weapon with an innate proc (Y HALO THAR EARTHSHAKER) and slap a cheap 40 point LDoN aug proc in it (there's one in Tak), start a parse, and walk away for a few hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Hehe, of course its only on test. Just wait a little longer before it goes live. I don't see reason why it won't go live.. Sorry to see you wasting time on parsing for nothing. :D Also, double proc only happens if you have imbued proc + either innate weapon proc or aug proc. Aug proc+innate weapon proc won't proc at the same time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Manslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Except that wouldnt do anything since both are weapon procs.  Innate procs are referring to procs from buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Noctix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Sorry to see you wasting time on parsing for nothing. :D <br />
Eh, I had already done the parse, so I only wasted about 3 seconds glancing at the procs.  Oh well, hopefully it goes live soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Eh, I had already done the parse, so I only wasted about 3 seconds glancing at the procs.  Oh well, hopefully it goes live soon.<br />
<br />
I would expect this change to go live (if it does end up going live, which I hope it will) no earlier than the Omens of War release, which looks to be the next patch in September.</div></div><hr />

Which of the 47 OOW patches do you expect it to show up in?<br />
<br />
 :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Rueeliar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I was never implying that slapping an aug proc in a weapon was to see the augment proc and the weapon proc going off at the same time.  It's to double the chances of seeing a proc-buff going off at the same time as either of those.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Heh, I expect it goes live in next patch. Cuz once it hits on test server, it usually won't stay long before going live.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Which of the 47 OOW patches do you expect it to show up in?<br />
<br />
 :D<br />
<br />
I expect it'll be put into the first patch, removed in the third, reinstated in the twelfth, tweaked downward in the twentieth, and finally stabilize around thirty-three.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>vilesoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">OOW can eat blue sausage.  Not buying it until they fix all the retarded shit they have ignored for the last few years.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agreed. Hopefully enough people will do the same thing to give SoE some initiative to actually work shit out, too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Omens will be the best selling expansion yet. Those that don't buy it will end up quitting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">I know it sounds terrible to say so, but I'll be getting Omens regardless of tanking fixes, aa fixes, spell scaling, etc.  I'd need the level increases and new aa's (regardless of cost) as my only way to increase in power.  Not to mention as one of the few ways available to me and my guildmates to progress through older content...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Belyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Without question the 5 levels added in pop trivialized alot of content.  Im sure the same will be true for omens.</div></div><hr />
