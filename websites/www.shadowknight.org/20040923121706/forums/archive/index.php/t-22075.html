<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Svartrot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I might be imagining it but has anyone noticed of fear aggro works as normal in Qvic?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Wait until Inkuta.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What do you mean works as normal?<br />
<br />
Fear works great in Qvic. I tanked a M'Sha last night just using Fear and a HEP.<br />
<br />
In Uqua it does not work at all. Not even a message.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Im still on the fence about Fear in qvic+.  Just cant bring myself to get rid of it.  Even darkness lines are lower relative agro these days.  Ranger, paladins, warriors are all blowing us away on snap and long term agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Svartrot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I probably just had a bad aggro day. What I meant was I had problems getting aggro with fear. I got plenty aggro from snares, but that's not much help when I want to do no damage OT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Avryce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">For some reason I want to say fear works in uqua before the room that's right before barxt (yes I suck at explaining!)  I know those mezzable ghosts and the ones in barxt event don't respond at all to fear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Askeer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Fear's never worked for me anywhere in Uqua (maybe some mobs I didn't test fear on tho, since I removed the spell from my Uqua set). I had a hard time figuring out why I wasn't aggroing at all on those traps at first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Avryce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Maybe it's just the spawned ghosts that it doesn't work on and that's why I'm thinking that about the door.  I usually used spears on the traps to tag before they moved around corners etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">taunt~~~:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Svartrot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Did my monthly terror of thule test in qvic that day. One mob loose on a large pull headed for healers.<br />
<br />
Taunt - you have failed<br />
Terror - nothing happens<br />
Taunt - you have failed<br />
Terror - nothing happens<br />
...<br />
<br />
After the third or 4th or something terror cast and taunt fail a paladin stunned it and got aggro.<br />
<br />
We'll be there again today, I'll give fear another go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kizzestra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">/Aggro Spell_01<br />
/Taunt<br />
/Proc<br />
/Disarm<br />
/Proc<br />
/Bash<br />
/Proc<br />
<br />
Usually more than does it for me... even pallies can't keep mobs off me.<br />
<br />
Weapon Affinity 5, self buff proc and a weapon with 2 procs is teh win.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">You know, if they're going to make Fear not work in a zone, why not just flag it as a spell that can't be cast there?  It's not like they haven't done it before, and it would reduce frustration levels.  Of course, maybe that's part of the challenge of the zone, I wouldn't know since I haven't been there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Svartrot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Kizz, if I can beat on the mob it's not a problem  :). That's not an option when I'm just holding it for a mez to land though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Synapticus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Maybe its not a reduction in spell aggro itself, but the increase in power of the other players.  Perhaps the ranger or monk or rogue you are grouped with is creating a lot more DPS and a lot more procs than you were use to.  <br />
/shrug ... just a thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">That's right, it's relative aggro. Others have gotten more, while we still use the same spells we have been for years. Our spells still can draw aggro, just takes a little more effort and a solid understanding of how taunt works.<br />
<br />
Everything in Uqua is non-mes or run speed change immune, so load up Clinging and Festering and you are all set.<br />
<br />
Terrors are garbage, flawed by design.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Rueeliar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Inktuta aggro is a nightmare.  I get it when I dont want it, and cant get it when I need to have it.<br />
<br />
I dont use Fear in Qvic.  I stick with Clinging/Festering.  Couldn't care less if I render something unmezzable, as we're usually drowning in warriors, lately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Svartrot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I was clearing MA in Qvic today when we did the M'Shas so I could give fear a good test. It worked well so it was just in my imagination.<br />
<br />
Yeah, I found that CD worked very well in uqua, the few times I wasn't playing a warrior (like half of ours are on breaks and/or vacation) and boxing Svartrot. The good part about playing a warrior is that now I can tell them they're full of it when they complain about their aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Avryce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">For those wondering about fear in Uqua.  You'll know it's not working when you get no return at all on the message (as if it didn't land on anything) that's what I remember when it wouldn't work I know I always switched to CD for aggro right before barxt fight.<br />
<br />
I think we're gonna be hitting it up soon for backflags I'll pay more attention to it.</div></div><hr />
