<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Luthaer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Its random.<br />
I tried all three as my first pulls and only the green frog dropped. I got 2 blood from the first spawn round, and 1 from the second mob pulled in round two.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vaeldarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">A word of wisdom to any who might read - and yes, it may already have been said, but it doesn't hurt anybody for me to say it here.<br />
<br />
The paladins are absurdly easy to split. Yes, yes, they are all clumped into a neat little group, but just run them off, play with them, etc. They do not path, and are non-aggro, so once you clear with FD you're fine to find a nice angle and play with them some more. I got the first 3 single by doing this, each of which dropped blood (dumb luck). My group was upset with the ease of the fight, so we pulled the other 3 all at once. The cleric tanked one, since she was bored and nobody needed a heal the whole damn time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Croix VorAbaddon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Another thing to consider is that the pallies don't see through invis. Combine that with their normal non-KoS nature, and you have a winning combo:<br />
<br />
Step one: DoT a pally<br />
Step two: FD<br />
Step three: Have someone else around, ranger, chanter, etc, invis you ((Popping with an insta click invis may work, but I don't have one to test with.))<br />
Step four: Stand. Only the pally who was DoT'd should aggro.<br />
<br />
If you can get away before it hits you, or casts on you, it'll follow alone. I've noticed the one frog doesn't seem to cast as much.<br />
<br />
Now, of course, you could just pet pull em easily... but who wants to do things the easy way?</div></div><hr />
