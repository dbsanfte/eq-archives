<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mystina</div><div class="date">12-01-2002, 04:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok lets describe how this zone suck:<br />
<br />
_Ring of Fire:<br />
Some nice stuff drop(ed) from this ring, but now no one bothers to do it anymore since verant smashed it with nerf stick<br />
_Boss:<br />
To reach this boss you need to do some crap quest to get a key, on my server no one ever bother killing him, I guess his loot is not worth to bother with one more time sink<br />
_CoH nerf:<br />
Try to CoH someone in this zone and it will summon a bunch of extra strong mobs instead<br />
_Levitate nerf:<br />
One more zone where you cant use levitate spells, with no good reason<br />
_Burrower depop:<br />
Aggro the burrower for a too long time, and it will depop<br />
_AE nerf:<br />
To nerf AE groups, they put random spawn of nearly magic immune mobs, &quot;funny&quot; thing is that you can get way better exp than AE used to be by just doing normal group in PoP, or AE in deep/HS/chardok/seb &amp; co<br />
_Overconed mobs:<br />
Mobs have insane amount of hps, they avoid/mitigate alot, they can hurt you badly even when green<br />
<br />
When SoL came out you could have some interesting things to do in this zone, now you only enter it to get you VT shard, and you never come back.<br />
This is why it is a perma-empty zone, grats verant on greating a sucky zone in a sucky expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">synnoira</div><div class="date">12-01-2002, 05:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, i feel sorry for the poor bastards in Ring of Valor who went through all the hoops to kill Tashaki and got nothing to show for it. And then is was announced at some point that fixing it wasn't on the things-to-do list schedule. Dreadful waste of a zone, especially when you consider all the work that went into designing the shar vahl/grimling war quests leading up to it. Yet another indication of what a half-finished, half-baked product Luclin was. I feel dirty just stepping in Luclin zones now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kebsis</div><div class="date">12-02-2002, 04:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Luclin sucks.  Although I have been reaping the rewards of the Bazaar lately.<br />
<br />
Edit: although they could easily have made it less laggy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bulvyne</div><div class="date">12-02-2002, 10:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Luclin is a love-hate expansion for me.<br />
<br />
Some of the coolest features in the game, ever, came with Luclin (Bazaar for example). <br />
<br />
Some of the worst zones in the game, however, are in this expansion (Acrylia is almost always deserted on my server).<br />
<br />
Agree with the original poster. Too bad it won't see a touch-up for a long time.</div></div><hr />

ssra and VT, thats it, the rest are pretty lame.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For no other reason then that I like to make my own food. Centi steaks are yummy!<br />

I just heard that inner acrylia is getting revamped during this patch...</div></div><hr />
