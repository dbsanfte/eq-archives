 <br />
<br />
what class do you guys think would make a good partner? I almost always win in a 1v1 pvp situation but the teams aspect opens up a whole new can of worms...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dester</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">really really depends on levels and gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nenadar W'Vern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Probably a shaman.  Chanters could be good for malo and mezz which would take one person out quickly but when I PvP I hate fighting shammies (although a good disc HT last night took one to 4% health :)).<br />
<br />
Can't comment on bards as I haven't grouped with one in 4 years.<br />
<br />
Does depend on level and gear though.  If its low level I might even suggest a cleric.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Maicom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">magelo is in sig, most of the guild is 200+ AA, early EP's, farmed VT a lot but I havent been so active recently</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Darko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Bard</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>UGLA</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I might have to go with a druid.  Druids are pesky with their heals, and their dots land even if you have good resists.  <br />
<br />
Shamans are ok but they can't really land much of their spells if the peeps have decent resists which they should if ur vt'ed geared.<br />
<br />
Bard could be ok with selos and everything they have to offer...but I like goin with the under dogs and would wanna keeeel the evil bard not group with'em.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ghismonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Paladin!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>ourok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">thats not a bad idea... pally / sk duo would be great, though i might go with sk/ bard or sk/enc hmm... sk/shm if you cant find anything else, but if you are facing a duo with an enc and you have a cleric.... well you are screwed =/ UNLESS!! you can slap your partner to wake em up... thats not a bad idea...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Arikash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Bard or shammy.  Bards have everything, debuffs, resists, regen, snare, DoTs, mez, DD's, and most of all speed, you can run around everybody else, hitting them all the way while they try to catch you.<br />
<br />
Or a shammy, they are pretty good PvPers solo imo.  DoTs, slow, root, pet, haste and stat buffs for you, and debuffs for them.<br />
<br />
Pally would be kinda iffy.  You'll prolly want a debuffer, helps dots and stuff land.  But the pallies heals would help, LoH is a lifesaver, they have flash of light which if you can get it off is a sweet pvp spell against melees, and will cause pets to run around blindly, not attacking you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>ourok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">yes but a bard may be also hitting their partner...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tarrasque</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Cleric. Clerics are almost impossible to kill unless you can somehow prevent them from casting a spell, for example by mezzing them, which is easily solved by you hitting them once with your fists or whatnot. Shadowknights are very offensive in PvP and will be able to take down two of almost any class if the cleric keeps the team healed (should be very easy). And remember, if you fight enchanters or bards, use crimson potions (or a weak dot if potions are not allowed) and use a pumice or spell to dispel the enemy if they have a cleric, enchanter or shaman with them. Also have harmshield up, and if the opponent has a cleric, enchanter, shaman or druid, go for these first, and don't be afraid to harmtouch then at 75% (or lower, if you judge them to have more than 5k hp at 75%)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>darkcorruption</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">i think shammy cause they can slow the person the tank is fighting plus heal them AND shammys can buff the best in the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tumy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Sounds like alot of fun.<br />
<br />
I would have to go with shaman also, not for their buffage .. but for their debuff's.  At your guilds level of hte game if your shaman partner can get malo to stick on your opponents, then your snare will land.  If your snare lands .. the fight is over.  Staying mobile is the key to winning PvP in my experiances.<br />
<br />
Now that I think about it ... another SK with super HT would be a good partner /grin.<br />
<br />
Guess it all depends upon where the PvP will take place. /shrug<br />
<br />
Close quarters ide go for another SK, open range .. prolly shaman or bard.<br />
<br />
Oh, let us know what you choose and how things work out!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Toltanus Thule</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Shaman/SK or Cleric/SK is a great way to go.  Cleric/SK is pretty hard to beat too, but if the opposing team blitzes the Cleric and the Cleric panics, you are going to be hurting.  Shamen are pretty good at making people pretty much pay for getting too close, so they'll take someone down with them if it comes down to that.<br />
<br />
If you have a Circlet of Shadow, prenerf, it will help lots.<br />
<br />
Have fun!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Daeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Uhh how about Sk/Sk cris cross jousting plus the ability to take down one person instantly via double super ht</div></div><hr />
