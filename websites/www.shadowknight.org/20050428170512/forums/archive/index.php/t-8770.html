<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Manslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Stamina is generally a good bet for most people.  If you plan on eventually doing high end raiding, Int is much harder to max.  245 unbuffed STA isn't very hard to get even as a less physical race, but getting 277 unbuffed INT is tough.  Overall though it won't matter a hell of alot in the long run what you put your stats into.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>asguth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">bah human arent too bad and if you dont have a lot of time to spend human level very nicely put some points into sta enough to get to 100 sta with whatever items you will use. Determine if you are going to solo more or group more. Make that determination now so if you are going to group more you might wanna adjust your starting stats accordingly 75 agi is good for now dex is iffy i didnt buff my humies dex but then again there isnt alot of room to play with a human then think of the equip that is on your list of practical stuff to get and include that into the equation if you are going to solo more then maybe you might wanna put some more into int. Me myself i put 90 str 90 sta and 90 int and its working great for me because to get your dex up to a point where there is actually gonna be any major diff in procs is about 120 something. and agi is over 110  so i just went this way with my humie and im totally happy except for my dex but she procs alot still. Have fun tho and kick some butt</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Pavil Gravebringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I agree with &quot;asguth&quot; you should determine how you want to play the SK first. Group or solo?  I put a majority of my points into int. Not the max amount but almost.. then I spread the rest starting with sta, str, agi.. Most stats are easly upgraded but int is harder to come by.  The humans start off with well rounded stats so pumping points into int will not really hurt you in the long run.  Right now at lvl 52 my int is around 180ish.  Makes for easy soloing.   Humans are well rounded  SKs. They are not as stupid as sTrolls and bOrgers but yet stronger then Darkies, Ikkies and spermiedites</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>nnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">oddly enough, putting points into INT is a good idea not only for soloing but for grouping. many a time, I run outta mana mid battle when an extra spell would have been handy to cast (one last snare, etc) .. and this is with 140 INT. <br />
<br />
Just my opinion that INT is a fine skill to put points into whether you are a group SK or solo SK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gwenix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">For humans what I usually do is 10str, 5sta, 5 int. If I were to do it any other way I'd have to say split it between dex and agi as those are usually lower than I like.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dondi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">personally i tried DE ogre troll and human SK's only kept the human and im tellin ya he rocks there is no other word for it i have tried every class in eq except the rogue and none compare SK&gt;all. Currently Dondi is at lvl 45 with 130 or better in all tradeskills except tailoring and is a mere 18 days old he's a leveling machine granted im lucky my RL wife made a DE cleric about the same time so i have had a built in healer from birth. But anyways that aside when i made my human SK i split points evenly between int str and dex only used dex since it does make you proc more often and also makes your skills increase quicker. If your making a noob human SK be careful when goin to your guild there are 2 newbie armor quests 1 sux bigtime the other i used until i was mid 20s and got a full suit of darkforge which i have since given away and upgraded to the human cultural armor (very nice btw) and for clarification my human sk started in fp so i dont know if wqeynos has 2 noob armor quests or not but if starting in freeport you want the dismal rage noob armor quest cant remember name of the guy that gives it right off but i will go find him today and post it in case anybody is interested.<br />
    (yes im new here just found out about the serverwide channel over the weekend very nice have gotten tons of useful info there already you all rock and found out about this sitr from that channel)  For those of you that think there is very little roleplay left well im tryin to change that a bit lol most of you may not (most likely will not) agree with the direction i chose but i like it sets Dondi apart from the rest and makes for an interesting story full background story at www.geocities.com/donditolax  good luck to ya all and always remember as an SK we are the best there is the best there was and the best there ever will be<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Moongarm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Its a fairly tough decision between int and sta now that there are actually decent spells to be casting at the higher levels. Honestly, I'd just split the 20pts down the center 10sta 10int.<br />
<br />
Just a random tip:<br />
Get used to being mistaken for a pally from time to time.  My title on my guild's message board says &quot;Not a Paladin, really!&quot; But if I had to choose all over again I'd still be a human.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Cerena Gloomheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I do regret putting points into INT.  I should have put them into STA, because sometimes my little human arms get tired from swinging huge blades and polearms.  I also wished I had a higher STR too.<br />
<br />
But it certainly beats being a stinky inkie. ^_~<br />
<br />
edit:  Yeah! Get used to the pally thing until you learn spells, or use HT in combat.  I had a friend who thought I was a pally for the longest time.  When he saw a skeleton following me home one day, it just blew his mind!</div></div><hr />

Rethinking what I said before I'd put all my points into Int aswell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>ubvman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">If INT is the way to go for humans, why not go straight to Erudites? Put 5 into AGI and DEX (to bring them up to the 75 penalty limit) and the rest into STA. The 117INT starting point makes them the best caster SKs IMO. <br />
<br />
Frankly I think Erudites blow DESKs, Gnomes and Humans out of the water.<br />
<br />
Feare-some stuff (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=399284)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gwenix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Cause Erudites look funny. It's a taste thing for me I like humans they are the best balanced race and have some of the best looks.<br />
Factions nice too I've burned more factions than the more popular sks start out with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jonatt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I like being a human SK in EQ. <br />
<br />
A lot of people say &quot;why be a human in EQ&quot;. Personally, I like being the &quot;normal guy&quot; in a world of freaks. I like being a normal human and walking into an elven city and have everyone sneer at me. I even like being blind, because at least that's realisitic. It's kind of cool sometimes and makes me feel like I'm in the game, (especially with my headphones on)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Points...If I could do it over I would have put more into sta.  As it is I put 15 points into str and 5 into stamina.  I'm not too dissapointed though, I enjoyed the extra strength for carring stuff through my younger years.<br />
<br />
I picked human souly on the basies of roleplay.  The only other race I would have even considered would have been dark elf, and those are a dime a dozen, would much rather be unique<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>jbullions</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">My 2 cp worth... there's really no point dividing up your bonus points being that there are so few to begin with. You'll have to dedicate a chunk, or the entire whole, to really get the maximum effect.  :)<br />
<br />
That said, I'm planning to start anew with a Human SK to work in tandem with my bro (who will be starting an Ogre Shaman). Both of us will be untwinked and starting from scratch. Should I put the full 20 into STA? or should I consider INT instead? Are the SK spells that big of a mana drain? My only experience is with my Human Knight and I have never had a problem with my mana.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Gwenix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Go for Int. Lot more mana... Sta is easier to raise than Int.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Calidore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I'd say to go for Stamina since sometimes you won't have any shaman around to give you a Stamina buff, so you need to have high stamina without the use of spells.  You also won't hardly even need any int while you are tanking Flurry Drakes in N.ToV after the main tank falls hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>jbullions</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I'd say to go for Stamina since sometimes you won't have any shaman around to give you a Stamina buff <br />
<br />
<br />
Well the thing is I do have a Shaman that will be following me around. My bro and I will be working in tandem together. :D  But regardless, you still think STA would be more effective? More than likely, we're taking on mobs with ourselves, and our pets. In these situations, what do you SKs prefer? More HPs? or more mana? <br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Manslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">More mana just gives you more margin for error xping.  While not a bad thing, it shouldn't necessarily be your top concern.  Which stats are more important varies with the stage of the game you are playing, with STA being the top of the heap for most people.  Unless you plan on doing higher end raiding, when INT will be the one very important pertinent stat you won't necessarily have maxxed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>jbullions</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Well to be honest I'll be starting anew on a RP server, and the chances of my character advancing that fast in levels is slim to none (I'm not going to be able to play as much as a dedicated player would). ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Archus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I personally put half my starting points into STR and half into INT.  This was prior to reading any information on this forum.  If I had to do it over again, I would probably change that to half STA and half INT.  However, not a big deal.  Although still pretty low leve, my human SK has been an enjoyable toon so far.<br />
<br />
I chose a human, because of RP reasons, and because they are IMO well balanced stats wise with regards to INT casting vs. melee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Gwenix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Good first post... Yeah humans are balenced which is why I like em so much. That's also a good way to divide your points up. I just wish I'd have put more of mine into int cause my str is over cap, and sta is almost there.<br />
<br />
I did 10 str 5sta 5 int btw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Kimmey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I think the humans stats are even lower then a gnomes.. hmm Maybe I'm thinking of my magician oh well =oP  Anyways I'd say stamina all 20 points of it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Archus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I liked the idea of making a Human Shadowknight from a RP perspective as well.  The idea of Freeport being corrupted by the disciples of Innoruuk is pretty cool.  I actually did the newbie armor quests and got all the Dismal Knight armor pieces... and had fun.<br />
<br />
I made my human toon so that without his gear, he doesn't look all that evil.  He could have been a paladin, a warrior, a ranger, but no.... Innoruuk got to him first, and taught him to hate all others on Norrath.  Archus was corrupted and twisted, and his handsome features become grotesque when his face contorts into a shapeless mass of brutal rage!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>jbullions</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Archus, that is exactly one of the reasons why I am choosing Human SK. :D  In RP, you really can't tell the difference (I'll play mine subtle) between a Human SK, Pal, War and even Ranger until he begins to use his innate powers, or you see his jet black armor, heh. <br />
<br />
I don't know. I want to refrain divvying up my bonus points (the bonus statistic becomes more and more trivial as you divide further). Last time I played, I dedicated all 20 into my Paladin's STR (ended up pretty well since way back then 2-handers were utterly underpowered and the FA did craptacular damage). With the bonuses today, I may just put the SKs INT over 100 and maybe put 5 into STA so I can sleep easier. I think in my situation, where I'm grouped with my half-brother Ogre Shaman, the additional 200 mana or so is more important than the additonal 60 or so HPs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>ShareebMM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">First char i ever made was my Human SK. had a lot of fun with him partnered up with my brothers human pally. I picked human so we could start in the same town...back in the velious days it was quite hard to run across country to play together. <br />
<br />
Anyways by the time i hit lvl 30 i was still very broke and i started to get bummed about my stats, and wished i'd have made a troll instead. I made a druid and that was my main upto lvl 55 at which point i found playing druids just aren't that fun in the end game (for me at least). So after getting a few other chars upto lvl 30. (3 others to be exact) i decided it was time to give my first char a second chance. I had more money at this point and got him some decent equipment and i've never looked back. I'm proud to be among the few high level(relatively)  SKs around and i like my home town of FP. It still might have been cool to be a troll as there aren't many trolls around compared to other races but still i like my human. <br />
<br />
Int is huge once you hit lvl 49+ Especially soloing. But on the other hand when i solo i switch out my sta gear for int gear(which isn't terribly expensive) so i would agree that towards the end stats wont matter as much. If you're looking to go hardcore i'd suggest either Sta or Dex or Agi, as Str and Int are much easier to come by on SK gear. <br />

I'm a human SK,and on Fironia Vie that's not all that common-but I do know a few. Bertox SK's are actually the rarer of the two of us,though there's at least one. League of Shadows tends to attract the odd ones (they've had a host of every flavor of SK and a half-elf warrior of Innoruuk. :) ). <br />
 <br />
As for better cultural? Eh. I'm human. I can get to the forge...if I have to,we're the best faction-changers of all SK's.</div></div><hr />
