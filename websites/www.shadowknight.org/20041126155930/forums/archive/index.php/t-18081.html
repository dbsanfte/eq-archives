<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ashigaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My regular group has recently started trying LDoN on hard mode. This came after some of the content started to feel trivial, (A little!), and going after the named mobs stopped providing any likelihood of upgrade.<br />
<br />
Mild disclaimer - we are far from uber. We've just entered VT, and at the Bertox stage of EP flagging. We are however reasonably well AA'd, equipped, and I think, able to play our respective classes relatively well.<br />
<br />
Group make-up is:<br />
<br />
65 SK<br />
65 Cleric<br />
65 Shammy<br />
65 Bst<br />
65 Bard<br />
65 Rogue<br />
<br />
AA range is from 100 to 250.<br />
<br />
Mobs hit for max of 990 (Yard trash), and 1060 (mini-named). Resists are similar to Normal level, HP slightly higher, but not hugely so. Mobs tend to resist lull somewhat more.<br />
<br />
Only done five missions so far, all slaughters, while we are getting the hang of it. All missions were in Rujark, as its somewhat easier to pull (IMHO). No failures as yet<br />
<br />
Some learnings / suggestions if anyone is thinking of venturing into hard:<br />
<br />
The loot (For our raid level) is great. Drops so far include a FT2 cloak, useable by Wis and Int casters, a pair of 34ac 10str/wis/int/agi 90hp 80mana gauntlets, and a pair of int caster sleeves with 90hp, and erm, some int caster stuff on them.<br />
<br />
A single puller and CC is essential - bards appear to have a slight edge on chanters again, as they can take a couple of whacks.<br />
<br />
Two slowers helps immensely in the encounters.<br />
<br />
Bulwark of Vie is a major life saver<br />
<br />
On a AP / hour basis hard works out really well for us. Average time to complete a mission = 60 minutes, for 105 (Or is it 102? Generally that pleased to succeed, don't note it) AP. Given the restriction on starting a normal encounter having to wait for 45 mins from the start of the last one, max AP earned per hour in normal is ~90 / hour. Not huge difference I admit.<br />
<br />
Anyone else got comments or thoughts on hard level? This is by no means an exhaustive commentary, or written by an exceptionally skilled SK, merely an invitation to share experiences, ask questions. And a way for me to avoid boredom during a (for once) quiet day at work.<br />
<br />
See you at the Wayfarers camp...</div></div><hr />
