<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">WASHINGTON, DC—In an internationally televised statement Monday, President Bush modified a July 2003 challenge to Iraqi militants attacking U.S. forces. &quot;Terrorists, Saddam loyalists, and anti-American insurgents: Please stop bringing it on now,&quot; Bush said at a Monday press conference. &quot;Nine months and 500 U.S. casualties ago, I may have invited y'all to bring it on, but as of today, I formally rescind that statement. I would officially like for you to step back.&quot; The president added that the &quot;it&quot; Iraqis should stop bringing includes gunfire, bombings, grenade attacks, and suicide missions of all types.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Know what would be fitting? Give ol' G.W. Bush a WHOLE lotta guns, and send him in, *alone*, to Iraq to kill as many people as he wants. After he gets in 2 or 3 lucky shots, and he's dead, everyone will be a lot more happy I think. Just my random thinkin' anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mutton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">He needs to quit talking... ;;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Androsulach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You know they won't let him sit in the office and do the job without shoving a camera in his face periodically.  It's bad for publicity and this is an election year.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>vilesoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The problem is a catch 22.....<br />
<br />
If he;s on camera its bad for his publicity<br />
<br />
If he's not on camera it's bad for his publicity.<br />
<br />
<br />
Same goes on for about every action he takes...<br />
<br />
Well, if he runs around in circles shooting off 6-shooters int he air while whooping like some  sort of cowboy on some good ddrugs..that might raise his rating....slightly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Derraj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">its great that hes a step away from getting on his knees and begging terrorists to &quot;stop bringing it on&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The sad part is you believe it may be real</div></div><hr />

The sad part is you believe it may be real  <br />
It's not even sad. It's just mindboggling how stupid some people are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well he ASKED for them to come kill us. &quot;Bring it on!&quot; I just want to know why Bush hates our troops.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway, it's from www.theonion.com...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm a little disappointed that you chose to make a stupid political remark rather than flaming all the idiots (naelyan, mutton, androsulach, vilesoul and Derraj) who bought it.<br />
<br />
I'm also hoping this brings down you credibility just so the political arguments leave the board.  Sorry, I have other boards for those.</div></div><hr />

I never said I bought it, I said that bush is in a catch 22 where his sppeches sound so bad that he's no better off making a sppech or not making one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yes, but you said it in response to a parody rather than in response to any of the real political discussions here.<br />
<br />
Nice try to save face though</div></div><hr />

Grim saw the bredth of his domain and wept, for there were no more tubgirl pics to post...<br />
<br />
<br />
Seriously, there's not a whole lot goin on around here. There's no more board tards like grandam or newtank, fen and keb hardly post, etc etc. So sure I'll post something to get the wingnuts all riled up about the dumbass in chief.<br />
<br />
<br />
edit: Add a WTF?!? &quot;Bush-Cheney '04 Launches Winning the War on Terror Tour!&quot;  ROCK!</div></div><hr />

At the same time, realize that I'm not American, don't give a shit about politics in my own country, and sure as fuck don't pay attention to politics in yours.</div></div><hr />
