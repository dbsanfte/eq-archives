<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Maicom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i just passed tipt.<br />
<br />
my thoughts:<br />
<br />
1) hasted pets are wrong<br />
2) ripposte/parry discs are wrong<br />
<br />
Our group was:<br />
me<br />
cleric(time level)<br />
shaman(time level)<br />
chanter(non-raiding guild, but can handle a pet like you wouldn't believe)<br />
monk(decent EP gear)<br />
ranger(less than bazaar, had 6khp w/9/kaz/7/sot)<br />
<br />
<br />
i don't see how removing defensive from this trial does anything for sk's, unless we were to get some ripposte/parry disc(that's not what i want, slein's mini-defensive tuned for off-tankin, or removin defensive and adjustin innate -DI values for tanks is really what i think would be best)<br />
<br />
someone explain to me the logic for removing defensive? Just seems to be a good reason to get warrior's pissed at us. I understand it's supposed to balance us against them, but it doesnt really. A warrior at my guild's level can still do this trial thanks to furious or whatever, only he doesn't have to bring along a ranger in his group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vaclav</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nod, the defensive change - unless they remove charm - is pretty silly for Tipt...<br />
<br />
It really did make alot of difference and sense for DD in Ikkinz 1 though, and I think since knights commented about issues with both DD and Jhiru they put the same change forth to both.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Madrone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">They readjusted the DB/DI of him too, although I agree knights are in need of a parry/riposte disc</div></div><hr />

  <br />
Did ranger tank with WS?  Did chanter use a charm pet?<br />
<br />
If answer is no, then fine.<br />
<br />
If answer to either of these is yes, then you are a hypocrit, who only calls for nerfs after what worked from them, got them through.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shadowsoal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Mardark, what he is saying is now that mobs dps has been upgraded charm pets are even more insane then they used to be, and they now that def warriors can't do shit on Jhiru ws rangers have taken the spot tanking him, he isn't being a hipocrite he's just commenitng on what now is even more outstanding then it was before the patch</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'd have to agree with the charmed pets is wrong part. My tipt group last night consisted of a druid pulling with snare, the pally (who was the tank, as my hp/ac/AAs aren't nearly enough for tipt yet) stunning on inc, and the chanter siccing the pet as soon as stun hit. Pet would be at 60% by the time stun wore off, and would be dead before it got even remotely close to the group. The cleric was laughing because she started stunning for fun too, since nothing needed healing except for the pet on the odd occasion...... fuck, talk about feeling goddam useless. I think I pulled 4 mobs the entire run (we didn't get all the way through), and of those 4 mobs, 3 of them were single pulls, its just the druid wasn't sure if they were or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Madrone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">the boss dps/spike wasnt raised, it was lowered and thats what was giving knights trouble</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Krushum Gudended</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I tanked jhiru for 3.5 minutes last night, as well as 3 other fights up.  The log is corrupt, and its a damn shame, but jhirus dmg was evened, and is definately lower, while the rest of the trial was increased in difficulty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I've gotten assraped every time I've tried tanking tipt.  Trying to get myself a nice, cushy pulling spot with a warrior tanking so I can get KT flagged, but haven't been able to swing it yet.<br />
<br />
Last time I tried prolly woulda been ok except the chanter was having problems with his pet, which fucked us pretty early in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ashrai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If you can get a Tipt with a good chanter and a pet you should have np tanking it- I finally got my flag tonite as the only tank. Had 3 healers tho (clr, dru, dru) :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">heh unfortunately the chanters and clerics I'd trust to do this trial with in its current state, and my current gear, have been scared away from it and simply won't do it until we've cleared time a few times (we're mostly keyed now, will prolly attempt our first clear very shortly).<br />
<br />
Managing to tank that trial with your stats is nothing short of impressive, however, considering how badly I got reamed in there.<br />
<br />
I'll probably just stay the hell away from the place until I've gotten some significant time loot, unless I can manage to get in as the puller.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ashrai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I got my Vxed flag as tank too, with charmed pooka and only 1 healer (cleric). When you're on the lower end of the stat scale like me you have to really &quot;use&quot; the pet to your advantage. Chanter has to be able to control the pet and pull as well- and the group has to aid in pet control and be quick to stun pet on charm breaks. <br />
<br />
Chanter pulls with a tash, I tag off chanter on incoming with fear,  he sends in pet. In the few steps it takes me to run up and land a taunt off the pet, the mob's already taken a beating. I rarely turn on attack so I take as little riposte as possible, and use fear and CD to keep it agro'd on me while pet and whoever else downs it.  I do have full defensive AA and keep AoP on me as much as possible. WoG is a must as well.   <br />
<br />
I will say that the chanter I've done these trials with is excellent (the best charming chanter I've ever seen in fact), and he frequently does Tipt with 8Kish hybrids as his tanks- so he understands sending in the pet in between my tag off him and my landing of my second agro spell. Even if you just let the pet chew on it for 2 seconds, it's done a nice amount of damage and hasn't taken much itself. By the time a heal lands on me, mob is slowed and it's a bit easier. <br />
<br />
True, it's not the most ideal situation and you can start to feel a bit like a speedbump only. But unfortunately this is what Sony's done to SK's for these Trials.</div></div><hr />
