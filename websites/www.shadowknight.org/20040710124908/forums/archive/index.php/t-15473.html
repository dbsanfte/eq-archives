<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Slagnath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">the veksar quest guy in LoIo eats your items if you give him the wrong stuff. i gave him one of each item rather than 4 of one item (being the 'tard i am) and he doesn't say 'no thats not right' or give you any back...no response at all.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xygoz Shadowreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Now i could be wrong(and probably am) but maybe its possible that since you gave him 1 of each its like beginning each quest, sorta like starting a MQ for someone or something, if thats the case and you had 3 more of one type of wep you could turn it in for ermm whatever the reward is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Corpun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You are correct Xygoz.  After spending a lot of time in veksar, i got really tired of ending up with 2-3 incomplete sets of weaps at the end of a run.  Turned in a couple partial sets one night cause i just didnt want to carry the damn things any more.  Lo and behold i got xp for one of the 2 sets of 3 i turned in.  Experimented with it a bit and it seems that just like any other MQ, the person who turns in the last piece gets the reward.<br />
<br />
Likely a lot of people just dump whatever weapons they have on the guy, not knowing its supposed to be only in full sets of 4, or they are doing what i did: <br />
<br />
Since then when i go to veksar, i have just dumped whatever veks weaps i have on the guy in whatever quantities i have, usually get a few reward messages xp and coin.  Worked a damn sight better than hauling the misc weaps around forever to make full sets.</div></div><hr />
