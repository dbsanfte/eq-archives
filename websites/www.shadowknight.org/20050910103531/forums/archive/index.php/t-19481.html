<br />
someone in my guild posted a strat that said<br />
<br />
I recomend having a shadow knight pull with Nullify magic and immediately casting divine aura <br />
<br />
does pulling with nullify actually do anything ?<br />
if you have done this did u use anytype of ER4 item (ceramic war sword sp?)<br />
<br />
i guess weve been handed the sacrificial lamb job by my guild for this fight, just wonderin for those of you who have pulled him, what kinda of strat did you use. or if you used an sk at all to pull him over any other class?<br />
<br />
Just kinda wanna know the advantages of this i guess, and whats the best way to go about doing it so i dont start off 100% green when we walk in there and one of us (2 sks) has to go tag sol ro.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brael</div><div class="date">01-16-2004, 02:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fire arrow, invul, run to tank, you (rampage) and the tank get healed.  Alternatively the person tanking can toss a stun/fear/incite on him as you invul.  It's no different than pulling any random exp mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DConquest</div><div class="date">01-16-2004, 08:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know why they suggested you pull with  Dispell.  Unfortunately, that won't work on Sol Ro... need to Mark of Kings him.  He rampages so a HoT'd RT is probably the best choice to shoot an arrow and run him back to camp.  Alternately you can use a WS Ranger.  Just make sure MoK is on before Melee engage.</div></div><hr />

Thanks DC thats exactly what i wanted to know...didnt think it would since its described as an &quot;innate damage sheild&quot;.<br />
<br />
thanks again for the quick replies, got no prob HS pulling and RTing, i do it every now and then (of course luclin content and PoP is 2 differnet degrees of difficulty).  I just didnt want to run on the hope that nullify would actually do something.</div></div><hr />
