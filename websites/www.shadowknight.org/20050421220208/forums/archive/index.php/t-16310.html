<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jormunrek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">All I have left is her mirror and the Glowing Cliff Golem.<br />
I know that I can do the golem without much fanfare but Getting a group to go put the hurt on Venril's honey has proven to be a bit of a problem for me.  Especially being in a small guild.<br />
<br />
Seriously considering tracking down someone to mq the mirror for me just to be done with it.  <br />
So roughly about how much does her mirror mq cost nowadays?<br />
<br />
I'm sure I could probably find an mq on my server (Inny) but I don't want to get anal gang raped trying to purchase it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Calamity_Daemon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Dude you on Inny? Well, I wanna get this quest going so if you find a group I'll be willing to join if your in for a round two of Drusella. Give Kuglog a tell ok?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Elrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I recently paid 2k to MQ the mirror. None of us had any idea of what it was worth, so don't know if that's good or bad.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jabbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">1-2 k seems to be going rate on most servers.  Actually, if you just post something saying you're looking for it you'll likely get it for free. <br />
<br />
Also, you might wanna check the monk's board for your server or on Monklybusiness.  Lots of monks solo Drusella for a quest, and the mirror is either a rot or a rarely used thing.  If you let a few of them know, one might save the mirror for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nazgaull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I thought this mirror is No Drop?<br />
<br />
How can you have a monk or someone save one for you if it is?  Unless you mean go in and loot one when a monk raids, in which case you may as well just go raid yourself to get it, right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ashrai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Because it can be MQ'd.<br />
<br />
<br />
The person with the mirror hands it to the Tradesman in Dalnir  next to the forge (no faction needed) to spawn Haggle Baron Dalnir. The person who had the mirror ends up with the Cracked Mirror which can then be used to spawn him later for another SK. IF you have all your pieces for the rest of the combines (and you have them with you) you only need that one spawn of Haggle Baron. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Krushum Gudended</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have a fully &quot;charged&quot; mirror on Inny.<br />
<br />
I will mq it both to you guys for the cost of getting me to that forsaken hellhole of a zone and a shrink charge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jormunrek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Holy shite!!<br />
<br />
I haven't checked here in a bit, been busy with RL stuff and whatnot. <br />
<br />
Does the offer still stand Krushum?!?!<br />
<br />
Your price is most generous and am more then willing to get you there, shrink your big ass and get you there!<br />
<br />
I'll keep an eye out for you online to get this squared away asap!<br />

Hiya Armengar.  My lil ikky beasty is doing fine.  53lvl is being the pain in the ass that 52lvl was for my SK. =/<br />
<br />

<br />

I know the blade is outdated now but it has been a character's dream to wield this blade.<br />
<br />
On a side note it was a very good day to be a leezard!<br />
