<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Noctix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">How about a fast casting (1 second or less) spell &quot;Sacrificial Offering&quot; that causes 100% of all damage incoming on a SK to be redirected to their pet for 12 seconds, during which time the pet parries 100% of all attacks.  At the end of 12 seconds, the pet instantly dies.  Recast time of 30 minutes.<br />
<br />
This effectively gives us a short avoidance disc but keeps with the spirit of our class.  Also, it has some trade offs; our pet could still die from AE or spell damage, cutting the 12 seconds short, and we'd be giving up our pet dmg until we could find time/mana to recast him.  Sacrificing out pet would mean giving up the mana it took to cast him as well as all of the items and buffs he had received.  It also gives us some reason to cast our pet other than adding 2% to our overall dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shriva</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I do believe the title said it all.    <br />
<br />
Why do we have to resort to tricks and goofy shit?  Just give us the damn mitigation or avoidance we should already have!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Agreed - quit trying to create abilities that somehow use role-playing to justify their existance.  Either it's balanced and we should have it or it's not; making it &quot;fit the class&quot; has no bearing on that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Noctix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">SOE likes to have a role-play reason behind their abilities.  See necro rez requiring a sacrifice, SK feign death being a spell instead of a monk like ability, all the bard abilities that copy every other class but in song form, etc.<br />
<br />
I'd love to just get a disc and be done with it but so far, I haven't seen much movement out of SOE to examine our discs.  At least they continue to give us new spells with each expansion.<br />
<br />
Besides, we don't have enough squeak in our wheels to get any oil.  I'm just trying to create some chatter.  Would you rather that I organize a sit-in?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd rather you drink half a gallon of antifreeze and chase it with your own urine, but I guess my opinion doesn't count, does it?</div></div><hr />

Sure it does.  Would you like me to parse the results of this as compared to chasing the anti-freeze with someone else's urine?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rajak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I don't think it would help much to try to make the pet a focus of tanking improvement. Dev just doesn't seem to want to give the class anything, much less get fancy about it.<br />
<br />
Even in a roleplaying context, it would hardly be silly to give a plate wearing knight a tanking improvement disc to match a ranger or frigging monk for the love of common sense.<br />
<br />
You have to wonder by now what the fuck they're thinking.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yes, and post ss plz.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ganlarg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Nothing crazy like &quot;The pet takes all damage&quot;, but making a high HP, low DPS pet that has a HUGE, HUGE taunt, so that for all intents and purposes, it ends up tanking.<br />
<br />
Kind of a defensive &quot;harm touch&quot; where once in a while, the group gets a few seconds of breathing room.  After the pet dies, all the hate goes to the SK.<br />
<br />
Might not solve SK taking problems, but would be cool, and maybe a way to balance.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Or maybe we just get a disc called &quot;Brael's Virtual Penis&quot;  where this giant penis comes down from heaven and takes all the damage for 30 seconds then the zone explodes because &quot;Brael's Virtual Penis&quot; is too big for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Arikash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Or how bout something similar, but we call it Wrath of the Gnomes, where a bunch of gnomes come with their giant dicks in hand and smack the hell out of the mob with them, it will be our form of Furious</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Envoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">something as simple as being able to control when you pet shields you vice him just doing it when you are low Hp could help cut down on initial burst dmg prior to a mob being debuffed... then agian, i will usually kite a mob till its debuffed if im unsure as to wether i can straight up tank it or not.<br />
/pet shield me<br />
makes alot more sense considering they want us to waste 20aa so that out pets get group / raid buffs.<br />
<br />
/shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>vilesoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">ass-fire AA<br />
<br />
You spew forth a massive cloud of flame form your ass, that engulfs the mob so tehy cant' see of hit you for the duration of the effect...the mob also gets very pissed and tries to find you regardless of whats going on until the ffect wears off...which then renders you stunned for 15 mins or until death...which is usually quite fast since you had have you back towrds him for this to work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Culdahl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I guess I could see something like a &quot;bond of death&quot; AA that essentially allows our pet to take a fixed percentage of incoming melee, but that would require too much thinking.  Also, could you imagine the bitching you would get from the warriors and paladins if we got anything like that (or any sort of mitigation for that matter)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Culdahl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Hell, I'll be happy if our new spells aren't resisted so much and our epic 2.0 isn't just a glorified backscratcher.  If you really want to make things interesting then quit asking for shit and just remove the taunt Hotkey...make warriors manually type in /taunt...it'll drive those lazy bastards nuts!</div></div><hr />
