It sorta adds up in CS while farming gems, but in an hour, I still get like a couple of yellow ticks (Maybe 2 or 3 at most), and I really atm need to hit 65 now.<br />
I can solo pretty well, been to DS (OoW)/GoD/Ldons, Ldons seem best for exp so far, just don't always have 30min to get a group and 2h to do an adv. (though my avg. time is maybe 40min (Collect))<br />
<br />
Any help would be great, really appreciate it too :D .<br />
<br />
Thanks to all Sks,<br />

<br />
i remember i did 60 65 in 2 days in pov, if u get a good camp  and decent group = neat exp,</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you insist on it being solo, try maybe kiting in PoV? I know a necro friend of mine got crazy xp at that level, though you won't be able to kill mobs nearly as fast as a necro would. Worth a try though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
try the expedition guards in the mines in the se corner of Great Divide...<br />
<br />
they can be fear kited...and i think are lows 50s lvl wise...so exp should still be ok...and its easy access from POK....get buffed with c, sow, etc and invis and run down and kite...<br />
<br />
there are 6 expedition guards in the caves in 4 spots....the two spots with 2 you can fd split....and are on a 10 min repop....so youll never keep them clear...but will always have something to kite...use fear vs invoke fear as you dont want them to run into and add any of the coldain miners....<br />
<br />
if you fuck up and die....you can drag or summon corpse back to POK book for an easy rez from someone in PoK....<br />
<br />
this is probably better for AAs than real exp....but should be ok at your lvl...<br />

If there are groups, they are likely in Griegs End.<br />
<br />
I don't know how good the exp would be for you, but it's fairly easy to fear kite in Akheva Ruins.<br />

<br />
I can't fear kite much in PoV and my pet sucks, so that's marked out.<br />
No one is EVER in PoS on Drinal, but they are in PoV Sometimes.....<br />
<br />
Thanks for the info, will try it out, been doing Ldons for exp lol.... :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Suckers have so much exp, so I might have to use 2-4 fears and maybe 1-3 Snares before they go down (49+ spell ones)....<br />
<br />
Btw, anyone know why their graphic is silver to me?<br />
They're not a dragon looking thing, they're silver and Murkgliders are purple all around, any help?<br />
dunno if I have to repath OoW or go into system...</div></div><hr />

.... wtf?<br />
<br />
I dont normally ever flame people, but that has to be the most nonsensical bunch of gibberish ive ever seen, what the hell are you talking about?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Venae</div><div class="date">11-16-2004, 10:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fearkiting in Akheva is indeed easy, but the exp is horrible.<br />
<br />
I've been killing junk on the bottom floor of Velks recently.  Mostly because I need velium to skillup smithing, but pretty much all the spiders and gargoyles down there are still blue at 59.  It's slow, but not as slow as Akheva and nice at 3am when I can't get a group and I have the zone all to myself.<br />
<br />
Generally I don't even bother to get buffs (mostly because nobody sells them at 3am.  Crap, I need a new job).  Generally just pull with darkness, run them back to the zonein, then fear from there.  They'll path back down the zonein ramp then turn left and head up the first ramp there.  Usually fear breaks before they get too far up it, but if not I just back pet off and wait for them to come back...nothing has ever added.  To save mana, once the fear runs out I just tank them down with the pet; they're usually at around 50%-60% hp by then.  Nothing runs, so no need to reapply darkness.</div></div><hr />
