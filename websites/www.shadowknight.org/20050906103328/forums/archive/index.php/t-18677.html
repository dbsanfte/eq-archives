<br />
It seems obvious to me to use dark and maybe low lvl fear but im not sure and I dont wanna screw this up so any help from you uber time Sk's would be apreciated. Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Syfon</div><div class="date">12-03-2003, 02:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">your only job is to keep the mob busy while the guild kills emp, you wont actually be killing it or even coming close to it (even if you did, it just respawns). Once you lock agro you wont have to worry about it again as you will only have you on that mob (maybe 2 mobs per spite depending on how your guild divies it up) and a healer to occasionally top you off.</div></div><hr />

So, forget Darkness as it has a damage component and load Fear. Go one hander and shield, then attack off and just cast Fear every now and again for the next 20 mins or so.<br />

The rest of the spells don't matter all that much.  Lifetap for occaisional heals, but you're still doing damage with it, so you gotta gauge how much hp the mob has left.<br />
<br />
Don't think the AC from aop makes much diff, they don't do much damage with, don't do much damage without.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just agro a bit, sit back an relax.<br />

<br />
I use clinging for initial - no matter where my assigned mob is he comes right too me. Terror to keep him on me.<br />
<br />
I go sword &amp; board, bash him to corner him.<br />
<br />
Life tap I keep memmed and only use if slow fades. Zbite I use once in a while to keep my CC group casters with mana. AC tap is GOOD to use also to cut down on your damage intake.<br />
<br />
Then sit back and hope HP or Emp drop something you can win. Boring job but someone has to do it ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Catharsis</div><div class="date">12-03-2003, 09:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Use CD.  Click off any DS (their regen sucks and you really really dont want to kill it).  Have a RGC hotkey if you're tanking a devourer.  AFK for 15 minutes otherwise.<br />
<br />
Your rogue should be pre-targetting btw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Atraleto</div><div class="date">12-03-2003, 11:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow thanks for the responses guys. Yes we have pretargetting. Im gonna be OTin Yasiz the Devourer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paradox</div><div class="date">12-03-2003, 12:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The snakes you'll be mez-tanking are immune to snare/darkness.  As stated already, the key is to hold aggro and not kill the mob because it will only respawn and slaughter any unsuspecting guildie nearby.<br />
<br />
My method is the following:  Equip my Ashenbone Shield and my Journeyman's Walking Stick (extra AC/HP from shield helps, and I get enough damage from the JWStick along with the proc for aggro, but not enough to cause a problem).  I then gain initial aggro with Darkness (which is resisted, but aggro is still gained).  As the snake comes to me, I'll AC tap and start to position.  The mob will then be slowed and then I get comfortable for a long fight.<br />
<br />
Continue to keep aggro after the Blood and Emp are dead and loot is being done.  Your crowdcontrol/lockdown snake should never die.  If you win loot, keep aggro and go loot - the snake will stay with you.  At some point, the Raid Leader will call the raid complete, all crowdcontrol/lockdown tanks should position their mobs near each other.  The rest of the raid will join you and then an AE TL will be cast by a Wizzy.<br />
<br />
Spells to use:  AC tap, lifetaps, Lifetap over Time, Darkness or some other aggro boost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</div><div class="date">12-03-2003, 11:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">doing damage to them isnt that bad so i use cd and zevfeers/tov mostly.  honestly if you are tanking non-flurry snakes and have decent defensive aa they wont be a problem just lock aggro...and always let the slower know if yours needs slowed if it isnt etc....we usually dont need to mez tank, cc isnt that tough on these dudes just keep them locked down and out of the way of the rest of your peeps.  Emp isnt a tough fight in general, its just a very trying fight for all ends of your raid at first.  But have fun its one of my favorite raid targets.<br />
<br />
*edit* doing dmg isnt bad...killing them is,  just be cautious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RandomKayan</div><div class="date">12-05-2003, 06:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Terror, CD and AC tap is overkill for aggro purposes.<br />
<br />
No need to attack it and you can even put yourself perpendicular to it to ensure you won't riposte it.<br />
<br />
<br />
There is Zero reason for your mob not to finish at 100% health.<br />
<br />
<br />
There is also the fun factor of guildies shitting their pants when you go HT the emp with your little Snake pet in tow.:rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kahntun Derstand</div><div class="date">12-05-2003, 10:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used to just beat on my target until it was down to about 25%.  At that point, you can turn autoattack off and just keep a darkness on it.  It's not going anywhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Atraleto</div><div class="date">12-05-2003, 11:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well we all went up to emperors room last night to get a look before we kill him tommorow. We should beat him down no prob. Thank you all for your comments and I will let you know the outcome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thoruk Mudslinger</div><div class="date">12-06-2003, 12:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I always just used dark and terror for argo ac grp tapped and z bite, if you have 2 shads offtanking in same grp z bite is 200 free mana and hp to druid shamen what ever is in the grp healing you also the grp ac helps all offtankers in the grp. <br />
Ya running in to HT the emp with a snake scares a lot of people. <br />
I sometimes would FD after emp was dead and let my snake make a few new friends. Don;t Fd though if you and your guild is not 100% confident in the encounter or you might get yelled at.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Atraleto</div><div class="date">12-06-2003, 11:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Emperor Down. Thanks for all the comments and thoughts the fight went well. I used CD and Fear and kept SoC up with an occasional LT. Lol I had to loot my rift with the snake beatin on me. He dropped a Caen and SoMF. Oh lol Deathly Temtation dropped too.</div></div><hr />
