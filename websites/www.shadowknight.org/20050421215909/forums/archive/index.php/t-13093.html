<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>lanz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">From reading all of the posts located on this subject, Which by the way you'all rock! I dont understand how to get the newbie weapon without being an iskar?  Now greanted I am new to the game, my main is only 37, but I am currently playing a 35 DE SK on Vazelle.  So any help would be great.  <br />
<br />
From what I gather, I should worry about faction first.  Which means a ton of skeleton bones and daggers.  Then worry about the weapon.<br />
<br />
But I want to make sure this can be done with not being an iskar.  Some people were talking about haivng someone make a dummy char, but I thought it was no drop?<br />
<br />
Anyhow any help would be appreciated!<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jackkal Darknite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Dont bother with the bone chips. Not as good faction hits as withthe explorer knives.<br />
Then kill all the iksar maurader/bandit types you can. Your goal is to get to amiable with the Crusaders and Dubious to the Necro's (Blood of --I forget the name atm--).<br />
Explorere knives raises faction with all except necro's.<br />
iksar bandits raises necro's.<br />
<br />
Now for the newbie khurki I did a /who. found a lvl 10 iksar and talked to him.<br />
he gladly make a Iksar SK and MQ'd it with me, I gave him 100pp for his time &amp; effort.<br />
<br />
Alternate is to make the alt yourself then quickly log them on/off to do the MQ yourself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have a friend (or yourself) start a Iksar Newbie SK. After getting the proper faction camp your main in front of the quest mob. I forget his name off the top of my head. Well hand him the iksar newbie weapon then camp and come back on and hand him that bag of heads with your main. Taa dah you have your new sword :D</div></div><hr />

Easiest way to start the quest is this:  Get your factions.  There's NO RUSH here since you're just starting out getting your main up - so unlike the rest of us, you can kinda XP as you do this, which is nice, instead of it just being a drudgery thing.  You can get the factions however you want...  thousands of bonechips, killing the Forsaken Iksar in Warsliks and LOIO, Explorer Knives - however you want.  Take a look at what each bit entails and decide what you wanna do.  You're going to HAVE to kill the Forsaken Iksar for the Necro Faction and honestly, I think the Knife Quest is the highest amount of faction hit per turn in for the rest - maybe you just wanna do those.  Test it and play with it a little.<br />
<br />
As to when it comes time to get the Khukri Quest started, you don't even need a friend to help ya...<br />
<br />
You've got max faction with Crusaders now, so just go up to the top level of the tower and talk to the guy behind the Arch Duke.  He'll lead you into a quest to gather Sarnak Hatchling heads - and he wants four.  He'll give you a bag.  Go outside into LOIO and stay right around the complex of buildings.  Kill every Goblin of any kind you see, and eventually, Hatchlings will spawn.  Kill them until you have four heads.  Put the four heads in the bag and combine it.  Return to Arch Duke Whatshisname.<br />
<br />
Log out at the feet of the Arch Duke's friend behind him and make a noobie Iksar SK.  You'll spawn right there at the Arch Duke.  Hand him the Note, he'll hand you a lame Khukri.  Turn around and give it to the other guy.  DO NOT HAIL ANYTHING.  Don't say anything, don't talk to them, nothing.  If you do this right, this character will be deleted without ever speaking.  Once you've handed in the Khukri, log out and back to Main.<br />
<br />
Main hands the combined sarnak bag thingie to the guy near Arch Duke, and poof - you've got the first No Drop Khukri.<br />
<br />
Now you just have to do all the rest of it. :)</div></div><hr />
