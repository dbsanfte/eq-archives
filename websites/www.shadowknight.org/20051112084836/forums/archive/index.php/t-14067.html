<br />
news flash to all the newbies out there: once you reach the higher lvl of the game you'll find out that the stats will all blend in together, HP, Mana, AC...<br />
<br />
If you choose a race, the only way to do it is to choose one which looks the best in your eyes!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vuloshek</div><div class="date">05-23-2003, 09:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nah, dude, here are some real, valid points:<br />
<br />
Ogres totally suck because they can't have mustaches.<br />
<br />
Trolls don't have any cultural leather pants, and that really hurts you at the end-game<br />
<br />
Humans are the best because they have the highest charisma and you totally pay, like, 3 silver less per Iron Ration.  I made a human, and got 2 opal encrusted steins, and I own you all when it comes to buying supplies!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kenshin_ex</div><div class="date">05-24-2003, 03:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">lol, you have made some valid points there,<br />
that extra copper really does make it all worth it, and those poor ogres, i see some real important facts you brought up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zakton</div><div class="date">05-24-2003, 01:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here were my considerations, I didn't want to be a santa elf, I didn't want smelly fingers, and I didn't want to be the same race as I am in real life.   Was an easy enough selection to me.</div></div><hr />
