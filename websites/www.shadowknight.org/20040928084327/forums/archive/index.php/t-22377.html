After the changes to the hide drop rate I still couldn't manage to get one despite days of camping (other people had seen multiples drop!) but an ex-guildie MQed me one and put me out of my misery. I had pretty much resigned this to the back burner again when on a spur of the moment fear raid on an off night, two Soul Leeches dropped! (Luckily there were 2 because the first was ninjaed by a assling druid who didn't know what it was  :eek: ) After a nervous meeting with Duriek Bloodpool and ganking Lhranc with 10 (omg, he is still a badass, he killed one of the wizards and oh how he hates healers!) I now hold an IC of my own.<br />
<br />
Many thanks to those who have contributed to this forum over the years, the information here is the best anywhere.<br />
<br />
A couple of minor updates to Manr's walkthrough, my changes in bold:<br />
<br />
Lhranc says 'Ahh, at last I can free myself of this prison! Centuries have passed since I enjoyed the fruits of mortality.' He hurls the components above his head where they remain suspended in midair. They hover in place while he chants the words of an ancient spell. As he speaks, the items begin to rotate around his head, slowly at first, then faster as the chanting grows louder, until it spins in a blur. Soon, the room is filled with a deafening shriek that pierces you to the core. Lhranc hurls a coin at you and laughs, 'Here is your reward fool.'<br />
<br />
Lhranc says 'Young one, you cannot fathom how long it has been since I breathed air and felt flesh on my bones. I told you I would show you a weapon that would make you the most powerful of your kind. I said nothing of giving it to you, thank you for your service.'<br />
(Note the removal of &quot;Feast your eyes on Innoruuk's Curse mortal&quot;)<br />

Holy hell.  How could that possibly happen?  A druid looted a NO DROP item, that HE COULDN'T USE?  I just don't understand how that could happen...</div></div><hr />
