<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>muuru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok....i have all the items. I kill the giant camp about 40 times now. Where or how does this spawn pop. I heard too many place in giant camp main build, random place between giant and city, city and OT...help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jackkal Darknite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The Iksar Knight spawned outside the first building to the left as you exit Cablis into WW.<br />
<br />
At least, thats where he was when I needed him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>vinizyts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ok most of the time the iksar knight will be siting in front of the building already! When you leave cabilis and walk into WW it is right on the left. <br />
<br />
If it is not up ... well dont panic take your pet to the giant fort and go whipe it all lol. The giant you need to kill to spawn the knight is in the middle building. The spawn is faster in this building for some reason. Sit there and kill everything that spawns in the middle building. I think the name of the giant is &quot;forest giant&quot; anyways  ... it took me 30 min to make the iksar spawn ... just kill the giant and you will see the iksar pop out of its pocket and run to the city ... he will run and sit at its usual spot. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Amphitryon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">yes, if he is popped, he will sit at outside the Cabilis gates and not go anywhere<br />
<br />
but, if he is not up and spawned out by the giant fort, he can wind up in a varity of places between Cabilis and the fort (hes KOS to most folks so will go chasing after people camping the fort and gets himself killed often) same happens to Alchemist Granika unfortunately.<br />
<br />
hes up more than he used to be though since the giant fort isnt that popular these days (forest loops just arent 'in' anymore I guess)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jobrill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">He's part of the warrior epic too, so he runs out to a certain place sometimes. Also, He falls under the world a lot.<br />
<br />
Get a tracker out there. If they can track him but can't find him, he prolly fell under the world. Get a Guide/GM to respawn him, or if they refuse, wait for a patch, He'll prolly be up just after the patch np.</div></div><hr />
