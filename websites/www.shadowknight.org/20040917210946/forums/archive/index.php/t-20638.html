<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ogrukk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am thinking about doing my AAs in this order:<br />
<br />
<br />
Innate Run Speed 3<br />
Innate Metabolism 3<br />
(6 in general)<br />
<br />
Combat Agility 2<br />
Combat Stability 1<br />
Natural Durability 1<br />
Spell Casting Fury 1<br />
(that makes 12 in archtype)<br />
<br />
Unholy Steed (I know this is not all that, but dammit, its cool)<br />
Physical Enhancement<br />
<br />
Combat Agility 3<br />
Combat Stability 3<br />
Natural Durability 3<br />
<br />
Improved Harm Touch<br />
Unholy Touch 3 (if I understand this one correct, it obviates the need for SCF &gt; 1 for harm touch, correct?)<br />
Touch of the Wicked 3<br />
<br />
other stuff (too far out to plan yet)<br />
<br />
Thats a ton of points, but does that look like the right order of things?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">&gt;Innate Run Speed 3<br />
&gt;Innate Metabolism 3<br />
&gt;(6 in general)<br />
<br />
Either innate metabolism or the regen 3, your pick.  regen 3 better for low levels, innate metabolism possibly better for high levels.<br />
<br />
&gt;Combat Agility 2<br />
&gt;Combat Stability 1<br />
&gt;Natural Durability 1<br />
&gt;Spell Casting Fury 1<br />
&gt;(that makes 12 in archtype)<br />
<br />
Don't do SCF1.  Do SCF3 or don't do SCF.  SCF1 is too infrequent procs for too little bonus.  If you are only gonna do something to the &quot;1&quot; level, do CF1.<br />
<br />
&gt;Unholy Steed (I know this is not all that, but dammit, its cool)<br />
&gt;Physical Enhancement<br />
<br />
Unholy Steed is needed if you have not bought a chain horse from bazaar, IMHO.  Good call.<br />
<br />
&gt;Combat Agility 3<br />
&gt;Combat Stability 3<br />
&gt;Natural Durability 3<br />
<br />
This makes sense for a tanking SK.<br />
<br />
&gt;Improved Harm Touch<br />
&gt;Unholy Touch 3 (if I understand this one correct, it obviates the &gt;need for SCF &gt; 1 for harm touch, correct?)<br />
&gt;Touch of the Wicked 3<br />
<br />
This does not make sense for a tanking SK.  If you're gonna go and do CA3, CS3, ND3, PE... then follow that up with LR5, ID5, PD3, PP5.  If you are gonna do SCF3, then go with SA3, ToL3, IHT, UT3.  Keep your aa's so they build on each other, not so they wander randomly down different paths.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dester</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Max out SCF before you do the HT AAs else you won't get as much benifit from them.<br />

Dester</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Even though I went the &quot;little of everything&quot; path, Bolas is right from a pure power perspective.  Get SCF3 or dont mess with SCF.<br />
<br />
As for order, it depends on what you want to accomplish.  Most SKs build along a defensive path (CA3, CS3, ND3, PE, ID5, LR5) or an offensive path (SCF3, CF, SA, ToL, IHT).<br />
<br />
I've done a little of both, but I'm not terribly serious about doing things in the &quot;best&quot; order.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>nimic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I went with intelligence, regen, and run3 for general.  However, I would reccomend run3 and regen3.  Once you get pact of hate, its nice to minimize the damage per tick with some regen.<br />
<br />
There are ways to prevent the overeating of stat food from what I understand, so innate met. might not be that good of a benifit.  <br />
<br />
I agree on SCF - one level is not going to be much benefit.<br />
<br />
ND3 is like SCF - do all levels or not at all.  The first level of ND3 gave me ~40 hp...  ND3 I was probably up about 300 hp overall.<br />
<br />
In fact, most scaling AA is probably better to max or there is not much benefit to it.<br />
<br />
The AA horse is an awesome investment.  I have a chain horse myself, and realize how convienent it would be to A) get most of that investment back and B) be able to call my horse after a wipe when no cleric is immediatly available.</div></div><hr />

<br />
this is completely wrong.<br />
<br />
ND1 is 2% for 2AA (1% / AA benefit), ND3 is 10% for 12 AA (less than 1%/ 1 AA benefit).<br />
<br />
SCF is the only AA line that you should get all or none of.<br />
<br />
anyway, regarding the original post, after you get PE you might want to just do SCF3... its really one of the better AAs.<br />
<br />
i basically agree with bolas ordering, except you don't have to do all tanking AAs or all damage AAs. mixing the best of each should end up better for less AA. the luclin defensive AAs are a good deal, and i'd recommend them, but its worthwhile to get a mix of other good AA before working on the less cost effective PoP defensive AAs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ogrukk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I see the reasoning beihnd Lightning Reflexes, Innate Defense and Planar Durability (and will add those in before the HT stuff), but why Planar Power?  For the extra 25 stamina, im guessing.  Is that right?<br />
<br />
Also, the reason I picked SFC 1 is because (if i understand correctly) Unholy Touch give you a gaurenteed critical for every harm touch, as long as you have at least SCF 1.  I was aiming for the 7200 harm touch in that set.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">SCF1 gives you a 2% chance to crit for 33% extra damage<br />
SCF2 gives you a 4% chance to crit for 66% extra damage<br />
SCF3 gives you a 7% chance to crit for 100% extra damage<br />
<br />
you need SCF3 for the 7200+ ht.<br />
<br />
<br />
i'd just stick to your plan of getting all the luclin defensive AAs.. that gets you in the 50AA range, and at that point reevaluate your goals. no need to plan out your entire AA path just now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm a big fan of SCF3 early in your AA path (possibly even your first 12 archetype AA's if you're not hurting in the tanking department) on the grounds of it effects so many things for an SK.  <br />
<br />
On defensive AA's (luclin era) - you get the most for your AA on the first and 3rd levels, so doing CA2 isn't the most effecient.  Stop at CA1 or go ahead and do CA3 for the best gain/AA.  That said, I personally prefer CS over CA - same damage reduction over time, but less spikey.  In the end, you'll want both, so it's not a big deal, but something to think about.  <br />
<br />
CS/CA &gt; ND also from a tanking standpoint, but one can't argue with the usefulness of more HP - again, you'll want them all fairly early in your AA path.  <br />
<br />
SCF3, CS3, CA3, ND3, PE, horse, SA3, ToL3 &gt; the rest.</div></div><hr />
