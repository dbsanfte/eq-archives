<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vaclav</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">All of the Forms stack with everything except other Forms - only exception being RZ ring Form doesn't stack with Quarm ring.</div></div><hr />

OMG that was so hard!  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Lucy is your friend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Warmonster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">SJ, your information is useless, since it doesn't answer the question I asked.<br />
<br />
I asked if it stacks with our current raid buff options.<br />
<br />
I will be more specific...Does this stack with Kazz, PTo9, BSS, and CoL?<br />
<br />
=========================================================<br />
<br />
Vaclav, Thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The other slot 6 effects listed on lucy are the things it doesnt stack with.  I don't think anyone's ever called SJ's input &quot;useless&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Vaclav, Thank you.<br />

Anyone smarter than newtank should be able to figure out how to interperet the lucy info I linked, and from that, derive an answer to your question... hell, actually, 10:1 newtank could have figured it out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Khat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Warmonster,<br />
In Lucy, anything listed under Stacking will not stack with whatever spell you are currently listing; be it the entire spell's effects or a subset if there are multiple effects.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Samir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have one and yes it does stack with all of those spells you mention.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Warmonster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The reason I say SJ's info is useless to me is because he has absolutely no credibility as an SK on the Eci server.  I don't even think he plays his SK anymore and I don't believe I ever saw him outside East Commonlands or the Bazaar.  But don't take my word for it, create an Eci toon, do /who all 65 Shadow, pick someone on the list, ask them about SJ, and form your own opinion.<br />
<br />
So now, SJ will prolly try and say something to provoke a flame fest, but as usual I will ignore him and go about my business.  My question has been answered.  <br />
<br />
==========================================================<br />
<br />
Samir, Thanks, I was really hoping someone that owned it would post.<br />
<br />
Khat, Thanks, I will use Lucy next time to avoid posting here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Because what some dipshit on E'Ci thinks is the end-all-be-all of worth valuation...<br />
<br />
If you haven't been reading here long enough to know the value of SJ's opinions and research, then you don't know jack shit about your class; it doesn't matter who the fuck you think you are or how big a fish you are in your small pond, fuckchops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ghismonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Where's that guy with the &quot;You are not your Magelo&quot; signature.  Would be fitting right about now.</div></div><hr />

The reason I say SJ's info is useless to me is because he has absolutely no credibility as an SK on the Eci server.  <br />
<br />
Which reason is it?<br />
<br />
I think you are a moron who got caught then tried to cover it by insulting someone else then got caught again.  <br />
<br />
It's like that episode of Cops where the naked guy is running frm the cops, tries to jump a chain link fence, racks himself then get caught, cuffed and stuffed in the back of the cop car.  <br />
<br />
Was that you?  <br />
<br />
(if it was can I have your autograph?)</div></div><hr />
