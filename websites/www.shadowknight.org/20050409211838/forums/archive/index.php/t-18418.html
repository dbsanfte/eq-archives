<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zakton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well I wanted to ask about 1handers and tanking since I couldn't find a thread that answered it well enough.  I took about a six month break and just got back recently.   <br />
<br />
First as far as I remember the choice for tanking, as a SK, is a 2hander.  The higher dmg bonus helps generate more agro than our 1hander because we don't get dual wield.  Is that still right?  Or should I be looking for a 1hander upgrade for tanking now? <br />
<br />
Someone in group today was trying to say that I should have been using a 1hander so I could keep agro better.  I think the warrior in the group had an anger augment or something cause he kept getting agro.   I was thinking that since I had been out maybe something changed that I missed and just wanted to make sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Atlis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">2 hander and clinging darkness spam.  If you're worried, use a voice on yourself.  dot-debuffers like asystole are heart flutter are great aggro, too, but slow casts and mana hogs.<br />
<br />
1 handers are good if you're healers aren't asking to med every 6 fights.  Low delay is more aggro, but also more riposte.  Don't take raids with 1 handers.  900 damage riposte after a double/triple attack and a proc drop you from 100% to 30% in a split second.<br />
<br />
If you have an insane shield, but not a long delay 1 hander, consider using the shield, some stat boosting 1 hander, and don't melee at all.  Rather spam clinging darkness.  That's only if your dps is insignificant compared to the raid AND your shield+1hander outweigh the 2hander in HP/AC bonuses.  But, chances are, in a raid like that, you'll have a warrior or two to tank for you instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wolff-Kishner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I use both 1handers and 2handers for tanking depending on the con of the mobs.  I usually don't have a problem with taunt.  On the occasion I do lose aggro, it's usually to a taunt happy ranger or warrior.  I'd send a tell to the warrior next time and ask them if they're hitting taunt.  Sometimes it's hard for number mashers to mash 2 buttons instead of 3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">1h aggro is horrible, read my thread in the arena on it (shortly being rewritten and put in archives when i do alittle more work on it) and it will explain it for you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Weapon agro means nothing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Actually, it makes up a pretty good chunk of your aggro</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zakton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">To be specific it was during an LDoN where I became the MA.  The reason being that I was the highest level tank and had the most HP/AC.  The warrior in the group was a level lower but he kept getting agro really easily and I thought it was cause he was taunting.  I asked him to stop taunting and he said he wasn't.  At which point I was told I should use a 1hander to keep the agro easier.  I balked and kept using my 2hander but since he was getting agro much easier than I remember from my previous playing I thought maybe it had been changed.  <br />
<br />
Thanks Brael for the thread I did read it but got the wrong message apparently.  I thought it was saying that weapons with faster delay got more agro (aka 1hander).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dakkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The problem you had was one warriors bitch about all the time; ignorant group members not controlling their aggro.  If the warrior's got a solid aggro weapon setup but hasn't bothered to get himself non-proccing weapons for when he's not tanking, he's a guaranteed menace in groups and on raids, pure and simple.<br />
<br />
You'll never compete with a dual wielding proccing warrior for weapon aggro and shouldn't try.<br />
<br />
Remember he could easily have a pair of low delay one handers with anger III augments, EB or whatever; your weapon aggro will never match that.<br />
<br />
A decent weapon won't hurt, but if you have to go flat out to keep aggro off a warrior who hasn't bothered to bag his blade of carnage you'll be spam casting aggro spells so your DPS and proc rate will go through the floor.<br />
<br />
The distinction between 1 hand and 2 hand aggro is kind of secondary in this situation.<br />
<br />
Not your fault at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ramgar SK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I run into this problem a lot with my warrior friend.  He thought it would be kewl to have two planar stun 1h-ers.  It's a pain to keep aggro off him.  It will be good for him later on, when he starts tanking, but for me I find myself trying to keep up.<br />
<br />
1h are better at keeping aggo, but only when duel wielded.  Something about the multiple quick strikes get more aggro, even if your big 2h does more damage.<br />
<br />
It is my understanding that the best of the best 1h-ers for us can't keep aggro as well as our good 2hs-ers.  We're taking straight damage aggro here.  Simply, the 2h-ers out damage the 1h-ers.<br />
<br />
Back to the basics, keep aggro with spells, not with your weapon.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If you chose it to be that way, sure.  'A good chunk of your agro' is entirely dependent on how much you're casting.  Point being, its a moot discussion.  Use your best weapon.  If you have too little agro, cast CD.  You have to much, cast FD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yes Ramgar, back to the basics... damage done has absolutely nothing to do with aggro.<br />
<br />
Catharsis, the better your weapon gets the more of your % of aggro it does, 5 clinging darknesses a minute is about the same aggro for me 1 minute of melee aggro with vanazir... thats a decent amount of aggro from just your weapon</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sevanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I am a level 65 Ogre SK on the Ayonae Ro server. When I want to keep aggro I cast Voice of Thule on myself (level 65 - aggro modifier), and pull with Festering Darkness. Usually all I have to do after that is taunt once in a while. Casters REALLY have to try in order to pull aggro off me. I dont notice a whole lot of difference keeping aggro between 1Hand and 2Hand weapons. Spells are what I use to get and keep aggro. <br />
<br />
I do remember when a 65 Pally in our group was chain casting stun and was using a weapon with Planar Stun on it. It was hard to keep aggro then.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Burek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Use a 2h.  Your dps will also be higher because you are not missing out on swings when using a slower wep and casting between swings.  I seem to hold agro well when I initially hit it with clinging, then spear, then attack while taunting for a while and hit it with another CD when it's around 50%.  Almost never fails.  You may also want to throw the jolts in there as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ramgar SK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Originally posted by Brael <br />
Yes Ramgar, back to the basics... damage done has absolutely nothing to do with aggro.<br />
<br />
...snip... <br />
<br />
Nothing?  Curious.  I would think it has something to do with it, otherwise warriors would just use the fastest weapons possible.  I'm no expert, and never claimed to be.  :)  I just go by what I see.<br />
<br />
I've seen mobs jump on a ranger because he'd crit with a bow early in the fight.  Similarly, the rogue can get in trouble with an immediate backstab.  I am not saying that those don't produce a separate &quot;hate&quot; stat, but rather that it seems redundant to do so from a programming standpoint.<br />
<br />
Spells ovbiously have their own aggro, like heals, that don't come from damage delt.  That doesn't mean damage is ruled out of the equation.<br />
<br />
It seems approprite that the more damage done draws more aggro, but I like I said, I don't know, I didn't program it.  :)<br />
<br />
One way to test would be to have two people on one mob, and have one person use a better ratio, but much slower weapon, and the other use a faster worse ratio weapon.  And see who gets aggro after a couple minutes of fighting.  Take out any spells and effects (bashing, taunting).  Has this already been done extensively?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>signa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">wars wouldnt want the fastest weapons possible, they would get riposted to death</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Vezax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Ripostes are over rated in xp groups.  Unless you dont have a priest class you already have more then enough healing.<br />
<br />
Ripostes are over rated unless your MA on a raid.  Guess what attack from behind and turn off attack if you cant get behind a mob during enrage.  <br />
<br />
Ive never met a mob whos riposts were set so high or did so much damage per hit that I thought to take a slower weapon.  But i havent tanked much past vt either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kaleeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">wars wouldnt want the fastest weapons possible, they would get riposted to death <br />
<br />
Ummm - Warriors generally use the fastest, most damaging weapons they can find!!<br />
<br />
Damage, taunt and procs are the only ways a warrior can generate aggro.<br />
<br />
To agree with your statement, one would have to believe that haste was detrimental for an MT\MA, as the more haste from spells and equipment that one has causes more riposte damage (which it actually does) and that added with mob melee damage will kill a tank.  It will, but ONLY if there isn't a healer present.<br />
<br />
Riposte damage unless from Enrage --&gt; won't kill a warrior or anyone else for that matter if there is a competent healer on board.  The damage just isn't that significant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Originally posted by Kaleeka <br />
Damage, taunt and procs are the only ways a warrior can generate aggro...<br />
<br />
as brael already said, actual damage does not relate to agro. if you read his thread you'll see that agro is given on a per swing basis, and missing gives just as much agro as hitting. better weapons do produce more agro though.<br />
also, taunt doesn't &quot;generate&quot; agro unless the warrior is not on the top of the hate list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Lunaticfringesk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Someone needs to define what a *better* weapon is because there is a great deal of uncertainty at the moment.<br />
<br />
According to the thread at the Steel Warriors, which served as the foundation of Breal's testing, it was essentialy found that the faster the weapon, the higher the agro, as all that was required for agro was merely a swing--a hit or miss is irrelevant.<br />
<br />
If it is a true statement that damage done does not translate into any additional agro, then the fastest weapon should generate the highest agro of all.  <br />
<br />
That, however, does not seem logical, nor in accordance with Breal's statement that 5 CDs is approx the equivalant of him swinging his 1H for 60 secs...<br />
<br />
Further explanation is required in my mind<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Sandmann Dreamcatcher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I normaly do 1h slash  if I need to tank.<br />
and 2 h  slash if I am off tank <br />
<br />
I got for 1h the greenmist 18 dmg 22 delay and 2h the great sword of the bloodsworn 30 dmg 32 delay.<br />
<br />
<br />
WHY ??<br />
so if I tank I will do less dmg, but    noone care. <br />
my job at this moment is  to absorb the hits and hold  argo.<br />
 <br />
the greenmist is procs alot and  helps the me regen a bit better.<br />
the greenmist is a fast weapon and gives me a chance that my procs come more  often. <br />
i can hold a shield  so this will add some AC and other stats.<br />
i will get hit less. <br />
one of the biggest advantages is i can bash  and interruped casters. nothing is more annoying if the mob heals 3 times selfe up again.<br />
most times I do not even need taunt. and the healer do not have to heal me so often this safes alot of mana. <br />
<br />
if i am off tank  i can concentrate to put out more dmg.  so i normaly cast my dark temtation that lowers my regen for 4 and gives me 25 more atk and get out my 2 haender. so i can do more dmg. <br />
one thing i am working on now is to get a 2 h weapon with no proc and more dmg   me think a bout this war bladed staff but i have to save some money for it ))</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">the greenmist is a fast weapon and gives me a chance that my procs come more often<br />
This is untrue, btw.  Proc rate is a function of time, not swings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>tanadil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Nothing new here, but I have been the main tank most of my EQ life both in groups and in raids. (albeit lower level ones).<br />

I use 2hs (with regular haste SCHW).<br />
Used to have a wieghty polarm, then a widebladed greatsword, now I use a War Marshals<br />
<br />
Generally<br />
I pull or grab the pull on way to camp with a darkness. (which one depends on mana and time to cast- dont want to get interupt when mob arrives and smacks me mid cast!!<br />
<br />
Spear and if in a group with some heavy casters a heart flutter/ Heat blood.<br />
<br />
When mob gets to 20% ish. Recast snare and finish him off with a spear.<br />
<br />
Taunt if aggro drops.<br />
<br />
Only ever lose aggro to muppets who pile in before I have snared or loopy necro's/ shammy's dotting too early.<br />
<br />
Spells really work.<br />
<br />
<br />
On the odd occasion when I am puller or just assisting, then I would pull with a baby lifetap or arrow. Wait for warrior to grab aggro. let him establish and only after a bit pile in with just pure mele. Maybe snare at the end still and patch my health back up with Lifetaps. May have to FD occasionally mid fight as a hasted WMBS can pull aggro on its own merrits no problems.<br />
<br />
AS I said not rocket science.<br />

I am sure there are many complex theories on aggro, but when it comes down to it the basics seem to work fine if everyone has a clue.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Winkles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I would think damage does play a part in aggro production.  Was MT on mission last night and mob turned to rogue after a BS.  Was about to hit the taunt button when I doubled for 180 twice, mob turned right back to me.  Same adventure pulled out my SBS and scepter of lightning and was having a little more trouble keeping aggro off rogue and bst.  <br />
<br />
I have also been noticing something the last few times I've grouped with a bst.  If you try to reposition a mob sometimes it won't follow you.  I believe this is becuase the bst pet has done a sucessfull taunt.  I think from now on I will ask pet classes to turn pet taunt off.  I do when I am off tanking because it would seem that it might give you aggro if your pet is taunting all the time.  Maybe not much but even just a little extra aggro is sometimes too much since every spell we have has a serious aggro bonus to them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Thunderbumm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">As is the case with all encounters in EQ, what you use is dependent on the encounter itself and what you have available to you.<br />
<br />
There are some things that can be done to maximize your HATE generating abilities, but for the most part the choice between using a 1 hander or a 2 hander depends on what gear you own.<br />
<br />
I have a Ivory Etched Aegis and a Heavy Bludgeoner, and I find that this combo is far more effective than most 2 handers for keeping aggro.  The Heavy Bludgeoner swings fast, procs often, and delivers exceptional damage for a 1 hander.  The Ivory Etched Aegis provides my spells (I.E. Clinging Darkness, etc.) an additional 30% bonus to their aggro generation, plus produces solid HATE when I bash with it (It has Furious Bash III as an effect).  Additionally, the defensive stats I gain by using this combo are hard to beat, +240 HP/Mana, 58 raw AC, etc.<br />
<br />
I am an unusual case, sure, but my point is that the decision is entirely dependent on what you have available to you, and whether it suits the encounter and your role in it.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I use 1hs / shield when tanking, 2hander when offtanking.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Backstabbing creates an innate amount of hate, whether or not the Rogues backstab even hits the mob. My rogue alt will often steal aggro from backstabbing even if I get a double backstab miss. So whether it's a double backstab for 600 pts each, or a single backstab that misses entirely, it will generate the same amount of hate. The same goes for spell aggro. I remember during one of the few times I was offtanking to a warrior, I had a critical blast of 3 (yes 3 pts haha) from a spear that caused the mob to turn towards me. We joked saying that it only turned towards me to laugh at the patheticness of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Darknyss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">This is untrue, btw. Proc rate is a function of time, not swings. <br />
<br />
Can anyone verify this?  I thought that every time you swing, there's a check to see if you proc.  In fact, they explained 2 procs on a weapon as checking the 2nd proc if and only if after the initial check of the first proc failed.<br />
<br />
Of course there are some weapons out there with strict time enforced procs (i.e. the Cleric summoned hammers), but I would like to hear some more on the rate of procs.<br />
<br />
I personally use Greenmist for aggro, as not only do I get to hit the mob faster after using Taunt to jump up on the list, but usually I don't miss many swings since most of my spells during fighting are very fast (spear / terror line).  Also the ability to bash casters has been a time saver numerous times.<br />
<br />
I have just aquired a Black Bastardsword and have had NO problem keeping taunt with that monster.<br />
<br />
Basically, pull with darkness, throw on a terror, and it almost doesn't matter WHAT happens next, you're gonna keep aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Search around.<br />
<br />
In a nutshell:  each individual weapon has a proc rate.  Calculate procs per swing over a long time frame.  Take off your haste and count it again, the number went up.  Put the haste back on and get spell haste, the number went down.  The average number of procs per unit of time remains the same.  The average number of procs per swing varries depending on current delay.  The latter would be the constant one if the weapon simply had a % chance at a proc with each swing.  It may be stored this way in the item database, but in practice the number gets scaled with the inverse of your delay modifier (haste or slow) such that proc rate remains constant over time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Hexa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">For aggro 2hers, no question about it.<br />
<br />
1h has its uses, though. I lug around a shield and an adjutants sabre to switch in during some LDON adventures. A stun proc and bash makes some casters and assassination targets easier to kill. Gotta hate CHing mobs..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>DConquest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I've seen too much evidence of DPS being related to aggro to really write it off.   I know 2h weapons have an innate aggro bonus per swing, but think of how many more swings duel wield classes get... and yet it's relatively easy to keep agro with a 2h weapon.  Another example, I have a twink warrior and I have that 5 / 17 thorn weapon... and my main weapons are that 19 / 30 and LSoEE ( 29 dly ).  I hold aggro much better with my main weapons, even before it procs.  I'm pretty sure it has something to do with swings AND Dps combined, but it's still part of the equation.   <br />
<br />
Back to the topic at hand.  I've found that it is true that 1h weapons are far less aggro then 2h weapon.  Even with my GEA I used to find that I'd lose aggro at times.  Easy fix though, I got a 100 dd + stun Strike of Ykesha aug and not a problem since.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Kanigit007</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">&lt;-- has a rogue i borrow occasionally<br />
<br />
<br />
BS damage does matter - ALOT<br />
<br />
if i double or quad for 65 pts it not nearly an attention getter to the mob if i quad for 550, (which is over 2k in a blink - and normally takes an SK 6-10 sec to regain agro)<br />
<br />
Damage DOES matter - however, SPEED also matters.<br />
<br />
try to look at it this way.... Melee Agro = (Z+damage dealt)x(Number of Swings), where Z is the innate agro of a swing of that type of weapon (which is further based on the weapons base delay)<br />
<br />
Haste increases your swings and therefore you get more Z and Damage - which makes you produce more agro... etc.<br />
<br />
We dont know how big a number Z is.<br />
<br />
However, for agro generating purposes I'm guessing damage dealt is on a 1 to 1 basis, as Healing is on a 1 to 2 basis.<br />
<br />
So, to a point = your agro is dependant on the number of swings you get.<br />
<br />
-<br />
Snare is HUGE agro - as is our Jolt line (but i never use them).<br />
<br />
As tank i never have trouble holding agro unless its a paly trying to be MT</div></div><hr />

now if you are gonna be casting agro spells, then using either a 1h or 2h really doesn't matter now does it?</div></div><hr />
