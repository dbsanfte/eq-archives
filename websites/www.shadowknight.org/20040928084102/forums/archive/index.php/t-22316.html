<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kemora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Maybe I missed the boat or something...<br />
<br />
But i've talking with guildmates about this, we've all noticed IHT doing around 1500 - 2000 less damage then it used to. I used to crit for around 9500 everyone time with ID4. I've recently upgraded to jointed scale, and even with a bard singing muse/trusik I have yet to hit even 8000. While i'm the only SK in the guild with JSGs, the others also noticed that they usually only do around 7200.<br />
<br />
Either we're all having really crappy luck, or it seems like IHT was changed at some point...</div></div><hr />

bard songs and unholy aura do not stack, btw.</div></div><hr />

I'd say the average damage done by our &quot;big&quot; HT has decreased in the past couple of months or so, I think I've had 1 HT land for 9k+ in this time. Compared to the consistently high damage I was seeing (8500+) on mobs just after the change went live. Also, I seem to recall an awful lot of people claiming to have had HT hit for more than 9720 while grouped with a bard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">claim or not it doesn't happen.<br />

rizlona's call of flame, and other bard songs are like this:<br />
1:  Increase Spell Damage by 15% <br />
Short Buff Box: Yes <br />
<br />
unholy aura disc is like this:<br />
1:  Increase Spell Damage by 50%<br />
Short Buff Box: Yes<br />
<br />
so, they have the same effect in the same slot as the same buff type... so they don't stack.<br />
<br />
my past few harm touches with id4 and UA have been for:<br />
<br />
7668<br />
9432<br />
7524<br />
7920<br />
8568<br />
9288<br />
<br />
with max AA the harm touch works like this: 3600 * (random 1-50 unholy aura focus + improved damage type focus) + 3600 critical.<br />
<br />
with the AA backbone  change patch it could have changed in some fashion, but i doubt it. the unholy aura disc hasn't been changed on lucy, and i've still broken 9k a few times since patch and even gotten a 9720 one since the patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think they adjusted it shortly after the disc change, seemed like I was getting 9k HT's a lot then, but I could be wrong.  I'm 99% confident they haven't done anything with it since at least dec-january.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Oberyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">... a 9500 about 3 days ago *shrug*, and a few low ones.<br />

I'd just chalk it up to RNG I think.<br />

You contradict yourself here. ID4 is on the same slot as Rizlonas and Unholy Aura. So either you have nothing stacking at all, which can by proven wrong with turning ID on and off, or your assumption of Rizlonas not stacking is false.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Stryph</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">As far as I remember Bard songs stack with UH but not with ID. And the changes to HT did come when they screwed around with all the discs. We use to do I think it was like 9200ish without bard songs. Now we get a new max of about 9875 but with a fluxing between 7500 and 9875 instead of hitting for the same amount every time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
unholy aura and rizlona's are both buffs, focus effects are worn. worn &amp; buff stack, two buffs do not stack. if you don't believe me you can do a search on graffe's regarding their focus effect type buff iceflame of e'ci.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Saruton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I would look up Graffe's if Iceflame and Unholy Aura would be the same typ, which they are not. The only thing i see about UA is that it is not a Song, yet i dont see where i can find anything about the nature of UA and it beeing a buff. Iceflame is listed as Focus Spells if you want to look up the category at Lucy. UA is listed as Unknown hence i would say it is not a Focus Spell ergo there is nothing that lets me believe that ID 4 and UA would not stack. The other thing is that UA is a discipline and has its own window hence i would say that they stack as the very nature of those two Effects is different. UA was never regarded as buff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Blackstone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Its not changed.<br />
<br />
I did 10044 just the other day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Vermadas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Whether you believe it or not, window is right, UA and the Rizlona line of bard songs stopped stacking when they implemented the disc changes.  It became apparent pretty early when people were posting their new HT numbers and not one person surpassed the 10080 mark (or whatever max HT was possible with their declared focus.)  If anyone can post a screenshot of a HT above 10080 (assuming they don't add an upgraded encompassing DD focus in Tacvi and beyond,) then there's your contradiction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Rhumba_Kween</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Harmtouches have always been really streaky. I've been using ID4 for quite awhile, and I'll still go weeks with no HT's over 9k. But I was noticing last night that for that last week, all of my HT's have been around 9500. I was going to ask if they'd been adjusted up. :) So I guess we are all just experiencing streaks right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kemora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Guess my luck just sucks :)<br />
<br />
Then again we had to kill inny like 7 times before he dropped gauntlets for me and I think we did Glorification four times before JSG dropped, so i shouldn't be surprised :p<br />
<br />
Thanks for the feedback guys, I'll go attempt to cyber the RNG and see if we can kiss and make up!</div></div><hr />
