<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dkhar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know my idea is a little overpowering but I don't know crap about number crunching or how much of an effect such things as this would have on the game, but here goes. We're shadowknights, we get things like shadowstep, Gather Shadows and Harmtouch. With the new mitigation and hitpoints warriors have gotten and the gap it has left between our classes, something must be done. So I thought maybe we should get something unique to our class which lies within the &quot;shadow&quot; boundaries of RP. A skill which would turn our forms into a materialized shadow sorta, making us harder to hit. Maybe the devs will see it and bring it in so feel free to flame me or add an idea of your own to make our class the tanking ability it deserves while still keeping it unique to our class.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Stattic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ah,,, a cool idea.<br />
<br />
If it were me I would make it a Proc spell.<br />
Once it procs then we would poof into a shadow form like you were saying,<br />
<br />
Would have to have some NEGS on it though or else we would be jamming hehe. <br />
Kinda make it liek a RUNE buff/spell or evena mirror spell Hell even a fleeting Fury.<br />
<br />
Like -20 to STR and Attk. or something but ya it would be like a Fleeting spell. so it would last 20 secs or something but we would be able to have it proc throught the fight.<br />
<br />
<br />
Would be a cool speel around 52,<br />
It could be a series of spells the improve as we get Older.<br />
<br />
Anyway a great idea<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Useless... and not even close to overpowered (or even correct for fixing us where we have problems right now)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dkhar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Why would it be so useless ? They don't want to give us higher mitigation, that's obvious. So why not evasion ? Is parry and dodge not a big enough factor while tanking to lessen damage over time enough to equal that of a warriors mitigation ? If they don't hit us as much, wouldn't that account for less damage ? Would we need the actual Evade skill for any sort of noticeable difference to come into effect ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">+25% dodge and parry wouldn't have a very large impact on damage avoidance, since we don't dodge and parry all that much as is.<br />
<br />
I like the idea of using some type of spell to solve our tanking problems though.  Not sure if it's doable or not with respect to game balance, however.  What would make us 'balanced' on some mobs would be crazy out of balance on others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>shadowblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">From a Rp perspective its a nice idea, although it would have to be far more powerful than what you propose</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If we were shade form we could only get hit by mobs wielding &quot;magic&quot; weapons, right?  Might means alot of designating mobs and wepons magic (remember a monk's bare fists become macig at one point).  Might make it so some mobs/zones couldn't melee damage us.  Prolly give us a resists decrease to make us more vulnerable there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Belyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Unless something changed that i dont know about sks tanking abilites vs lvl 1 to 64 encounters are fine.  Its the new god encounters that warriors where adjusted for and we where not.  Not to mention if you want to do any named in those one group encounters, you must have definsive disc to tank toe to toe, whatever it was intended to be was necessary for raid lvl bosses only....till now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Stattic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Was thinking of a way to make us more unique in pulling. What about being able to hit a spell/AA &quot; SHADOW FORM&quot; that would give us a way to encounter a mob (much like the rouge's HIDE SNEAK.)without being seen but will alow us to attack and run off with the mob without any agro from mobs close by. Or a reduction in agro. Make it like we hit SH and use a bow to pull a single from a group. The mob runs in the direction of the puller(SK) and then we remove the spell and gain agro or pass it to the MT. Make the spell very short in duration like 5-6 sec long. And make it have a 30- 45 sec recast time. Make it so it will go away if u cast a spell but not if you use range attack or attack(STAYING IN THE SHADOWS KINDA THING)<br />
<br />
Just thought it was a cool idea to the term SHADOW FORM. Fits well with our Class title too.<br />
<br />
Yes I know this is not a fix to our problems that we have with tanking.<br />
Just a fun idea to help us do something new.<br />
I can se us never getting any new Skill/spells to help us do anyhitng new.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Mortre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">maybe instead of a 25% increase to those stats, say a 25% chance to dodge, parry, and reposte all incoming melee dmg.  I'm not a number cruncher so I can't really come up with a good example % but shrug.  I would figure though that would give the SK similar mitigation to defensive albeit alot spikier.  Maybe half SK's outgoing mellee dmg or some other downside just to help keep the warriors happy.  Not like SK's really count on mellee dmg to keep agro anyway.  Hell, maybe even just make it a buff that goes off ala Divine intervention when you HP drops to a certain point(with a heal component of course, wont help any if it goes off then you die .5 seconds later)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Warriors were adjusted for all content, and not just at level 65+. God was tuned for the new warrriors, but that doesn't take away their new advantages earlier in the game. Yes we are still just as good as were were, but the warriors are now noticably better, with none of their former drawbacks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Razs Meows</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Why not give SK's a self only DI?  Give it a long recast time, about 20 minutes? (so you can't just wade around using it)<br />
<br />
Can give it a nice cheesy name like &quot;Return of The Hateful&quot; or something.  Some encounters it'd help with, some it wouldn't.  If you make it stack with normal DI, you could essentially get a 3rd chance :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Synapticus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">1)  Trash the illusion<br />
2)  Instead of + 25dodge --&gt;  +25%-40% straight up avoidance.  <br />
3)  + AC is cool.  <br />
Aura of pain should have been like this.  I think its been mentioned before that AoP should have a +avoidance aspect added to it in addition to the +AC.  <br />
/shrug<br />
&quot;simple&quot; way to balance against stuns.</div></div><hr />
