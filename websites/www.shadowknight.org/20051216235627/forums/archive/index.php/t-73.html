I recently came back to EQ and started a iksar SK  ( when I left to try DAoC my brother and I deleted all our characters after playing since beta..... don't ask why =P  )   Just wondering</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cephas</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 05:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think mostly all of us turned off luclin models cause the iksar models are horrid for luclin(think godzilla on steroids, instead of the previous sleek lizard, plus luclin textures were phat on an iksar, and those got turned off with luclin.  YAY I look like I have banded again! *spew*).</div></div><hr />

Also if you want to have velious textures show up you have to turn off ALL the luclin models, at least it worked for me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe I'm in the minority here ... but I really like the new iksar models and think they are better in most ways (one glaring exception being the swimming animation). I'll try to take some pics to post on my lunchhour even tho my SK isn't really all that high level :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarkWyld</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 09:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, I like the Iksar models for Luclin.  What I dislike is the horrid pink armor we she-lizzies have to put up with from the Velious models.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neq</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 10:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah that pink armor is pretty bad :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Uglugg Bloodsbane</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 10:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The new Iksar look isn't that bad, I kind of like the new look. What I HATE about the new Iksar model is the animations that go along with it, those need to be changed to more closly match the old ones.<br />
<br />
They also need to change the new Troll models run animation, I hate watching myself run now as the animation looks to &quot;girlish&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varanus Komodoensis</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 11:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Uglugg: Ever seen a real lizard run? They got this real weird bowlegged gait. Sort of what we got in the new models.<br />
<br />
As for the look, the only complaint I have is...WE ARE FAT!! OMFG we need slimfast diets or something. That and the armor is NOT fit properly. HUGE gaps around the neck and other &quot;openings&quot; further enhancing the fat look.<br />
<br />
I still kick ass though. :P<br />
<br />
Our armor looks like drek as well. What's with this marble green and white motif? UGH...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Utterance Unholy</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 11:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">New Look vs Old Look, IMHO...<br />
<br />
Old look iksars are *too* skinny, look a little gangly<br />
.... batman melee helm look is a lttle silly.<br />
.... sometimes they look like they have a silly grin<br />
.... dreadscale looks great<br />
<br />
New look iksars are *too* thick, look squat<br />
.... no melee helms, which make's sk look less like knights<br />
.... look more menacing<br />
.... rygorr looks god awful, ds looks ok<br />
.... even with shoes on I have claws on feet, that is stupid<br />
.... the animations for two handers are broken, you swing, then when the motion ends, you don't go back to standing fluidly, it &quot;pops&quot;<br />
<br />
I have new models on about 50% of the time just for fun.<br />
<br />
I will say, that if I can replace the rygorr bracer and legs I have with something that looks better, I will leave em on 100% of the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zobek</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 11:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like the new models, but it took a while to get used to it.<br />
One reason why is that with the new armor texturing, we look like we are wearing plate for some pieces.  We also now look intimidating and before, we looked like Gekoes.<br />
I do miss the cool swimming animation, and having a helm graphic, but that is pretty minor.<br />
<br />
My PC can't handle the models, but I like how it looks on my wife's PC.  I'll be upgrading my PC within the month though.  woot!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neq</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 11:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think a big part of the &quot;too bulky looking&quot; problem is the plate BP, it's not just iksar either ... those things seem to just hang off everybody and look all bulky and bad generally<br />
<br />
A while back (on TKW) someone posted a pic of their iksar SK wearing a tree-weave and plate arms, I think that was about the best looking new iksar SK pic I've ever seen  :) really seemed to slim him down a lot</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Railz8</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 12:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah iksars do look abit bulky for how they are supposed to be.  But with the spikes all over em, thats just rough.  I was wondering if anyone can post a picture of the velious custom crown on a male iksar with no luclin graphics.  I forgot what it looked like but I know it looks wicked.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dreadscale legs and BP.  Black Ice arms with Dark Rust Bracer.<br />
<br />
I really like the Luclin Iksar graphics.  The no helm thing is BS though.  I see Iksar in Velious Helms, but no other types.</div></div><hr />

Dark runed, crystal chitin, Will o Inno, etc. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kruze</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 04:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">*sigh*  I look at Rekss pict and think about how we are told 'Sorry there is no room in global memory to have Iksar skeletons for Iksar SK and Necro pets' only to have a whole new cat race,  wizard familiars, new mage pet models, etc show up with Luclin.  <br />
<br />
As far as our new look goes.  I think it's neither worse nor better than the old Iksar model although I agree that the new animations could be a lot better.   What I do hate is the new 'action' stance when we are standing still.  It puts me in mind of the plastic dinosaur toys I had when I was little.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neq</div><div class="date">03-27-2002, 01:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A pic with new models and more or less same looking armor as me was already posted so I won't put that up again, here's what pretty much full noctivagant (PoG) armor looks like on old-style iksar tho<br />
