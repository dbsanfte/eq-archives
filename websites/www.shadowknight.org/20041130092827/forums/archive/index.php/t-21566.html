<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>spanky4458</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was told to head down there with a group for some gear upgrades as well as xp.  What level group do I need to head down there and what drops should I keep my eye on.  Im currently a few kills from 52 and my magelo is in my sig.  Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rorthek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">if you can get the Shop camp the named there can drop a nice 32% haste belt for you, also any of the highborns near the end of the dungon can drop a pair of gloves to replace your hand wraps. (ill post the 2 items in a sec after i look them up)  <br />
<br />
as for the group lvl,. some of the highborns are lvl 63, so unless you have some high lvl friends it might be a while till you get back that far =(    <br />
<br />
But for info a lvl 65 Necro can solo highborn camp.</div></div><hr />

Here is a link to Alla's bestiary for Veksar, for a list of the names and there drops <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It depends on where you are going.  The shopkeeper that drops the belt is pretty much perma camped by a 65 necro, so good luck with that camp.<br />
<br />
The goblins can be tanked by a 65 shaman pet, I expect you'd do ok there with 1 or 2 other people (just watch for gaters).<br />
<br />
The next set of camps is... lord sasil and champion someone or other.  You should be ok tanking there, but none of the drops are useful for you (and probably don't sell for much cash).<br />
<br />
The next set of camps is the rotting peasants, and the kylong legs drop there, which would be an upgrade.  You could do that with a full group, but it might be a bit dicey.<br />
<br />
Past that is the golems (no loot) which I seem to think are about 55 and hit for 250ish, then the shopkeepers (soulscream belt) which are perma camped then highborns (kylong darkmail gauntlets) who tore the crap out of me at 64 but became doable once I got 65 and started filling in CA/CS/PE and bumped my AC/HP over 1250 and 4000 (duo with a shaman).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>StPatrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I personally love this zone. Got few upgrades myself and a lots for guildies (group, not solo of course). Aggro range is very low there and most mobs can be single pulled without even lull (but use lull before you get used to the zone).<br />
<br />
Here is map of Veksar, it is pretty good IMHO<br />
<br />
http://www.pbfirst.com/VeksarMap.jpg</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Oagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I 2-3 box here quite a bit (all the way to Synthrax).  If you're the tank, looking at your magelo, you won't be able to handle the Highborns.  They will rape you.  Not a slam, just where you're at for the time being.  Some hit in the 400's, and at your level, you're going to get feared, and that's going to mean trouble with 61-63 adds.  <br />
<br />
I'll try to find the link for the map (.jpg) that I use.  There are some upgrades available here.   Toughest mob outside Synthrax is the Highborn Crusader...fairly nasty mob damage-wise, and the only one that consistently fears me (which can be a bit scary when you're surrounded by 61-63 mobs).<br />
<br />
I've done the highborns quite a bit, but no drops on the gloves yet.  I have got the shopkeeper a few times, as it's not as heavily camped on TM.  <br />
<br />
I would say if you have a regular group of your level, you should look at some spots in Droga for farming for plat, and possibly some upgrades.  No mob sees invis.  They don't fear, and at most you are getting hit for 200.  A bit less hp's as well.  Plat drops are 10-20pp/mob on avg.  There is some decent stuff, and possibly some upgrades for you here or member of your group.  The named seem to pop a little more consistently here, too.  At the very least, you'll be able to farm some drops for bazaar plat.<br />
<br />
At your level/gear, I'd say you have a bit to go before you could successfully handle Veksar.  It's tougher than Droga.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kruggan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've duo'ed the shop in Veksar with my 62 Shaman (I'm a 59 SK) on Firiona Vie, and the reason I find it easier than Droga is because I hate (emphasis on HATE) spellcasters - especially those that dispell you.  You're right though as far as mobs in Droga hitting for less, definitely.  The other thing that appeals to me about Veksar is how there seem to be more 'safe' spots to pull to over Droga.  Maybe i'll try Droga again - the Kingly Boots of Splendor camp is a pretty good one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Oagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Flame master camp (Kingly boots) is totally safe, and even at their level should result in single pulls.  Just set up in the hallway leading to Bone Caster Fizzik.  No roamers.  Nice 4-5k loot drop (boots) as common drop.<br />
<br />
Fizzik can be added for another pull.  I usually pull the 3 (including Japal), and then do Fizzik's room for a 2 drop camp.  You will get adds the first time around breaking Fizzik's spawn (2-3).  After the spawn is broken...NP.  He drops a nice neck piece for C/D/Sh that's also worth about 4-5k.</div></div><hr />

second: Get a cle or a 58+ shaman <br />
third: Get to camp5/6. No roamer there so you when you get there you would find a camp spot easily.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>spanky4458</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thanks for all the advice so far.  I couldnt get a group together to do anyof these thing yet but ill definitly try and check em out.  I stumbled into a velketor (sp?) group last night and got a new helm on my first kill.  I guess it was worth getting stuck in a wall for half an hour in GD.  Now I can rock the def mullet cause it has no graphics.  <br />
<br />
Anyways Im going to try and get a group to do either of those camps.  Or at least 1 or 2 higher level people to assist me.<br />
<br />
Edit: will I be able to get down to Veksar without something to help me hold my breath? About 55 swiming skill.   And once there can I walk around safely with invis?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Oagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It's not complicated to get through that tunnel.  SK's have breath of the dead (requires fish scale) and bobbing corpse, so we don't really need water breathing items.  When you come out of the tunnel, there will be one undead mob in the room with you.  There will be 4-5 in the next room.  The ph'er for the Feral Lord is the animist.  This is a nice camp to try your skills and drop is the plate legs ( Kylong Shinguards - 39 AC, and will be a good upgrade from your crusty).  <br />
<br />
Mobs all summon.  Get your magic resistances up over 100, or you're going to get feared a lot.  That can be a problem, and result in a death.  I believe Veksar is considered a city.  So you can bind at the zone-in area, when you come out of the water from LoIO.  That will avoid a long run back, in the event of a death.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Daemoness</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">There is a named golem and he is easly doable if you are doing the camp, he drops a worthless robe and eyepatch. However on an off-day he can drop an ID3 bracer sells for 25-35k on average and the normal golems can drop a Razor-edged Shan'tok (sp?) 12/20 with stats.<br />
<br />
Also the big building on the other side of the golem area (the church) has 3 named that spawn around the podium area, one of whic drops Dented Kunzar War Helm (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=65537).<br />
<br />
ps. Oagan wish my Kylong Shinguards were 39ac.. Can I have your ones? you can have my uber 35ac ones!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Oagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">whoops, my bad...35 ac.  <br />
<br />
heh.<br />
<br />
Still decent loot for a relatively easy camp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>spanky4458</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Ok, I got those legs and updated my skills on magelo.  Thanks for all the advice so far and anything else would be apreciated.<br />
<br />
I am also going to stat working on some of those nurga slaves quests.  Definitly the ring and Ill look through the rest for whatever else is good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I like the nurga neck item</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Eggborn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Around your level, or it might have been later come to think of it, when I couldn't get a group I solo'd the entrance mobs.<br />
<br />
Cast a pet, memorize your baby fear.  The first few are a pain to break, but after you can single pull them you are good.<br />
<br />
Snare the mob, send in pet if you hold aggro.  Dot when you can.  When the mob gets to you fear kite it to where the room opens up.  Then /pet back off, run back to the wall at the bottom of the stairs till fear wears off.  Repeat till dead.  <br />
<br />
I got about 4 to 5 percent AA per kill there till around 58 or 59, and a few nice drops from the named that spawns.<br />
<br />
Mostly people wont train you, cause it's all sk's and necros in the zone who fd or die first.  If you see other classes in there, watch your butt and hide in a corner or zone right away, or the golems they will bring fast will just mow you down.</div></div><hr />
