You use aggro spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">One of our most boring tasks in a raid but hey at least we had a purpose.  I think I was on about 10 emp fights before I even got a look at the emp cause I was stuck in the corner mezz tanking the whole time.<br />
<br />
I have seen people unequip weapons or stand when they off tank so as to cut down on riposte damage but I never did this.  I think when I mezz tanked Rathe I drop any DS I have since your tanking them at such low health 2 percent or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Krushum Gudended</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">my guild doesnt mez, so I use affliction haste I CD</div></div><hr />

<br />
I find that very interesting your guild is in the elementals its seems but does not mez?  Why is that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Fuckton of useless knights and not many chanters?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Krushum Gudended</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">because my guildleader is a cleric that uses his own whacked out tactics, chaos tanking is our forte</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Sounds somewhat entertaining, even if... an &quot;interesting&quot; way of doing things.  One way to keep you busy I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If it gets/keeps SK's a role in his guild through the high end issues, then bully for him!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Ok so here is teh plan.  We remove Mez from the game and we all get to off tank everything.  Guaranteed jobs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">And our guilds would still be better off if we all rerolled warriors and pallys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Krushum Gudended</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">the only time we mez on raids is during rathe council, but I am usually pulling anyway, so meh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>cames</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Sheesh I watch the emporer fight from my corner all the time.  No need to face my mob after about 10 CDs and 10 Fears, he is following me anywhere I go.  So, I just turn and watch the fight.  I think we might do 1 or 2 more Emp kills before we are completely done with him.</div></div><hr />

LMAO haha - I know your pain, back in the day with the &quot;new&quot; Luclin engine changes I had to close my clip plane right down too get things running smooth on raids.<br />
<br />
First time I ever saw the Emp' was on a wipe when he disposed of the raidforce and the  emerged out of the fog to finish off me and the other knight TM's.  :D <br />
<br />
Was a hell of a yawn fest, .... used to equip a shield, turn off attack and just spam cast aggro spells getting spot heals for what seemed like hours.<br />
<br />
Remember not ever having an Emp' bane weapon as the components always went to war's and DPS melee, knight WERE always TM's back in the day when we had a role, ........<br />
<br />
Also remember when we got the Terror line of spells around then and Khaunshar and I opened up with them on our Emp' TM mobs only too see them both run away from us to another TM group member.<br />
We both simultaneously msg'd each other with &quot;WTF?&quot;  :eek: <br />
<br />
First and second to last time I ever mem'd one of the Terror line.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Elkar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I differential off-tanking from tank-mezzing in that when off-tanking, I can attempt to kill the mob, but tank-mezzing, I should not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Envoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">if i need to aggro lock hard, i will chain cast both my fear spells, and pray the chanters can mezz it... well, at least in the EPs +<br />
<br />
in places like SSra where fear actually lands, i would just chain cast clinging darkness if you are sure the mob isnt mezzable.  <br />
<br />
spears are also descent aggro, and are resisted like 50% of the time so you can take your chances there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Rueeliar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Spears are not bad aggro for their casting time.  That they cannot be chaincast is why they are not &quot;aggro spells.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
no shit.  tonight i was told i wasnt going to be offtanking on our 4 hour VT raid because the paladins are better geared.  F that.  I took off my gear and equipped the mod rod.  <br />
<br />
this was followed by a punt to PoK and a tell about not everyone getting what they want.  I think i might have pissed off an officer or 2 when i sent them tells about how i wasn't allowed to offtank the mob that was beating on them.  I did this as i stood in front of them and the mob.<br />
<br />
Fuck paladins.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Fuck that - VT mobs don't exactly rape anyone... if a mob is beating on someone it shouldn't, it'd be better off beating on you.  Just do your part and make them eat their words.</div></div><hr />

That's fucking hilarious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>bastardlunatic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">forgot to add that i deleted my offtanking call hotkey.</div></div><hr />
