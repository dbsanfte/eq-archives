<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kranuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I like the game a lot.I have been running around doing different things lately.I went on some LDON adventures and getting nice Loot.At 53 you can go alot of places getting decent gear for newb characters.I noticed I get a lot of stuff and sell it cheap and it really bothers me that nuggets are out there exploiting other people...preying on them in game.I got a ring that im gonna use,I got it pretty easy in a LDON adv.blood guard ring has nice stats and haste on it.No sooner did we get out of dungeon some guy is selling one....for 15K pp.Its bits of data fool!!I have now made it my mission in life to farm and blst prices to nothing.It has been working too.....everyone has iksar scaled gloves....for 30 plat i have 8 shrunken goblin skull earrings for a 900 plat that i sold.I farm every zone i come too and sell cheap.That ring imo is maybe worth 3 k but I dont see gaffling someone in need and in reality it sucks to have a toon and lvl the hard way like I did.Also I bought my WMBS for 1800 pp thanks for the help guys,Im not selling anytime soon but the gafflers have put the prices back up to 9k for it.....greed is the real killer and it makes me sick....just needed to vent...in 10 years will anyone care about EQ and its 15 expansions???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Thanks for the useful insight in to your opinions and desires for Everquest.  We here as SKO appreciate your interest in our community and are glad to have you aboard.  As a value added service to our community, you will likely begin to see several responses to your post using some rather colorful vocabulary.  Members of this community offer these responses in order to help you broaden your horizons and to make you feel like the very special person we know you are.  In the future, if you ever need to be reminded of how VERY special you really are, all you need to do is post a rambling run-on sentance that describes your innane opinions and moral judgements on a topic that no one here really gives a flying fuck about.  We'll be sure to jump right in and make with the &quot;special&quot; feeling.<br />

Edit: Oh, one more thing, stop making up words, please.  Gaffling may be what your uncle called it when he gave you a quarter to diddle in your face, then charged you a quarter for use of a paper towel, but around here, no one fucking knows what the fuck you're talking about.  If you're not sure what word to use to describe such a complex concept as &quot;freemarket economy&quot;, you should probably go here (http://dictionary.reference.com/) rather than trying to sound intelligent and failing miserably.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kyfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just curious, what language is &quot;Gaffling&quot;? I couldn't find it on dictionary.com.<br />
<br />
Also, there's this little thing called supply and demand which sets prices. If you have weird notions and sell things for far less than what people will pay to not be a &quot;gaffler&quot;, whatever makes you happy. But ranting against prices seems rather ridiculous. You can't be anti-economics. Especially when the prices stated are quite reasonable (WMBS is the best droppable 2 hander in the game, which drops in a locked zone, 9k isn't bad).<br />
<br />
Also, you type like an imbecile. Try sentences and paragraphs and such.<br />
<br />
Edit: Damn you Groff! Your edit beat me to it while I was typing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Enrikk Xei'Maxximus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ahh, Fantasy and it's many problems.<br />
<br />
An item, ANY item, is only worth what someone is willing to pay for it. Period.<br />
<br />
In my time, about 3 years, I have purchased a Swiftblade of Zek for 500 plat, and a Windblade for 30k, and in each case, I felt I got a good deal. And, in each case, I am sure the seller felt they got a fair deal. <br />
<br />
I have seen both items go for different prices, and it matters not. <br />
<br />
The only person who I would consider wrong, in the game, would be anyone NOT involved in the deal, who later told another they got robbed, cheating them of the excitement of their new toy.<br />
<br />
I would without a doubt pay 9k for a WMBS, at todays prices, but if I saw one for 20k, and wanted it, I'd buy it too. It's fake coin, and I don't sweat that. And, if by some miracle it was being sold for 500 plat, I'd buy it then too. Freemarket, freeetrade, it's a beautiful thing!<br />
<br />
Thanks for helping newb's, everyone was one,, once. And, if you care to sell your WMBS for 5k, send me a tell, I'm buying.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, the ring is bits of data but so is what you are paying for it....<br />
<br />
Maybe I just don't understand your post.<br />
<br />
Or I'm too busy watch movies of you &quot;gaffle&quot; your dog to really pay attention.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hatre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">At the risk of getting flamed myself for supporting our erstwhile flamee here the stretch from gaffling which I agree is not a word to gaffing which is a word is not so far:<br />
<br />
gaffed, gaf·fing, gaffs <br />
1. To hook or land (a fish) using a gaff. <br />
2. To equip (a gamecock) with a gaff. <br />
3. Slang. <br />
     a. To take in or defraud; swindle. <br />
     b. To rig or fix in order to cheat.<br />
<br />
Flame away for him consistantly mispelling a word but I don't think he actually made it up just got it wrong, and you know Im sure I saw you post an opinion or two around here somwhere Groff.  Most of the entertainment on this board comes from people posting inane opinions and moral judgements about topics no one gives a flying fuck about.  At the very least it gives you reason to come here and vent some of that pent up anger by giving your inane opinion of someone elses inane opinion in the form of a flame.<br />
<br />
By the way not that you give a flying fuck but in my inane opinion it was quite a good flame.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">:D<br />
<br />
Thanks, Hatre.  I had presumed that he was grossly mispelling the word &quot;Grifting&quot;, and was not aware of a definition of &quot;Gaffing&quot; in which it meant to cheat or swindle.  I've only ever heard that term used to describe what salty sea dogs do to deepwater fish when you hook them on a charter boat and they're too heavy for you to reel in on your own.<br />
<br />
As for the inane opinions and moral judgements, sure, I'm probably guilty.  So are a number of other folks who's opinions I'm willing to listen to and then dismiss whole heartedly as being moronic.  I think what offended me most was the run-on sentence, of which I have never been guilty.  That and grossly misunderstanding the nature of a Free Market Economy, the same model which, I'm fairly certain, this moron is surrounded by daily.  If a person is uneducated and unable to communicate clearly, that's fine, I guess I just expect them to realize it and censure themselves appropriately.  Maybe I expect a little too much. :(<br />
<br />
Oh, and thanks for the compliment, I aim to please. ;)<br />
<br />
Edit: spelling</div></div><hr />

I hate it when I laugh out loud suddenly at work.  Dead giveaway that I'm not writing educational software.</div></div><hr />
