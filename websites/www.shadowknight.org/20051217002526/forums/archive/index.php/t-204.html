Usually groups are looking for a tank in general, and sometimes you can get groups as a snarer.  I've never really been in an experience group where we needed to fd split anything since lower guk before Kunark.  I don't do much raiding, so maybe people need to split in rougher areas that I don't know about.  Out of all the classes I've played over 3 years, shadow knight has been my favorite.</div></div><hr />

Also at 52, I've zoned into places (KC for instance), and get half a dozen tells asking me to group, before I even announce LFG. I guess it depends on the phase of the moon are something.<br />
<br />
Chanters and Shammys that have grouped with good SK's love us. Shammys can get slow off much earlier with a SK taunting, versus waiting for some gimp warrior to finally build enough agro before they start debuffing.<br />
<br />
IMO, our damage output is fine. Rangers can do more, monks usually, and some warriors can do better.<br />
<br />
Some mobs you pretty much have to have a warrior tanking, but those mobs take raids to take out, not single groups. <br />
<br />
With crack, I can pretty much keep myself healed just fine. I can't heal others, but heck, they don't often get hit if I do my job of keeping agro.<br />
<br />
Monk FD is better. At 60, we narrow the gap a lot, and can have more choices for fd available. Still, with circlet, I can split stuff monks wouldn't have a chance at (solo tag pulling, anyone?).<br />
<br />
We also do CR better than any other class, is most situations.<br />

Yes, I'll concede I might be biased, but you did ask on a SK board. :)<br />

ok a little more info for you on your cons. First, at 60 death peace is arguably better than monks skill. When it comes to AC you will probably have the same or more than a warrior but the difference there is the skill caps on skills like parry and dodge etc. Hp's will be less but still high enough for you to split tank most adds on large encounters.<br />
<br />
When it comes to wether you will be considered a viable contributer to any situation that is completely based on yourself and has nothing to do with the race or class you choose. EVERY class has something to contribute in the end, it's just a matter of devoting the time to learn what you can and can't do and your willingness to think through a situation and try something new.<br />
<br />
It is a hard road as a shadowknight but in the end I have never regretted the choice to be one. I personally think the shadowknight is the funnest class in EQ to play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ghob Owar</div><div class="date">03-29-2002, 11:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">From a Non-SK point of view:<br />
<br />
I play a Chanter, he's level 57... and in all those levels the people that I trust the MOST to break a mez properly are SKs past level 9 (when we get spells) and level 60 paladins. Others are adept at breaking mezzes, but there's NOBODY who can control aggro like a Shadow Knight.<br />
<br />
I've been in groups where the SK saved my butt because of aggro control and only aggro control. That (IMHO) is what we do best, there's nobody better.<br />
<br />
I've seen SK's out-pull monks, and in some cases were preferred over monks because of their ability to snare/split and invis pull past other mobs. Granted, we use mana to do all of these magical things... but if you're grouped w/ a Chanter/Bard you'll never be LOM (never had a SK in my group say... OOM someone else pull for a bit).<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
From the SK point of View:<br />
<br />
I USED to play a Chanter. Now I'm a Shadow Knight. I enjoy the versatility of being able to solo, and I love the challenge of being in a group w/ a Rogue who is several levels higher than me... and have him say (after about 3 hours of playing)... 'Nice work Ghob... I never got hit once!' (aggro control...).<br />
<br />
FD is icing on the cake. Yeah, I don't do as much damage as a monk at my level, but can a monk split-pull mobs that just won't come apart? Can a monk stop a mob from running back to it's other friends? I can bash / slam / bludgeon / slash and hammer mobs and if I get into trouble SNARE run a bit and FD (if I even take the time to do that...). I can bank anywhere I want to (w/ FD and CoS) and never get hit. And most importantly... I can grunt and make funny quips about my overly rotund ass and big ass feet (still looking for boots btw...).<br />
<br />
At 60, a Shadow Knight (without any AA abilities) has not 1 but 2 FDs (making that better than a monk) perhaps not as reliable... but we have the HP to stand there and take a beating while trying to cast the next one. Yes, we do have less HP and AC than a Warrior... but our job isn't to be the main tank (we can of course fill in... and VERY nicely when necessary... but it isn't our main role).<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
In terms of finding a group, that is up to you as the individual... not as the class. Sure, some groups would rather take a chanter over a bard... or a warrior over a SK... or even a Monk over a SK. BUT, if you've proven yourself... you won't have any problems finding a group. Learn the class... ask questions (as I seem to ask daily)... and absorb what those more experienced can teach you. And that doesn't necessarily have to be about being a Shadow Knight. (It could be... don't pull that one, pull the left one first... etc etc...).<br />
<br />
All in all (this post seems to have gone on long enough), I really enjoy playing Ghob, he's in the thick of things, I can control the tempo as to how quick my group makes XP, and from playing a chanter... I'm aware of things around me (like when the cleric gets jumped for healing someone).<br />
<br />
Just my .02... but I'm not looking back...<br />

If you are in comparing classes type then I don't answer to your question. I don't play SK to compete other classes. :) Let others answer..<br />
<br />
If you play SK to compete other classes then you will be thrilled then disappointed then thrilled over and over again over series of patches on class balancing. SK itself changes over years and it never stays the same. Some classes get stronger than others then became weak later on only to get strong again later on. It's best not to compare others and just love your SK 100% and focus on it years to come.<br />
<br />
Here's link to my post (http://www.divide-et-impera.org/ubb/Forum1/HTML/001349.html) and you decide if its worth to play SK or not. I didn't explain equipment, spells, etc. I just explain about generic thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Utaldain</div><div class="date">03-29-2002, 11:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My personal experience has been that a lot of people just don't understand a SK.  The pros and cons you listed are very marginal.<br />
<br />
AC/HPs  Warriors do have an edge in this department in class specific armors.  However, today there is a wealth of gear that is both War and SK usuable, taking you back to just the base class difference.<br />
<br />
Damage output  If you are talking about standing there and turning autoattack on and hitting the bash when it refreshes, yes, a warrior will out damage us with comporable gear.  That's why we have a pet, dots, taps, and buff/debuffs to make up the difference.  Remember, we are casters as well as Tanks.<br />
<br />
FD and pulling  It's been argued time and time again, but SKs can do things that a Monk could only dream about when it comes to pulling/spliting.  See the Damage Output section.  Nuff Said.<br />
<br />
Tanking on raids  We can very easily generate a lot of Agro, fast.  I've been MT for 6 months now in my guild, why?  Cause I can keep our chanters from dieing on the break.  IMO, as long as the mob doesn't flurry, we can tank it.  I would rather have a warrior tanking the adds then they don't have to worry about their agro.<br />
<br />
So, in summery, if you want to just do the same old boring attack on/taunt/kick/yawn then play a warrior.  If you want to play something that is a  challenge, but offers a lot of options the Shadow Knight is the class to be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But I have something to say....<br />
<br />
I am a twink.<br />
<br />
I am the alt of a 60th level monk Main by the name of Tzuten Tsunami.<br />
<br />
I created my Shadowknight when Kunark first came out. Reading of the history of the iksars and such, I thought it would be an exciting character to play.<br />
<br />
With raiding and such I could not play him as much as I would have liked, and he fell into obsurity at level 21.<br />
<br />
Then I heard the Greenmist was put into the game.<br />
<br />
I immediately brought life into him and once again his roar was heard across Kunark and beyond.<br />
<br />
Basicly I chose a Shadowknight for the sheer reason he can go most anywhere with Fiegn Death and Self-Inviso just like my monk. I chose an iksar for a chance to get the Greenmist.<br />
<br />
Only one step keeps me from my Greenmist Dream.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Puller on Plane of Fear brings back 3 mobs.  Chanters try to mez 2 of those 3, have a resist, aggro, get beaten up, cleric gets up in a hurry and throws a fast heal on the chanter, ...  Not pretty.  A shadow knight (me) intercepts one of the three mobs (shadow vortex) and aggroes it.  Chanter assists and mezzes that mob, in safety.  Much better.<br />
<br />
Arena in Kael Drakkal.  A 54 monk pulls a level 56 Protector of Zek, nasty mob.  The main tank, a 58 warrior tanks it but gets hurt eventually.  The cleric casts a complete heal (level 58 warriors have a lot of HPs) but because of lag, that 10 second spell can take from 10 to 18 seconds to cast.  I don't have lag, so when I see that the warrior is in danger ie at 20-30% HPs remaining, me, little 52 shadow knight, takes the aggro (shadow vortex, disease cloud, siphon life) from that 58 warrior.  CH gets through and the big warrior is saved, and I FD with 40% HPs remaining.  Amazing.<br />
<br />
Shadow knight spells have a high taunt value.  I use them to gain aggro when needed.  And FD when I no longer need the aggro.  That's how I play, and I love it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you have to ask, the answer is NO.  There are *no* powergaming reasons to be a Shadow knight.  <br />
<br />
Will people want us?  My experience has been that anyone so limited as to see other players as defined by classes and levels isn't really worth bothering with.   I'll leave you to determine how you care to play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Attyla</div><div class="date">03-29-2002, 12:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you are concerned about melee output, then you will notice a big difference between your own damage and that of a regular melee.  At 46, I get outdamaged about 1/3 of the time by our lvl 41 warrior (not counting melee damage).<br />
<br />
If you group with a priest type, then the HP difference will be much smaller vis a vis a paladin.  Whereas your damage output will far exceed a paladin's.<br />
<br />
I see that on your pros list, you list great taunter near the bottom.  From my experience, that is the #1 reason to be an SK.  We shine in our ability to allow OTHER classes to generate huge aggro almost at will.  I regularly group with a rogue/wizzie and cleric, and they love it.  Rogue almost never gets hit, wizzies can start nuking within a couple rounds, and the cleric can CH with near impunity.  The maiin value a tank adds to a group, is the ability to soak up melee damage, not deal it.<br />
<br />
Being an SK as a main tank in xp groups, means other classes can play *badly* and won't notice a thing.<br />
<br />
That's grouped.  SKs are excellent soloers for a melee class.  When you solo, you typically bring in all the offensive tools an SK can use (pets/dots/fears).  A pet can increase your damage about 10% (I'm only 46, so don't know what higher lvl pets can do).  DoTs add further to your advantage.<br />
<br />
I'd say if you are worried about what other people that don't know you from adam, or suffer from melee log parser envy, then maybe an SK isn't for you.  Myself, I find little trouble getting into pick up groups when I have to (which isn't too often).  Normally, I get tells from peeps I've run with before and had good experiences with.<br />
<br />
This is the viewpoint of one SK that has yet to see the &quot;end&quot; game.</div></div><hr />

That warrior must have some pretty uber archery skills.  :D<br />
<br />
Yes, I know he meant spells.  With our pet, DoT's, and taps (and nukes if you're fighting undead) you'll easily out damage a similarly equipped warrior or a comparable level.<br />
<br />
Oh, and yes, taunt is one of the best things about beig an SK. Casters/rogues/ran0gers love us.<br />

Aw heck, I was going to say that. <br />
But the other people do have a good point in the aggro control. In a guild &quot;pickup&quot; group in Chardok, after about a half hour, I was the preferred mez breaker over the lvl 58 warrior who was pulling. Even though I was only lvl 51, I could get the aggro on me and not the enchanter 99% of the time, and get it back very quickly on the few times it didn't work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The SK is a viable class, relative to the other classes, for grouping for experience (alt or normal) up to and including level 60.  Most posters have already provided ample reasons above.<br />
<br />
The SK is not viable, relative to the other melee classes, for high end raid situations.  If your goal is to raid and contribute effectively at the highest levels of the game, you would be wise to choose another class.  Your SK skills alone will not be necessary or important enough to merit your inclusion on a raid.  You will lack the hp and damage mitigation skill to tank most mobs, FD cast time will cripple your pulling ability relative to monks, your spells will not augment your tanking relative to other hybrids, your HT will not adequately damage mobs, your alt skills (at best) allow only negligible improvements in performance relative to other melee classes.<br />
<br />
This is not to say that you will not merit inclusion on other grounds (raid knowledge, specialist roll in certain minor situations, etc) or that the class is not enjoyable (for the most part); it means that, at level 60, you will have fallen behind the curve in relation to other melee classes in raid crucial areas.<br />
<br />
Verant shows no sign of either acknowledging this, or moving to fix it, so you should be aware of our predicament before you invest time leveling up.<br />

I was particularly impressed with the well thought out responses regarding the high level game and pick-up group roles.  It has given me insight into the class.<br />

Some were not so helpful though.  Those who said 'If you have to ask, then NO' really came out all uppity and stiff.  I am just looking for opinions from the players who play the class. <br />

Overall I am still uncertain.  I am a casual gamer and the thought of a soloing melee really appeals to me.  SK and monk are my top choices.  I am fairly familiar with the monk class (there's a lot of them hehe) but was uncertain about the SK.<br />

But yes, SK's are played by a rare (different?) type of player I think. I bought EQ after hearing about the game, checking it out, and deciding I wanted to play a SK. In other words, I play EQ because I wanted to play a SK.<br />
<br />
This was 2+ years ago, this is my second SK, I changed servers to play with some RL friends. I've got a cleric on a second account (bought from a close RL friend) that I bot occasionally, and I've got a shammy on that same account that I'm trying to get high enough to group with me. No other class than the SK holds any interest to me. Besides the shammy, I haven't played any other class, and I have to force myself to play the shammy. The SK fits what I wanted from the game, which is go anywhere, solo well at will, and do just about anything I want.<br />

<br />
And he has a point.  I won't lie to you, playing an SK takes a certain type of player.  More so in the old days than now.  If you are lukewarm about being an SK, you may want to just be a monk.  Monk's roles, expectations and appeal are far greater defined than that of an SK.<br />
<br />
Shadowknights are a far more subtle class.  What we do, isn't measurable on a parser, and isn't reported on logs.  Our contributions to a group aren't fully felt until we leave it...<br />
<br />
If you can take pride in doing the things that nobody notices and few people in a pick up setting even appreciate, then be an SK.  If you need to be picked up by any Tom, Dick or Harry in the crappy SK/LOIO/OT/DL xp turnstile, then do yourself a favor and be a monk.<br />
<br />
Playing an SK, means playing through an SK stigma that is perpetuated by the inane and the drole.  It's annoying so you better have a thick skin.</div></div><hr />

<br />
*I* play an SK because I find that class endlessly compelling.  The &quot;who contributes more to a raid&quot; argument is pure BS, IMAO - skilled &amp; motivated players contribute more.  Yes, we SKs won't be tanking the Statue any time soon, but the actual Boss encounters make a small percentage even of the typical high end raid.  <br />

I started the Game just after Kunark, I loaded up the game and whent right to the chr creation screen. after 10 min I found a Dark Elf Shadow knight and was up and running. LOL it took a friend telling me abought the /camp comand to figure out how to get out of the game, I did not read the manual!!!!<br />
<br />
I have played over 122 lvl's as an SK and over 150 days played on 3 chrs, on 2 servers. I have 2 druids over lvl 30, a mage and a necro mule. I have always known what class is right for me.<br />
<br />
The SK class can be summed up by rereading what Attyla and Nephtu said, as did many others it's not an easy road, but to be good takes a great player, to be bad is very very easy....<br />
<br />
To Attyla thank you for the kind words, I don't know everything but I do try to help as much as I can expeshaly to my fellow Torvo SK's.<br />

Oh you me and Nep should all hook up and get drunk one night, were all in the Seattle area!!!  =)</div></div><hr />
