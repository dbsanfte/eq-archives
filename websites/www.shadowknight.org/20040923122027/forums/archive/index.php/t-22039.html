<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The list is also posted up here (http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=shadowknightbalance&amp;message.id=3163)<br />
<br />
The way it works is they take the top 10 list, we add to the list/take away from it based on response/need.  Theres a few responses placed on the end of each item regarding its current status. The status indications are:<br />
<br />
Currently being evaluated – This means that a few of the development team members are looking into ways to implement the item.  This does not guarantee that the item will be implemented; however we may see changes made in the future.  The Community Team plans to give updates on these types of items every 2 weeks, even if it’s just a “no change since the last update”<br />
<br />
Currently being discussed – This is almost just like being evaluated however these items the development team is totally undecided if they want to implement or how to do so.  The Community Team plans to give updates on these types of items every 2 weeks, even if it’s just a “no change since the last update”<br />
<br />
Done – This means that the development team has implemented this item and it’s currently on live servers.<br />
<br />
Currently on Test server – This means that the development team has implement this item and it’s currently on test server, watch for future updates for implementation on the live servers.<br />
<br />
Waiting for community feedback – This means we don’t have enough information to make any type of decision on how to implement.  Threads will be started by me to get your feedback.<br />
<br />
No changes planned at this time – This means that the development team has decided at this time not to implement this item.<br />

1. Knight tanking is too far behind Warriors and too close to non tanking classes. (currently being evaluated)<br />
<br />
2. SK's are supposed to be tied as the 2nd best tank but have the lowest damage avoidence of all melee classes. (currently being evaluated)<br />
<br />
3. SK spellbook needs to scale to evolving content better. (currently being evaluated)<br />
<br />
4. Revise the 68 points of SK AA's that weaken us by buying them. (no change planned at this time)<br />

8. Our spell based aggro needs fixed and designed to scale. (currently being evaluated)<br />

9. Knight DPS while not meant to be the highest should be higher than Bards. Far more progressed SK's can be KS'ed by Bards with ease from sheer lack of DPS on our part. (currently being evaluated)</div></div><hr />

Just to clarify this then, does the fact that is is flagged as &quot;currently being evaluated&quot; mean the devs agree, and are actively looking into ways to rectify it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Chania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Oh, and something that I would like to add:<br />
<br />
<br />
Paladin stuns have no counterpart for SK's and are a serious source of disparity in tanking, our primary role, on any stunnable mobs. If Paladins and SK's are to perform the tanking role with any similarity, SK's need some answer to Stuns. Warriors have a legitimate gripe here too and might need a similar ability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well, the list is intended to be made by the class as a whole but I would suggest changing #4 to read as casting subtlety only.<br />
<br />
Change #6 to be seperate timers on Imp HT and Lifetap HT.<br />
<br />
Maybe make #10 something like return aggro supremecy to us.  So we're the absolute best people at getting/holding aggro in any circumstance, it's something minor in the grand scheme of things but it is supposed to be something SK's dominate and we're the lowest of the 3 tanks atm.<br />
<br />
I think #1 is ok on its own for now, between the 5 million+ various posts all about balance I would assume Dev's have a good idea of where to look at our issues.</div></div><hr />

This is useless as it does not crit I actually used lift tap ht the other night when I caught a spike, I have bought all of it even the god upgrades,  I was very suprised after I got a rez that I scrolled up and saw it landed for 1900 hp.  No wonder I was dead.  Thats crazy to pay that kind of points for a 1900 hp heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">It's even crazier to pay for it by using up your Imp HT.<br />
<br />
Would you prefer it reading, Allow our Lifetap HT to be focused and not use our HT timer up?  Would rather have that seperated into 2 things myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I really dont want to waste one of our upgrades on having that put on a seperate timer unless it could be made to use focus and crit its useless anyway.   1900 hp heal I can crit toi with focus for 1300 hp<br />

Placing IHT and LeechTouch on seperate timers would be nice. Paladin's have LOH and Hand of Piety on seperate timers why shouldnt we?<br />
<br />
Then for new AA idea have some passive aa that auto Crits and or Thefts LeechTouch every use?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Rueeliar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">2. SK's are supposed to be tied as the 2nd best tank but have the lowest damage avoidence of all melee classes. (currently being evaluated)<br />
<br />
I believe it's noteworthy that our avoidance is also lower than most of the pure casters.  There was a set of parses being done to compare clerics and knights with comparable AC to reinforce cleric complaints about their mitigation being lower despite having equal AC.  I'll pester the cleric in my guild who was doing that parse for some info about this, because I believe them to be the only class with worse avoidance.<br />
<br />
4. Revise the 68 points of SK AA's that weaken us by buying them. (no change planned at this time)<br />
<br />
SCS, and WA/SA3... what am I missing?<br />
<br />
7. Deathpeace is no longer sufficent as an FD tool. (currently being evaluated)<br />
<br />
It sounds a little odd, but the 1s casting time isn't what kills it.  It's 1s after slowing to a stop, then waiting to establish immobility through a turn or pause, and then praying the server doesn't decide we weren't standing still long enough... adding up to 2s-3s depending on fps/latency, versus trash mobs that hit as hard as they do, and it's barely useful at all except to take a piss during a raid.<br />
<br />
8. Our spell based aggro needs fixed and designed to scale. (currently being evaluated)<br />
<br />
I would bump this up substantially in my personal priorities.  I'm not looking forward to OoW with the spells I see now, where every class gets obvious upgrades to their aggro output through heals, dots, or DD's.  Keeping up is going to get a bit iffy.<br />
<br />
9. Knight DPS while not meant to be the highest should be higher than Bards. Far more progressed SK's can be KS'ed by Bards with ease from sheer lack of DPS on our part. (currently being evaluated)<br />

Embarrassing (but true), but I barely care about my DPS.</div></div><hr />

I was under the impression that this list: http://www.shadowknight.org/forums/showthread.php?t=21502&amp;page=3&amp;pp=15 last post by Brael on that page, was the one submitted.  I hope Kytherea did not delete the sub-bullets before it was submitted and they are simply omitted on the SoE site to save space.  If the list on the link above is the one that was not submitted I won't be very impressed as it contained rational explainations and detailed problems which made up the core of that complaint.  Perhaps Brael can clarify on both boards which list went in for comments.<br />

I assume they are not going to address the weapon affinity issue.<br />
<br />
Other stuff you could add...<br />
<br />
1) Make Unholy Aura an innate calculation to Harm touch<br />
2) Split timer on Harm touch and leech touch<br />
3) Have our aura's debuff mob will buffing us<br />
4) Have our terrors do something else besides just hate...debuff, direct damage, lifetap...anything.<br />
5) My personal favorite but not liked by all...give us a haste/slow tap.  :) <br />
6) List weapon affinity by itself instead of saying 68AA's make us weaker?</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is why FD needs to be instant cast so we don't have to stop and turn and wait for the server to see us as stopped before we can FD.  <br />
<br />
With sow speed and faster mobs coming at you that hit for 1100's there is not enough time to stop and wait anymore and hope you can channel a FD when their friends are beating on you even if you did manage to land Festering on one of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">1. Knight tanking is too far behind Warriors and too close to non tanking classes.<br />
<br />
1a. Knights need a 3 minute DI altering discipline to bring us closer to Warrior tanking since we no longer possess an aggro advantage.<br />
1b. Knights need a short duration melee immunity discipline to allow us to compete with &quot;emergency&quot; tanking by non tank classes.<br />
1c. Knights need an innate DI modifier (possibly accompanied by an increase to the innate modifier on Warriors) to seperate us from non tank classes.<br />
1d. Knights need a 3 minute evasion discipline to bring us closer to Warrior tanking since we no longer possess an aggro advantage.<br />
1e. All tanks need an increased role of shields in combat so they provide more of an advantage than simply adding stats.<br />

 Status currently being evaluated<br />
<br />
2. SK's are supposed to be tied as the 2nd best tank but have the lowest damage avoidence of all melee classes.<br />
<br />
2a. SK's need a way to compete with Paladin stuns such as a modified version of Fear2. Depiste the intent of being equal tanks, on stunnable group content SK's are far behind.<br />
2b. Knights need to have the same damage avoidence skill caps as Warriors. This change is 4 years overdue currently from when we got 252 defense caps.<br />
<br />
Currently being Evaluated<br />
<br />
3. SK spellbook needs to scale to evolving content better.<br />
<br />
3a. Heals do not scale appropiate to mob DPS. <br />
3b. Lifeaps do not refresh fast enough.<br />
3c. Damage portion of lifetap balance harms us in offtanking roles because damage is meangingless then.<br />
3d. Disease resist is too high across the board.<br />
3e. Self only buffs non stackable buffs should be comparable to what other hybrids can cast on everyone (CoL should be same HP/AC as Brells/Rathe combo)<br />
3f. Group recourses need to goto the short duration buff box.<br />
3g. Undead needs to be more concentrated so we make better use of the Scythe line.<br />
3h. Much of SK utility is given out to other classes through clicks and procs. This needs to stop, it dilutes our spellbook severely.<br />

Currently being evaluated<br />

4. Revise the 68 points of SK AA's that weaken us by buying them.<br />
<br />
4a. Spell Casting Subtlety needs a toggle when it's bought.<br />
4b. Imbue procs need to check before weapon procs for SK's to prevent the proc loss from Weapon Affinity.<br />

5c. Feign Death is becoming too difficult to channel.<br />

6. Itemization revision.<br />
<br />
6a. Grimror/Rayin armor sets need ac/hp increased to be between current values and Warrior values of equilavent sets.<br />
6b. Not enough beneficial focus on armor for SK's compared to Clerics/Paladins.<br />
6c. Rayin's armor needs a revision of focus effects. SK's need distance focus, magic nuke focus, etc... not what's currently on the pieces. Detrimental versions of Paladin focus do not work.<br />
6d. Ornate click effects need revised.<br />
6e. Grimror's BP needs a better focus. Disease focus doesn't give us any real benefit.<br />
6f. Non visible hybrid armor needs to be revised. It harms Knights tanking advantage over non tank pure melees when their versions are higher hp/ac/tanking effects.<br />
<br />
No change planned at this time<br />
<br />
7. Deathpeace is no longer sufficent as an FD tool.<br />
<br />
7a. A new FD spell is needed, preferably something that cannot be broken by spells (like the Monk AA), and is more difficult to interrupt.<br />
7b. An emergency FD hotkey skill is required such as a 36 minute reuse, instant cast, completly unbreakable (other than by standing), 100% memblur, unfailable AA.<br />
<br />
Currently being evaluated<br />
<br />
8. Our spell based aggro needs fixed and designed to scale.<br />
<br />
8a. Terrors need a more appropirate level of hate, they do not scale properly, the level 65 one is only 3x higher than the level 34 one. This spell line should be capable of holding aggro entirely on it's own with no problems.<br />
8b. Terrors need an adjustment to their mana:aggro ratios, they should get better and not remain at 1:10 for their entire lifespan.<br />
8c. Terrors need shorter cast times.<br />
8d. Fear should not generate the obscene aggro it does in most zones, provided Terrors are fixed.<br />
8e. Knight weaponry needs to be designed to provide more aggro than it currently does.<br />

If Sony wants to be serious about this, PVP issues should never be even brought up. If their visions sees back-to-back IHT + leechtouch as being too much burst dps or whatever, some issue that affects the whole game, then fine I guess.

knight tanking - SOE likely solution - pallies get improved stuns, SKs get improved lifetaps (haha) - SOE logical solution - SKs get moderated defensives on faster reuse timers<br />
<br />
sk vs pally mitigation  - SOE will just assume lifetap solution meets this.  No seriously.<br />
<br />
sk spell book - lifetaps plus oow content.  Pray for a mandate on the dev team to give damn potent spell upgrades and they cluster the balance on our side without realising until wars have war whine sit in II.  SOE logical solution - defensive in, so no lifetap, no changes other than OOW.  <br />
<br />
68AA - at least they were honest, they could have just blown it off as OOW.  Not a huge issue in my view, SKs already have a broad AA range to consider and most classes have a fair amount of farcical AAs.<br />
<br />
channeling spells - I reckon they will do this unless theres something way more complex in the algorithms than I'd think, pallies too (compounding the stuns prob, but hey! we have lifetaps).<br />
<br />
itemisation - wont change.  Personally I advocate wars having a large edge here as a more versatile class, but then I also advocate Knights tanking on a par to them, and thats not going to happen so wars can take a colonic as far as I am concerned.<br />
<br />
DP as a FD tool.  Being able to have a chance to channel a stun/spell without aggro would be huge, and see us make some long lost ground without causing bards and monks to have hernias.  However they wont do this, they will reduce the recast time by 10% or something equally unhelpful.<br />
<br />
spell aggro.  Um PRAY they dont play with this.   In 5 years of EQ I have YET to see them actually do anything but fuck SKs up about this.  And each time we have fallen back on another spell while laughing at the 'aggro' line.  Well, the informed amongst us anyway, I always sigh when I group with a SK that terrors.<br />
<br />
knight DPS.  If they genuinely fixed tanking, channeling, and FD I'd happily forget all the other concerns, including this.  Itemisation always has the potential to help here, as will OOW spells (if anyone can find one 8p)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Rueeliar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">The point was differentiating it vs PVP issues. I agree very much with separating the two, etc etc, but it seems that first point was missed.<br />
<br />
Not at all.  I didn't miss that it would be a problem in PVP, I simply dont care.  They're dropping the cap on max damage that a spell can do, are they not?  So your mega-HT will not even hit the cap after the PVP redux, but hit their HP limit most of the time.  Nerfs + spellshield + hp mudflation = HT getting less and less useful in PvP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>ghoule</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">I assume they are not going to address the weapon affinity issue.<br />
<br />
Other stuff you could add...<br />
<br />
1) Make Unholy Aura an innate calculation to Harm touch<br />
2) Split timer on Harm touch and leech touch<br />
3) Have our aura's debuff mob will buffing us<br />
4) Have our terrors do something else besides just hate...debuff, direct damage, lifetap...anything.<br />
5) My personal favorite but not liked by all...give us a haste/slow tap.  :) <br />
6) List weapon affinity by itself instead of saying 68AA's make us weaker?<br />
I think that one possible way to fix terrors and to possibly give SK an answer to the aggro that Stuns grant paladins, would be to add a Poison counter effect to the terror lines. Its well known that Tash and its one whopping poison counter gives tons of aggro, and anyone that has played a poison DoT caster knows what sort of aggro that gives....Hate over time? There really has to be some way to add some actual use to the Terrors...as it stands now its nice to give a extra taunt to a mezzed mob, but otherwise its crap. Meh, some ideas anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Visvires</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Heres my take on the list as someone whos played a sk for 5+ years, and who is on the bleeding edge of game content, which, may make my opinions more valid, or less, depending on your outlook. <br />
<br />
<br />
1. Knight tanking is too far behind Warriors and too close to non tanking classes. <br />
<br />
To a certain extent yes, its embarassing to do a vxed run with a warrior in my guild, we are both on the same level of gear, but ill OT a mob and the difference is a joke. Im sitting at 2300 ac, hes at 2700, with the same gear, 10% shielding vs 18% , the difference just gets worse as gear goes on, paticularly because warrior weapons become aggro machines, wherein simply knight weapons do not scale even remotely close, the spell aggro argument comes into play here too. A lvl 65 sk with 5000 hps tanking BoT trying to keep the slower from getting aggro, has just as powerful a terror as me trying to keep aggro off my wizards who are nuking for 8k every 30 seconds.<br />
<br />
2. SK's are supposed to be tied as the 2nd best tank but have the lowest damage avoidence of all melee classes. <br />
<br />
I have seen only minimal parses on this, so i prefer not to comment on something i dont know alot about.<br />
<br />
3. SK spellbook needs to scale to evolving content better. <br />
<br />
Read above, even if there was an opposite of spell casting subteltly in form of a focus, similar to innoruks sarcasm (?) only opposite effect.. +(%) aggro to x_spell line, or blanket aggro, put it on high lvl raid content, and help balance the aggro differentiative between higher lvl paladins, shadow knights, and warriors.<br />
<br />
4. Revise the 68 points of SK AA's that weaken us by buying them. <br />
<br />
I agree with what someone else posted above, alot of classes have useless AA, the only real issue is WA, otherwise it doesnt seem too important to me.<br />
<br />
5. It is currently too tough for us to channel spells. <br />
<br />
Totally agree, specifically with attempting to FD pull, im a big proponent of stalwart endurance AA, but i cant seem to find anyone who agrees with me, persistant casting is shit.. channeling needs to be upped, also to scale with tanking, hard to keep aggro if you cant channel anything.<br />
6. Itemization revision. (no change planned at this time)<br />
<br />
7. Deathpeace is no longer sufficent as an FD tool. <br />
<br />
Read above, its not only not sufficient, its near useless on anything in GoD. Ever try FD Splitting anything + an archer? Ha.<br />
<br />
8. Our spell based aggro needs fixed and designed to scale. <br />
<br />
Read above. I also think they are on the right path with that 1200 hate terror spell, thats fantastic snap aggro, just knock the mana cost down alittle, OR make it like a .5 sec cast time, but give it a long re-use to balance it out. Other spells with that line of thought work well, the spear line for example.<br />
<br />
9. Knight DPS while not meant to be the highest should be higher than Bards. Far more progressed SK's can be KS'ed by Bards with ease from sheer lack of DPS on our part. <br />
<br />
This i have a big problem with, I think its generally been shown a knight and warrior with same stat + weapon the knight will put out about 20% + dps. Granted, as shadowknights we can do things to make up for this, but i dont want to put in 2x the effort to even the DPS table. I understand that we have to sacrifice some kind of tanking ability and DPS for our versatility , which im fine with, but they can bring it closer in line. Raise the 2h cap, bring it more around 10% less dps , that way if i'd like to, i can outdmg a war if I choose to spend my mana that way, or any other class for example. Frankly, im tired of us being compared to wars 24/7 (although I know thats logical) its just funny to see the tables turn, as warriors were coming up with their flaws by compare and contrast with knights. I have no problem with warriors at all, I love the wars in my guild and im happy with what they have been given, but the reality of the situation is that they sit in the same pool with pal/sk, and when you boost one up, its going to make any problems that arise as a result very obvious, which I think is what we are dealing with now.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thats all done ranting, disagree if you choose! Stalward endurance AA!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">I 100% disagree on the AA point, for atleast 12 of them.  I can forget Weapon Affinity as not wanting to make a proc exception that isnt through AA's for SK's.  I can forget Lifetap HT as it has some (extremly minor) value so truely isn't entirely worthless (19 aa... its really 65 points).  But SCS, I'm sorry but for SK's it's the only ability that detracts from us in ALL circumstances, and whats more it's the only ability that detracts from a classes primary role that any class has.  I completly disagree with you saying the AA's aren't a big deal.  Considering very few SK's even have SCS I doubt there would even be any negative feedback from the people who are affected if they flat out removed the AA from the class and didn't even refund it.  It's that bad of a skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Agarwaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Brael<br />
<br />
I doubt any SK in the game (at least those of us who think SKs are Tanks not dps machines   :rolleyes: ) think the SCS aa is of any use, but other than giving SKs that buy this the right to refund I have little sympathy, hell at least that AA is obviously useless to most SKs, theres lots of aa out there that SOUND useful to their respective class, only for them to find out its fubared.  There was probably some SKs that bought this back when war aggro blew and they wanted to be able to light up raid mobs, so yeah, a right to refund sure.<br />
<br />
68 AA is a lot, but I would be surprised if most classes couldnt argue a similar amt of useless aa.<br />
<br />
Visveres; um you use terrors for aggro?  Wow I guess your bleeding edge changes things a lot from my end of the game, where I sit terror line blows chunks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Agarwen, refunding is just so lame though... the AA has so much potential for the class, if it could just be toggled it would be flat out amazing, I would probally recommend it before defensive aa's then, it would just be that good and have no negative feedback from other classes.  SK's have the best aggro control of any tank, of any melee even and we're the only ones with the aa (unless you wanna count bards in melee) why not further enhance that level of control we have?<br />
<br />
Also you can't make a similar argument for SK's and SCS with other classes, you can with Lifetap HT and possibly Weapon Affinity but not for SCS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Visvires</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">a .5 sec 1200 instant hate spell is what i was asking for, i was referring to a modified terror, otherwise I merely used it as an example that spells didnt scale ;) Otherwise, the only situation ill ever use terror is in a raid offtank situation with both spears down and the mob is still going after a chanter or cleric, sometimes its just enough to push them over the edge, otherwise I dont touch it, like most sk's I believe.<br />
<br />
Terror in its current form is what, 1 BoC proc? Yawn.<br />
<br />
SCS i can see it being removed, I fully understand its utter uselesness, and even detriment, but in reality, its not doing anyone any harm being there so its really not that important to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Manslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">SCS used to be an excellent AA back when SKs had a huge aggro surplus as it increased your dps when you werent tanking but it was still very simple to hold aggro when you wanted it.  With the changes in aggro have accumulated though it has become a detriment.  As far as I can tell, no other class has an AA that is directly bad for them to take.  Personally I would think it would be amazing to have on a toggle, barring that it should be removed and replaced with something else that actually does something positive or even just removed all together.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Parasite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Personally I am worried about the poor implementation of a Toggle..<br />

(Suxx when you want to type /2 in pull channel but miss the / button and then cast your ZBite placed on Hotbutton 2 and stand up from your FD during a split.)</div></div><hr />

What I do know for sure:<br />
<br />
1)Some sort of Def. would be good.<br />
2)Having to stop, pause then cast Feign Death is just fucked.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>xizorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">what about moving the FD from spell book to a DISC.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Rueeliar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Hmm... that idea, while it sounds silly, has merit.  Giving us a FD that uses Endurance instead of Mana, but is instant casting time is not a bad idea.  It would be like Bard's and FM:  Powerful, but steep in cost and slow to return.  After all, we haven't gotten new discs since 60.<br />
<br />
Edit:  Referring to Endurance renewal, not a refresh timer on it.  Give it an 18 second refresh timer, a flat (but steep) Endurance cost, and no casting time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Visvires</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">The problem is, we simply cant have an instant FD, that would be make us just as good pullers as monks, if not better because of our ability to snare amongst other things.<br />
<br />
Granted, that point can be argued, but its simply *never* going to happen for a myriad of reasons.<br />
<br />
With SoW speed mobs a permanent fixture in GoD, Sk's as viable pullers is almost a no go in alot of situations, however, i really can't see fixing this without seriously encroaching into other classes territory, after all, we arent even meant to be pullers, and I for one am not too interested in dilluting class skills. It's hard to channel a FD, yes, i mentioned that earlier, but a better FD would not be one of the things I would ask for. Channeling increase in general, sure, at least that helps solve other issues, but im not going to have some dev toss us .1 sec cast FD and write that off as a SK fix.</div></div><hr />

I for my part think it's perfectly alright for us to be equal to monks.<br />
Even the monks themselfs see pulling as their secondary function (see the Monk petition draft on MB), so we are in the same position really.<br />
Our snares are balanced by their lulls, our FD-ability should be identical.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">When Brael and others got SCS, we were the aggro masters. So much so in fact that Warriors had trouble holding aggro when we had a Vanazir or similar weapon. Since they got their aggro boost, SCS has lost any usefulness it might have once had. Now that we are struggling for aggro, the unfortunate SK's that bought this AA set, are getting screwed over hard.<br />
<br />
It should be removed from our list and the AA's refunded. Simple, fast and easy solutions. They will get no complaints.<br />
<br />
Weapon Affinity is a minor issue. Assuming that you choose your weapon and augment procs correctly, it turns out to be a big net positive for us. Even with a slow weapon, the parses done show a 10-15% reduction in innate procs, with a large increase in primary at the same time. Let's make sure we focus on issues that really impact us.<br />
<br />
Things that should be added to the list are improvements that help us be better off-tanks, secondarily better pullers, and as a result of those improvements better group tanks.<br />
<br />
As some of us have suggested, we need a discipline that is short duration, fast reuse, reduces damage taken by half or more, locks aggro and increases stun resistance and channeling significantly. A true off-tanking/pulling tool.<br />
<br />
Also needing to be added is a spell line that let's us get parity with Paladin stuns. Fear2 being an example.<br />
<br />
The Terror line needs to be scrapped or significantly imrpoved. It's not that 1200 hate is not good, it's just that the way aggro works at higher levels, pure hate spells are not ever going to give us immediate  initial aggro. It might be great in building aggro over time, but that is not what we are lacking in, far from it. And in the instances where we have to maintain long-term aggro, we have several other great choices that are more than adequate. Add some type of debuff or snare or stun to Terrors to help with initial aggro, or better yet, replace them with a stun line that starts with lower level SK's and scales up to our Ancient spell in Omens.<br />
<br />
FD needs big time improvement. It needs to be hotkeyed. Keeping the same cast time and chance to failing is fine, but make it uninteruptable and channel/persistant cast through a stun.<br />
<br />
No reason that Aura of Hate and Pain should not be able to be clicked off as a buff. I get so many complaints on raids about this. Short-duration box is ideal, but SOE is resistant to that idea.<br />
<br />
It looks to me like SOE put that list together a while back, and our perspectives' have changeed somewhat. Would be nice to have a revised list that includes the really important issues.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Ghismonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">My two copper pieces:<br />
<br />
1. Knight tanking is too far behind Warriors and too close to non tanking classes. (currently being evaluated)<br />
2. SK's are supposed to be tied as the 2nd best tank but have the lowest damage avoidence of all melee classes. (currently being evaluated)<br />
<br />
These could be lumped together, since they're essentially the same problem.  I assume by &quot;tanking&quot; the author meant &quot;mitigation&quot;?<br />
<br />
3. SK spellbook needs to scale to evolving content better. (currently being evaluated)<br />
8. Our spell based aggro needs fixed and designed to scale. (currently being evaluated)<br />
<br />
Everything needs to scale better, but let's be specific about what it is that needs to scale and how we can fix that or else we can expect to get jack and shit fixed from the devs.<br />
<br />
Spears resisted too often.  Recast time is too long.  Fix:  Have a DR adjust on the spears, more adjustment the higher level the spell.  Lower recast time the higher level the spell.<br />
<br />
Lifetaps don't scale.  Fix:  It'd be nice if we could just make them scale alone, but the way that healing scale is fixed with other classes is through improved healing focii.  Either make improved healing affect lifetaps, make magic DD focus items far, FAR more available for SKs or invent and implement some focus effects that increase the healing portion of a lifetap or lifetap-over-time.<br />
<br />
4. Revise the 68 points of SK AA's that weaken us by buying them. (no change planned at this time)<br />
<br />
I understand if you don't wish to force feed fixes to the devs, but at least tell them what is wrong.  Spell Casting Subtlety is exactly counterproductive to our jobs as tanks.  Make it toggleable.  Weapon Affinity makes our best procs happen less.  Reverse the order to 1. Imbued procs 2. Weapon procs 3. Augment procs.<br />
<br />
5. It is currently too tough for us to channel spells. (currently being evaluated) <br />
<br />
Do hyrbids get an innate channeling bonus?  If they don't, they should.  Oh, and persistant casting is a fucking waste.<br />
<br />
6. Itemization revision. (no change planned at this time)<br />
<br />
Not an SK-specific issue as presented.  Why is it on the list?  Let's be more specific about what on our items sucks, because it's clear that the devs creating our armor don't actually play SKs.<br />
<br />
Fury of Bertox - What.  The.  Fuck.<br />
<br />
7. Deathpeace is no longer sufficent as an FD tool. (currently being evaluated) <br />
<br />
I would rephrase that to &quot;Death Peace, on its own and in its current state, is not enough to keep shadowknights in the pulling role for their guilds.&quot;  We need Stonewall, and we need a faster casting or uninterruptable FD.  A manaless FD, or one that we could use while stunned or silenced would really make me happy in my pants.  I supposed that encroaches too much onto monk territory though.<br />
<br />
For a situational bone being thrown our way, a high level multiple-target undead lull would be nice.<br />
<br />
9. Knight DPS while not meant to be the highest should be higher than Bards. Far more progressed SK's can be KS'ed by Bards with ease from sheer lack of DPS on our part. (currently being evaluated)<br />
<br />
Why are bards singled out here?  If our bards retire because I just got them nerfed, I'ma have hell to pay.  Besides, they're not the only concern.  We should be out DPSing warriors as well, but we're not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">Because Bards are supposed to be lower dps than us yet they can sustain higher dps with lesser quality equipment.  They're also one of the few classes we're supposed to outdamage.</div></div><hr />

If my whole job is to cast, then I want higher skill in this than the class that can do multiple things.  That being said the fact that the same skill is used for casting a spell as is used for not being interrupted by being hit is the long term handcuff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, and that's a problem, but is it an SK problem or a bard problem?  Are you calling for an SK fix or a bard nerf?<br />
<br />
I want SKs to be balanced in the grand scheme of the game, but I don't want my balancing act to be measured against a bard as a yardstick.  We need to be careful what we're asking for, because all they would need to do is nerf a bard to satisify that request but we're not really fixed.  We're still being outdamaged by other classes that we're &quot;not supposed to&quot; as well.<br />
<br />
So why are we being outdamaged by bards/warriors/etc?  That's what needs to be in the balance request.<br />
<br />
That being said the fact that the same skill is used for casting a spell as is used for not being interrupted by being hit is the long term handcuff.<br />
<br />
The way I see it, channeling is not used for anything except maintaining spell-casting focus while being hit.  If there is documentation to the contrary, please point me toward it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I might suggest looking at the following, for fixing our DPS: We have very few effective dots, and they take too long to cast (the longer we take to cast, the less time we have to swing a weapon).  The resist rates and long recast times of our direct damage spells make them situational at best.</div></div><hr />

 - Group tap buffs being sent to the short duration box and/or being removable with a click.<br />
 - Shields really affecting your ability to tank, ie: increased mitigation, or a block discipline while a shield is equipped<br />

Ok, it's been a couple (few?) years, so my memory may be off but... back when they changed disarm so the weapon went into inventory rather than on the ground, didn't they say that the weapon being dropped, fucking over players in PvP, was an unintentional side-effect and indicate that it wasn't originally planned as a PvP tool or something along those lines?  <br />
<br />

I thought that was fairly ironic, considering they're already out DPSing us.  I poked around a bit on the other classes top ten lists, and some of them are just ludicrous.  Read the cleric's demands if you want a good laugh.<br />
<br />
I guess this raises the question, are they going to balance classes against the classes' current models?  Or balance them against the projected class models?  I understand that class balance needs to be on ongoing project, but I would feel very defeated if, for instance, they increased our DPS to keep up with a bard and then met their demands to increase their melee DPS not a few minutes later.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>cames</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">Been thinking about the damage mitigation thing.  Maybe the deal should be to create a spell and an AA to help here that become Damage Shields that heal (sort of a lich shield).<br />
<br />
Spell - long lasting - causes damage (50? 100?) to the mob and heals the SK.  Biggest issue with it is that one will become invulnerable to greens so maybe some percentage of the hit with a max is better (this also scales more easily - say 10% of hit max of 50 or 100).<br />
<br />
AA - Short duration - Same idea with a high percentage (depending on whether we want this to match the riposte (100% for 3 ticks) or Defensive (25% for 1 minute/3 minutes).<br />
<br />
The reason for a Lich Shield is that it scales with hits, can't be interrupted, and could be tuned by playing with percentages and maxes).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u79"><b>Howlitoezis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p79">Been discussed, many times. wont scale unless its a ficed percentage of incoming damage, like 35-40%. The problem with that, is it would really overshadow other classes defensive abilites, as not only would the SK be mitigating properly, it would be doing a crap load of damage to the mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u80"><b>Skvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p80">People seem to forget that the reason that the high end people are struggleing and crying out for some form of mitigation disc is that they are being one rounded too often. Healing (however it is gained) is not the answer , never can be the answer. In theory a % heal of the hit might be the answer , the problem with that though is that you take the hit then get the heal. So say it was a 10% heal...you get hit for 2000...you still get hit for 2000 and then get your 200 heal. If you have less than 2000hp though at that time your still dead no matter how much of a heal you get after the event.<br />

me thinks every single class is majorly in danger of being one rounded. while in concept is realisitic makes for shitty game play. <br />
<br />
they in thier &quot;big GOD change fix&quot; said that the attack levels of mobs were to high and frankly i think they are still way to high. when every class and most of the &quot;end game&quot; players are worried about one rounding its a serious problem.<br />

single group content should not be a worried about one rounding.</div></div><hr />

Not true, rngs, bards, bsts etc with immunity melee disc can withstand for several seconds without being harmed; hence, not 1 rounded at all. That's why GoD trial group preferred rng to tank boss over SK if there is no warrior to tank. Is that cool? Heck no..</div></div><hr />

I'm willing to wager that pretty much every warrior, and a good number of people of other classes, will say that this is how it should be.  Too many times I've seen the attitude of &quot;warriors are tanks, knights are light combat buggies, all is right with the world.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Tankability go way beyond discs.  I played a warrior one night in Uqua. For flagging purposes ofcourse..Warriors are boring to play.  He had the same hps as I do, buffed, and 300 less ac.  I tanked noticeably better.  Innate mitigation &gt; discs.  If the goal is better tanking, we should be asking for some innate mitigation. Enough to set us apart from the chain, leather and, sometimes even silk classes. But, still well below warriors.</div></div><hr />

yes but the subject of the topic is mitigation in general and I even stated that was &quot;circumstancial&quot; so please read what I posted.  The idea that a ranger has a discipline that helps him tank in rare instances doesnt change the fact his mitigation is very very very low for GoD mob DPS.  So please dont use that as an excuse to justify why they, or other classes, shouldnt get a revamp in mitigation in some form or another.</div></div><hr />
