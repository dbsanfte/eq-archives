<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Burbak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Have returned to EQ after 1 year off and am being plvled by a 64th druid.  We've done the whole Sol A up till now (playin Ogre SK fairly well equiped).  We have stoped in Sol A at 31st because he does not want to mess up his Gnome faction (but man I love the exp that used to come from gnome killing).<br />
<br />
Having moved on I'm thinking about going to Gulf for 31-35 or so then maybe doing the Great Divide for 35-42... 40+ for Dulak isnt bad but i'm not a big fan of dulak (bad train's in the past)...  <br />
<br />
Question I have is maybe from 40 headin back to Sol B and doing the doggies (some decent loot at a few of the king/champ/etc camps) and bats and such also...<br />
<br />
So my final question I guess is where would you all hunt from 31st on with a 64th druid powerlvling you?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, I started a hobby twink a couple days ago myself.  Although the new toon isn't an SK, at these lower levels and with the availability of cheap gear, where I am now and going next wouldn't change whether I played a melee or hybrid for a while anyways.<br />
<br />
I'm using a 65 druid to PL (of course, have to use 49 and below spells to buff and PL with) and I went to OT at lvl 15 and hit lvl 30 last night.  I do plan to go to GD next, to kill wolves and try out some FG scouts.  However, I just got my OT hammer last night (oh, this is a BST twink) so I'm thinking of staying in OT a bit longer so I can get to non-kos at the outpost so when I hammer in I don't get aggro'd and such.<br />
<br />
Although I am not planning to PL the absolute fastest possible way, I prefer to get the same quest items I have for my other characters, and therefore I try to PL in zones where I can faction and xp at the same time.  I plan to do the OT Hammer [got], 8th Ring [GD], Bracer of Benevolence [GD], Woodie Crown [Seb] -- so I'm heading to those areas so that I can get decent xp, even though they aren't the BEST xp/PL zones.  I have about 10 hours played, including time spent working on spell skills.<br />
<br />
I guess I am saying, I'd suggest planning ahead on certain must-have quests and try to hit those zones so that you can get faction plus decent xp at the same time; possibly rather than hitting the absolute best xp zones and later going back to faction for quests when the mobs are now green.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Burbak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've tried the GD and the wolves are good, scouts are red and hit a little hard sometimes (nothing the druid cant easily keep me healed with) and otherwise isnt a bad place (except the long distances sometimes of finding mobs).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Carzon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I was just hunting in GD last night with some guildies at lvl 33. Exp was decent and got good loot from giants, plus good faction hits with the dwarfs if that matters to ya. I dinged 34 just today soloing in Dawnshroud peaks. No ability to plevel here :(</div></div><hr />
