<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Peye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Heya, peeps. I've been out of EQ for the most part since last October, even though I've continued to buy the expansions. I did a search on where to hunt solo at lvl 56+, but a lot of the info is about the same as when I played before. I would greatly appreciate any advice you have to offer.  If i missed a thread that would be useful, please link it to me. I tried soloing Skyfire, as one person suggested in his post, but I didn't find it to be that fulfilling. Thanks for whatever help you have to offer!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rorthek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">At 56 you can fear kite gobs in Veksar.<br />
just single one up the ramp to where you need to Ivu, snare, and use your lowest fear and it should path back down the ramp.<br />
<br />
You will probibly have to run it up and down a good 3 times, but its nice exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ramgar SK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I hate to knock something stickied on this great board, but that hunting grounds list needs some serious updates.  Many zones have been revamped, Nurga and Droga have changed in level quite dramatically.  Veksar, Nedaria's Landing, and all of GoD is not even on the list.<br />
<br />
The best exp 56+ is grouping in PoP.  Soloing at this level is painfully slow.  Try PoJ exit groups, PoI exit group, and Nightmare waterfall groups.  <br />
<br />
Try the flies in PoD.  Depending on your gear, you should be able to fear kite these from the safe rock.  Watch out for the rats in the water.  Keep up bobbing corpse if you need to truck it to the zone.  Great exp though 61.<br />
<br />
Nadox Shrine Bruisers are great, single pullable.  But geting there is a pain now that you can't run though the big trapdoor, go though Dulak or bring a druid for succor.  /flip directX9.<br />
<br />
Natimbi is good for fear kiting, they have low hp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Peye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I totally agree with you, Ramgar.  Sk.org is probably the best class website I've ever been on, so there are definitely no complaints from me.  However, we all have to offer advice, CONSTRUCTIVE criticisms, and ideas to continue to make the site better.  I can see how the Hunting Grounds sticky could become slightly out of date because so many of us either already know where to hunt, or have gotten to the end-game part of EQ.  With that said, what say we all ban together to make some updates to the hunting ground list??? Oh! And thanks for the advice on my original request. You all kick MUCHO booty! :p <br />

<br />
I’ve been out of the game for about 3 months now, and feel totally lost. Not sure if it’s worth coming back, as everyone I knew is too far ahead to need me in groups.<br />
I give you lots of credit for trying to come back after your lengthy hiatus.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Peye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I feel the exact same way, and that's probably going to be the reason why I will make the move over to EQ2 when it is finally released.  In the meantime, I'm going to see what happens. Guess I'll have to make new raid friends lol!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Excessium</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think Newtank had the right idea by staying at 55 and gaining mass AA's in KC. You screwed up by not asking when you were level 55. Now your 56...time to delevel.  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
joke btw...just in case.</div></div><hr />
