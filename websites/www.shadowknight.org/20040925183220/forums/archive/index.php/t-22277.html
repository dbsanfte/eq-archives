<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>khuan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Do you actually have to kill lhranc?? I mean if you do inivs turn in trick and get coin cant you jsut wait till marl is popped on his own and turn in coin without killing lhranc?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Paradox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You have to kill him to spawn Marl there in CoM.  The Marl used for running seals won't work.<br />
<br />
Lhranc is a cakewalk with PoP equipped people.  Bring a decent group or two and you'll take him out easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>khuan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">KK yay me new IC on the Seventh Hamster. Few things bout that. Yeah i'm in  Time guild so my tank had 11k hp and i have 9k but heres the quick and easy way to drop this sucker. I used 7 people, 2 warriors, beast, chanty, cleric, me, mage.<br />
<br />
EASY EASY way to kill him.'<br />
<br />
Use 2-3 warriors. Heres why<br />
<br />
1.) First tank engages (using his heaviest hitting 2hander, Fabled Exe Axe was his choice). Goes Furious Disc (Full autoriposte) took lhranc down to 75%<br />
 once his disc was up 2nd Tank engaged and went Furious as well, dropped lhranc down to 50% (mind you not a single heal was tossed on either of them and they were at full health the whole time. After that we rushed him and he dropped like nothing. Overkill to bring as much as i did but wanted to be safe.<br />
<br />
2.) I kinda freaked out reading the walk throu it said loot the coin of lhrancs corpse. That isnt true, there isnt any corpse, the coin is in your inventory as soon as you do turn in.<br />
<br />
But hell i think the quickest way to kill him safely get 5 warriors with some heavy hitting 2 handers and rinse repeat my method with the furious disc. he should drop like nothing and never need to heal anyone  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>SuDanger68</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Wow, gratz you're in a time guild and got 9k hp. And hey, T H A N K S  to post a strat how 7 time geared people can kill him sooooooo easy.<br />
<br />
Maybe you can post a strat how 7 time geared can kill some more Kunark mobs? like Talendor?<br />
<br />
Get the heaviest hitting 2hander and split your skull.<br />
<br />
thx.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>khuan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">WTF is your problem prick? Kunark era or not its an epic. I bet your one of the people who always ask Why the hell are you doing the sk epic when you have a bag full of weapons 10x better? I didnt post that strat on how to kill lhranc for time equipped people. its for ANYONE trying to get theyre epic. I have yet to see a post on this board about how hard lhranc is, and any kind of strat to kill him. I went by info from other players and what Allah's posts said about him. If you actually READ my post. I stated the warrior was using a Fabled Exe Axe dickweed. That is no where near time gear. Next time you feel like replying to a post pull your dick out of your ear and try posting something useful for other players as i was doing. KK STFU ..!.<br />
<br />
P.S. Obviously you dont know dick about other classes either, Dosent matter what gear you have, or how many hp you have. Warriors Furious disc (aka autoriposte) means they do not take a single hit for 12 secs, RIPOSTING all attacks done by the mob. I stated using the heaviest hitter they had to do the most dps DURING furious. Fakkin Nube go back to the bazaar</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>SuDanger68</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">?? Seems theres someone not getting any sarcasm. <br />
<br />
who the fuck cares about you'Re leet strat even if you don't use time weapon ...mr ohh i am super duper 11k hp and i have 9k.<br />
<br />
Maybe get the dick out of your mouth and start thinking with the brain you swallowed. You're post is as usefull as yourself. Any 11k war cunt and 9k braging sister can do that... :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Hachemalum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If I understand the posts on allys, Lhranc procs a 500 point lifetap. Does the ripostes from Furious negate his chance to proc? I am wondering, bc I know that you can still proc on a swing that is missed. (Not sure if the swing is actually missed or reduced to 0 damage bc of AC tho.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">1.  Its a DD not a lifetap, alla's info is wrong.<br />
2.  A player can proc on a miss, an NPC cant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>khuan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">which is exactly why any warrior with furious can do this REGARDLESS of hp or gear. SuDanger can kiss my ass for all I care. This strat will work for anyone, its not &quot;leet&quot; or anything else, its just a simple way of killing him without needing 3+ groups like allahs and everything else states. Sudanger, Take your sarcastic comments and bite me, Someone offers a strat that anyone (regardless of progression) can use and mock them? who the hell are you anyway?  This is quick, easy, and safe way of killing him. Which most people who are attempting a final IC quest would WANT so they dont wipe and have to either 1.) start over collecting all the crap or 2.) Hope to hell a GM will refund the turn in items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Khat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If each Warrior is knocking 25% HP a pop off Lhranc I guess an even l33t3r strat would be to just stand in the back while 4 Warriors make him dead.<br />
Would take what, 36 seconds?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Not to burst your bubble, but using furious warriors to tank lhranc has been the standard for 4 years.  No need to bring it to attention.  Its the standard.  And other guy, the epenis comments are old and tired.  Makes you look like a jealous kid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The info on Alla's is a bit dated, which is why the strats would be different nowadays.  The first time I helped with Lhranc (when the IC dropped off him), we had 60 - 70 people there, and at lvl 57, my monk at the time was the highest level toon there.  Lhranc just mowed through everyone, heheh.  Zerg at it's finest.  Even when I did mine, we wiped twice (I was highest lvl at 61).  Not sure how we'd do now, I haven't been asked to help with Lhranc for a while now.<br />
<br />
Congrats on the epic -- still the best looking wep around IMO.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Elkar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">How about 4 SK's and insta-DT him?  1 Ranger and 2 Wizards?  A good Vxed group?<br />
<br />
I think the point is, a strat on Lhranc at this point is posting how to tie a shoe.</div></div><hr />
