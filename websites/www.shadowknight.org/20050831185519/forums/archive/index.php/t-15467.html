When he was in Droga i guess you could just sit there and he would unspawn and respawn.  Ive sat for awile here and he doesnt do that in his FM location.  Does clearing the room pop him or what?? Any info would help lots!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pendaryn</div><div class="date">07-20-2003, 07:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">He spawns where one of the two iksar slaves spawn.  The other night I sat and camped them for a while, and discovered 2 things.<br />
<br />
The slave on the left (If you are sitting against the wall inbetween them, facing the tunnel out of the room), when hailed, gives you a message that talks about shackles (usually).  Killing him gives no faction hit.  In that place spawns another iksar garbed like a bandit from FoB, which gives you +Legion of Cabilis etc.  Or another shackle mob spawns.<br />
<br />
For the right slave...<br />
<br />
Each time I've been there, and hailed the iksar on the right, I've gotten a message about frothing at the mouth, etc etc.  He also occasionally buffs himself.  Killing him gives you negative legion of cabilis and negative scaled mystics (shaman guild).  Ooops.  And I've heard it's a big hit, but I haven't checked my faction since.  Unfortunately, it seems that after two nights of camping there, only tihs spawn is an actual place holder for Argest.  You must kill the iksar slave to get him to spawn.<br />
<br />
The second night I was there, I cleared the left spawn repeatedly, never got Argest (About 2 hours worth, 6 spawns I believe).  Not wanting another faction hit, I had a friend clear the right spawn, and got Argest on the next pop.  So yes, you do have to kill the iksar slaves.  Watch the faction hit.  I wasn't quite sure how high my scaled mystic faction was as a dark elf in the first place, now I might have to go do some faction work, again.</div></div><hr />

In fact I only had to kill the PH once to get him to spawn.  I timed it where he would spawn in the daytime, as that was his spawn time before.  I don't know if this was necessary but it worked none the less.</div></div><hr />

Argest spawns evening time, game time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wasn't true in my case.  Sat there for, hrrm, 3-4 hours the first night with Argest UP, but didn't get the keys.  <br />
<br />
The second night the mob never despawned/respawned that I saw.  Maybe they did in Droga, but I never saw them do that now that they're in FM.</div></div><hr />

Anyone have a loc for this place?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qedemel</div><div class="date">08-13-2003, 08:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The entrance to the cave you're looking for is around -2000, +2000 .... follow it down and around to the left where it will dead end in a room with 2 iksar and 5 or so gobbies, a couple of which will be key holders or their ph's.<br />
<br />
I killed the ikky on the left (left facing out from the cave, or right if you're facing in) repeatedly, and all I got was a crazed iksar (factioned like a manslayer), or an iksar slave (no faction hit).  I only killed the other one twice (faction hit on legion and mystics), and both times the exact same iksar respawned.<br />
<br />
This is frustrating the hell out of me .... I don't want to ruin my faction trying to complete the stupid quest, and my little alt is just too darn little to take this guy on (you can not pull him out of the cave, and the gobbies will join in if you try to whack him on his own)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caziel</div><div class="date">08-13-2003, 02:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I tried waiting for the two iksar to despawn and one respawn as Argest but they didn't. Was there for about an hour and half waiting. Got tired of waiting and killed em both. Took about 3 kills before Argest spawned. He was on the right hand side looking towards the tunnel (away from wall). <br />
<br />
No huge change in faction from what I've seen. I was warmly before and after the session.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I went ahead and took the faction hit from the iksar slave a third time, and guess what : that's right, Argest spawned.<br />
<br />
Went to Droga with a shrink potion, shrank and invised, trucked on down to the jail, and got my tome without a single problem.<br />
