Don't care about super fast exp.  I'm looking more for a place to train my skills and try out my abilities and a place that is fun.  Most of the bulks I hunted in Echo, (and learned feign splitting on), are going lt. blue.   I didn't just want to do a DL grind.  As long as I'm fighting dk. blues and above I'm not worried about amount of exp.<br />
<br />
I was thinking of either Mistmoore or Kaesora to get more exp vs. undead.  Any opinions on these choices or any other ideas you might have are exactly what I am looking for  <br />
<br />
Also:  I've done very little fear kiting except a little in DSP.   Should I be using this tactic more, and if so where should I go?<br />
<br />
Also Also:  Feel free to check out my Magelo and suggest any place (group or solo) that I should be hunting for possible upgrades.<br />

Thanks,</div></div><hr />

There is only one true answer...Katta Castium Graveyard<br />
<br />
Who doesn't like the idea of spawned mobs with no add if you don't move.  Use your undead fear and you can med mana faster than you use it.  I had fungi so I regened too but even without this is a good spot.  With BE gloves snare is free you set to fear kite once you know where the spawn spots are.  Add ldon undead nuke in there and you solid.<br />
<br />
1st time go with a friend to make sure you ready.....careful guards outside are kos to some and DO NOT run around the mobs are spawned you need to walk till you spawn one and then fight in place let it come to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kazral Shadowthirst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">OT was a good place for me until 43 soloing from what I remember. And yes, now is the time to utilize fear kiting (36 was when I did). Before then, one can simply lifetap but now, you just fear kite until in the 60s when almost nothing can be feared for exp. (I still solo in SF because pick-up groups suck and because there are lots of spell drops there)<br />
<br />
Technically, one can solo in SF without too many things going light blue and green til 60 or 61. Some things still are dark blue to a 65 and can be fear kited by a 52.<br />
<br />
At 43, do spires until 50 if your brains don't pop out from boredom. It is still good exp.</div></div><hr />

Fun thing to do. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Probably because, at 35, the DL skellies are probably a bit rough...<br />
<br />
They were still decent xp for me until 52, and an easy solo.  Around 49 it becomes a lot simpler because you get Dooming Darkness, though I've heard that they've been patched to no longer run on low health.    I don't know if you could solo it yet or not, but if you have a shammy friend/guildie around the same level, you might want to hunt City of Mist stables or Pyramid room (aka temple) for your Greenmist scrolls and his epic scrolls.  <br />
<br />
You could also probably do fairly well at the Fort in Gunthak, or even around the entrance to Dulak and the first boat or so.<br />
<br />
I did DL skellies and CoM from around 45 to 52 or so, then started on Dulak boats and moved slowly up to the Armory (start at the Stormwave, move up to the Dandolak as they start to light blue out, then move to the Armory).  At around 55/56, I started xping in PoN at the hedge most of my time, did 55 - 57 there.  I also had a Shammy partner the whole time, and we've learned each other's playstyles pretty well.</div></div><hr />
