The last few times I've logged in my SK, I've noticed a huge decrease in the frequency of my procs....typically with mental corruption.  I use that buff all the time. I have my stats buffed the same each night as I tend to group with the same peeps each night.  And recently, it procs ALOT less.  It's weird, sometimes I'll click it off and rebuff it, and it fixes it for a while, then it stops procing again. And with 275 dex, I know i'm not procing as much as I used to.  Anyway, just curious as to whether anyone else has noticed a difference in proc frequency.<br />
Thanks guys</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gixxia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">D'oh, meant to say that I know something's changed because I used to keep pretty good mana flowing while pulling and tanking (which I usually am).  But now, since MC doesn't proc near as much, I find myself exhausting my mana after a while.  That used to never happen.  It's very frustrating. :confused:</div></div><hr />

But that doesn't explain why it's happening all of a sudden =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Renmazuo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've had the same thing happen since the mid July patch.  I notice it mostly because I always use KEI and Mental Corruption and have been procing less ever since then.  Since I usually solo and all my buffs are pretty much always the same, I tend to notice that I am running out of mana after three or four kills.  Probably just SOE doing &quot;class balance&quot; issues since &quot;SKs aren't supposed to have unlimited mana pool&quot;  or whatever.  Drives me nuts having to actually med up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gixxia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yes, it's extra annoying since I'm usually pulling / tanking for my group and they get ticked if I whine about having no mana.  I hate stealth nerfs. I realize they are constantly tweaking classes and to ask them to announce each little change is dumb, but stuff like this drives me crazy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I haven't seen any difference, procs are streaky sometimes you get more mana than you need sometimes you dont get enough</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gixxia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Believe me,<br />
I have mental corruption up ALL the time, and the proc rate has been changed. I've used it since 54.  I dunno about our life tap procs.  I have shroud of chaos but till I get some more AA's I won't use it as in my current state it's a piece of s**t =)  Just dinged 65 a while ago and am working on AA's now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Duke Xerro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It has been procing less, I hardly use it anymore, I would rather use Shroud of Chaos, which procs a lot more, and just rely on using less mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Duke Evyl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Here are some related issues that will help with mana.  I am a 65 sk on brell serilis. I prefer shroud of chaos to MC anyday. This is how i compensate for the mana loss from not using MC. Have up the best sk aggro spell hehe Clinging darkness level 15 snare cost of 20 mana. You have to cast twice on a mob and you pretty much have the aggro the whole fight. if you loose aggro cast again and you should have aggro. Its almost like a summons spell. But i also recommend that you keep up uncle festering darkeness for cc purposes.  I rarely find myself OOM or slowing a group down when i am tanking and pullin. If you have aa in soul abrasion your proc from shroud of chaos is another huge aggro.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ashrai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I use Mental Corruption ( 'cause it's all I have at this level), and last night in an exp group it was proccing like mad- much more than I can remember before. Perhaps a stealth fix in the patch?</div></div><hr />
