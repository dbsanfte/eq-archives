<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Iamask</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Working on reports in seru, just want to know if it has a bigger chance that report drops from higher lv of building is greater than the ground lv? Is it doable by myself and a healer type?<br />
Thanks :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mathas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The reports only drop off of specific guards.<br />
<br />
Eye - A vigilum cohortis<br />
Heart - A lictor of the heart<br />
Hand - A signeferi of the hand<br />
Shoulder - A custus armorum<br />
<br />
The drops are rare enough that it would be hard to tell a difference between the ground level and the upper level, as most people I've seen just move to upper and farm there.<br />
<br />
And yes, you and a healer could do it, provided you're careful with your pulls.  Slow is nice, and cc is nice(pathing isn't the best), but it's certainly doable without.  We've taken 4 level 60 guards at once with sk/shamam/echanter, and barely broke a sweat.<br />
<br />
Be prepared to spend a LOT of hours there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Karmie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">They drop only on the top floors , drop rates on reports have been recently nerfed too. They drop alot more than they used to now</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Iamask</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for the replys.<br />
Will other mobs in the building drop reports except<br />
Eye - A vigilum cohortis<br />
Heart - A lictor of the heart<br />
Hand - A signeferi of the hand<br />
Shoulder - A custus armorum<br />
?<br />
<br />
Cuase one time when we were moving in, one of the mob on ground floor dropped 1 report, sounds wierd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Traxl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Only the listed mobs drop reports.  I have noticed Lictor's wandering around the ground floor areas before.  The mobs inside the Arx are Custos Armorum's, so you end up with quite a few Shoulder reports on the way to killing Seru.</div></div><hr />
