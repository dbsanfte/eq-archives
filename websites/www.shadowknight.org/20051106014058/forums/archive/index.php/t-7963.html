We decided to start completely over, as my 37 ranger....BAH and her 36 druid....BAH BAH....doesnt seem fun anymore.<br />
<br />
I am thinking of playing a Shadowknight and she is wanting to play a Shaman. <br />
<br />
What we are looking for is a GREAT duo team. Would this be it? Would there be other combos better. <br />
<br />
We are both very open, and willing to try any classes (other than ranger or druid 8), but mostly we want to optimize our 4 hours a night we get to play. We want to have tons of fun, as little downtime as possible, and lvl at a reasonable rate.<br />
<br />
Looking forward to you veterans giving me input on the issue, and wanna thank you ahead of time 8))<br />

<br />
both the shaman and the sk are VERY versitle classes.  SK can snare, fear, tank, lifetap, add a pet, do decent DPS FD pull and shaman can slow, ghetto root mez, heal, buff, DoT like crazy, summon a pet.  You have a winning combo on your hands.<br />
<br />
enchanter and sk are also nice, but alas no heals, so at 61+ it would be moot.</div></div><hr />

They bring tons to the table as you porgress. Haste, slow, dots, healing, sow, pet, stat buffs, nukes all make life much easier. So set up SK/shammy and have fun.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Shammy also retains great soloing skill should either of you have some spare time and want to go solo on your own.<br />
<br />
a close second (imho) would be enchanter. Doesn't have heals but can do pretty well with the runes or the series of spells that has a built in dmg abosorber and attack increase (the name eludes me atm... sorry). They then provide superior haste, but inferior slow (to shaman), and mana regen. along with mez, should it be required. Soloability varies according to level for chanters tho.<br />
<br />
I would be quite happy with either, personally.</div></div><hr />

They're so versatile its just sick.<br />

Oh, and Slow (plus a little haste thrown in) &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;All else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maniacles</div><div class="date">11-07-2002, 03:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sk shaman is a great pair up!  Start leveling together, and then add lfg people as time goes on.<br />
<br />
The only problem is.....<br />
<br />
No real mana regen early on....<br />
<br />
DPS can definitely be an issue between 40 and 54....in that without a good twinker weapon (ebon mace/granite face grinder quality), your shaman will be wondering why he's carrying the sk.<br />
<br />
Of course, between 0 and 30, the sk with moss will be carrying the shaman.....<br />
<br />
My personal favorite combo, though, would be necro shaman.  There are plenty of melees out there to fill out your group, and with necro and shaman, you have all your bases covered...cc, healing, mana regen, damage if necessary.  Use jobobber in a pinch as a tank.  The nice thing about that combo is that both classes CAN solo, but shore up each other's weaknesses very nicely.<br />
<br />
If I were starting from scratch with a pair, I'd start up an ogre shaman and iksar necro.<br />
<br />
Another cool combo would be beastlord necro!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paradox</div><div class="date">11-07-2002, 04:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree 100% - SK and Shaman are probably the best pair.<br />
<br />
I've played with clerics, shamans, druids, etc and shaman comes out on top every time.<br />
<br />
Has anyone paired up with a bard?<br />
Any thoughts on SK/Bard duo?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Duke Vendric Ravenkrest</div><div class="date">11-07-2002, 04:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would suggest troll or iksar shaman for the regen, to spam cannibalise. And keep my guild shaman motto in mind: Only a bad shaman meds.<br />
<br />
And for SK if you go iksar shaman, go iksar SK. If you go troll shaman, go troll or ogre. DE, Erud, Gnome, Human SK are all nice, yes, but you don't need mad mana to duo with a shaman. You need mad melee and hp. Ogre being unstunnable will have advantages. Troll and iksar won't need as many heals. Troll and Ogre both have great melee stats. Let's not mention conveniently close starting cities, or the same starting city as your shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Duke Vendric Ravenkrest</div><div class="date">11-07-2002, 04:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Paired with a bard? No. But, I was in a SK, WAR, WAR, BRD group in frenzy room of lower guk at level 44 average amongst us. kept the place clear. It's evern more horrifying how powerful a bard can be in high levels. And, get a 60+ bard with all his songs and Ssra+ gear, and wow...<br />
<br />
Another good combo, oddly, is SK + Ranger at high levels. Well, on snare/rootable mobs...</div></div><hr />

if your goals arent that high then any duo will work based on preference as long as theres some sort of healing</div></div><hr />

We both started trolls. He's a shaman, I'm a sk.<br />
<br />
Years later and we're still taking camps that make other people boggle.<br />
<br />
It's alot of fun when a guildie asks what I'm up to on an xp night and I tell them where Moksurea an I are going.. &quot;You cant do that, you'll need a full group!&quot;<br />
<br />
We are a full group thx.<br />

Moksurea is the most shiznitest shamantastic shaman there is tho.. i want his troll babies.</div></div><hr />

I'd prefer mage, ranger or monk for the tank, because more damage = dead faster and each of those classes outdamages a SK.<br />

We've been able to do things that no other duo I know of can do.  Like when he needed spells we duo'd the Cliff Golems in OT.  There isn't a dungeon that we haven't ripped up together.  Lately we have been doing the clockworks/tins in the Factory in PoI.  Mad exp I tell you mad.  For all the reasons so well put forth previously, this is the best combo I have seen in action.</div></div><hr />

<br />
- no snare (non issue for SKs obviously)<br />
- no evac (druids do have their days)<br />
- haste is not as effective as encs, esp at low levels (shamans do not get any haste till 29, shamans really come into their power at 50s)<br />
<br />
<br />
I agree with the above posters.  Encs are also good.  So are necromancers, druids, bards, rogues, clerics and even mages and wizards in the right places.<br />
<br />
Sks are an extremely versatile class.  Our biggest weakness is damage output, but we counter that with pulling ability, pets, taps, dark and fear ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
But, enchanters have superior haste, their slow is only MARGINALLY below shamans, there runes/bedlam series of hp buffers is like a premature heal, they have damage shields for lower levels, can solo with pet or charm, then mem blur to have the lowbie kill and get exp, ac, strength, and mind buffs, can mes when things go wrong, you name it.  Close second to Shaman? Or the best?  Just imagine a DC pet and blur.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DaginSK</div><div class="date">11-08-2002, 09:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, this is semi-offtopic.. BUT!<br />
<br />
6 level 65 SKs with all spells could very well be the best 1 group combo in game.<br />
<br />
Specifically, with Zevfeers bite, you get:<br />
-6 people casting bite, resulting in 600 mana per minute, or FT60.<br />
-6 people casting bite, resulting in 1200 hps per minute, or 120 hp/tic regen.<br />
<br />
If each of the 6 SKs is using Pact of hate, that is another 15 mana per tic regen.<br />
If each of the 6 SKs is using fungi tunic, with regen3, that offsets most of PoH damage.<br />
If each of the 6 SKs is also using Bond of Death, this offsets PoH damage clearly, raising our hp regen to well over 100 per tic. (yes, this is a dot, but I consider it a regen effect in this situation).<br />
<br />
Keep in mind, the above effects are ONLY regen. effects.  This does not include casted taps, casted DoTs, weapon procs, SoD procs..etc.  Also, FT items aren't taken into account..which will add to mana regen.<br />
<br />
-6 level 49 necro pets, each providing around 20 dps?..maybe more not sure..this is assuming they are hasted using our new pet buff.<br />
<br />
The group now has 12 melees, ~75 FT standing, over 100 hp/tic regen.<br />
<br />
Then, you have the advantage of having the DPS of 6 level 65 melees in your group, as well as 6 pets.  Also you have the advantage of very precise agro control.  Each SK could tank for a bit, FD agro off to another SK, regen hps etc.  You could cycle tank this way with very little danger of any one SK dying.<br />
<br />
Also, if each SK has SA3, SCF3, Theft of life3, Maxxed HT AA, each wielding a decent tap weapon (goldenrod/SoS), each using both spears...well..you get the picture.<br />
<br />
Yes, this group is not feasible on most servers (if any), but..if this group ever did materialize, it would be very efficient, xp would fly, and it would quite obviously be the ultimate in cool seeing 12 skeletons beating the shit out of stuff.<br />
<br />
OH, to dream....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nocifer Deathblade</div><div class="date">11-08-2002, 09:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nice thought Dagin. <br />
<br />
I didn't even think of that. It could be a formible group full of SK's plus they all combined can HT for 45,000 hp INSTANT if needed with maxed out SCF and UT along with /disc.<br />
<br />
Your math is little way off for ZB. :) It doesn't give each SK 600 mana NET per min. It gives us 400 mana cuz we each PAY 200 mana to cast ZB.<br />
<br />
lvl 44 necro pet with 55% haste already does 25 dps. I parsed.. I dread to think what lvl 49 pet with 65% haste dps would be. I wager it would be between 30-35.<br />
<br />
I thought there is a limit of 5 pets on one mob on given time? Did it get changed or only a myth?<br />
<br />
DOT stacking code from several patches ago is a blessing for a team of SK. :)<br />
<br />
I gotta try to train an elite SK unit in my guild. :D<br />
<br />
One MAJOR drawback of this is..  Too few SKs per server to find and form up. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kharzhoul</div><div class="date">11-08-2002, 11:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The other problem is simply the amount of damage an unslowed mob does these days. If you have a SK proc a slowing weapon, it would work. Other wise - it would be ugly.<br />
<br />
A cleric I am friends with died the other day in valor and lost his level. I decided to grab a mage and kill 1 or 2 mobs to help get him his level back.<br />
<br />
Ouch<br />
<br />
Ouch<br />
<br />
Ouch<br />
<br />
With full raid buffs I am around 6k hps - so I am a decent tank. However, the amount of damage unslowed mobs pump out these days is just amazing. So - I wonder if the sks could survive a few rounds and transfer agro quickly enough.<br />
<br />
/Shrug<br />
<br />
Dunno, but it sure would be fun to try!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, I haven't used mem blur to level my SK.  Instead letting the SK pull, even solo, except for haste/KEI.  But that was just so I could learn more about SKs.  Let her actually solo with no buffs, pull with no aid, and group without PL, etc, cause I know if I don't, I won't really learn how to play an SK.  And what fun would that be?<br />
<br />
But when I'm PLing, the only thing that really kills me is spells, especially DoTs.  Enchanter/SK combo is really very good at mitigating damage.<br />
<br />
However, mezz doesn't work very well to 'save the day', because an SK misses out on a ton of their damage if they don't dot, especially if the SK has constant KEI.<br />
<br />
And /agree with the other enchanter/SK poster /hug gate/FD combo for emergencies.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ps. with chanter u guys can do fear kite fairly ez though, ie. chanter pull with tash n let his pet jump on mob, at the same moment u snare it n chanter fear it ... repeat again n again mob oftenly dies fast</div></div><hr />

nowadays, i'm having a little trouble keeping the aggro off of him as his damage output increases (on those increasingly rare occasions that i do actually tank), and i sometimes wish he could heal me.  but i wouldn't trade him.  we have too much fun strategizing to overcome these inconveniences.  <br />

however, i will say that things are getting increasingly difficult, and i'm not sure how much longer this duo is really gonna work efficiently.  might have to resort to /lfg.  <br />

I basically fall in line as a 3rd pet and just focus on putting out maximum damage.  I've even tagged along with 3 necros.  <br />
<br />
Necro's can heal, darkness, fear, have great pets, and pump mana if needed.  Oh, not to forget, in a screw-up, they can also rez.  <br />
<br />
I'd consider Shaman a about even with a Necro, and I've found duo with a skilled high level Bard is very nice as well.    My choice is a Necro.<br />
<br />
It depends on what is available but to me comes down to Fear Kiting with Necro or Bard.  Or if it's fear-kiting with Shaman assistance.  <br />
<br />
I have pretty much walked away from soloing and duoing.  I never enjoyed it.  I prefer raiding or a full exp group.</div></div><hr />

Yes, I was not counting the mana we are outlaying..was merely pointing out the total mana inlay for the group per minute..which is 600 from 6 castings of zevfeers.  Yes, we do expend more mana than we are getting back....I just wanted to separate the total mana inlay from everything else.  Also, bond of death does cost mana as well.. and would retract from overall mana regen..etc.<br />
<br />
If someone wants to work all the nitty gritty numbers out, I would love to see our 'observed' mana regen and hp regen.<br />
<br />
Kharzhoul, I think you are right for some zones, but it also depends on gear and level.  This group could do fine in CoD, or HoH for xp.  Remember, there will be MAD tapping going on at any one time.  This group generates incredible mana.. more so than any other group you can put together I think..simply because bite is unique among spells in that it returns mana instantly, and endlessly stacks.  Necros can Mindwrack, but I dont think more than one wrack can be in effect at one time..making it not as useful when stacked.  <br />
Possibly a group with bard/necro/SK/chanter could pump out more mana at a constant rate, but the damage would be much less than with 6 SKs I think.<br />
<br />
Anyway, it would be nice to see in action, just for the coolness factor.</div></div><hr />

I do agree it depends on gear and the zone. Right now I am just thinking about pov (I am addicted to that zone) and you really have to have a slower there.<br />
<br />
With slow in place, I would love to see the 5 sk, 1 bst group. Would be a blast!</div></div><hr />

<br />
BST have a desent slow at 22. With my BST I see tons of differance. Then put on the Epics and you have a great combo. And they get a mana/hp regen AND regen. Makes life way easy. Pet damage is awesome when placed right. And at low levels there Inner fire heals will make heals no problem. With my ogre BST. I can heal from one bubble of health to full on 1.2 bubbles of mana. And that was at 17. So easy to do. And they are a great solo class so add in SK and you got a wonderful team. <br />
<br />
I say BST&lt; shaman. But that is just my opinion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
BTW a good shaman can stack 100+ DPS in DoTs, Epic, Bone of Bertox, bane, ancient bane, poison, and the new spells(unsure of how good). Not counting ~35 DPS in buffed pet damage, if you give it 2 weapons.<br />
<br />
So basically, the only use I have for beastlords is 7 hp 7 mana a tick, or the better PoP version. Sorry beastlords =/</div></div><hr />

<br />
Only problem is that both classes grow in Power when you get higher being not so good at lower levels, especally shammys get really good once you get to 58, the Mini CH really rocks for mana...you are FM in no time and can heal your SK very well then...<br />
<br />
I think both classes require some Skill to play them good, not like Necros where you fear the Mob, add a DoT and tell Pet to attack. So that Combo is good if you like to havr action while playing :)<br />

<br />
We just can't do it for very long amounts of time (barring FT 15 + Tranquility or some other type of mana regen).<br />
<br />
600/400 spears, zevfeers bite, touch of inny/voltais (I love the new taps; I'm all about this fast cast theme) or both, Aura of hate (or pain, but hate &gt;&gt;&gt; pain), Blood of hate, and that's 6 fast damage spells there, if not all 8 slots. Add to it that on raids, Ignite blood, blood of hate, and Bond of death stick pretty often.<br />
<br />
<br />
We got some mean, invisible, and useful DPS spells.</div></div><hr />

Shit they're tough!<br />

Necro can fear/dot/reverse lifetap if my wife looses a lil' health.<br />
Chanter has haste for pet, clarity, and slow/dot.<br />
<br />
I can't wait until they're level 45+ :)<br />

SK-wise? Shaman or Druid you can't go wrong :)</div></div><hr />
