<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Blackmerlin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was reading about all the trouble highend sk have in god trials and the gap between warrior/sk getting larger and larger and was thinking about a an defensive way , that is sk-like but doesnt gimp old content.<br />
<br />
Here is were i came up with the idea of an forced defensive proc.<br />
It would be a instant cast (or nearly instant 0.1 - 0.5 sec) buff spell (or disc) that would turn our inate proc buff to proc on every hit we take from the target we are fighting. This buff (or disc) would consume 1000 mana per tick (starting at the moment where the buff is cast) and stop any manaregeneration through buffs(kei,voq,tranq,pot,...),rods,procs and recourse effects as long as it lasts.<br />
This buff can be clicked off, it will then start to fade till the tick (which consumed the 1000 mana, is finished) - (if it would be a disc - it could be turned off and still would last till tick is finished).<br />
<br />
Recast time of this buff would be 6 seconds -&gt; you would be able to keep this up as long as your manapool lasts. As one relative long duration or in many 'one tick' - steps.<br />
<br />
Its most efficient use would be with shroud of chaos/black shroud + soul abrasion since manaregeneration wouldnt be possible with mc proc line and it would only be a short duration dps increase for the cost of an whole manapool and only for the one sk who is actually tanking.<br />
<br />
This buff would have one purpose - to help sk slightly against spike dmg - as it would be a nearly instant turn on/off ability - that wouldnt be able to be abused as to my knowledge.<br />
<br />
What do you think about this ?</div></div><hr />

If it's mitigation through 75hp lifetap procs every time the mob hits, it's not mitigation.<br />
<br />
If that's not what you meant, then you need to clear it up a bit, as what I read doesn't sound like something I'd ever use.</div></div><hr />

I had 10111HP and ~2200AC at the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Blackeagle Dwimmerlaik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I love how with 15 time or time-level loots, you, a tank class (in theory), lived for less than the duration of a rogue/monk/bard/whatever melee riposte disc or parry disc, despite the cleric healing you via spell once, divine arbitration once, and having a DI fire off for the full 8k heal<br />
<br />
and your aggro would have been shitty too, you weren't even able to get a single spell off through that pounding (granted you only got 2 tries)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Blackmerlin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I was not suggesting an equivalent to defensive, but more of an short duration fighting style that would allow to reduce damageincome by a variable number (depending on aa's - soulabrasion,scf,theft of life,...).<br />
If soulabrasion kicks in on every hit we take while this mode was active, this would be over 200 hitpoints healed on every hit taken and on a number of these hits there would be additional healing from crits. Looking at the mobs parsed in this trials (see Brael's parse in general) that would be roughly 10-20% less dmg taken in bad combat rounds with the occasional crits healing up to 50% per hit.<br />
I think that would be enough to stay alive but not make it to easy with 2 healers behind you.<br />
If this wont be enough there would still be the possibility to build in an increased crit rate up to effectivly doubling the received healing, but i think it wouldnt be balanced with 500 hitpoints healed per hit.<br />
<br />
<br />
At least these encounters arent disigned to be fought with only one healer in group, i think soe wanted this to require more healing since one more slot given to a healing class is one less slot given to a dmg class and this results in more time needed per instanced dungeon. Which is what they sure were aiming for, since they realised that hard ldon adventures could be done in under 10 minutes - while they had planned them to require 45 minutes at least. How much of this will change with more and more god loot coming in the game, will need to be seen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thing is, it wouldn't help much against damage spikes.  Worst case scenario... a mob quads you for 2k * 4... 8k in one round.  You just got 800 hp back off of that.  It's still not enough to keep you alive through the next round.  Defensive could shave 2500 off that quad, easy.  Defensive shaves off a percentage of the mobs DI.... ie, it gets more effective the harder the mob hits (in general).  This ability would be a fixed amount healed... would make it highly effective in emergency situations against fast hitting, low damage mobs.... but barely help at all against the high end mobs we need help with.  It'd also leave you oom and helpless in 30 seconds or so when you ran oom and it wore off (assuming you've got 5k+ mana and you're fm when you fire it off).... and that mob is still quadding you for crazy damage.<br />
<br />
I like the concept of fixing our tanking issues with some type of spell.  But this is not it.<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;since they realised that hard ldon adventures could be done in under 10 minutes &lt;&lt;<br />
<br />
That only happens if you get damn lucky, no matter how uber you are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Blackmerlin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">To get hit 4 times in a quad for full dmg is not common, except you are really not equipped for the encounter you are facing.<br />
It may happen once in a while, but then ou would still have leechcurse and leechtouch at your disposal to add another 1k of life back to your pool, counting in possible crits/Tol on 4 hits taken with maybe a modified critrate while under this buff you could expect to get back nearly 3 k in no time on this rarily occasion.<br />
<br />
Sure if you get hit more then once or twice with such an 8k round, you would need luck on DI + the dmg absorbing cleric buffs + some healers that are on their toes.<br />
But as i said i wasnt suggesting defensive for knights, i just wanted to share an idea i had for an way to slightly compensate dmg taken - only in or just after such bad combat rounds for a short duration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gobgob frum Grobb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You can't count on spell crits to save your life - that's just more RNG generated crap that we're subject too with the damage spikes anyhow.<br />
<br />
Infact you can't count on lifetaps at all - I get the crap interupted out of me during mountain trial-trash fights so cast lifetaps are a moot point - they'll only heal a fraction of one hit from these mobs anyhow.<br />
<br />
I'm casting festering or dooming on a mob to pull or when it's inc to gain aggro when I'm tanking and hope it sticks first time because I know my opportunity for spell/melee aggro or dmg during a fight as MT is just not there anymore.<br />
MT melee damage from the front won't gain you aggro during these fights and spells are interrupted regularly.<br />
<br />
Somekind of lifetap-defensive ability isn't going to cut the mustard unless it truly scales with the damage that we are taking which bring you back to a defensive/mitigation solution of sorts.<br />
<br />
When I die on these screwed abortions of fucked up game design I can scroll back thru my dmg while sitting at my bindpoint and clearly see the damage spike that killed me, .... nice big burst of 4-digit red hits in amongst a smattering of red/white hits/misses.</div></div><hr />
