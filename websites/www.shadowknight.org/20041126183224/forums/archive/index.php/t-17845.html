<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Burek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First....yes, I have read the long sticky at the top of this forum, it it lists a ton of good info...<br />
<br />
That being said, most of the zones that I go to, like PoJ, are deserted.  So...where do you guys normally grp that has at least 20+ ppl in the zone?<br />
<br />
<br />
thx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Burek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">anyone?  where do all the groups stick around on your server?<br />
<br />
<br />
I logged into PoJ the other day and there were 7 ppl...  =/<br />
<br />
<br />
I've been doing ldon lately and have been having fun, but the xp is way slow, let alone the time it takes to get a good group going.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nambkab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just go solo somewhere like HHK nobles.  Easy xp, and will tide you over to 55 with ease.  Kill the guards on second floor, dark noble, fear noble, kill noble, rinse and repeat.  Works great and with KEI you can kill with only downtime being to wait for respawn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Burek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">thx for the tip, are there any places that you got to for groups though?  it's much more fun</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nambkab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think I did a few PoJ basement groups at that level, but I made those groups then went down there.  You might could get a group in PoD, but I never did much in that zone till I was high enough to tank in the courtyard.  PoN might be ok.  I believe I tanked at the waterfall at that level.<br />
<br />
Best xp though = HHK</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Putrid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Initiates in Gunthak should be soloable at that level.  <br />
Often time you can zone into each of the teir one planes and ask if anyone wants you.  Being in a zone, seems to make you chances of getting in better.  Best is knowing where the groups usually hang out and just going there and asking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>AadinyeDuathiel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Not sure what server you are on, but on Xegony, I did 50 to 55 in PoJ.   About 9 times out of 10 I would get a group when I did a /shout LFG.  After dinging 55 I started having more difficulty, but usually I could get a group at exit, Captains room, and rarely the basement.  <br />
<br />
The times I couldn't get a group, I would try and form a group from others that were LFG.  One time we had a full group without a healer but did ok till we could get one.  Also, I found that xp went best if we had 6 in group, so if you get a group of 5 and someone is LFG but you don't need the class, grab them anyway so you can get the best xp.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Taeluuan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">52-55 were hard levels for exp groups for me as well. I believe i stayed in KC till 53 or 54 got a little slow might wanna try going plane to plane and shouting lfg more than likely you will be little more than dps at first but you can build a good rep starting out that way. If you ever want to do the OT hammer quest do it before you hunt inside KC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Anash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">How do you single pull the nobles ? I never fought them but I figured the bards and nobles would be social.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nambkab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If I remember correctly you can single pull at 52 without worrying about social aggro.  If social aggro is a problem on nobles or bards, what I did was to tag one with dark, other comes faster, fear the non-snared one, then fear the snared one and kill it, may need to refear each one once, and it can be kinda hairy, but once you have done it once, you will be able to do it again.  Once the spawn is split, you can pull as soon as one pops and not have to worry about the other one (it won't have spawned yet).  For some reason I think the bards always came single for me, but I didn't kill them much because the spawn time is so long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>UnholyWarrior</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Found &lt;font face='Courier New'&gt;&lt;b&gt;/w all xx yy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; will give you info on where various levels are... For example:<br />
<br />
&lt;font face='Courier New'&gt;&lt;b&gt;/w all 50 55&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;<br />
<br />
will return where all the [non-anon; non-roleplay] lvl 50 thro 55 (inclusive) folks online are...<br />
<br />
Guildie turned me on to this; have used it a bit as I level [although not very scientific; sometimes most people are in the bazaar :)]</div></div><hr />
