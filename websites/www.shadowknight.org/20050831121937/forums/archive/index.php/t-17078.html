<br />
<br />
Do you think if we get enough people to /feedback that they would add an animation to the Greenmist ? Imean casters have all kinds of items that have particle effects... and bards... they are walking lagg monsters they have so many. So, what would be the harm in giving a sword that is a reward for a hard quest a particle animation, something like a green mist like cloud that hovers about the blade...<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, just an idea, let me know what you think (how knows, maybe everyone likes it without one, but I myself think us melee type people get shafted in the way of particle effects... especially since us SKs have such a hard time completing our epic)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jergory</div><div class="date">10-03-2003, 12:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i totally agree with you on the particle affect thing.   innoruuk's curse is without a doubt the hardest epic in the game.   i am , at the moment, goling thru the greenmist quest. currently im camping CoM as i am on the last khukri quest and need the 3 scrolls from the stables area ( extremely easy for me to solo by the way, level 55 SK)  only bytch is waiting for the spawns.  but yes the idea of a floating pale green mist cloud engulfind the blade of the greenmist is really quite appealing to me, i could only imagine how UBAR it would look when running  with the greenmist equipped... come on, why not sony?  show us knights of the shadows some love.</div></div><hr />

<br />
WRONG! Just ask any epiced mage how hard was it to get to the 7th Isle of PoA. That is, if you can find an epiced mage, which is not that easy. Also, I'd have to say the Necro epic is nearly as hard as the SK one too. It's a trivial matter to get a Blade of Abrogation from PoA compared to getting the cloak (rare drop) off the Keeper of Souls in PoA. Only three hard parts of the SK epic are:<br />
1) getting a group to farm the Hole with you<br />
2) getting a piece of Decrepit Hide from PoH (if they still drop...)<br />
3) Killing Lhranc (but I'd have to say, he by himself is comparable to the Keeper of Souls, arguably easier cause he has no regen and doesn't despawn for hours, so if you're undermanned, ya can always kamakazi-zerg him.<br />
<br />
Granted, there are some classes that got easy epics. To name a few: Druids, Monks, Clerics, and Beastlords.<br />

Add the wizard epic to the list of easy epics, Phinny is about the only real obstacle.<br />
<br />
In regards to Greenmist I'd like to see a new quest to augment it it.  Greenmist has fallen behind a bit as better PoP weapons have come about but I still do use mine as an aggro tool.  Maybe give us a quest to up its stats and at the same time give a particle effect too.  Maybe have to get items from Ssra, Plane of Fear (note Greenmist itself does not require planar access to get), and maybe Nightmare as well.<br />
<br />
This could be related sorta to Epic 2.0.  Maybe not to give us a new item so to speak but to augment the one we have.  No the stupid LDON augments do NOT count.  What possible reason would I possibly want a proc affect on my Staff of the Four anyway?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nazgaull</div><div class="date">10-03-2003, 03:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought Greenmist originally had some animation with it but was removed early on?<br />
<br />
There is a Pic of it being wielded by an Iksar, on Everlore which is quite out-dated.<br />
<br />
The Pic shows a greenish-mist like animation-effect as the Iksar is swinging the sword.  Don't know if the animation is from the sword though, or some effect from a caster not seen in the picture.<br />
<br />
But with all the Lore behind the Greenmist and how it come to be (the Plague of the Green Mist and all) I am surprised there is not already some wierd greenish haze like cloud about the sword, even when it is being held idle in the hand.</div></div><hr />

Its a long involved quest (at least it was for me) with a history behind it. <br />

It would be fitting.</div></div><hr />

Hmm...this could be done pretty easily I would think, at least up to Luclin standards. Just make another &quot;final&quot; step in the quest, where one of the oracles says something to the effect of &quot;We've received another vision. Journey to the final stronghold of the shissar, bring back a brick of greenish ore, the blood and saliva of a shissar and the heart of the emperor, and we shall further enhance the Greenmist.&quot; It would stay entirely in-quest for content and story, and still be a weapon worth using for a while (if done right).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">yuggoth</div><div class="date">10-07-2003, 10:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Considering it took over a year of us early iksar SK's bitching, whining, pissing and moaning just to get them to finally implement a working final khukri quest (and likely an easier one than they had originally planned), I doubt they will ever add another stage to it.  They have never even finished the iksar warrior and necro quest lines.<br />
<br />
And no, it has never had a particle effect, nice as it would have been.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are more mages with Epic then SK.  that should be first clue as to which is easier.  I helped my roommate do his epic from beginning to end and it took less time then mine and he even admitted was easier then sk.  <br />
<br />
Mages that whine their epic is hardest simply because of the PoA part need to go smash their face on a brick wall and shut up.  <br />
<br />
As for particle effects, won't happen.  ever.  period.  The quest was a blast i thought except the test of pain-in-the-ass collecting those ten pages.  Outside of that, the whole thing was very fun for me.  Soloed the quest except mirror which i got from a guildy since i didn't want to burn OT faction.  All sk's should do the quest for the greenmist imho.  Besides being a fun quest, it's a great weapon in Ssra Temple (not grey.. the temple)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">angelless</div><div class="date">01-27-2004, 07:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">noper no partical effect on my  sword . the proc is a green cloud rainin down. i did the quest for the hell of it  just to be 1 of the only de sk's to have 1 i rarely use it  unless i'm bored . i totally love the katana look  of it to bad theres no better weapons for a sk with that look</div></div><hr />

The Pic shows a greenish-mist like animation-effect as the Iksar is swinging the sword.  Don't know if the animation is from the sword though, or some effect from a caster not seen in the picture.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
The picture was most likely taken with spell effects on when the weapon proc'd.  On a proc, you'll see a fine greenish misty rain over the mob.  If someone took the picture at just the right moment, it could look like a particle effect on the blade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Amphitryon</div><div class="date">01-31-2004, 11:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you take the Teir3/4 PoP zones out of the picture, the Greenmist is STILL the finest SK one hander in the game and consider the fact that the bulk of us will never see the Teir 3/4 zones, why sweat it?<br />
<br />
The consider the IC as well if you take Teir 3/4 zones out of the picture..its STILL a rocking weapon as far as overall usefullness. If you would rather be a gimped warrior, then by all means use a Windblade and go for its higher melee DPS, but if you are about rouding out your abilities and play as a Hybrid, the the stats and effects on the weapon plus its decent melee DPS make it a must have.<br />
<br />
and back to Greenmist<br />
<br />
I use it in combination with a sheild (Tae Ew SHeild) and the added AC, and combined stats + the boots from the proc are HUGE and the low dmg/dl is great especially when you factor in high levels of perma haste. I mean 18/22 + like 36% perma haste makes the Greenmist a proc'cing machine</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ganodoar</div><div class="date">01-31-2004, 12:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Haha just imagine if greenmist proc was a lifetap. That would really own more. Greenmist rocks indeed and the lifetap dot helps big time in reducing downtime. Plus the dmg/dly is decent and the stats. I also use it with a tae ew shield as well and could not see myself with anything else till I get Inny's Curse. With high attack I have even done dmg in the low 100s with Greenmist. Pretty impressive. <br />
I do wish it had a particle effect but alas it still looks cool even without one. I still see the rare person who says is that the Greenmist or link your sword and then proceed to say nice.<br />
Hehee only getting the decrepit hide and IC will top getting the greenish metal shard and forging Greenmist.</div></div><hr />
