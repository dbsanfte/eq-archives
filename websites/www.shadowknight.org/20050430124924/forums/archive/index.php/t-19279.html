Prefer soloing, but am in a massive slump, any suggestions?  Other then the fact that asking for help isn't actually soloing. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>cames</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Massive slump meaning you die a lot?  Or the xp isn't great?<br />
<br />
Well, you are nearing the end of the Paludal Caverns xp.  My take is soloing in most dungeons is pretty dicey so I would stick to outdoor zones.  An old standby in the 20s was LOIO, you should be able to fear kite by the lake.  Perhaps the Aviaks in SK.  <br />
<br />
The old world has the advantage of lower hp and dps mobs.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I solo'd aviaks in SK, and then moved up to solo'n Gnolls outside splitpaw, and then moved to Overthere(to group).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Don't worry about the slump, tend to fall into those myself from time to time.  Generally, I look at Bral's guide and then play wanderer until I find what I like.  Can't remember if it's Gorge of King Xrobb or runnyeye, that I fould a blast at that level.  Look at the list and see what you like.  Also if you want quick exp to get you out of the rut, get a sow and an invis near zone and go to HHK and kill gobbies.</div></div><hr />

After that go to marus seru, be careful of adds with frenzy and those zelniaks, but it great exp zone. Then OT and just go from there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mobs have low hps since its an old zone.<br />
<br />
Downside is you may have to compete with farmers/pl'ers.<br />
<br />
You can make decent coin and experience there 23 - 30.<br />
<br />
<br />
Around 30 try Dalnir's.  Downside there is the casters can suck if you're not ready for them.  Bright side however, invis and FD will get much practice here.  Not many mobs see invis in here.<br />
<br />
If you can swing it group with a cleric and chanter for some trio fun in these zones.  Hell, duoing with just about any class would be good for either zone.<br />
<br />
Good luck.<br />

At your level I think the bridge and a few of the ones on the back of the first temple. As you level to 25+ you can pull some off the other temples and when you're 28-30 you can start killing the judicators and stuff by the tip of the cliff for your DF armor drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kilze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I solo'd to about 55...<br />
20-25 OT coast and fear kited at pillars in loio<br />
25-30 Fear kited giants out of FM fort<br />
30-40 Fear kited in OT around SF<br />
40-52 Fear kited in DL and echo underbulks/gnome guards<br />
52-55 Fear kited in katta, PoD, SD and HK</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ketamina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">A good place for the mid to late 20's is Marus Seru, though it's not a favourite of very many. No bonus, but not many hunt there, and I like that because no one bothers me. :)<br />
<br />
Zelniaks and lightcrawlers are agro, and the Zelniaks have a long range. Rock dudes, greyhoppers, Recusos, and beetles aren't agro until you've killed a lot of them, and they're social.</div></div><hr />
