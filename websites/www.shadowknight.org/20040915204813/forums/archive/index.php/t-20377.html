<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Laymon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Yes it looks cool. Yes owning one shows how uber/well 'ard/dedicated/lonely (delete as applicable) you are to have camped hate since the Simpsons was new and funny, But what 'stats' would make it worth owning? <br />
<br />
Better dam/delay? A proc that can make a difference to a fight? different coloured spinny skulls? let me hear your thoughts</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>yuggoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not stats.. status. It's all about the bling bling, right? :p<br />
<br />
Some of us like quests.  Personally, I got more satisfaction out of spending 18 months working on my epic than I did doing an hour long event in PoN and getting a weapon with better dam/del ratio.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It already is worth getting.  People are really understanding what I mean by that.  Just like any other piece of gear, it's desirability goes down as you move through content.  If you're at the phase of content where you obtain this, old-world planes, its a fabulous weapon.  If you're in ToV, or anthing past Velious, its not.  IC was meant to be obtained while farming Hate/Fear for epic and gear drops.<br />
<br />
Put things in context.  Just because it was the best weapon available in Kunark, doesnt mean it holds any value past there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Laymon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I wasn't complaining. Untill I actually get to own it I can't really say wheather it was worth the trouble in the end or not. It was more a question for all the people who say it sucks -  <br />
if it sucks so much, what would make it better?<br />
<br />
BTW did i read a snippet in here somewhere about a quest in time to upgrade the IC? any more info on that? (not that I'll see Time anytime soon)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Messer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">EQ is all about fashion.  Thus, SK epic &gt; all.  <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, dyes really screwed the fashion show part of the game up.  Bastages.</div></div><hr />
