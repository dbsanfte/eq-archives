I've been playing EQ for 4 months now and got my DE SK to level 19 (casual player), soon to be 20. I've joined groups from 8th level to 15th but after that I’ve been soloing and now i feel that I’m not contributing much for the effectiveness of the groups I’m in (camping orcs in oasis most of the time).  Can u experts help and share some thoughts on SK group tactics for this level?<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

We're pullers and tanks.  For the lower levels, just try to practice keeping agro.  That cleric can probably tank the mob, but just wait till you get a bit higher in level, where he'd go down in a few seconds.  Also, your melee damage is helping.  Just stick it out till you get FD :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paynreaver</div><div class="date">05-02-2002, 11:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its really basic at lvl 18: Fund a mob, pull it. Dont let him kill anyone else in the group. Thats how to be a good shadowknight. Wanna be a GREAT knight? Be willing to DIE, yes DIE for your group. Overpull 10 mobs? Suck up the death and scream at your group to hightail it outa there while you buy them some time. At lvl 23 a warrior did that for my group, i thought he was the greates. We are friends and still group to today. <br />
<br />
(Note: Thats just one way to go a little above, theres tons more)<br />
<br />
Also, if you need to taunt off a groupmate (taunt meaning get a mob [mob = monster] off a weaker groupmate) use Desease cloud. This gem of a spell REALLY makes the mob angry, so they will attack you. If all else fails, put on a harmtouch too, but only in an emergency because its only available every 90 mins.<br />
<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />

Well, except on raids, where I use it to get kills on mobs :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've read somewhere that Scream of hate is a good taunting spell as well, is this true? If so, can I safely go to Luclin and get it? (Echo caverns I think). <br />
Do these DOT spells stack, I mean if I cast disease cloud on a mob and then cast it again will it do anything or just make the mob angry?<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarkWyld</div><div class="date">05-07-2002, 12:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Scream of Hate is an ATK tap.  This does not generate alot of hate from the mob.  The AC tap line works wonders, though.  So your primary aggro generating spells are:<br />
<br />
Disease Cloud<br />
AC Tap (Shadow Vortex, Shroud of Pain)<br />
Darkness line<br />
Flutter line (Heart Flutter, Asystole)<br />
<br />
From my experience, these are listed in order of Hate generated from most to least.  I think there is a Scream of Pain in the AC tap line as well, but since I was high level when SoL came out, I haven't looked into them.  Overall, though, DC is the best aggro management tool we have - fast cast, low cost, and large aggro.<br />
<br />
As for getting spells in Luclin, this should be no problem.  Shadow Haven is non-KOS to everyone.  Getting into Echo is fairly easy, and the merchants are close to the Shadow Haven zone - away from the creatures within.</div></div><hr />

Oh and your english is very good! :)</div></div><hr />
