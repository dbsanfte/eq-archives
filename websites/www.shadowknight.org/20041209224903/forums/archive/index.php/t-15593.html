<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all.<br />
<br />
I saw no thread about Char B quests here so I decided to start one.<br />
<br />
What's up with missing Gem #1 and Right Hilt?? I heard NOTHING about them that they are discovered yet. Did you ever seen those pieces yet? I am 1h/shield knight for 4 years and very much want to enjoy the quested shield but Gem #1 is preventing me from completing. If you know where, let us know! :) For now, I think they are not on loot table yet. VI forgot to put those in.<br />
<br />
There are 3 current known quests..<br />
1. Page quest to produce Ring of the Golem Heart<br />
It needs 4 pages then turn in to kill trigger golem to kill to get heart then turn in to quest guy to get the ring.<br />
<br />
2. Staff quest = unknown.. Missing Gem #1. (rumored to be 68 ac shield).<br />
It needed 4 staff of sufferings then it will give you gem bag to put 4 gems to turn back in for unknown result.<br />
<br />
3. Sword quest = Unknown.. Missing right hilt<br />
It needs 4 sword pieces. It is unknown what it would give after turn in 4 pieces..<br />
<br />
Any new information is appreciated. ;)</div></div><hr />
