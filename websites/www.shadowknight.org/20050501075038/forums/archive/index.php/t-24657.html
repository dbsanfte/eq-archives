<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gobbledy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been pulling the front of Dalnir, going as far back as the first cave.  Now that I've dinged 35, I've noticed a pretty big drop-off in XP from dark blues (and the appearance of a few light blues).  I was thinking of moving on to Kaesora.<br />
<br />
I was there a long time ago, with a group.  We made it as far back as the library, but I don't know if that would be a viable solo route .. too many spiders, and the casters would blow my cover for FD.<br />
<br />
Anyone have any advice on a good solo spot inside Kaesora at 35?  Any advice would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />

At 35 he has FD, invis and invis to undead.  <br />
<br />
There are now maps.<br />
<br />
Gate potion in that situation is a lazy lazy waste.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Oh, you're the warrior.  I should have expected you to be lazy, worthless and waste the skills we have as a class.  Go roll a monk, they got un-nerfed and already have a ton of people who don't know how to play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>farrudarruk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">warrors are useless?? .. i allways thought that about sks now im changeing my mind but i still think they are no match to a warror  in tanking power but ofv course they do have there uses and there a very fun class .... anyhow dont care what you think if you come out with stupid things like that ..</div></div><hr />

No, people who play warriors are useless.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Warriors only out tank knights for 3 minutes that defensive is up. Once thats gone the gap is extremely close.If healers can keep a warrior up after disc is gone then a knight can tank it considering he has the ac for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>farrudarruk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">explain what makes us  useless :mad:  .....anyhow im loveing this sk i hardly ever die and im not twinked im in crappy gear cuz i moved sever to bert  from fv ...<br />
<br />
i guess knights and warrors are equal i guess its simply what gear you have  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />
