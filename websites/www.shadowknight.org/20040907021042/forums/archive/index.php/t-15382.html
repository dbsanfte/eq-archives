<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ffejdoow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">(Level 57sk with Fungal/Greenmist on Karana)  <br />
<br />
I had a blast going solo to get my cell key.  I read some posts here and thought it would be exciting and I went into it expecting to die.<br />
<br />
I think one thing that was left out is GET SOW.  I would recommend getting a 5 dose sow potion.  This came in handy when I was FDing my way to the bank.  <br />
<br />
Also, I would recommend making a level one Rogue and making sure you know the way to the bank.  <br />
<br />
I zoned in and fd my way to the bank with little problem.  The sow keeps the mobs so far behind you that you dont have to worry about them bashing you.  <br />
<br />
I did /quit about twice on the way down.  <br />
<br />
Once you get past the secret door then FD near the bottom.  /quit<br />
<br />
As for pulling, if I just got close to the chest room the middle one would charge me without the others.  Casting all the spear lines, life leech, and Greenmisting him, it was not too hard a battle. VERY IMPORTANT!  Do not forget to land Doomdarkness.  The one time I either did not realize it did not take and when the mob got to 14% it ran and pulled like 4 golems.  I FD with 1% health!  Thats no lie!  That was the only one I had run on me. <br />
<br />
Once you kill the middle one, med up and then just walk along the left wall slowing.  The right chest will agro you without pulling the other.  <br />
<br />
Then just med up and repeat.<br />
<br />
Do not let it run or pull it up the stairs or you will pull the golems.<br />
<br />
It was an easy camp except for the one runner.  I got my key after 6 chests.  I forgot a gate potion so I used my gate hammer from OT.  That was a scary battle too!<br />
<br />
Good luck and it can be done!  Im glad I dont have to drag my whole guild down there now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shintou Shinai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I just tried this.. (Hell, I'm /q 'd right down near the mimics right now)<br />
<br />
And I got to the Area near the Mimics under the Bank past the Hidden Door with 90% HP.<br />
<br />
Some tips you may of left out.. yes you did say get SoW. SoW is VERY Important, I had level 60 Shammy SoW on, and it worked GREAT Let that level 60 Shammy buff you up and head to the hole.<br />
<br />
Make sure you mem Harmshield and Diamondskin. Let Harmshield pop before you go<br />
<br />
Once you do that, Cast DIAMONDSKIN on yourself. Once that is cast run like mad. <br />
<br />
I was able to get down to the entrance of the city with 100% HP. I FD'd the first time right there on the ledge, overlooking the city.<br />
<br />
After that, its time for Harmshield. Run throught the city with Harmshield untill you make it down past the Invisable wall. FD on the stairs.<br />
<br />
Guess what? You're there, and you shouldn't be all that beat up either. wish I could of realised this sooner :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shintou Shinai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Pulling tactics are sound. Got the hole Key off first mimic, no problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ffejdoow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Wasnt it a rush going in that place solo?  <br />
<br />
Congrats on getting the key off first chest!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shintou Shinai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Damn right it was, :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Saeldayar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Okay, I was kind of curious about getting to the mimics so I did a little checking around...<br />
<br />
DMF at the top of the large 'hole' up by Paineel entrance.... slowly drop down until you reach the FIRST 'lake' area, there is a dock here, make sure to stop here or you are doing the same fighting but going up instead of down...<br />
<br />
This area is on the same level as the bank, and only about a 50 yard run.  Yes Harmshield is your friend again.<br />
<br />
Move to the back wall of this area, there is a hallway, pass through, strafe right until you hit the wall, go forward, tada the bank.<br />
<br />
NO fighting your way down through masses of crap or /q multiple times (although once reaching the bank you're going to want to do the quit option as noted in the above postings)<br />
<br />
But hey, look how much time and effort you have saved yourself.<br />
<br />
I really dont see how anyone could call this a cheat, I mean, you have the DMF, you now have more direct access (they did design the zone this way), is it not a Shadow Knights perogative to use any advantages you have...<br />
<br />
Try it, I think you'll like it....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dester</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Lev does NOT work in this zone, as soon as you jump into the hole from Paineel and you zone, your lev will be stripped and If you don't have HS up to cast before you hit the bottem you will die.<br />
<br />
If master yeal is up you will die.<br />
<br />
The run to the bank from below is much more dificult then from above.<br />
<br />
Please have some expriance w/ the Hole instead of just looking at maps before you post.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Saeldayar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Dester, I agree completely, I should check myself before I suggest an avenue of attack... <br />
<br />
I had been curious about the deep well, so I floated around the edges of it trying to look down, no problem there.  I figured that the zone into the Hole was actually down at the lake level passing through the tunnel... didn't consider it to be a PoA type of jumping situation... good call.  I'm glad you posted a response, I was about ready to try my suggestion.  Thanks, I'll know better next time...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Inzanity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Did this today at 61, fd'd 3 times on the way there, and never had to quit out once. 3rd mimic dropped the key for me, and at 61 they con dark blue but are very weak. <br />
