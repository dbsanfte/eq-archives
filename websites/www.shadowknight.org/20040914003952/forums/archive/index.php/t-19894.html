<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ganodoar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey there folks. Would like to post a neat technique I used to successfully camp shroud of undeath solo at 60. Keep in mind you cannot be KOS to the mobs or this won't work. After several nathsar gauntlets and 1 bauble, Battle Master Ska'tu coughed up the spell. He is not that rare. The most I saw was 3 phs in a row and I even saw ska'tu pop back to back in 2 instances. <br />
<br />
As for the strategy, first off you must be dubious or higher so that you won't argo any mobs getting to the graveyard camp. When you head to the graveyard target ska'tu/ph. Now here is the tricky part, cast a pull spell like abduction of strength on ska'tu/ph and slowly run a bit. You want to make sure that you don't run too far out of the argo range. When I did this I always made sure to use Line of Sight to my advantage so that most of the time the necro spells from the crypt masters wouldn't go through. Constantly move slow and twitch backwards to see that you are not moving too far.<br />
<br />
As far as argo goes, only the graveyard, BK/betrayer and captain room mobs would add. Eventually you want to land past the lev tunnel and head near the zone out. Now here is where things can get real nasty if you are not careful. Quickly use either dooming darkness or clinging darkness on ska'tu/ph and then zone. Hopefully it landed. Rezone back and you should see ska'tu/ph lagging behind the others. Sometimes I noticed the ancient guardian/BK would stay behind for a bit. You may have to resnare ska'tu/ph and rezone. After that, if all goes well, ska'tu/ph should be all alone. Now how to do it solo. Fear won't work so I had to dot kite him with dooming darkness/asystole/boil blood. Don't even use undead nukes cause ska'tu is not considered an undead mob (though he is a huge sarnak skeleton). The same strategy above applies to his ph except that it is considered undead.<br />
<br />
It will take awhile but eventually ska'tu/ph will die from your dots and from your sk butt spearing/meleeing once in awhile. I always made sure to melee sometimes and even tap a bit. Don't be afraid to use harm touch or leech curse disc if you feel that your mana is dry and the mob is still alive. I just kept using this strategy and eventually patience paid off and shroud of undeath dropped. <br />
<br />
Keep in mind 2 things when you do this though. One is to make sure no one is by the fort or the train will argo the innocent people there and also make sure no royals raid groups are going through the lev tunnel or it won't work. If there is a royals raid group period make sure that they are going through the fort and wait until they are at the first bridge before pulling from the graveyard. The second point to note is that this is not 100 percent fool proof. I have failed pulling the graveyard twice due to the necros landing the annoying dd snare. If they land it and it lasts for more than a few seconds, just feign and try again.<br />
<br />
Another annoying thing I found was that most of the time ska'tu's ph was a reanimated berserker. This can cause problems as there are more than one in the graveyard and it can be easy to get confused. Generally you'll want to target the last reanimated berserker heading back to the graveyard after you zoned and only if you snared him with clinging darkness. Only once did I make a mistake and ended up killing the wrong berserker. <br />
<br />
Ska'tu also has a 2nd ph too but his 2nd ph is actually rarer than ska'tu himself. His 2nd ph is the wraith of a di'zok hero. It looks like a sarnak ghost. I have no clue if it is considered undead or not. One other thing too, the faction hits are not big for killing ska'tu/ph. I was max ally when I started and was still ally at the end. It took me one hour of clearing the goblin cave in Frontier Mountains before I jumped back to max ally.<br />
<br />
I hope this advice helps you if you are on sarnak faction and wish to camp ska'tu without having to drag guildies with you. This technique I imagine could be used to also solo the iksar betrayer/ph if you want to camp the pipe for a friend or to sell the MQ. I used this technique to even solo the Watch Captain near the betrayer area. Difference was that the captain ran below 20 percent health :)<br />
<br />
Good luck to anyone who camps this spell. It is useful to have if you are an sk who wants a complete spellbook, a big fat sk who wants to have the shrink from skelly illusion, and useful if you want skelly illusion and KEI together. It was a fun camp in my mind and hopefully people on di'zok faction can use this strategy to get this very rare sk spell. My last point to make is that the spawn timer on ska'tu/ph is 20 minutes on the nose.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>cauchy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Another way to do this if you're non-kos and 65 is to just dark split out Skatu to the small bridge right after the betrayer bridge and before the graveyard area where the light blue con 2 spawn is.  They're low enough not to add or assist when you fight Skatu right in front of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gargar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I went on a chardok raid last weekend on a joint guild venture. I was HOPING to case the place out and find out where this guy pops. Dammit it was aweful in there.. hehe  all the maps i find suck and I havnt seen a loc for where this guy or his ph's are.<br />
We were able to take out the prince and the king. So I was at least that far in.  I remember quite a few bridges we crossed and dont remember a gy at all. :-(<br />
<br />
We did kill the wraith of a di'zok hero but for the life of me i cant remember where that was.  <br />
<br />
Could i get a loc or some directions?  <br />
And does anyone know of a good chardok map?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ganodoar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">http://www.shadowknight.org/forums/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=13888&amp;highlight=Chardok+Royals<br />
<br />
This is the map that someone posted of chardok in the past. The only thing wrong about the map is that it still shows the royal sarnak herbalist spawning near the king/queen, which is wrong. Ska'tu is labelled 8 on the first map. He and his 2 possible phs spawn a little south of the number. He spawns at the left bend of the graveyard at around the loc of neg 450, pos 375 right by the left wall.<br />
<br />
The graveyard is the area where he and gravemaster zo'lun/ph spawn at. It is known as the graveyard cause of the di'zok cryptmasters, reanimated berserkers and reanimated champions.<br />
<br />
As for directions there are three different ways to get to the graveyard but going through the lev tunnel is the fastest way. The lev tunnel is located just ahead of the fort. When you cross the lev tunnel keep on heading down until you see a fork in the road. You have to turn down south and you should see the Bridge Keeper/ph and the captain room to your side. Head up to where the bridge keeper/ph is. <br />
<br />
DO NOT go past the bridge straight ahead of you because that only leads you to a deadly trap there that will root you and kill you slowly. Instead when you first go up past the captain room look immediately to your right. You should see a bridge and a waterfall ahead. Past the bridge by the waterfall is the graveyard. The graveyard isn't that big and you will know when you have gone past it when you begin to see another bridge leading to the royals area.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gargar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">OUTSTANDING!  Thanks...<br />
Off to chardok tonight to try and get ma spell!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ganodoar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hey there Gargar did you have any luck with getting the spell? Just curious since it'd be cool to see another sk get that spell. If not I sure hope you got to smack the Battlemaster down a few times as payback.</div></div><hr />
