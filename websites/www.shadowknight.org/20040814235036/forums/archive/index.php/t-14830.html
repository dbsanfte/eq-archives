<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shainaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Got a hold of Yelinak's head on a guild raid other day and wondered what is best way to faction for giants.  I am so far ally to the Rif and KOS to the Zek and i imagine KOS to KT as well.  Turned in about 50 heads so far to the Recruiter since Bvellous still doesn't like me.  <br />
<br />
Not seen any Dain raids lately but have heard that is the best by far factioning with Zek and KT himself.  I am lookin more for solo factioning.  Ice well seems ok but the dwarves don't drop heads and take longer to kill then the ones in EW.  Anyone have any better advice or shoudl i just continue as i have been slaughtering dain in EW and turn in heads?<br />
<br />
Again, lookin simply for solo factioning advice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Solan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Only way to get KT up other than raids, is to turn in heads and doing some small quests in Kael, so EW and GD is the way to go.<br />
<br />
 With a group you can get substantial KT faction off the Dain guards as well if you can get that set up.<br />
<br />
 As an added bonus, Velketor gives a substantial KT hit as well, I know it's a raid, but I thought I would give you the info anyway :)</div></div><hr />
