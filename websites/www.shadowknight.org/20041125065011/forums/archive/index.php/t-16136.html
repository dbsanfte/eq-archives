<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lurker99</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I thought I read about an FD bug here somewhere... but could not find it... anyway, FD seems to be failing without a fail messege or interrupt messege.. It happed a few times in CoD last night, I would pull, get 2 or 3 .. then try to FD.. and see my HP's dropping like panties on prom night.... I would still have to stand up and my spell icon was grayed out, so those are 2 ways I could tell I actually cast it... now I looked at the log.. and there's not fail/fall messege?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xanathol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Interesting....would explain my death in HoH the other night, as I had a simliar thing happen...FDed, layed there, no msg, then I am being pounded on, and had to stand before trying again. I wrote it off as lag.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>wismerhall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It happened to me too in PoD &amp; BoT, quite annoying for BoT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Branndonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I had it happen in HK. Don't know if there's any relevance, but now maybe the moron telling me that FD isn't working will believe it when I tell him that I'm not getting a message.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kizzestra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You are not experiencing a bug. What you are experiencing is melee timing. There is a delay between the time a mobs swings and the time a blow connects. If your FD goes off and the mobs blow was already triggered before the spell actually went off, then the mobs blow still comes in. If it hits you, the mob realizes you are not dead because you still took damage. It then is not fooled by your &quot;successfull&quot; FD.<br />
<br />
This is a pretty old issue really. Especially with mobs who hit multiple times, the second, 3rd or 4th blow in an attack round can come in well after the first attack is triggered and break FD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thats happened to me also, no big deal really it just happens.  However anyone notice an increase in fizzle rate lately.  My abj is pretty high and death peace will fizzle 3 times in a row quite often.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>AtogEd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah I fizzle FD like 3 times before it goes off.  COurse my abjure is only 100</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Duke Xerro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've been getting that too. Its odd</div></div><hr />

It happened when I wasn't fighting anything. I was in the basement waiting to take pops in WR, we cleaned out RR and took a few from GR (good considering both of those are usually camped as well) and I was working on my skills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Duke Xerro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Sometimes happens when Im just trying to split, before the mob even gets a chance to hit me.</div></div><hr />

Our FD can Fail without a message, it has been able to for the entire length of the game, it is not a bug, <br />
<br />
its sorta like Sony saying &quot; nothing is Fool proof&quot; even when you suceed in FD sometimes enemeis just wont fall for it. <br />
<br />
and if you FD while attacking it WILL fail. <br />
<br />
If you FD and are cast on it WILL fail. <br />
<br />
FD has never been a 100% get out of death free, thou it does save my life 93% of the time................ i think thats good enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Drakonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I've always thought it'd be great if they altered FD so that if you get a spell cast on you, but resist it, you remain feigned... but if the spell lands on you, it breaks it... would make more sense, if possibly overpowered in some minds...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">fuck....everything fizzles.  i dont have a damn casting skill under 200 (evoc is low) and they all fucking fizzle constantly now,  this is stupid.  sometimes fizzling death peace 3-4 fucking times isnt an option.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ragdak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Something has been changed. I have been killed thrice from a mob I used to FD easily. Now I cannot get a successful FD after multiple attempts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Apokx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Fd has been working as intended for myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Jagdwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I have NEVER had my FD work in combat.  EVER.  I understand if you have a dot running on you or running on them, however, I can pull with a bow from 150 and then FD and they still run up on me and wack me silly.<br />
<br />
Maybe it is a bug?  Anyone sent to sony?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Turning auto-attack off Jagd?<br />
<br />
It really does make a difference, even when the mob is well out of range.  It's kind of stupid, but something we learn to live with.<br />
<br />
Of course, I've been out of game for a while, so I don't know.  It's entirely possible that something's fucked up in a major way, but it seems like I see these &quot;FD isn't working&quot; posts about once every 3-4 months, and it's almost always the same deal, someone just isn't completely up on how FD works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Drakonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I heard a SK fail FD 5 times in one raid yesterday... mines been working fine however...<br />
<br />
Jagdwolf, as stated you have to turn Auto-attack off for FD to work in combat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>zagbok dagreat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I am now a 62 sk and have to say, FD has saved my ass so many times.  If you put together a good FD macro, it should not fail too often.  Here is the macro that I use.<br />
<br />
/attack off, pause<br />
/target zagbok (insert your name)<br />
/cast 8<br />
/cast 8<br />
/cast 8<br />
<br />
The 8 being my FD spell slot, this will almost always work.  Since I have gotten lvl 60 FD death peace, my FD has failed one time out of like 150 attempts.  Give it a try with ALL level FD spells, I know that it will help you all!  I have been using this macro since level 30.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>GranochTonka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">FD hotkey hmm..isnt there a recast check between fizzles of spells? thus causing your hotkey to not work really?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Makkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">i thought there was, but it really doesnt matter. i have all my slots full of /cast 8 now and its never messed up.<br />
<br />
a bigger bug is the &quot;recovery time not met yet&quot; or whatever you get when you cast dp immediately after another spell, or try to cast a spear. the gems are refreshed but you cant cast, annoying as hell</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Jinsei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I had that happen while pulling vindi for the past 5 nights...Had to bring in a monk since I failed fd on every attempt. Though I'm 3 lvls off of DP, its fucked up. Even when I got one successful FD, he still came up and raped me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>GranochTonka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">My Blood Ember greaves NEVER fail on me..but the spell itself does...sigh..btw hotkey works, its awesome lol<br />
<br />
/autoattack off<br />
/target Granoch<br />
/cast 8<br />
/cast 8<br />
/cast 8<br />
<br />
<br />
it really does work!</div></div><hr />
