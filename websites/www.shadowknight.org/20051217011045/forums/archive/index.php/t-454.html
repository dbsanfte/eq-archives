<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tazok</div><div class="date">04-05-2002, 12:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am trying to get dubious to Coldain so I can start the Coldain Ring Quest.  I am currently scowling as I have killed quite a few dwarves and turned in their heads to the Captain in Kael to get ally with Kromzek (yes I know I should have done the ring first but I wasn't thinking).<br />
<br />
I am wondering if there is a better way to raise Coldain faction then slaughtering Frost Giants in Kael?  I can't do any of the regular Coldain quests as I am scowling, but I thought there might be another way I didn't know about.<br />
<br />
I have already killed giants for a week or so with no faction change, so if anyone knows a better way any help is greatly appreciated.;) <br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

Brael's right, the best way is to kill lots of frost giants and  drakkel wolves (less hps so much faster), i dont know how it is on your server, but brell usually has a few people there working on it so you can raise it pretty fast without downtime.<br />
Leeching the frost giant campers in GD also works well if they kill fast enough.</div></div><hr />

I would assume that by killing the giants overall in GD gives you good coldain faction soo im going to guess...err assume that posibbly by some funny way (dont kill me if im wrong) the same outcome would be present if you were to go kill them in Kael.  Why not check that to make sure. I did Kael raids to get my CoV faction up but didnt pay attention if you got coldain faction as well. Anyhow if my presumptions are correct then you can just go on a few kael raids and try to hit every mob. Worked fast for my CoV faction so mabey it could help you. Forgive me as I am tired and do not remember :)<br />

Oh some of the entrance mobs on the WL side have Coldain faction as well.  Best bet is get a group going and wax the shadowknight guild.  Either that or just go to GD and kill the gaints there, rather easy if you have some type of healer, easy mobs and Coldain faction hits with the kills.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now not 100% thats always true but I know the Giants close to WL and all the giants form EW to the bank give Dwarf faction, I was there soloing last night for some faction.<br />
<br />
The Giants Close to WL are mixed DB to Green, and the ones at the first gate close to EW are 90% green with an odd LB thrown in.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />
