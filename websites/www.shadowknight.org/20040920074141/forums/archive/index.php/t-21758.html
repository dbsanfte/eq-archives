<br />
The above comes into play quite often when tanking issues between warriors, paladins, and shadowknights are discussed(for example, this thread (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=7633)).  Generally speaking, the SK position is that War DPS is greater than SK DPS currently is, while the War position is that SK DPS is greater.  Those TSW DPS parses are still fairly vaild, as least as the melee ratio is concerned between Warriors and SKs...a ratio that showed that SK melee did 80% of Warrior melee DPS.  The variables those parses don't take into account are spell/pet DPS, and the DPS spell versus Aggro spell tradeoff that needs to be made when tanking.  I think it would be extremely useful to have recent, accurate parses of the DPS differences, both when tanking and when not tanking, which can be used to rebuke the &quot;SKs are the DPS tank&quot; arguement (or possibly prove it true).<br />
<br />
These parses are something I would do myself if I could, but I don't have the gear or the weight that some of the visible end game SKs like Brael have in the EQ/Dev comminity.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>cames</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Okay if we are to be the DPS tank, then bump our offensive skills up to match those of Warriors.  That way if I am going to tank a whole lot worse than a warrior (and I do), then if a Ranger does 50% more damage than a war (I suspect that percentage is wrong) than let me do 25% more damage than a war.  Something noticeable, not 80% of melee + spells (which may or may not land).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">DPS tank is a fatally flawed concept - for it to work it would have to be grossly overpowered.  Our DPS can be a *MINOR* part of the tank balance, but because it would be a poor balance decision for our DPS to be raised to the level of a DPS class, it can never be a primary factor.  <br />
<br />
DPS tank doesn't work because the tank's DPS doesn't matter when the tanking job does.  Sure there are times when an SK's DPS is a worthwhile contribution, but a ranger could do the job in those situations too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jovec</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm not saying we should get these parses to prove we are the DPS tank, or making the arguement that we should be the DPS tank.  I don't think we should get into logical or theoretical arguements about the viability of DPS tanks yet either.<br />
<br />
I'm saying that there is a significant number of warriors and paladins who are of the opinion that since they believe  SKs do the most damage they should be the worst tanks.  If the SK community had some parses whereby an equally geared War, SK, +4 others did some normal LDoNs, hard LDoNs, some GoD trials, and maybe some EP exping with both the warrior tanking and SK tanking, we would have data we could point to whenever the better DPS = worse tanking arguement is made.  Once we prove where SK tanking and non-tanking DPS lies in comparison to warriors (and to a lesser extent, paladins), we can rebuke this argument easily and without question.  <br />

Of course, the obvious backfire is those SOE asshats interpreting this as a request for the &quot;DPS tank&quot; role, which would only turn out badly for us, so best leave well enough alone. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you're assigned to tank, you're only wanted to hold aggro and mitigate damage.  A group has several people, a raid dozens, who do much better DPS than you.<br />
<br />
If you do both these well (paladin, warrior) you'll be invited to tank on raids and invited to join guilds.<br />

If you don't (SK, berzerker) they won't look at you.</div></div><hr />

Exactly.  TSW stuff you are referring to (if it's the same parses I'm thinking off)  showed that Sk melee only with  VDD/GBoC did almost exactly 80% of warrior melee with VDD/DBotW+EoE.  DPS spells, pets, and potential DPS lost to aggro spells (i.e. gameplay tanking) was not.<br />

The problem is that AFAIK we only have opinions, albeit informed ones, like Brael saying we &quot;...are far worse DPS than Warriors.&quot;  I'm suggesting we back it up with parses.<br />
<br />
I would agree that it tends to be less intelligent warriors and paladins who make the DPS tank arguement, but that's still a lot of noise that can be refuted in class balance discussions when SKs can say 1) we don't do more DPS than warriors when tanking as these parses show; in fact we do less, 2) we do equal damage when not tanking, and 3) the concept of a DPS tank doesn't work because of X,Y,Z so don't increase our offense, increase our defensive capabilities.<br />

If you are not trying at least that hard, then it would be better for you to sit on the bench and let a warrior tank it.<br />

1.5s to 2.0s casting times for your spells, you're looking at doing no more than two-thirds your normal full melee damage, and that's without getting stunned at all.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Gimpy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">The root of the problem is that essentially you have 4 roles to fill with however many character classes there are today.  You are either Tank, Healer, Crowd control, or Damage.  If you can't at the very least fulfill your primary role, then you aren't any good to a group that can turn to someone who does.<br />
<br />
It makes absolutely no sense to tell someone they can't be as good at their role as someone else if that is the role they are stuck with.  It doesn't matter how good you are at the secondary/tertiary roles if you don't fulfull your primary role.<br />
<br />
A better way to approach it would be to make all the &quot;tanks&quot; dead even in tanking ability.  On top of that, start adding different spells/abilities/qualities to differentiate them.  Paladins have backup healing and stuns, Warriors can do more damage, Knights can pull/snare/etc.  Make the warriors do a whole lot of damage, just a step below the Rangers/etc, but substantially more than the knights since it harder to differentiate them without giving them spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Culdahl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Gimpy,<br />
<br />
  I have suggested something to that effect myself, though I disagree about the secondary role of the tanking classes.  Warriors need to be given some niche in this game or we will NEVER be equal tanks.  Also, SK's secondary role should be DPS, as we are a tank/DPS hybrid for the most part....Paladins have healing as their secondary role and warriors should be given some other unique ability(s) as well.  I'm not saying that we should be a DPS class....we should be the best DPS tank though IMO.<br />
