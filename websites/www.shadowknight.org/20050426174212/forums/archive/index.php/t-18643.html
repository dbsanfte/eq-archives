<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GlyphicVZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Where can i find him? I looked at the walkthroughs and couldnt find him anywhere. could somebody give me a loc or something please?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ganodoar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The Iksar Knight is most of the time found in the Outpost that leads to West Cabilis in Warslik's Woods. I always found him kneeling by a building near the road. He should be there. If he is not then I heard the way to spawn him is to head to the forest giant fort and find the a forest giant mob. Kill him and the iksar knight should spawn where I said he should be. It's not easy to miss him when you see the road ahead of you at the Cabilis Outpost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chezebreth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well the knight in WW some times will get up and walk off and if he gets attacked or trained he will run off and get stuck in the caves neer the iksar town in WW and wander around in them. I have never seen any mobs there other than him and he will wander around in there kinda fast so HAIL him when you can to get him to stop. I had to get 2 friends to track him down and we thought he was under the world till we found that tunnal. <br />
