She tells me if I hit a bird at him, I could put his eye out, I tell her, if we are playing badminton and I smash the bird at him, he is in pretty much the same amount of danger of losing an eye, infact maybe more because I am putting alot more force into it. She tells me that I am immature, well I am a highschool student, im not the most mature person and what the hell does she expect, she has went through highschool and should know that we are not the most mature age group out there. She also tells me that &quot;life is not a game&quot;. What the fuck is this suppose to mean, if you know the meaning of life, please fill me in, as I would really like to know.  Life is suppose to be getting a job, and raising a kid then dying? I mean please stfu, untill you can tell me the point in life don't tell me life isn't a game.  From there view it could easily be considered a game, where the point is to get as much points as you can, and you can get points for having a high standard of living, loving some people, and having people love you, and to be as safe as possible. anyways there is no paragraphs in here, it could have been a pain to read.  It is a stupid rant, it is late at night and I am tired so it might be incoherrent, but whatever, fuck it, I feel a little bit better now.<br />

society is all about patronizing, submitting to the groups wishes, so in that regard they still have a vital role, indirectly, when it comes to making contributions to _____.<br />
just as english teachers are just failed writers<br />
thats what i was &quot;arguing&quot;, albeit weakly, about.<br />
Just because someone chooses to become a teacher of English doesn't mean that they are a failed writer, it takes more skill at writing to be able to teach someone else how to do it than it does to just write...<br />

hardly true at all.... after 5 years of college and finishing it soon I can still remember a shitload of teachers that actually meant something and in their classes I learned 5 times more than I ever did in any college class.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">It's funny that American students are saying Grade School and High School &gt; College.<br />
<br />
The US (and Canada isn't much better) ranks at the bottom of developed countries in Education up through the high school level (12th Grade 16-18 years old for reference), but has the best University system in the world (yes the are fabulous Universities elsewhere, but it's the American University system that allows our students to catch up to the rest of the world).<br />
<br />
I think the issue is the culture. Most American kids are not raised with the same sense of responsibility as I've seen in and from other countries. American youth are not required to take accountability for the ramifications of their actions. It's always someone else's fault, and their parents will back them up and post their bail (when necessary).<br />
<br />
This leads to 2 things: 1) the inability of the youth to make informed decisions, and 2) the inability of the youth to take responsibility for their own poor decisions.<br />
<br />
You take courses that you are not interested in or do not know how to position yourself for your future dream job through educational choices (this involves the school, the program of study, the courses and the instructors one can choose) then the fault is yours, not the fault of the school.<br />
<br />
You don't want to take biology as part of your Philosophy degree? Choose or transfer to a non-liberal arts school where you can focus more on your curriculum or see if the Desert Ecology course you could take at the local community college would transfer in to count as your science credit.<br />
<br />
Take ownership, damnit. If you aren't getting anything out of school, look at your own choices, they are probably more to blame than the school.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I'd go nuts if I chose a course I didn't really like just because it assures a wealthier future.<br />
I totally agree, I took my degree's because I felt it's what I could actually stay interested in in 4 years of study.  My point is more about either taking what you like and not complaining or taking what will get you where you want and not complaining.  I think very few lucky people can take something that will do both.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Culdahl1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">College is far better then highschool IMO.  It focuses more on one's abilities rather then one's ability to simply do a lot of work.  Also, I think teachers in public schools are bound by certain lesson plans that are often as tedious as they are useless.....so, to be fare to highschool teachers, it's not all their fault.<br />
<br />
I do agree, though, that college is about choices and those decisions are the student's responsibility, but you can hardly hold an 18yr accountable for making life altering decisions.  What bothers me most about college is the tons of redundant information that is &quot;required&quot; to get a degree in a given field.  IMO, these core courses are required because of the failure of the public school system in america (and it's mo' money for the colleges) to properly educate kids in english, math and science (fuck history, it's gay).  Kids should be able to get most entry level jobs with a public education, which isn't the case today....so, either we need to extend the public school system beyond 12yrs, or we need to completely revamp the public education system to better prepare students for employment and not enlightenment.  For fuck's sake, it is ridiculous to expect anyone to retain math beyond a basic level, just as it's ridiculous to expect anyone to retain the entire history of everything beyond grade school, etc, etc....The public system should better prepare kids for &quot;employment&quot; and/or the college system should be focused more on employment, but 16+ yrs of redundant information is a complete waste of time IMO ('less ye be a participant on jeopardy).<br />

Depending on how you look at it, American and Canadian high schooling might not be that bad.  Japanese students, which are often held up as a model due to their vey high test scores, have trouble answering basic questions such as 'Is the Sun or the Earth larger?' and 'Does the sun rotate around the Earth or does the Earth rotate around the Sun?' (according to a recent survey).  Apparently, since Japanese schools have a tendancy to teach strictly by rote, many fundemental questions such as these are left unaddressed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Depending on how you look at it, American and Canadian high schooling might not be that bad. <br />
<br />
I look at the Program for International Student Assessment administered by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.  This assesses both book skills (where American students are very high in math), and practical skills (where American students scored very low in being able to apply math).  This test looks at most aspects as my American math example illustrates (and I understand no test will please everyone with it's approach).<br />
<br />
Australia and Finland scored tops in most categories for the 2003 school year, though those racist aussies claim the scores would have bene higher if the aboriginal testing didn't bring them down.  <br />
<br />
The Japanese that you list aren't tops in anything nor have they been for years, it's become an untrue stereotype only perpetuated by the misinformed.</div></div><hr />

Biggest grudge about HS, is that I know my future doesn't involve a lot of english, and I personally hate the subject, but I still have to take 4 years of it, where someone who likes english, and hates math/science only has to take 2 years of each(not sure on science, but positive on math).<br />

He will not have friends until he graduates college...he will not have a girlfriend until he graduates college and has a well established job...what's worse is that he doesn't even really desire to have a social life.  He studies roughly 4 yrs + a day and studies year round (even during winter/summer breaks).

<br />
The same can be said for college...The reason there is such a jump in the quality of education between grade school and college isn't because our universities are that much better then our high schools, it's because the kids that go on to college tend to &quot;value&quot; education more or are likely washed out very quickly (add to that the fact that many adults attend college and pay with their own money).  I'm sure a larger percentage of foreign students go on to college (per capita), but I think america's college students want to be there more which gives us quality over quantity.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I was reading this..... then I started thinking about our school system. My children currently attend a school that is on probabtion for low test scores. <br />
<br />
 (My first grader, was so far ahead of all the other kids in her class, they felt she was being left behind, because she wasn't learning anything new, so they skipped her a grade) <br />
<br />
Now, here is where the school got screwed. If they would have kept her in first grade, her test scores would have brought the average up. (because while she was in second grade, her math score was in the high 90s and her reading score hit the 100%.... (she brought the second grade average up.. guess that counts for something) <br />
<br />
Our school system has to follow that No kid left behind rule. The teachers are only allowed to fail a child once.. ONCE in 12 years... That means if the kid can't say his ABCs in kindergarten, and he has to repeat it... they are not allowed to hold him back again... Ever wonder why those kids graduate highschool and can't read? It's because their school system might follow some insane rule like this one.</div></div><hr />

You missed the point =o(<br />
<br />
She wasn't smart, the other kids just weren't up to grade level. The new &quot;No kids left behind&quot; bullshit that the democrats pushed into effect, made it so they &quot;had&quot; to move her up a grade. Since the other kids weren't at grade level the teachers had to drop their standards to reteach them basic skills.<br />
<br />
No kid left behind means the teachers have to teach the classes at the pace the class as a whole can learn. If one kid is stuck on a subject, the teachers don't press forward like they used to, they wait for that one kid.<br />
<br />
<br />
And yes, stfu, I'm a proud parent... But I don't agree with the school system, it's way to relaxed, and the younger kids aren't learning what they should be, or even what I was learning at their age. And that bothers me. They should be moving forward in teaching, not taking a step back.</div></div><hr />
