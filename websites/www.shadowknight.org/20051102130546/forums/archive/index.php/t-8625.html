<br />
There are about 4 clustered around a rock in the sw corner of the zone, and I could never single pull them at 57 - often got all four.   Dark splitting was iffy, as  a few times I couldnt get a fd off due to stuns and interrupts, and i had the quick TL to bind.<br />
<br />
Can anyone offer any tips on this camp?  Or was it just a question of bad luck or low level that makes it a tough multi pull.  Will they be easier to pull at a higher level?<br />
<br />
Also, what's your techinique for feigning?  Do you stand while the mob beats on you and hope to channel through, or do you run and pause to get enough headway in between you and the mob?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
Seriously though, I have only seen people single pull with the new harmony.  <br />
<br />
I would think FD splitting si possible however since they are not casting and straight melee.  Should not be too hard, but I think they have a huge aggro range so it may be fairly hard.</div></div><hr />

That's about it. Works every time. You can also just straight up FD pull since they don't all wander back at the same time, but snare pulling is more consistent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Groobash</div><div class="date">11-25-2002, 07:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It was a PITA to split these to solo them at 61 too. They have the new PoP &quot;feature&quot; of not forgetting you when they get back to their spawn spots.<br />
<br />
There is one nightstalker away from the others that comes single, but you gotta be damn lucky to not get two when you try to pull another one, and they almost never forget you. They also share social agro and tell their friends about you too, so pretty soon you pull and get 4 or 5 mobs...most of which don't forget you when they reset.<br />
<br />
Once you get one single, they are pretty easy to fear kite tho. Resists are pretty low. XP isn't great, but beats the hell outta sitting around LFG. The only drops I got off them were occasional BDs. <br />
<br />
After a couple hours it was obvious that these weren't worth the trouble with the mana loss from FDing constantly, not regening mana like normal while FDed, and the trouble keeping up a pet. Was just too much of a hassle for limited rewards. /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Saruton</div><div class="date">11-26-2002, 03:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For splitting them. Just go closer to them step by step untill you aggro some. When they get close to you FD before they get a swing at you. Timeing is all. Then wait untill alle are wandered back to their spawn point except for one. Now you have a splited Nightstalker. Stand up and pull it to your group or solo it.<br />
<br />
And i never had any problems with them remembering me after a pull. It wasnt hard at all to Split em.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boolowa</div><div class="date">11-26-2002, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm, maybe I was waiting a bit long to fd.  There is that group of 4 that looks like they are linked or close enough to share aggro, and they were a real pain.<br />
<br />
It's quicker to just grab a roamer than wait for them to reset and try splitting. :p <br />
<br />
Thanks for the help.<br />

Run3, Jboots, horse, sower in grp or sow potions, this is mandatory<br />
You get some distance, stop for like half a second, and cast FD.<br />
Playing in 3rd person view helps alot for this.<br />
<br />
Try bringing a second tank in group and ask him to tag your pulls while you stay FD.<br />
To break some camps you will have to stay FD during a few fights, or if you are crazy like me, you can build aggro on adds and kitte em :D</div></div><hr />
