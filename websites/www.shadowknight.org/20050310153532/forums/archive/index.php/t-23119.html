<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Apparently it IS the intent of SoE to reward the groups of players doing the helping with the epic with some form of loot spawned in chests. However you can blame the farmers who killed mobs over and over for the system requiring overhaul.<br />
<br />
To that extent:<br />
<br />
Cipheron, as well as other epic NPCs that spawn a chest were perma-killed in the last few days and changed as of today. As of today, you will need to be doing the epic in question, as well as being at that step (or near it) in the epic to be able to spawn the treasure chest involved. If your character indeed looted an epic item already that spawned a chest, you will not be able to spawn that same chest again, because an invisible flag is placed on your character indicating that you've spawned this chest already.<br />
<br />
-Zajeer <br />
<br />
As has been noted here and on other boards however the chests are not spawning like they should. This is being looked into and Developers on Test are trying to sort this out.<br />
<br />
We're looking into why the chests aren't spawning for some folks, since this seems to be a bug.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>phaerun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I do not know if it is a bug or a &quot;feature&quot;, I assume the later, but I think that after the nerf there is a chance the mob will pop a chest which I assume is rather low as opposed to always popping up the chest after looting the corpse. <br />
<br />
So far In 3 falmont kills (mine and 2 friends') after the patch,  I have only seen the chest once.  I have also helped 2 guild pallies to do mujaki and we got a chest once as well.<br />
<br />
So I guess you still get chests just the probability to get them is very low :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>VengerMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">got a chest on Varns, did not get one on Falmont.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Malamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I didnt get one when i killed Falmont last night (10/4)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>The Zenogias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">How much HP would you say he has? 100k Max?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>grinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">something like that, we did him in a bit over 90 secs [3 AE's], didnt have any wizards, just a couple rangers, few druids, knights ....other psuedo DPS ...had a warrior tank it with defensive...max hit was 1550 [the war had about 2200 ac, guild is only just time flagged really and not got any of the good time loot]</div></div><hr />
