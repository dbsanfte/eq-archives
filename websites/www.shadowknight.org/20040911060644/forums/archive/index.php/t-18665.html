<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Naaklum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I never got the Dusty Tome off a Ratman Guard, and I don't feel like going back to the Hole and camping him.  (I know I'm lazy)  I've read here that I don't really need this.  I ran Marl Notes back and forth until he said &quot;My Hero&quot; already, and then ran about 4 more after that.  Am I good to go, or should I head back to the Hole?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Stugein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You should be fine.  The dusty tome portion of the quest is really just a faction modifier for those who do the quest &quot;as intended&quot;.  If you've already run seals to get to the &quot;my hero&quot; message, you should be safe to skip it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Naaklum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanx for reply.  =)  Has anyone else done this recently as well?  I'd kick myself if I lost my decrepit sheath.  Should I just go back and camp the stupid rat?  I hate to think that I need to, as it took me 3 days just to get some peeps to go help me get my key in the hole.  I'm a tad paranoid.  =)  I'm like, &quot;what if they changed it so Duriek will eat your stuff if you've never given him the tome?&quot;  Heh..............</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Stugein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you are paranoid you can always do the Hide trick for the turn-in.  Open the trade window with the items you are turning in, hide, /con to make sure the NPC is indifferent, then hit the trade button.  The trade will be completed as if at indifferent faction, which in the case of our epic turn-in mobs is more than enough.  You just need to remember to /con to make sure the npc is indifferent.  If not then unhide, rehide and /con again until it is.<br />
<br />
But really.  If you are getting the &quot;My hero&quot; response you should be good to go regardless.  How safe you play it from here is up to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Naaklum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Faction wasn't my worry really.  I got up to indifferent w/Marl, but am still app to Duriek.  I will use /hide even though I know my faction is high enough.  I just worry that they changed it so he will eat the pieces no matter what your faction is if you've never given him the tome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lunaci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I know people are saying that the tome itself now drops off any ratman (yes I use search :) but I swear I've killed every rat in the Hole to the point where their great great grandchildren can't spawn fast enough to save the race and still not a sight of the tome.  Anyone seen any particular spot since the revamp that seems to have the tome more often than not?  My healer friends are getting very bored of this particular trek (and after only around 50 drakes they haven't started to feel the agony yet of the hide camp on Hate)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Naaklum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Whelp it may be true that other mobs can drop the tome, but I don't know myself.  I have heard however that the ratman guard drops it EVERY time, so you should prolly concentrate on him.  He is found on steps up to where ghost of Kindel spawns near bank area.  He should have a ph on the steps.  This is what i've read anyways, as i have not killed him before.  Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dester</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ive only seen the tome off of the ratman guard, but he now can pop in the place of ANY rat, ( not in the jail anymore).  Seen the ratman up only once in the jail before revamp and then 3 times down in the city since.<br />

  dusty tomb does drop of the Ratman Guard in the city area of the Old Ruins of Paineel.  Was down there with the guild on a raid and ended up letting one rot.  2 Sk's in the guild got the ones that we needed and sent out an Ooc for the last.<br />
I think that the Ratman Guard is now a roamer so stick close to the bank or just down from it and you will see one eventually.<br />
<br />
On another thread I read that people were having trouble getting the key from the Mimmic mobs.  We killed the Mimmic or chests in the bank area and out of 3 mobs got 2 keys.  Might have lucked out and gotten good drop rates but they are there.<br />
