The whole Dark Warrior thing won it for me, Anyways, im sure his question has been asked thousands of times, but im stuck between choosing a Troll and an Ogre, my reasons being<br />
<br />
<br />
Troll- get slam, Regain, good melee stats<br />
<br />
<br />
Ogre - Get slam, cant be stunned from the front, great melee stats<br />
<br />
So the question is, is the great melee stats and the stun hing worth more than Regain?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

So if I was choosing between no stun and regen, I'd pick regen every time.<br />
<br />
The only other thing that I will say about running a troll, though, is that the Innothule Swamp zone simply sucks. I have a troll shaman who only goes home to train. She moved out of Grobb and into Oggok around level 2 and never looked back. (If you go a little north then almost due west to the zone line, you almost never run into any mobs at all). If you can build your Oggok faction up enough you might even get to the point that the Oggok SK guild will train you, but that won't happen right away.<br />

Play whichever you feel more comfortable with as regen and unstunnability are both useful, but neither is earth shattering by any means.  Troll has a slightly larger xp penalty than an Ogre, tho an Ogre also has a pretty significant one as well.</div></div><hr />

I'd put the two on almost equal-ground.<br />
<br />
So, you have to ask yourself one question: Which one would make you more excited to play, which one would make you more eager to log in and have fun?<br />
<br />
That's the one you should play. :)<br />

Now, next matter of business.<br />

What server should i put him on? I don't like having lots of chars on the 1 server (Tholuxe Paells)</div></div><hr />

<br />
What I do hate is the exp penalty. I normally group with a halfling druid. I was 4 lvl higher then him now at lvl 40 I'm 2 lvls higher. For every 2 yellows I get he gets 3.</div></div><hr />

Stun (or rather the Ogre invulnerability to) is a big issue with a lot of people.  Troll regen at mid-levels (15 to around 35) really do help a lot if you need to solo while LFG. I can assure you though, the racial exp penalty for trolls really hurts a lot when you hit the level 50 doldrums.<br />
<br />
If I had to roll again, I'd say go with Ogre. Things are mighty slow for my Troll now.</div></div><hr />
