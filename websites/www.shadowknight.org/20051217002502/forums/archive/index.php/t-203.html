<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aphyon D'Veldrin</div><div class="date">03-29-2002, 08:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i have only a few gripes about our class(a few),but everything else it's just great being a SK in norrath,Ladies Love us&lt;grins&gt;<br />
We can call pets to keep us company or chase away unwanted company,we are the best soloers in Norrath i dont care....a mob chasing me just doesnt cut it a 4&quot;11 darkelf chasing a 13 to 20foot giant in GD,RM,Sro or anyzone kicks arse,we can fear kite anything not just animals( i almost.....almost soloed Cazel must of been a bug or something but i was fear kiting him at52nd Season*Note before my guild told me and i was getting hit for 228 to 300 after fear wore off i didint know he was a epic mob for chanter or mage not sure which one*) i was holy bejeezus and ran for zone first &amp; last time i'm ever doing that<br />
<br />
if i knew i had this much power at 15 thru 30 i think i would even be better at fear-kiting in mobs and PvP situations All in All........<br />
<br />
SK's RoxXorZ................:D <br />
i had to get this off my chest,last nite a Monk named Dorfik(monk)<br />
says he would he would group with a Paladin before he grouped with a SK had to school him in the many perks of our class this was a Ooc-conversation in GD, no way was i gonna let him put my Class down zone wide(and in front of my wife Luxora who is a Necro hehe who was in zone atm =D )<br />
<br />
i shut him up and a few pallies as well told em the down falls of their class and vice versa they told me of our faults in out class but.......it came down to who can solo,break mobs,have some pretty decent DoT's to solo with and keep taunt(not just some stun spell woopty-do!):o  &quot;pally1 in zone&quot; but we have LoH and can complete heal our selves<br />
&quot;My Reply&quot;:In exp group that's ok but in PvP situations i'd negate half of your LoH and DoT you to take off the other 1/3 and then HT you for fun &gt;=) to finish you (i'm not gonna deny LoH is a great skill for do or die situations lol)most of their spells root and a few other spells not sure of them i'm gonna look em up to get a idea of what our counter-parts use......<br />

<br />
Is ok with me.  They will better understand the true power of a SK when I'm standing over there lifeless corpse after a duel.</div></div><hr />

<br />
*GM*whoever:&quot;yeah the SK class is a bit unbalanced to their advantage......gets blurry around there (this was about a year ago:p <br />
<br />
Player: i disagree the SK class is seriously lacking in some skills and caps that other hybrids have at their disposal,SK's are sorely overlooked ....blurry around there too im a goob i know but hey...<br />
........what if they left us alont the way we were a year ago not nerf every item they put out there for us blah blah ........ i just remembered thought i'd share with fellow partners in crime<br />
