Hey, I'm a college guy whose been in church for most of his life and used to be on fire for God. Recently (past 2 years) my relationship with God has struggled and I have fallen into bad habits, like 'kitten killing', that I know are not helping things at all. Its such a wierd scenario because I know these things are bad, I've always known it, but I still find myself giving into them. I'm in college where I HAVE to spend a lot of time on the internet and I always end up telling myself its easier to just do it and get it out of the way so that I can get other things done than to sit there thinking about it while trying not to collapse. <br />
<br />
Also, I have created a bit of a dilema for myself in that I know girls in college who are quite willing to have physical relationships with me and I rationalize that by 'kitten killing', at least I'm only causing one of us to sin. This is also a tough spot to be in.<br />
<br />
I was just looking for responses from college guys who might be sticking it out in the same situation. Yell back.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Every day is a new day, I'm thankful for every breath I take. I won't take it for granted, and so I'll learn from my mistakes.&quot; -P.O.D. <br />
<br />
