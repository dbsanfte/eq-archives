<br />
                              Ive been working on faction for greenmist and have turned in a good 1500 bone chips so far. Was curious how many I will need as a Dark Elf follower of Inny.  Farming Bone chips in Kurns tower sure gets boring=\ If you have happened to parse your logs on bone chips being turned in please give me a idea of how many more i must buy/farm. Thanks for the help.<br />

I ended up parking my cleric in front of kurns and just buffing the newbies for chips (lvl 10 necros love having 600-800 HPs).  I also did some torches and MM rings too.<br />
<br />
Kill explorer's in Loio and turn in the knives, you get a larger faction hit each time.  About 3-4 Stacks of knives, i maxed out my factions.  There was another post some where, saying it takes about 400 stacks of bone chips (I did about 320) to max faction, and it supposedly take about 40 stacks of knives.<br />
<br />
The camp is just as boring, but you arent there nearly as long.<br />

<br />
I had fought in LOIO in from my mid teens up to around 30, killing many goblins, sarnaks, and renegades.  Once I decided to begin working on faction, I went out the the caves on the northern coast of FoB, keeping all of the marauder MM snout rings.  I got enough to fill more than 32 backpacks, and turned them in.  I also recovered approximately 360 scorpion pincers in the FoB newbie area.  Lastly, I fought the explorers in nothern LOIO, recovered approximately 4 backpacks of the explorer knives/daggers.<br />
<br />
I am max faction with the warriors, aimiable with SK, indiff to beastlord, and dubious with shaman, necro, and citizens.  I AM able to receive the Greenmist quest.<br />

He is guarding an area in between Cabilis and the tower that the explorers inhabit.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">paustin</div><div class="date">07-30-2002, 01:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok i did the knife quests and am maxed out on cab res, scalled mystics, crusaders, swift tails, and of course legion of cab. But there is a building as i enter from LOIO that is full of robed scowling iksars necros i think...not a problem in itself but the Librarian Zimor the greenmist quest giver also seems to be on this faction...how do i fix this faction??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rastaf</div><div class="date">07-30-2002, 03:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's Brood of Kotiz.  Kill Iksar exiles/bandits/priahs.  900 or so.  You can find lower level ones in the FoB newbie areas (in the pit area, or near Kaesora), or a bunch of static, higher level ones in Warslick Woods.  There's a cave in FoB with some also, but I found that other areas were faster spawn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Orthogonon</div><div class="date">08-12-2002, 01:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, knives are faster than bone chips.  The other think about the explorers is that they usually drop ringmail pieces that you can sell for a few plat.   <br />
<br />
The explorers are on like, a 5 or 6 minute time i think.  In between pops, you can kill the wandering skeletons for a few bone chips and, the iksars for necro faction and, snout rings.</div></div><hr />
