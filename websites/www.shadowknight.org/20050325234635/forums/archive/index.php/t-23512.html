<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Paynreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Why are they being refunded?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Because the costs on them are being changed to be more reasonable.  The way the refund works is they just give you the AA back you don't have to rebuy it so if you have only WA1 for example you're essentially getting 3 free aa's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">They changed the cost of GoD AA on test.  They'll refund the excess spent AA if you already bought them.  However the new cost is structured so that while you pay less AA overall, the first level or so may be more expensive.</div></div><hr />

You can now store more than 30 AAs if they come from a refund, a Customer Service Representative or an in-game script.  AA's earned in-game from experience will still be capped at 30.</div></div><hr />

It could, just saying how it is on test currently.  All AA's remained purchased, you just get spam messages saying you have XXXXX AA's refunded for ability whatever.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Reading the post about code changes on Test explains this a bit better. It seems like it would be smart to get WA1 now, but since the price is increased, you don't get more to spend, you just get it cheaper.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Sarrasis Darkmist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">The change is nice but I'm not sure I like the current implementation on Test.  They can't refund all the GoD aa's because I heard there is still a cap of 100 aa you can have after refunds.  None of the new costs (for any level) should be more than they were previously.  It just seems like a sloppy fix.  Letting people buy them for cheaper now and keep them will skew total AA numbers slightly.  Maybe I'm just being anal but I think that 2 people who have bought the same exact abilities (regardless of when they got them) should have the exact number of total aa's.</div></div><hr />

They are just changing the price and giving you the extra AA back. So, if you bought Pet Affinity for 20 AA, and they are changing it to 12 AA, then you get 8 back. not 8 new ones, but the extra 8 you spent on that skill. So, unless I'm missunderstanding, no one will be gaining AA, if you had 300 AA before with having bought all GoD AA, after you will have 300 AA just with 86 of them unspent.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Zedlepln</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">The uncertainty has to do with the first levels of an AA where the cost is currently lower than the change. Depending how they implement the refunds, you could buy WA1 for 3AA before the change, saving 2AA off the cost from what we are guessing the cost to be after the change.<br />
<br />
I don't see that SOE would allow this discount to happen. They will likely refund any AA with a lower cost and make you buy it over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>kuulaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I imagine your refund will equal<br />
<br />
the amount you payed for the current level ability minus the new cost for the same level of that ability.<br />
<br />
<br />
so if you payed <br />
<br />
5 / 5  to get level 2 of an ability for 10 total AA<br />
<br />
with<br />
<br />
3 / 4 as the new cost to get to level 2 for the same ability for a total 7 AA<br />
<br />
you will get refunded<br />
<br />
<br />
3 AA's<br />
<br />
<br />
AA's you have earned and spent, its not &quot;free&quot; AA's, it just cost adjustment and refunding where applicable.<br />
<br />
<br />
Level 2 of the ability will cost you 7 AA's after the fix, if you spend 10 AA's on it now and get a refund of 3 later, or if you wait and save your 10 AA's and buy it after the change, you still end up with a net savings of 3 AA's.<br />
<br />
<br />
It wont add to your total AA's earned, just give you X amount of unspent AA's</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're right, no one is gaining AA.  But if you were to buy WA1 today, it'd cost you 2 aa points.  If you were to buy WA1 a month from now, it'd cost you 5 aa points.  Now in the end, after you get WA5, it'd cost less overall, but let's say you don't have WA at all right now.  And let's say that everyone tells you to get your defensive aa's done first.  Well, you could spend 2 aa points on WA1 now because it might be a while before you get your defensives finished and can go back to working on WA2/3/4/5 etc.  During the time you spent working on defensives, you got the benefit of a 'cheaper' WA.  I think the suggestion to &quot;buy now&quot; was for those that had not bought any or few GoD aa's yet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As I posted in the other thread this is exactly how they have implemented it thus far.<br />
<br />
If you had only the first or second level of an ability that scaled in cost then at the time of the refund you KEPT that level of ability and got no refund (since at that point you had not overpaid). <br />
<br />
Noone at this point has had to repurchase any level of AA ability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Ghismonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Brael's post for how much the new points will cost is just conjecture.  If it is implemented that way, the way that you &quot;gain AA&quot; is to find the AA levels now that have exponental costs, therefore having a small number in the beginning, and assume that the AA in the December refund patch will become linear, and therefore will cost *more* after the refund.  The previous poster had a good example in Weapon Affinity.  Right now, WA1 is 2 pts.  After patch, if Brael's conjecture is correct, it will cost 5 for WA1.  It is more economical to buy it now.<br />
<br />
Hopefully, however, Sony will realize that err and correct it by completely refunding the cost for AAs which they intend to move from exponential to linear costs.  This way, you must repurchase them no matter when you bought them, and nobody is able to abuse the supposed future costs.</div></div><hr />

I like this option better than letting you 'buy cheap now', but I still see an issue where someone could have bought WA2 as their only GoD aa's.  They will get refunded 6 aa but cannot re-purchase WA2 because now it will cost 10.  Best option, imo, is to adjust the cost without increasing the number needed at all levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Ghismonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Unfortunately, we assume that the reason for moving GOD costs around, in addition to being horribly inflated, is that many have exponential costs and linear benefits.  A linear cost for linear benefits should have been implemented from the jump, but I commend Sony for trying to correct the problem now.  Hopefully, a happy medium can be found.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Kyfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">There are many aa's with linear benefits and scaling costs, not just in GoD. <br />

Having a situation where two people have the same number of aa's, but one has more left over because he bought at a different time is absurd. I hope they don't do it</div></div><hr />

What happens if you've purchased the first level or two and the old is cheaper than the new. For instance Weapon Affinity 1 is 2 points (2, 4, 6, 8, 10) but it's assumed it will be (5, 5, 5, 5, 5) Do you lose the AA? <br />
<br />

You won't lose the AA... I asked Rashere about this awhile back and here is his response... &quot;No one will lose ranks. If the cost of a specific rank increased, then the player just basically got free points.&quot; <br />

I was just figuring cover all my bets and get level one of everything -- since I've already got level 1 of weapon affinity, critical affliction, intense hatred, swift journey, advanced theft of life -- I figure get level one of the rest -- immobilizing bash and vicious smash.  Don't really care about convalescence or improved consumption of the soul, since those are in the &quot;I've already got 800 aa's and running out of stuff to buy&quot; category and will be a long ways off.<br />
