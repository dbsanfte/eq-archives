<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>soulsearcher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok i know theres  a post on it but i was wondering    for  37 sk  where is best zone to solo and what to solo ? ** i have a  65 cleric to tag along with me** any suggestion ive heard  dreadlands and  loy  but what mobs and what could i solo if  im not  2 boxing my cleric at  the time ne help would be much appreciated</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shirou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">That isn't really soloing...but try a zone with an experience % modifier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kromglon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It would help us to know if your twinked. What kind of gear you got. I could name off tons of outdoor zones to do it in. That level its hard to fear kite because our snare isnt that great and youll be training stuff in dungeons. As far as I know no outdoor zones give any bonus xp but I could be wrong.<br />
<br />
 OT is gravy fear kiting and if you dont have that gate hammer  you could turn in the whips for faction dealing with it. You could probably handle Gunthak or Guntrhak whatever the heck it is too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>soulsearcher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have  1407 hp and  856 ac unbuffed ..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ramgar SK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Echo Caverns are close by, Gulf of Gunthak isn't so close, but you could solo stuff at the beach.<br />
<br />
You should be able to get a group pretty easy in DL.  With the new group bonus, exp goes pretty fast there.  You can also solo there pretty easy along the south wall of the castle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Putrid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You can solo in Crystal caverns, just takes some practice.  The orc miners can be pulled singly from the entrance by EW or from the dwarf town.  Just learn where the spawn points are and look for wanderers coming.  I used to grab one just past the dwarf city and run back to the icy room with a some water at the bottom and just fear kite in there.  You could alway go to guards if all hell break loose, but it shouldn't. <br />
You can also solo the terrors at the broken bridge room, but that is a little harder, due to there pathing, and some mobs in the water.  There is also a guard that will kill steal you.<br />
<br />
CC has an exp bonus, I believe, and has good loot.</div></div><hr />
