<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Pulverizer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello everyone,<br />
<br />
I'm kind of wondering how far a shadowknight and shaman duo could get assuming they're bazaar-, ldon-ish equipped with decent amount of AAs (like all defensive AAs for Sk, Canni5+healing AAs for shaman)? Would healing power or dps be the limiting factor?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Meriboh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Considering I don’t play all that much anymore, I can only offer limited information based on my experience.<br />
I am also Bazaar equipped.<br />
<br />
I also dou box an SK and Shaman. The furthest I was able to go comfortably was PoN.<br />
I’m sure with appropriate levels and AAs, I’d be able to go further. All the older world zones like Sebelis, Chardok etc are very doable, of course.<br />
With both pets up, hasted and buffed, the dps is nothing to turn your nose up at. The healing shouldn’t be a problem, as long as the mob is slowed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Pulverizer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ouch! PoN?<br />
<br />
I was kinda hoping you could duo in places like HoH, BoT, ToSR, maybe some OOW? Anyone else care to comment?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kelv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">In bazar gear, HoH maybe, ToSR, BoT and beyond no way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You would probably have to be comfortable aggro kiting with that hydra pair, but basically you could duo pretty easily with a SK and a SHM on anything that doesnt summon. This would mean HoH, Tactics, and even Water or Fire would be doable...but pretty would be slow overall.<br />
<br />
Root rotting with just a SHM and SK would be horribly slow also.<br />
<br />
With a straight ahead :: SK pull &gt; SHM slow &gt; SK Tank &gt; SHM heal :: or some varriation of that sort of routine, you would generally be most comfortable on older content. How old depends on the characters and their hp/ac/mana. There must be some spots in GoD and OoW that would also work with all of the low hp mobs.<br />
<br />
That's just what came to mind, good luck...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rhumba_Kween</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Post a magelo, lots depends on how well you're geared, and what kind of AA's you have.<br />
<br />
I can tell you that GoD is mostly out for you, although you could do some of the easier zones for sure. Quinimi, Riwii.<br />
<br />
Oow on the other hand might have some surprises for you. Certainly a well Bazaar/Ldon equipped SK/Shammy duo could handle several spots. If I were you I'd try one of the Dranik's hollows instances and see how it goes. It will be mostly 1 to 2 pulls. If you work at it a tiny bit, they are easy single pulls. I will say that your dps will probably be very low for it. The mobs seem to actually have some hps which is nice compared to GoD, but might hurt your duo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sadandroid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">.. I'm a not-so-god equipped SK with 8k+ buffed (defense + offense maxed, 200 AAs) and my shammy has only about 70 AAs. I can duo HoH, BoT and PoTa Pit without too much probs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Silku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've duoed in most planes, all the way up.  My wife and I duo in water at entrance, earth mobs, pof yard trash, storms at the pond(armadillos), PoI factory, Justice at the High Guardians.  Barindu, Natimbi, Ferubi.  The possibilities are pretty unlimited as you get into the higher AA.  Until mobs starting hitting for 900+ or are only &quot;slightly slowed&quot;.   I do know that with LR 5, 68000 hp, and shaman at like 50 aa, we duoed in BoT, storms and Valor easily.   Valor inner is some great exp duo.</div></div><hr />

Well that's a nice amount of hps you got there ;)<br />
I'll chime in here, magelos below, I can easily do HoH/Riwwi haven't tried elementals due to lack of flag, but they shouldn't be too hard as long as mobs don't hit much harder than 600-700 and are slowable. Most of the time healing is done only with Breath of Trushar, hardly any direct heals.<br />
I've recently started duoing a murkgliders cave in oow that's also quite easy, did a few mobs in NC too, same deal, as long as they are solo and slowable and doesn't hit for more than 600-700 then everything pretty much can be killed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Inspect my SK and CLE magelo isn't all that accurate but close enough... i can do BOT and HOH duo without slows... an SK and shaman could do it much easier and more effeciently. Max you could do would probably be like WoS level mobs duo with SK+Shaman i imagine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Pulverizer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Sorry for taking so long to reply. The characters in question are basically old alts with poor or no equipment, hence no magelos.<br />
<br />
I decided to reactivate an old account and move my 52 cleric over to it making this a trio. Dps will be low when &quot;soloing&quot;, but hey add three more friends to this &quot;backbone&quot; and you got yourself a group!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I can confirm that with fewer HP than Shumm, my shaman friend and I can duo Ferubi consistantly and without issue, albeit setting up camp near a zone line so we don't catch roaming dogs on two sides, and Barindu is cake.  We've duoed a couple of expeditions as well, though Plant mobs are a bit much for just the two of us at our current gear/aa level.  Anything oldworld, Kunark, Velious or Luclin we cut through like a knife through hot butter, and based on our flags we've not yet found anything in PoP we have access to that we can't duo.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure how much success you'd have 2-boxing, but two individuals playing the characters should have no problems unless they're under geared/aa'd or incompetent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Pulverizer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">It occured to me since my first post that sure a shaman shadowknight duo could do lots if they were already equipped and had spells to match (trushar's anyone?). But since my chars aren't there yet I'll have to compensate in some way and adding the cleric would be the logical choice for now. If the cleric turns out to be unneccesary later on I can always trade him for my necro!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>sasarle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">i duo a sk and shaman and i have no problems duoing all the way up to EP's for exp.  i find as long as the mobs dont have the ability to hit over the 6oo-700 range you are golden.  get yourself a horse and learn how to make and use hotkeys.  they are the most effective way of controllong a DC alt.  i left a magelo of my gear and shamans gear at the bottom. nothing special for shaman just regular bazaar and luclin gear.  may be a bit off but nothing huge. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Krassus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I have been duoing PoValor inner for a steady 2~%ish at 63 per kill of regular EXP. I use a 66 shammy with Time / Ikkinz gear and my SK has bazaar gear mostly</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Marruk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I've duoed Named mobs in Riwwi arena with a Shammy (although the one that summoned a pet once we got her to 20% ate us alive).<br />
The pure melee ones were cake.<br />
The Shammy has a lot more aa than I, but I'd say is not generally as well geared (except for his epic and a few pieces of ornate)... not that I'm well geared.</div></div><hr />
