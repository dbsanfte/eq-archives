<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nazak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Looking over the sony boards, I noticed this gem from Brenlo:<br />
<br />
The AAs I have seen will greatly support this play style.  They should be arriving on beta in the next week or two.  (they are not being included as Omens AAs, they are just being tested on beta, you will recieve these AAs to fill out your compliment and then a new set of Omens AAs if you choose to get it.)<br />
<br />
Brenlo Bixiebopper<br />
Community Relations Manager<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok, fair enough, so I scroll up to check the play style to which Brenlo is referring.  Here's what I found:<br />
<br />
We can gain aggro in the wink of a eye and be back on target whacking<br />
away at same mob everyone else is hitting or go after the mob we just stunned.<br />
The caster that we justed saved from getting beat on by a 900hp / hit or up type<br />
hitter will be looking at us puzzled thinking that crazy berserker is at it again..<br />
gonna get himself killed and soaking the healers mana up.<br />
I see a named running around killing the casters while MT is handling another named...<br />
I pop a stun on that bad boy he comes to me and I hit my RIP disc and hope the Tank Mezz<br />
gets there in 12 sec and can get aggro off me. Oh well, if I die is better then losing the clerics.<br />
<br />
Such is the life of a Kamakazi Beerserker!!<br />
<br />
We just need AA to support this play style.<br />
<br />
<br />
Funny, that's quite a bit like what I'm used to doing on raids (excepting the part about &quot;I hit my RIP disc&quot;).  Sounds like one less role for me...<br />
<br />
They truly seem to be painting themselves into a corner when it comes to a role for SK's, and honestly, the likelyhood of my continued subscription seems to get smaller with just about everything out of their mouths.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway, here's the thread, if you're interested:<br />

<br />
I agree that Berz are screwed up as bad or worse than any other class in EQ but essentially pulling the last broken leg out from under the other most screwed up class to toss them a bone?  GIMME A BREAK!<br />
<br />
Er...oh wait...they had no problem doing the same thing to Shaman with the BST class...just snake anything of value and give it to the new GM favorite twink of the week...and some people actually gave a damn about Shaman.<br />
<br />
So I guess we shouldn't be too shocked.  Maybe they can update the Berz to wear Plate in the next expansion or just make a lot more ALL/ALL armor that has tank ac and stats...hell now I'm thinking about their epic too...I gotta go drink.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Arikash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thier epic disgusts me.  It's almost an EP type of weapon, easily obtainable by a single group of baz geared people(that happened on Veeshan, so don't argue with me), while ours is obtainable by a single group no, but not easily, long hours of camping shit/killing golems in fear = not amazingly fun for a shitty weapon.<br />
<br />
And on top of that, how do ber's get aggro, I was in a group with one once, and we let him tank for shits and giggles, and he couldn't keep aggro for jack shit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rueeliar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">They keep aggro with endurance-funded stuns and snares... the same big things that both knight classes use to get aggro.  Their stuns and snares do not have the aggro output that our's do, however...<br />
<br />
That, and their melee style is high aggro.  Knight-ratio weapons with more attacks than any other class while using them (they get innate chances to attack an extra time as early as level 11, and Double Attack for real at 18, thus can triple attack at level 18) with a free extra round of melee every 6 seconds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vaclav</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Zerkers hold aggro quite well, comparable to a conservative stunning paladin - I'd imagine their stuns give the same aggro per stun, just their limitation of 1 stun per 12 sec vs. 1 stun per 4 sec for a paladin is the primary difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shredderr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My berserker (58) has always tanked over wars/knights in my groups just because stun was that much aggro and they didnt really  know what they were doing. I'm sure 65 would be different with hard hitters and not wanting to take that damage, but yeah they can take it pretty easily/quick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Visvires</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If berserkers wanting to be something more then warriors who cant tank makes you quit eq, i can't help but wonder what kept you here this long.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Rueeliar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">They were thinking that the game didn't have enough classes whose primary role was DPS, clearly.

<br />
This is a little misleading.  Their frenzy isn't an additional combat round, it's an additional attack like kick is for rangers.  Apparently they get innate crits though, so that's wonderful.<br />
<br />
Too add insult to injury in the BER to SHD comparison, they also get disciplines which add to the entire group's benefit.  Sound like taps?  Only it goes to your current discipline box.  The downside is that it currently overwrites whatever your discipline running is, but I'm sure it'll not do that very soon now.  Hey, can we get group taps to go short duration yet?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Nazak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I certainly don't begrudge Berserkers having a role.  If they are a class, they should have a role.  What I don't care for, and find demoralizing is when that role seems to be carved predominantly out of what was formerly my class' turf.  Maybe even worse is the fact that Brenlo et al consitantly avoid discussion of SOE's vision for the SK, while they ask us to buy into it for another five levels in another expansion.</div></div><hr />

Hi, did you read the entire post?  Or just block out the part about the Riposte tanking or the shift to support beserkers having a role that we used to have?  Or the total lack of anything informative, or even extreamly vague about what directions SKs are going to be moved towards besides extention via neglect?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kaxler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Unless its changed since it came out, Frenzy is 1-3 extra regular melee hits roughly on kick timer, not kick damage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Interesting then that one of the items on the BER top ten list is to make frenzy damage based off of weapon damage.<br />
<br />
I have to say, it is a potential problem that the BER AA list is going to support the style of play described in that post, though they didn't really mention anything about them necessarily surviving such a tactic.  I'm still waiting for that class description list to come out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Vnayr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Yeah I read the whole post.<br />
Point is what world do you live in?<br />
<br />
I watch stupid bestlords die everyday.  They arent tanks.<br />
You are supposed be a tank.  This baord cries for reasons to be tanks.<br />
<br />
Do you want it all or something? You want snap agro, you want to be a viable tank solution next to a warrior, and I bet you even want sony to buy you some hookers or something.<br />
<br />
Get over it, you can post all the fag as theory threads you want, but bezerkers are so far away from approching us in balance that its sad.<br />
<br />
They are no more threatening in this aspect than rangers with snare, and WS.<br />
<br />
If it keeps people alive, and keeps progression going then who cares.  The balance swings back and forth as the years go buy.. we are in a low spot now, but the sky is not falling.<br />
<br />
The worst enemy to SK balance right now are cry babies that dont know the role, or have the skill to perform it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Noctix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Why the hell did SOE introduce the Berzerker class in the first place?  Or beastlords, rangers, paladins, shadowknights, bards, shaman, etc.?<br />
<br />
Seriously, there should be three class types: warrior, cleric, and wizard.  Warriors get innate tanking and melee.  Clerics get innate healing.  Wizards get innate nuking.  Warriors can then use AA to buy hybrid style spells.  Clerics can use AA go get shaman/druid style spells.  Wizards use AA to buy chanter/mage/necro style spells.<br />
<br />
That takes care of ALL class balance issues and players can tailor their character in any way they like.  For a second, I thought they figured this out for EQ2...then I saw all the derived classes branching off the main ones.<br />
<br />
Then again, if there were true class balance, no one would visit the message boards anymore  :D<br />
<br />
I'm still waiting for that class description list to come out.<br />
If you were SOE, would you be in any rush to release those class descriptions?  They can only result in two things:<br />
1) People bitching because they don't like SOE's description<br />
2) People bitching because their spells/abilities don't reflect their description</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Rueeliar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Do you want it all or something? You want snap agro, you want to be a viable tank solution next to a warrior, and I bet you even want sony to buy you some hookers or something.<br />
<br />
That'd be cool.  Make sure they're busty Japanese women just out of college, trying to fit into those cute little sailor suits that stopped being &quot;snug&quot; when her chest filled out, mmkay?<br />
<br />
Not sure how you can go from two reasonable requests to something ludicrous and expect to be taken seriously, but whatever.<br />
<br />
They are no more threatening in this aspect than rangers with snare, and WS.<br />
<br />
Don't suppose you have noticed how easy it is for Rangers to acquire massive amounts of Avoidance and decent amounts of Shielding compared to us, have you?  Or how well they tank after they have it.  Here's a good example for you, a guildy of mine.<br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=417770<br />
<br />
37 Avoidance<br />
11 Shielding<br />
Improved Dodge 1<br />
Improved Parry 2<br />
<br />
&quot;For a ranger,&quot; he tanks very well.  Outside of raids, he tanks so well it's embarrassing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I watch stupid bestlords die everyday. They arent tanks. <br />
<br />
Ignoring the fact that neither are beastlords, monks, rogues, etc., yet they still present something of a balance issue for us...<br />
<br />
If you read the original post, it tends to suggest they may well be moving in that direction, at least to an extent that would greatly enfringe on a large part of our so-called role.  <br />
<br />
Do you want it all or something? You want snap agro, you want to be a viable tank solution next to a warrior, and I bet you even want sony to buy you some hookers or something. <br />
<br />
Snap aggro and tanking... humm, that sounds suspiciously like umm... oh, what is it... oh yeah! the role we've had since the beginning of EQ!<br />
<br />
Get over it, you can post all the fag as theory threads you want, but bezerkers are so far away from approching us in balance that its sad.<br />
<br />
Yeah, berzerkers are fucked up.  Dicking over the next most fucked up class isn't the way to fix them.  <br />
<br />
They are no more threatening in this aspect than rangers with snare, and WS.<br />
<br />
That constitues a reasonably large threat... rangers aren't amazingly far behind us in tanking, have comperable aggro, have the best invuln disc, have non-damage snare and root.  SK's have had two major complaints since February or whenever: 1) We're too far behind warriors/pallys &amp; 2) we're not far enough ahead of rangers and other DPS classes, who are even situationally better.  <br />
<br />
If it keeps people alive, and keeps progression going then who cares. The balance swings back and forth as the years go buy.. we are in a low spot now, but the sky is not falling.<br />
<br />
That last bit is why this constitutes a problem.  When you're &quot;in a low spot&quot; you need to be getting better relative to the rest of the playing field, not worse.  Upgrading broken classes is good, but upgrading broken classes at the expense of other broken classes (if someone trys to bring the semantics of the word &quot;broken&quot; into this, I'm killing his/her dog or something) isn't the way to do it.  <br />
<br />
The worst enemy to SK balance right now are cry babies that dont know the role, or have the skill to perform it.<br />
<br />
Skill doesn't reduce the DPS you take or your likelyhood of being one-rounded.  Skill is important for pulling, but anyone who trys to say that our tanking woes are the least bit related to &quot;skill&quot; needs a reality check.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They can hold aggro reasonably well(I used to play one and found that the whole &quot;resisted slows REALLY FUCKING PISS THOSE MOBS OFF&quot; mechanic was *very* useful.  I had SKs pull, and stack all their dots and stuff on the mob, and I could actually with just two slow get the mob to actually LEAVE the SK and come AFTER me, even with the SK in point blank range.<br />
<br />
Granted this was pre planar, but not by much.  Hell with a good stack of mana regen and flowing though a bst can effectively play the old Schtick of chain healing their pet.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Rueeliar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">You're missing the point.<br />
<br />
1. SK's have no well-defined raid role granted by SoE<br />
2. SK's in raiding guilds have been forced to define themselves<br />
3. Most SK's have elected to gear themselves towards off-tanking<br />
&lt;b&gt;4. A pure melee class which vastly outperforms knights in damage, and is capable of stunning, snaring, and buffing the party's melee output is now unambiguously stated to be intended for an offtanking role.&lt;/b&gt;<br />
<br />
Don't suppose you've noticed that Chain gear is overflowing with Avoidance by default, and that Berzerkers have a base of what... 200 less hp than knights?  I'm not sure I have the imagination to pretend it doesn't seem threatening to SK's as a class.  I wont tantrum or get up in arms about it because it's nothing new.  SoE doesn't care about knights.  That's all there is.  I'll go on doing the same shit I always have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>scaledge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I do to some degree feel that berks(I call them that because in forgotten realm berk is what demons from lower planes say instead of, well, dipshit, heheh, which is basically what berks are atm) are what warriors should have been.  high hp(well, relatively for a chain class), low AC tanks with decent avoidance, high combat versatility, and moderate tanking abilities, with above average dps.<br />
<br />
However, the difficulty with predefined roles is this:There are far too few.<br />
<br />
At this point, the predefined roles are(followed by the classes falling within them):<br />
Tank(SK, PAL, WAR)<br />
Offtank(SK, PAL, WAR, RNG, BST, MNK)<br />
DPS(ROG, MNK, RNG, BER, WIZ, MAG, DRU, NEC, SHD)<br />
Tank/dps hybrid(BER, BST, SK, RNG)<br />
Healer(DRU, CLE, SHM)<br />
Support(PAL, BRD, DRU, ENCH, SHM)<br />
<br />
Now, at this point, you can tell that the two largest overlaps are offtank and DPS, closely followed by support and tank/dps hybrid.  SHD fall into more categories than almost anyone else, but our problem is most of our abilities are spread so thinly, that we have no &quot;Focus&quot;.  Our class is spread so thinly that no one can actually figure out which of it's myraid roles it is SUPPOSED to fit into, and which are simply convenient utilities.<br />
<br />
At this point the SK community is split into three groups who want different roles:<br />
<br />
Offtank<br />
Tank/dps hybrid<br />
Tank<br />
<br />
in order of size from largest to smallest.  Luckily, if we play our cards correctly, the first two can go hand in hand, so lets scrap no. 3.  That leaves us with Offtank and Tank/DPS hybrid.  Lets look at our uses for just those two roles, currently, even if they are CRAPPY or even completely USELESS in those aspects, let us count them if they contribute at all, no matter how inefficiently:<br />
<br />
Offtank:<br />
Second Highest HP base(dangerously close to Berks however)<br />
Plate usable AC<br />
High Aggro generation(but not as high as warriors)<br />
Taps(HP, AC, ATK, etc.)<br />
Diamond Skin(ewwwwwww.  Crappy I know but lets count it anyway)<br />
<br />
Tank/DPS hybrid:<br />
All above tanking effectiveness<br />
Spears<br />
DoTs<br />
Taps give good balance of offense and support combinations<br />
<br />
Now lets look at what detracts from both OR would help/should help but does not due to bugs or poor implementation:<br />
<br />
Terrors do not work correctly<br />
Universal high resist rates compared to other classes<br />
Lower than average mana pool<br />
poor avoidance<br />
most spells do not stack with other classes.<br />
<br />
Now, we have isolated our largest issue.  Our class partially does not work because the tools we should have are given in the wrong manner, or do not work.  Therefore I propose the following changes:<br />
<br />
Correct terrors so that they generate acceptable aggro.<br />
Increase resist modifiers for all Knight(especially SK) spells across the board to make them in line with other classes.<br />
Give both knight classes an AA which boosts avoidance to make up for HP difference and mitigation difference between disced warriors and knights.<br />
Give SKs one upgraded version of each SK usable DoT line at high levels(60+), possibly quested or raided ala luclin era rare spells OR ala Life Leech.<br />
All said spells should be shadowknight only castable, and stack with all spells of other classes(IE necros).<br />
Give both shadowknights and paladins a new AA:Knight's Piety.  This gives knights a bonus to bash damage and AC above and beyond that of all other classes when using a shield.<br />
Give Sks an AA similar to that of paladin AA Act of Valor:Final Vengeance.  This allows the Shadowknight to choose to kill themself to deal an amount of damage equal to their current hitpoints to the target monster, with a reuse time of one hour.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, suggestion by suggestion, what do you guys think.  I will try to fine tune this list based on all of your suggestions in order to make it submittable to SoE.  Once it is in an acceptable format, I will continually stuff the damned thing into their faces until they AKNOWLEDGE the suggestions, regardless of the time it takes.  at the very least they will want to make some sort of commentary on it if for no other reason than to shut me up, eventually.<br />
<br />
What do you guys think?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Eclipsia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Offtopic a little but thought i'd post how I perceived the berserker role from a historically (and accurate) point of view. The name originally heralds from Norse mythology, they worshipped the bear, hence there name which translates as 'bear-clad'. They were to all intents and purposes a leather class. They were designated as shock troops, they were not tanks but dealt huge mellee damage and mitigated damage well due to the frenzied state they fought in. This 'bloodlust' made them extremely unpredictable in combat and they would often cut down their own allies in battle in there uncontrolled rages. This could have been implemented really well into the game mechanics, a high DPS, leather class, with decent mitigation. The 'bloodlust' could have been coded similarly to PC charm to reflect the unpredictability of there attacks, so they could, at times, lose control of their targets and mellee group members, and thus need to be mezzed, blurred or rooted until the rage had passed. Hopefully when new class descriptions emerge, both us as SKs and those as berserkers will be better able to argue our case for specific changes based on those descriptions.</div></div><hr />

My point with this is I constantly make suggestions, give out ideas, make constructive critisism, but almost all I hear on this board is bitch bitch, whine whine, &quot;Sks are broken but we dont know how to fix em&quot;  &quot;How about this&quot;  &quot;STFU we dont want to have ideas we want sony to figure everything out for us!&quot;.  Whenever someone makes a valid suggestion(I have seen several) they are either summarilly flamed, ignored, or just give up on it because of one of the above two.<br />
<br />
If you guys want to get your damn class fixed get off your lazy asses and do something about it instead of asking for everything on a fucking silver platter.  All I hear is &quot;WTF bad idea that idea sucks go away noob you dont know how SKs work we arent DPS we are add tanks but we dont even know how to be better add tanks so we arent going to give better ideas&quot;.  You just bitch whine and moan.  That may have worked for warriors but that was just because they are the largest playerbase, and had the support of almost every other class on top of that.  If you expect bitching and moaning to work for the SK class, then too bad, you aren't a fucking furor and we ain't got one dammit.<br />
<br />
Few people on this forum are in a position to flame every idea someone else gives when they don't have any fucking alternative.<br />
<br />
I have heard it from almost every other class board that the general consensus is, paraphrased, &quot;The SKs are too stupid to figure out WHAT they even want, how the hell do they expect to get it?&quot;.  I happen to agree with em.<br />
<br />
Day after day you guys get suggestions from people who don't play SKs just because everyone pities the class so much they are trying to help you freaks get fixed, all you do is bitch and moan more and flame em off the boards.  You were yelling at the warriors for the same damned thing before the melee revamp, so get your heads outta your asses and stop being damned hypocrits!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Askeer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">What the class will become is not decided on these boards anyway.<br />
And don't think that because no one answers, no one reads.<br />
<br />
One thing I agree with tho : this board is filled with useless whining.</div></div><hr />

We bring our suggestions to the warrior boards, THEY tell us that it's rediculous(sp?).  We've presented our ideas to Sony, there isn't much else to do but bitch, so STFU.<br />

Someone's a little bitter he didn't get selected for class correspondent?</div></div><hr />

Still qualifies as &quot;getting screwed by sony&quot; - same as the rest of us.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>scaledge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Ok gobgob, I have to admit that was a good line.<br />
<br />
Well if we are giving all these sugestion then what is our class correspondent doing, sitting on his ass?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">I'm sure Brael is doing anything but sitting on his ass; just because you're the class correspondant doesn't mean that he gets dev's addresses and runs around knocking on doors and busting skulls because they don't listen. He makes the top 10 based on what he thinks and what this board says, and then he hands it to ....... fuck, I forget the name..... not Absor..... I'll call him Shithead. Shithead in turn gives the lists (from each class) to the devs to do what they see fit to do with them. Being class correspondant doesn't give Brael almighty-god power... he can only pass along information, in the hopes the devs will like it and put it in the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>scaledge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Well, he wont have much to correspond with unless we decide what the hell SKs need to get in the first place.<br />
<br />
I mean, &quot;something to improve offtanking&quot;.  Wuwu, I'm sure theres only several billion vague possibilities for that.<br />
<br />
We need to be more specific or we aren't going anywhere.<br />
<br />
Hopefully the OOW AA list shows an improvement in our importance to SoE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">If our top 10 is too specific, it's just that much less likely that we'll get something from it.  By being general, we leave them options.  If we say we need &quot;Discipline of Shadowknight Tanking Prowess with this and that specification&quot; and the dev's don't like it, we're shit outta luck.  If we ask for &quot;something to improve offtanking&quot; then that leaves them a lot more options.  Note that Brael also passes along specific ideas/threads/whatever for the dev's to read, so dev's do get an idea of what we want more specifically.  <br />
<br />
We shouldn't be the ones trying to decide exactly what it is that needs to be done to fix us; we should come up with logical possibilities/ideas.  It's the dev's position to decide what we'll ultimately get.  The less specific we are, the more likely they are to come up with a solution deemed acceptable.</div></div><hr />

Brenlo is the name you are looking for but I believe Rytan is the spells guy <br />
<br />
Brenlo = assling cleric<br />
Rytan = assling druid <br />
if I remember right.<br />
<br />
Thier epic disgusts me.  It's almost an EP type of weapon, easily obtainable by a single group of baz geared people.<br />
I've only grouped with one non-epiced zerker.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>scaledge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Yes, agreed.  Zerker epic is ridiculous.<br />
<br />
More so because even the BST epic, which was released 2 expansions post the ranger epic, is still comparable in power.<br />
<br />
Yet zerkers come out and get this uber near endgame POP style weapon.  With tons of effects that are useful and stats and shit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>kharan_zechts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">If they made the zerker epic kunark level.. why do it when you can just go grab a wind blade from the bazaar?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">The same reason anybody else does the epics these days.  Pride.  I see no justification for such a good reward from such an easy quest.  Where are you Risk vs. Reward?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>kharan_zechts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">But zerkers are a new class. Why would soe spend all their time and effort making an epic quest that nobody would do except a few peeps that have a lot of time on their hands.<br />
<br />
Also have to consider most zerkers are alts. If they made it hard with big raids needed not many people would do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Arikash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">Well, the bst epic still wasn't up to par with high end Luclin when it came out, and about of average difficulty when it came out 2 expansions later, so why should 1 class have an easy ass epic, that gives you almost an elemental type weapon for about 10 hours of running back and forth through NPCS?<br />
<br />
I don't really see a justification, do you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Tropics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">Furthermore why would their EP level epic be easier to get then our PoS epic even today?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">its so people not doing high end raiding or advancement buy the expansion and level up a berserker so they can easily get an uber weapon.<br />
easy $$$.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Jupke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">OK, i've got the solution, nobody wants to hear it, but i'll tell it anyway.<br />
Add COFFEE to the game. This way SK's can go and fetch coffee on the raids and will be back in time to loot. I dont see any other way to make SK's usefull again.</div></div><hr />

Yes but how long until no one wants us fetching coffee on raids because another class gets the ability to fetch BEER?   :D</div></div><hr />

Risk Vs Reward.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>scaledge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">For the notable piece:<br />
<br />
Warrior says &quot;Okay, time out here.&quot;<br />
Warrior pulls out a book entitled &quot;Risk vs. Reward&quot;<br />
Warrior pages thru it &quot;Okay, Epic weapons are just supposed to be ones that you would use in any...any sit--any...&quot;<br />
Enchanter glances over &quot;Situation.&quot;<br />
Warrior says &quot;Shut up, I knew that.&quot;<br />
Enchanter chuckles.<br />
Warrior says &quot;But mine is only a little better and a ranger's is...&quot;<br />
Shadowknight says &quot;Hey mine ain't too great and look at how hard it-&quot;<br />
VerantEmployee appears.<br />
VerantEmployee summons a mystical window.<br />
VerantEmployee grabs &quot;Risk vs. Reward,&quot; points at the epic weapons, and tosses Risk vs. Reward out the mystical window.<br />
VerantEmployee says &quot;How's THAT for an analogy!&quot;<br />
VerantEmployee poofs.<br />
Warrior shoves Ranger.<br />
Warrior says &quot;First you cry about your defense caps and now this!&quot;<br />
Ranger shoves back.<br />
Ranger says &quot;I'm gonna show you the analogy of me breaking my foot off in your-&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">Shadow Knight tries to make a point, but there aren't enough of him to be listened to <br />
<br />
Wizard says &quot;Yeah but frankly we don't like people like you coming.&quot;<br />
Enchanter sighs, wishing he was any good for boss fights.<br />
BunchaDeadPlayers agree.<br />
Monk comforts Enchanter, &quot;Don't worry, at least you're not a Shadow Knight.&quot;<br />

<br />
No. The worst enemy of SK balance right now is the handful who ask for more lube.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>scaledge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">Agreed.  So many SKs think just because they dont suck all the time, they are fine.<br />
<br />
The issue is once warriors start getting ridiculously high aggro dishing out weapons with anger III augs and aggro procs.  A lot of people can't seem to realize that.</div></div><hr />

Both extremes are a problem.</div></div><hr />

What does that have to do with anything?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>scaledge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">The point is that much of our class issues is that we have a huge horde of idiot SKs who say we are fine due to lack of experience in the situations we are NOT fine in.</div></div><hr />
