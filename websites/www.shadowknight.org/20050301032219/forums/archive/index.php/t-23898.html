<br />
Boomjak (a pally) wrote this up:<br />
<br />
(Ghoulbane Quest) <br />
The Dusty Blue Stone  <br />
<br />
*Talk to Vida Sweeps in Nettleville Hovel to obtain the quest. <br />
<br />
*Visit The Baubleshire and talk to Tawli Whiskwind in Baubleshire. She will give you a broom. <br />
<br />
*Go back to Vida and she will give you the Dusty Blue Stone. <br />
<br />
*Examine the stone and you will be given the quest. <br />
<br />
*Go to Greystone Yard and talk to Gruffin Goldtooth. <br />
<br />
*Head to Thunderous Steppes and mine 40 rock samples. You only get credit from samples mined from Windswept Stones. Stonecrest Ore will not give you credit. You need 90 skill in mining to obtain the samples. (You can get to 20 in Oakmyst Forest and to 90 in Antonica.) <br />
<br />
*Once you have your rock samples head back to Greystone yard and talk to Gruffin again. He will tell you to seek out a mage who understand minerals. <br />
<br />
*Head to South Qeynos, enter the mage tower and use the red portal to visit Aristride Calais. He will ask for the stone and send you to Thundermist Village in Thunderous Steppes. The village is somewhat hard to find. Follow the main road from Antonica into Thunderous Steppes. It will eventually make an &quot;s&quot; turn. You will see some wagons, etc., barricaded up to your left. That is the entrance to the village. <br />
<br />
*Talk to Olden Highguard in Thundermist Village and he will send you back to Aristride Calais. <br />
<br />
*Aristride Calais will send you to find a priest. <br />
<br />
*Head to the Temple of Life in North Qeynos and talk to Toranim Skyblade. <br />
<br />
*Toranim will send you to StormHold to kill 29 ghouls. You don't actually need to kill ghouls. I killed Defiled Sentries and it worked just fine. <br />
<br />
*Head back to Toranim and you will be given two choices. You can end the quest, which I did not do, or you can continue on. If you continue on, you will receive the Restoring Ghoulbane quest. <br />
<br />
*A Key to the Past Quest. You are asked to complete the access quest for Tomb of Valor. <br />
<br />
*Head to the Library in Stormhold. You may require a group depending on your level. The mobs were blue (group 2up arrow) mobs to a level 25.<br />
<br />
*Talk to the Librarian and he will give you the access quest. <br />
<br />
*Kill Defiled Squires until you receive all three pages that the Librarian has asked for. <br />
<br />
*Return to the Librarian. <br />
<br />
*Kill Defiled Knights until you receive two more pages. [Thanks to P.Calvert] <br />
<br />
*Return to the Librarian. <br />
<br />
*Head to the chessboard and Kill Lord Andros. He is a rare spawn so you may need to kill the priest placeholders and wait. He is a level 20 group mob with two guards. <br />
<br />
*Head towards the spiral staircase and into the barracks. Guard Captain Hess is another rare spawn who spawns at the very back of this room. You need to kill him. He also has two guards. <br />
<br />
*Head down the spiral staircase to level 2 and into the Atrium. Go South, and you will find a room with Defiled Cruasder(s), A Locked Strongbox and hidden in on the right two Zombie Handmaidens. Kill the Handmaidens to finish this part of the quest. <br />
<br />
*Head back to the Librarian who will tell you to go find a key. Why didn't he tell you all this in the first place? =) <br />
<br />
*Head to the entrance of StormHold and look by the statue beside Sir Valinayle for a key. Grab the key and you have access to Tomb of Valor. <br />
<br />
Tomb of Valor<br />
*ToV is an instanced zone. You can enter it once every 8 hours if you fail the mission or once per week if you succeed. <br />
<br />
*You need a minimum of three people to enter the zone. <br />
<br />
*Get your ToV group and enter the zone. Do NOT touch anything. Touching the coffins, etc. spawns mobs. <br />
<br />
*The sword should be on the wall to your left as you enter the zone. Go and grab the sword. Finish the instance or not as you wish. <br />
*Head back to Toranim Skyblade in the Temple of Life and get the Weakened Ghoulblade. <br />
<br />
Reward: Weakened Ghoulbane: Primary Slot, One-Handed, Skill 160-190, Damage 9-27, Delay 1, Health +24, Wisdom +1, Power +24, Strength +5, LORE, NO TRADE. <br />
The quest continues from here, though I do not yet have the information. <br />
<br />
Final Reward: Ghoulbane: Primary Slot, One-Handed, Skill 160-200, Damage 11-34, Delay 1, Health +28, Wisdom +5, Power +28, Strength +9, LORE, NO TRADE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bulvyne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">From what I've read on other forums, the initial part (to get the Dusty Blue Stone), you have to have an alt do it, or someone else, as long as they haven't Examined the stone. The stone is tradeable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sadandroid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You can also buy it from the blackmarket in EFP. Its quite often offered.<br />
<br />
Stuermchen</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hurst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've started this quest and I'm up to the ghoul kill'n part. I can confirm that the qeynos NPCs invovled with this quest (so far)will talk to you even if evil  ;) <br />
<br />
I had a friend go with me to distract guards. If the guards catch ya they boot ya out of the city!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hurst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">first few steps are for the weakened ghouldbane<br />
<br />
<br />
Now to get the final sword!!! <br />
<br />
*Head to Crypt of Betraya. The mob you need is the &quot;Spectre of Ire&quot;. It will spawn in any of the ire minion alcoves. A tracker to help you would be nifty for this part. A 27th level or 28th level group should have no problem with him. <br />
<br />
*Head to Ruins of Varsoon and fight to the Golem Creation Room. You should be in a room with skeletons and Golems. There should be a mold here that you can click to get a quest. If there isn't, you are not in the right room. The mob is called &quot;The Creator&quot;. Keep clearing the room until he pops. He spawns in the middle group of skeletons. <br />
<br />
*Head to Cauldron Hollow and bring friends. I have not done this part yet, but Throgg of the Innothule Server posted a bit about it. In his own words: &quot; I've never been to Cauldron Hollow, so this is heresay, but heregoes! You need to get a raid together.. a rather large raid... I'm told 4 full groups of lvl 32+ is REQUIRED. so pack a lunch and bring friends for this one. Not sure what his name is, but he's the last boss of that zone. &quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
Final Reward: Ghoulbane: Primary Slot, One-Handed, Skill 160-200, Damage 11-34, Delay 1, Health +28, Wisdom +5, Power +28, Strength +9, LORE, NO TRADE.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wow... delay of 1?  That's really excellent for a 1h, isn't it?<br />
<br />
Will have to look more into this! :)<br />
<br />
Thanks for the info, Hurst! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>CursedBlue</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've gotten the weakened ghoulbane, I am a Freeport Dark Elf Shadowknight. It is VERY risky to get the dusty blue stone off black market since i've heard you can examine the stone only once to get the quest and it would be quite frustrating if you were to purchase something and find out that it is useless and already used wasting your precious gold.<br />
<br />
    When you go through the city it is much prefered to go through the peats bog entrance which is located in the moat of Qeynos city. It is near the lighthouse where the bells are... The entrance to Peat's bog on the qeynos city wall within a stone tunnel. Its not too hard to swim there but its been awhile and I cant remember exact location... I believe you head west on map before crossing bridge to lighthouse, go straight underwater and you should see it...Preferably with underwater breathing. You must work your way through the qeynos sewer system and into the city itself going through<br />
<br />
Peats Bog -&gt; Vermin's Syne -&gt; Down Below <br />
You must work your way into a Graystone Yard mining tunnel where Gruffin Goldtooth can examine.<br />
<br />
You must do this because the guards within qeynos will boot you somewhere in Antonica with one hit *This happens regardless of their lvl and no you are not harmed in any way just booted with a long run back, pissed off and having to do it again =P *The citizens within the town dont do anything but will say interesting things to you. <br />
<br />
    As for restoring the ghoulbane, I havent gotten too far on that yet I do have the knowledge i've read here and there so I will complete this asap and see what I come up with...btw those stats listed below are the base weapon dmg which is a piece of crap. The weakened ghoulbane hits 45-70 (could be wrong i'm up till 7:24 Am) or something...Dont remember atm but at lvl 32 a feysteel morning star is what I use. It may be similar in stats and I prefer ghoulbane but the lvl requirements higher so its pretty crappy for me. I'm thinking soon enough I can solo the lich myself, and i'll have an easy/ier time tanking the creator... Nek Castle? hmm...nobody seems to really know about it...yet  :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>CursedBlue</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Okay guys killed the spectre of Ire and Creator today. So heres my info on them, enjoy  ;) <br />
<br />
Spectre of Ire<br />
Level 27 ^^ necromancer with pet comes with 3 or 4 guards all warlocks no arrows <br />
<br />
I had trouble with this fight at lvl 32 solo. I could take hits and avoid them when it comes to 5 casters on me nuking/dotting me Its no good. I brought my lvl 30 necromancer friend we took them down, was a lil tough still. Make sure u have good aggro of course, luckily nobody died :)<br />
<br />
The Creator<br />
Level 33 ^^ ( Yellow to Lvl 32 ) comes with 4 enchanter bodyguards same con no arrows.<br />
<br />
I had happend to find a group hunting in creators room and asked if I could join when he pops I said later guys message me! Thats when he popped but it was a subpar group of 27-28s. Group consisted of Troubador, Templar, Paladin, Sk, and a monk...oh yeah berserker...Okay very crappy group. but I enlisted help from a 32 Templar so that was good healing power right there. <br />
<br />
    I pulled out to hallway killed the creator and his enchanters saying I would recieve credit after the fight...yet after I killed them all the encounter did not end. It appears creator has some bug you have to fight through. Perhaps I pulled too far etc, but usually they depop and respawn at origin with 100% health. This time he was gone...Our weapons were drawn no enemies yet were present. I know u can get credit through raids because I  tested it on a golem outside so it was fubared... <br />
<br />
     Well the fight was real tough since our dps was totalally *hit. I had to fd the berserker of course he got aggro. We ended up with healers oom but not quite bout a 1 1/2 bubbles of power total with both combined. Although very disapointed my petition to a gm was answered fairly quick and was reassured that I would get the credit ...soon whenever that is. Good luck guys perhaps someone can post how to kill creator actually getting the credit...I guess Cauldrons left ...right? lol</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
for the Graystone part its easier to use the bell on the dock - Oakmyst - Graystone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>CursedBlue</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ahh I used the same path as well actually, I've a hard time remembering its been over a week :P<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Bulvyne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">for the Graystone part its easier to use the bell on the dock - Oakmyst - Graystone.<br />
<br />
Sadandroid, that sounds like a good route...<br />
<br />
Just curious, do you still need another Freeport friend to come along to &quot;distract&quot; the guards, or if you take the bell, can you avoid guards without someone along to draw the guards away?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Bulvyne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Since the Ghoulbane quest is &quot;doable&quot;, and Ghoulbane itself is useable by Freeport folks, I wouldn't &quot;assume&quot; that there's an equivalent on the Freeport side.  :(<br />
<br />
I think a Dark Reaver quest would be SWEET (and very nostalgic), but I am not gonna hold my breath. :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Graystone part is easy and you don't need a friend to distract the guards. The NPC is very near to the Oakmyst gate and no guard around.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Worked like a charm! :)<br />
<br />
From the Griffon tower at the Qeynos gates, head south to the Mariner.<br />
<br />
Ring bell and get a ride to Oakmyst.<br />
<br />
From Oakmyst dock, SE to the Graystone zone.<br />
<br />
Zone in and talk to Gruffin, laughing hysterically at the guard's back a few yards away! :)<br />
<br />
This saved me from having to drag a friend all the way to Graystone. Thanks a TON for this info, Sadandroid! :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, the newest issue is Lord Androus, the last mob I need for the ToV gate access. :(<br />
<br />
On Najena, his spawn was broken Saturday morning. Apparently, someone had aggro'd him/fought him, Yelled to break the enounter, and beat feet to the zoneline. Lord Andy followed and somehow got &quot;stuck&quot; in terrain... and he stayed like that ALL WEEKEND. :(<br />
<br />
Friends confirmed that early in the day on Saturday, they were in a different instance of Stormhold and that he popped and was killed several times like normal. However, as of Sunday night, Lord Androus had not been seen in instance 1 since Saturday morning. <br />
<br />
ARGH. :(<br />
<br />
Oh well, will keep trying! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Astaroth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The Graystone part is easy and you don't need a friend to distract the guards. The NPC is very near to the Oakmyst gate and no guard around.<br />
<br />
Indeed, I did this whole quest solo at 30 except for the ToV part I had to find 2 ppl to enter with me.  Both the nameds for ToV were up when I went looking for them, guess I'm a lucky bastard.  The second part of this quest becomes retarded and probably unfinishable until 35-38.  (But that is just my guess)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Bulvyne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I finished the Weakened GB last night (thanks to the help from you folks here and over at the EQ forums).  What a rush! :)<br />
<br />
I made it to Stormhold right after work, and a solo Brawler was battling Lord Androus. Dang. :(  But, after he killed the lord, the two buddies the Lord came with finished off the brawler. Lord Androus RE-POPPED in his spot along with his 2 buddies. No one else around... SHAZAAM. Dead Lord Androus. ;)<br />
<br />
Paid a couple folks to go into ToV with me so I could get the sword, and ran to Qeynos to finish it. Woohoo!<br />
<br />
Then I figured &quot;Well, I need the Spectre of Ire here under Qeynos&quot; so I went downstairs and started looking for him.<br />
<br />
Lo and behold, a pair of mobs I had never seen before sprung upon me. &quot;Hired Assassins&quot; at 38th level (double-up arrows)! Needless to say, I fled to the entrance and ALMOST made it... but perished. <br />
<br />
Angry, I returned, stubborn and anxious to find the Specter.<br />
<br />
I retrieved my shard and looked... not up. :(  Thankfully, though, there were 3 instances of CoB up, so I went into the 2nd. Sure enough, he was up! Woohoo!<br />
<br />
I engaged, and man, for a 25th double-up level mob, he gave me FITS. I FINALLY killed him and his two buddies... but that left two other buddies somewhere that I couldn't see... yay, more mobs stuck in walls. So I had to break the encounter, and try again. By this time, there was a group nearby of 5 people, and I thought it would be a LOT faster if I asked the group to help me. They were hesitant at first, but flashing some gold their way convinced them to help. We quickly and efficiently took them down. <br />
<br />
1 down, 2 to go! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Bulvyne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">P.S.  Weakened GB's Delay is 1.7,  not 1. :(</div></div><hr />

 :( <br />
<br />
The REAL kicker is going to be getting 12 people to go to CH... Ugh.  Do you (or anyone) know if every person has to have their own key for that instance?<br />
<br />
The Creator shouldn't be too difficult. I really like RoV as a dungeon. :)</div></div><hr />

Each person needs a key for CH.  Need about 2-3 solid grps of 35+.  But that isnt the kicker yet.  Wait til you finish those ... first... three tasks =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>CursedBlue</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Okay I got the creator and lich time for vampire! apparently I missed a successful vampire raid by 2 min I kept asking the leaders who said they will get me and they zoned in, damn i'd have the ghoulbane in my hand...it will be mine!!! &gt;)<br />
<br />
btw: I fought the creator's enchanter guards first... I believe that quite a few of us will be brandishing the ghoulbane with the power of ghoulbane proc...awesome!!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Bulvyne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Finished my GB up last Friday, and have a few quickie comments.<br />
<br />
First, I am somewhat disappointed in the stats on the sword, to be honest. I don't consider myself a powergamer, but the sword is only marginally better than a feysteel flamberge (in my opinion), yet requires enormous effort to acquire. The flamberge (and other similar weapons) are useable at a lower level, and are far easier to get (lucky on a lotto, or 1g at a broker). I am still happy I got it, and I don't mean to sound like a complainer. The guildstatus points were appreciated, of course. ;)<br />
<br />
The final portion - going into Nek Castle and defeating Lord Everling - was enormous fun in a high 30's party - and not even a full one at that. We had a 41 Shaman, 39 Druid, 37 Roge, and 38 SK, and it was a romp. Most of the mobs in the castle were grey to us, but the end fight was pretty fun, being a decent challenge. Just a few short weeks ago my full group of friends trudged slowly and carefully through the castle in about 4 hours. Friday night, we were down to Everling in under 2. It was still great fun though! :)<br />
<br />
If there was one part I wish they'd change, it's the tiny portion where you have to go into the Tomb of Valor. This part is so hard - but so easy. You have to do the access quest for ToV (a pain in the arse), and then once you get access, find 2-5 more people to enter with you. Once you enter, it takes 10 seconds to grab the sword... and you're done.  :mad:   You leave ToV and never have to go back. I wish they'd remove this part totally, or make the interaction with ToV meaninful in some way. :/<br />
<br />
Anyway, thanks again to everyone for taking their time to post on this thread, and others, to help those of us seeking this fabled blade! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>CursedBlue</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Main part of Tov is to kill lord chesgard. Nektropos has tons of quest loot that you cant even use till 40+ on some. The library particularly gives at least 10 quests all having decent to very good items. I'd prefer ghoulbane over any weapon atm. It imo is far better than the feysteel flameberg. Also the proc does about 16 dmg per hit on an undead mob, and the weapon is a quick 1.7 . Although you wont get near an assassin's dps the stats are not so bad either :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Witchfinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">First, I am somewhat disappointed in the stats on the sword, to be honest.

That's the point - if you're questing for the &quot;stuff&quot; or for the exp, then you're doing it for the wrong reason.  The journey is as important as the destination.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Bulvyne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">That's the point - if you're questing for the &quot;stuff&quot; or for the exp, then you're doing it for the wrong reason.  The journey is as important as the destination.<br />
<br />
Well, in YOUR opinion those might be the inadequate reasons. ;) But you also should weigh that against the ends justifying the means. You know, Sony's &quot;Risk/Effort Vs. Reward&quot;. <br />
<br />
The journey IS important... and there are parts of the GB quest that are enormous fun... but there are parts that are silly and just plain bad design on Sony's part. For example, what's the point of forcing a group of 3 people to enter ToV for 30 seconds? By the time a lot of folks do this step, the mobs in ToV are grey anyway.<br />
<br />
A time-sink for the sake of having a time-sink doesn't really make &quot;The Journey&quot; that enjoyable, and having a mediocre reward at the end just deepens the disappointment, in my eyes. Of course, you don't know it until AFTER you've invested the time to do it. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>CursedBlue</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">yeah its hard, my only problem with it were the friggin bugs that came with the encounters. I'm happy with it, got lots of guild status and the weapons still badass. I havent seen any one handed sword better than it, and with such low requirements</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Astaroth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I enjoy the graphic of the sword even though it looks like Sword of Thunder.  It is certainly better than Generic_Sword_01.<br />

I'm close to obtaining the weakened Ghoulbane (probably have it this weekend).  Does anyone have a screenshot of the weakened version?<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any tips for getting between the Down Below, and the Temple of Life and Mage Tower?  Both look like they're going to be long runs from the maps I looked at, and I can't see how I'm going to avoid all those guards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Witchfinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I managed to obtain Weakened Ghoulbane last night.  The first part of this quest can be done entirely solo if you're the right level.  From this, I'll let you infer a certain inaccuracy in the initial quest guide for yourself.<br />
<br />
The Weakened weapon appears to be an acceptable sword in it's own right, although by level 33, I hope to have obtained better.<br />
<br />
Getting through Qeynos was easy.  Travelling 'round North and South Qeynos is not difficult for an evil character, as there are plenty of ways to avoid the guard patrols.<br />
<br />
Now comes the hard part!</div></div><hr />
