<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Silku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I posted this on my guild website, for feedback from them, I'd also like to hear feedback from each of you.  Trying to put together an AA guide for our new members, also could be used as a future list for AA requirements on applicants.<br />
<br />
Let me know what ya think, disagree/agree etc  :cool: <br />
<br />
<br />
The following post is meant to spark a discussion about the way in which each of us believe to be the most important path for a Shadowknight who joins/may join our guild in the future.  It also may have some bearing in choosing which character knows his class and which does not.  I look forward to hearing your thoughts and discussions on the following, and how you feel that your character is being developed.  It may also lead you to believe that another AA is more important.  However, as any work in progress, it is my own personal opinion, and as such may differ from yours.  If it does, please post here, so that others may read both of them and choose for themselves which is the way they wish to go with.<br />
<br />
During the past few months, I have been developing my character follinwg a certain path so to speak.  So I've been trying to compile as much data as possible about AAs and which ones would be more pertinent to me, being the type of player that I am.   During this time I have come to surmise that there are indeed, several different ways to play a Shadowknight.  I've tried to break these down into four distinct paths.  Some of which cross over, but over all I beleive that every AA, barring those like charimsa increases etc, have a place under one of the following paths.<br />
<br />
1. The Tank<br />
2. The Puller<br />
3. The Dpser<br />
4. The Raider<br />
<br />
So to continue I'd like to provide a brief description of the particular path, along with Alternate Advancement choices that I feel are necessary to follow that particular path.<br />
<br />
I.  The Tank<br />
<br />
The tank is a shadowknight who specializes in taking and absorbing damage.  His line of work involves increasing his aggro, and decreasing the amount of damage that he receives.  His concern should not be with DPS in anyway, except to increase his aggro.  His primary concern will be avoidance and mitigation.  His equipment choices will revolve around, hit points and armor class, rather than mana and spell casting effects.   <br />
<br />

Raises your regeneration ability by 1 point per ability level<br />
Cost: 3, 6<br />
<br />
The purpose of many of these are self evident.  The purpose of innate stamina is to provide two different benefits.  First it will help those of us with sub par stamina, reach the 305 buffed mark more readily.  Secondly, once someone reaches the current max stamina, they may then click off Talisman of the Boar, in order to provide another buff slot for Blessing of Vie, Rune etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
2. The Puller<br />
<br />
A puller is someone who brings mobs into camp, preferably one at a time or in manageable groups for the enchanter.  In order to pull successfully one must learn the paths of roamers, spawn points of all static and dynamic mobs, and study aggro ranges/assisting ranges.   One must memorize what mobs are casters, and what mobs have an innate ability to run faster than Spirit of the Wolf.  Shadowknights are often overlooked for this ability, but in my opinion, excell here.<br />

4. The Raider<br />
<br />
The raiding Shadowknight, likely follows one of the other paths as well but his primary purpose to make sure he is not a liability at raids.  He will concentrate on resists, hit points, and regeneration in order to alleviate the necessity to heal him during AE fights.  I also feel that the ~10k harm touch skill fits into this role nicely, though it's a DPS type ability, it's something that any raiding shadowknight should want.  The less time the mob is alive, the less need to be healing/fighting something.<br />

There are many other paths that can be taken.  I personally began the path of a tank, and then began to filter in DPS.  Finally, after 150ish aa I began the path of a puller.  I intend to finish that path, since it is what I enjoy the most.  There are several AA that I have not included in any path.  Some because I did not belive the pre-requisits were worth the extra AA to achieve for a primary goal.  If it is a secondary goal, then they may be worth obtaining.  <br />
<br />
There are several AA that could very well go under any of these paths, but were not placed there for various reasons.  For instance, <br />
<br />
Weapon Affinity:<br />
Requires Level 55, 6 points in General Abilities<br />
Enhances the performance of your weapons by increasing the rate that they trigger effects by an estimated 10% per rank<br />
Does not increase buff procs<br />
Cost: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10<br />
<br />
could easily be placed under section one, but I omited it. Though this will indeed increase the aggro of a Shadowknight following the path of the Tank, it is not necessarily worth the ~30 aa that are required to achieve it.  Shadowknights are able to build aggro without the procs of weapons, and therefore I only placed it under the path of a DPSer since it is necessary to increase his dps to a higher rank.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, I think that there are many ways to play every class.  I hope that everyone has found what they enjoy about the Shadowknight, and continues to follow that path.  I look foward to your input.<br />

Putting the aa's into groups like that really helps define what each one is for a lot more than reading the big aa list.<br />
<br />

take out all the regen aa's past the general level, and the sta aa's. I know not everyone hits the sta cap when they are at this level of aa's, but as long as they hit their cap w/boar they have much better things to spend their aa's on.. <br />
Add:<br />
Spell Casting Fury 3<br />
Soul Abrasion 3<br />
Since you chose to include ToL, these 2 should also be included for the same reason(increased effectiveness of lifetaps/lifetap procs)<br />
<br />
Weapon Affinity 5 - increased agro from proc's<br />
Spell Casting Expertise 1 - no fizzling fear/cd<br />
Channeling Focus 3 - great buy<br />
Only one part of tanking is mitigating/avoiding the hits, another important part is making sure you are the one taking the hits, the 3 sets above help ensure that is the case.<br />
