<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Fuck all warriors who try to use the &quot;original game developers didn't envision knights having such snap aggro abilities&quot; card to try and justify their getting significant upgrades and us getting none...  I keep seeing it over and over, mostly on the SoE boards, and it's just such complete bullshit - even moreso than most similar warrior comments.<br />
<br />
So what if it wasn't originally part of the intended class balance - neither was FD pulling or weaponshield tanking or CH rotations or AE taunt being THE tool for tank rotations etc.  The game develops and the players determine class roles almost as much as the devs do.  The fact that we have spells specifically designed for aggro generation should be evidence enough that our aggro was a valid part of class balance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lunaticfringesk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The problem that you are dealing with is that many of those WAR assholes want tanking DOMINANCE.  They could care less about class balance.<br />
<br />
I agree--fuck them.  <br />
<br />
Let me state that one more time in case there was any ambiguity in my first comment--FUCK THEM.<br />
<br />
There was this short period of time during PoP where, in XP groups only, they had an issue with agro and they had serious competition for groups based on that.  They cried like the world had come to an end, despite the fact that their woes didn't equal 1/2 of SHD woes previous to PoP days, and got upgrades that made them absolutely one of the best classes to play at this time.  I'm so sick of these worthless cocksuckers. <br />
<br />
On a mildly unrelated note, I have yet to find anyone, including many other WAR (particularily my guild), come up with ANY, a SINGLE reason, why WAR DPS should be as high as it is.  I find that EXTREMELY INTERESTING.<br />
<br />
WAR are so broken at the moment, it's laughable that you still see complaints on TSW.  Many are so god-damn ignorant, it's not even funny.<br />

<br />
What their upgrade did was continue to allow skill-less feks to function in content that should require some skill and game knowledge.  <br />
<br />
There are a few decent ones (at least I've known a few).  But, the majority are just lazy feks.  Right up there with monks, with them thinking that the world revolves around them.  SoE went and made it so in a way, they're almost right.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But what happens is since warriors are so narrow and can't do jack else effectively besides tank in groups and raids, the devs have to bend over backwards to create a need for them.  Same goes for clerics.  And rogues too for that matter.  So the devs wind up overbalancing the specialists and in the process they alienate funner, more popular classes who share their role.<br />
<br />
Anytime a class thinks they deserve to be #1 at something and really be about nothing else than that one skill, with zero competition, it just winds up being a burr in the ass of all the other classes and the devs who try to balance them.</div></div><hr />

This arguement is false.  They get many, many, utilities through clicky armor effects.  Invis, skelly form, shrink, speed, hell, even levitate if they want.  Where we get additional abilities through spells, they get additional weapon damage.  TANKING HAS NO PLACE IN THIS EQUATION.  It should match.<br />

Um, I don't know about you, but a good number of my spells have 1/6/10 minute timers....Harmshield, Voice line (if it's working today), spears, hell there's multi second delays in the tap lines.<br />
<br />
<br />
We do have an advantage in utility. I can duo with my Shm friend anywhere were as my warrior friend cant (due to adds or with a silly ensnaring whip not proc'ing). <br />
<br />
<br />
Warriors have an advantage in melee damage.  Where, to increase our dps, we have to increase both spell AND melee AA's, a warrior can merely work on their melee aa's and get a decent dps upgrade.  <br />
<br />
Duoing is ALWAYS terrain dependent.  There's someplace where HE can duo with yer shaman that YOU can't because HE can take the hits before the shaman gets the slow off.  Hell, he can duo with a druid and do just fine in places where you as an sk would get splattered.<br />
<br />
<br />
We have that advantage we solo and farm better also... in turn we dont tank as efficiently, and basically cant tank 'some' Raid mobs. No biggie and certainly no real reason to go on crying about it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Solo?  SOLO? hahahahahahahhahahahahahahaa<br />
Welcome to last year.  Soloing kind of bit the dust after fear stopped working on the mobs.  <br />
<br />
And while having special olympics style &quot;special&quot; spawned zones in GOD might work for you, it's pretty much complete BS so far as I'm concerned.  It's not that we can't tank SOME raids, it's that poorly equiped, low aa warriors can do content that time equiped max aa sks still have trouble with.<br />
<br />
Look, I'm an sk.  If I can't outtank a warrior using my physical skill, WHERE THE HELL IS MY SPELLSET that lets me do it temporarily?  And diamondskin don't cut it.  Maybe if it was .5 second cast with no reagent? and refilled when a tap overshot my hp?  How about a tap that creates a rune?  Where's my proc immunity/reflection?  Where's my spell reflection? How come my damage shield is so low?  Where's my &quot;reduce the damage by x% per hit?&quot;  Where's my &quot;sacrifice my groupmates health to increase my own&quot;?  Where's my &quot;oops, you just killed my pet instead of me&quot; self only DI version.  Hell, where are the 10 charge defensive potions usable by warriors, paladins, and shadowknights?<br />
<br />
Three things have screwed the game since day one, Complete heal, 75% slow, and defensive.  Why? because where EVERY OTHER EFFECT IN EQ is incremental few percent increases in power, which you have to add all together to get something, each of those abilities are HUGE LEAPS in DEFENSIVE POWER.  Which forces soe to make content that REQUIRES IT'S USE.  Which makes those classes that don't have those ability ASSED OUT OF GROUPS.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>sorguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Hi, I am a warrior.  <br />
<br />
If you didn't read any further than that, well you won't be reading this, so nevermind! :-D)<br />
<br />
First off, I do think that something needs to be done to make paladins and SK's viable tanks in GoD, I've been toying around there and I can't imagine any SK or pally without full time gear being able to do half the stuff.<br />
<br />
With that being said, I've seen alot of the same sentiment &quot;fuck warriors!&quot;<br />
<br />
You know who you sound like?<br />
<br />
Warriors before incite.<br />
<br />
The cries of fuck paladins and fuck SK's was heard rining from every mountain, high ridge, and um... tiny little hills...<br />
<br />
Why?  Because during PoP, we were useless for all but the first 3 or so times you killed a boss mob.  SK's and Paladins had the true hold on tanking.<br />
<br />
I've been told straight to my face, more than once, in fact MANY times that I suck compared to paladins and SK's.<br />
<br />
Not good times, to be honest.<br />
<br />
But now there is a problem, after the changes, warriors have respectable aggro, which, because of our hitpoints, and the 5% increase in tanking ability is leaving knights at a not as desirable place in PoP or every day EXP groups, but to be honest, the despairity between classes at current in every day group settings such as BoT, or LDoN, is little, and imo, pretty balanced (you can debate this or not, its an opinion, not solid fact, I'm the first to admit that I can be, and have been wrong, many many many times)<br />
<br />
Where the problem in my eyes is in the new high end content.  It is damn near impossible for many many many knights to tank half of what is presented in GoD.<br />
<br />
I don't even begin to know what to do about GoD and tankability, if you decrease it for knights you allow for easier passing of a group that is better suited to quick passing, and again you remove warrior's only job, tanking the damn near impossible, if you give knights defensive, well, that's just as game imbalancing.<br />
Knight with defensive is able to hold aggro better than a warrior with increased survivability(when compared to the current lack of defensive survivability of knights), whoops, that infringes on warrior territory.<br />
<br />
I think that right now SoE has painted intself into a corner, how do you fix knights, and yes right now you guys DO need fixing, and that is obvious, and believe me I'm not the only person who sees that on this side of the fence.<br />
<br />
What I personally don't want is for VI to just solve this by giving you 1000 more hp, or more defensive capability, that would kill the warrior class in every day xp groups, and high end trial atmospheres.<br />
<br />
I would personally think something that could work would be proc based surviveability.   Wierd idea, but with WA5, who knows.<br />
<br />
Think about this, you get a rune5 type spell proc you can add to your weapon, maybe not quite rune 5's 1500 hp, but then who knows.<br />
It counters warriors proc based aggro dependancy, and it would relieve alot of (at least imo, which again, has been proved to be wrong) alot of current knight problems.<br />
<br />
[Edit: I contradict myself by saying I don't know what to do and then presenting a suggestion, but I really wanted to get my point across, and I wanted to leave the integrity alone, so please don't mind the contradiction heh]</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">It's not scalable so it sucks, and giving knights the disc's I proposed would have minimal effect on XP grinding, so no, you wouldn't become obsolete in XP groups.

Yeah, except for that can fade in 1 hit, and your aggro procs don't. Getting one-rounded + 1500ish hp IF you are lucky wouldn't help the problem. If so, then every Chanter would have thought of that already.</div></div><hr />

Your right it would have minimal effect on xp grinding,  not gonna debate it.<br />

Warrior aggro is automatic, but random (excluding incite, 400 hate, half of what is needed to cover a slow most of the time)<br />

I didn't come to the SK board to throw out a million opinions on how to fix the class(because I honesty, having never played the class as a primary charachter have very little idea about what would fix it),  I came to show you guys, that not every warrior wants to completely remove knights from tanking, and wants to just relagate you to getting a group whenever we need something, or have an extra slot.  <br />
<br />
Some of us (I'd be willing to say a good 50%) would actually like SoE to wkae the hell up and figgure something out, apart from the assenine fix of dumbing down content.</div></div><hr />

While I appreciate the candor of your message, many of the comments made are simply *very* dubious, if not outright incorrect.<br />
<br />
During the time period discussed above, XP groups are pretty much the only place that SHD/PAL held an edge.  Raid roles still were dominated by WAR.  I know not why raid dominance is so often ignored by so many WAR, but it is.<br />

<br />
<br />
The WAR job is tanking, the *same* as a SHD/PAL.  A WAR should be able to take the greatest beating of all other, but, in no way shape or form, should they be the *ONLY* class possible of tanking any particular mob.  That misconception has been handed down from WAR, INCORRECTLY, for quite some time.<br />

An appropritely scaled version of /defensive is absolutely, positively, NOT game imbalancing.  Only WAR who want class and tanking dominance see it that way.<br />

Increased survivability?  Hardly.  <br />
<br />
As previously mentioned, a WAR should (&amp; presently are) able to take the best beating in the game (i.e. should be the best melee defensive class in the game)--that is IT.  Nothing more.  A SHD/PAL should be behind them from a *beating* perspective, but should be (a) a reasonable distance behind them, which is to essentialy mean, not a huge difference and (b) should have an advantage somewhere else to make up for that shortcoming (be it healing spells, increased DPS, etc.).<br />

An appropriately scaled version of /defensive for SHD/PAL would, in no way, shape or form, kill the WAR class.  This concept needs to be god-damn destroyed, ESPECIALLY in XP groups.  My god---XP groups do NOT rely on /defensive for Christ's sake...<br />

It counters warriors proc based aggro dependancy, and it would relieve alot of (at least imo, which again, has been proved to be wrong) alot of current knight problems. <br />
<br />
Slein is 100% correct--procs would be an utterly foolish way to even attempt to resolve it, as it would quickly die as the content changed/got harder.  /Defensive is pretty much the only solution--however, it *needs* to be appropriately scaled so that a WAR is still the best doing it, but SHD/PAL should still be *VERY GOOD* at it--it's that simple.<br />
<br />
Once again though, since we are talking class balance, why doesn't anyone mention how out of whack WAR DPS is?  WAR do FAR too much DPS for how defensive their class is supposed to be.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>sorguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">What I meant by giving more defensive ability was adding a percentage modifier like the currenti nnate one on warriors, not the disc....  <br />
<br />
(heh, that's why brael said that defensive woulden't kill wars in xp groups...)<br />
<br />
Not my intended meaning, apologies.<br />
<br />
Can you show me a list of DPS per class,  I have trouble finding stuff like that.<br />
<br />
And as for the first part you quoted, to be honest, I was setting up tanking for the guild I was in (no heroes, bertox server - you can prolly find traces of them, but the guild itself broke up a few weeks back, small guild and a few key people left - it was a 2 guild guild alliance though, and the other half still lives - iksarian broods *shrug*)  They were just doing breaking into elemental type things, Magmaton, they had gotten all the avatars down, few Earth, anyways....<br />
Setting up the tanking, I was at the cusp of putting knights to tanking yard trash and smaller named to allow for killing mobs faster by not having to allow for warrior opening build aggro time. <br />
<br />
Also the fact that I knew most of the SK's could pull, and had comprable hp/ac and AA levels to many of the warriors in the guild.<br />
<br />
Given another 2 months, and a few more 9k+ buffed knights, I can promise you I would have had them on tanking slots as SA, just for the sheer fact that the overnukers killed themselves, lowering our DPS, and we actually had an abundance of clerics, so defensive wasn't needed on many of the mobs we did, especially some of the avatars.<br />
<br />
Now, admitedly, we would always use warriors for magmaton and mobs of his ilk with high high DPS output, needing defensive tactics instead of increased healing.<br />
<br />
That is just where my opinion on the uselessness of warriors past the first few kills come in,  sorry, sometimes I forget my experiences can be the minority.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Warrs have a significant mitigation edge before you throw in the innate DI mod.<br />
<br />
Warriors were hurting with aggro before, most definitely.  Fixing warriors didn't require better aggro than knights, 500 additional hp, and an improvement to mitigation, however.<br />
<br />
Prior to GoD, knights had the best aggro of any tank in the game.  That's what made us desirable tanks in many circumstances.  Warriors had defensive, and could take the best beating in the game.<br />
<br />
What would a warrior feel like if tomorrow knights were given a 60% mitigation disc?  You'd feel like you just got screwed out of your primary raid role, that is, tanking boss mobs, and rightfully so.<br />
<br />
When warrior aggro was improved to knight-like levels... many of us feel the same way.  Our biggest advantage, and primary raid role, has been nullified.<br />
<br />
Balance in exp groups isn't perfect, but it's close enough to call it even.  I can tank BoT or elemental exp zones just fine.  A warrior can do it a bit better, but doesn't have Zevfeer's and Aura of hate.  Ok, whatever, call it a wash.<br />
<br />
Knights really don't have much of a raid role now however.  Yeah I offtank some, but that's mostly because we're 1)  short on warriors and 2) I'm better geared than most warriors in the guild. and 3)  some of the warrs have a nasty habit of going afk till it's time to tank the boss.  And this is elementals... I'm told in GoD there really isn't a spot for knights to even add tank in the higher level zones.</div></div><hr />

We must have been playing a different game.  In my guild prior to the warrior balances no knight was tanking bosses, except CT in time.

The problem is the 5% mitigation happened at all levels and most people want to be uber and play uber.

Who the hell wants a knight in thier group now?<br />

So... if only warriors can tank, what do knights do?  I have yet to hear an answer to that outside of &quot;you have a spell book! utility!&quot;<br />

I'm going to ignore the fact that your supposition (knights have better aggro and can survive better with full blown defensive) is wrong for now.</div></div><hr />

Playing a warrior, however, is not fun at all from levels 1 - 100.  Warrior and cleric are the two classes that I could never understand anyone playing.  Who cares how desirable they are if they are painfully boring and dull to play?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>sorguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">I did notice that kind reception I got from the people here, especially since the people in his particular thread, from what I've seen of a few, really dislike most people of my class.  The majority who took the time to read what I said, either gave me an informed response, or told me where I was mistaken, both things I really wanted.<br />
<br />
Now, I want to at least show that I myself wanna just learn, and express an opinion,  I know for a fact that I am wrong in some if not most of what I say, but I really want to learn where I'm wrong in my thoughts, so I can change it.<br />
<br />
So, I wanna say, thanks to those who responded with corrections / showing me what I asked.<br />
<br />
In addition, the warrior class is the only class I enjoy playing, and believe me, I've played many different classes - druid, BL, necro, paladin, bard, enchanter pretty much everything, cept for SK (at the midgame - high end that is, go go test buff for the low end spectrum of it haha)<br />
<br />
Its fun to me to do my job, even if it is with fewer tricks up my sleeve, and to be quite honest, I love when I get compliments over how much better my defensive capabilities (not the disc) are than anyone, which does include knights. <br />
<br />
I think my class is the only thing that has kept me playing for 3 + years, seeing new changes, and adjusting.  <br />
<br />
So, don't write off the warrior class as completely boring, unless you have actually played it firsthand, you would be surprised how much fun it actually is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Warrior resentment  stems from how they handled thier balancing issues (and yes the majority of the sk community agreed something needed to be done- though probably not nearly as much as warriors though needed to be done) including the outrage at a knight tanking Quarm.  Hell there were rumours that a chanter tanked it once just to show it could be done.<br />
<br />
It also stems from fact warriors are too often quoted stating that Knights should not be mt's and many sk's like tanking.<br />
<br />
Warriors also don't have a period as bad as Kunark to point to that they had giant awful struggles.  When the class exp penalty  affected your whole group and you weren't really powerful enough to be needed and there wasn't a role for your class.  The agro masters was not a dev intention (&quot;a level 9 spell should not be used at higher levels&quot;) it was a  bunch of very clever SK's using what they saw their spells doing and making a role for that.  The warrior role is and always has been cut and dry, SK's had to work for it and have seen it repeatedly taken away.  Its the classic eample of the Rich kid (warriors) and the self-made-man (KS's) not seeing eye to eye.<br />
<br />
Lastly, there are many warriors who don't do anything other than hit auto attack and mash taunt.  Try anything that stupid with an sk and you get you and your entire party killed, a warrior can get away with it.  So there is an elitism here.<br />
<br />
But hell we like it that way.</div></div><hr />

I personally hate Warriors (in general, not specifically) that keep coming back for more enhancements!  They couldn't possibly need any more at this point.  The gap is just way too big already.<br />
<br />
We do not care about main tanking raid mobs.  We care about being able to off-tank trash raid mobs.  We care about tanking one group content.<br />
<br />
We care about the gigantic gap that now exists between the chosen tank class and the other two tanking classes.<br />
<br />
We are touchy right now because, every time we bring up the huge difference between Warriors and Knights (mostly focusing on GoD), Warriors go ape shit on us and say nothing is needed.  What is even worse is that SoE agrees with them!

It is if you want to maximize what you are doing.  We rely on spells for damage too, you know.  Mixing them in between swings takes just a bit more focus than turning on autoattack.</div></div><hr />

Mana.....dps.....both go down the shitter from chain casting...unlike taunt mashing.<br />

Any fool Dark mashing needs to get the dick out of his ass and learn to play.  Once you know hte group, you know hte interval to dark to maintain aggro....anyone who just mashes it just to be sure is a moron.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Both are pretty bad, but I don't really think of either classes as massive DPS(there is some desparity between the two, which is prolly bigger than I know, not debating that), so I'd say warriors have the greater of two evils in that one - getting other people killed goes against what we're supposed to do, any tank class heh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>suziwon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">So, Sorguran...you still haven't answered the question...<br />
<br />
So... if only warriors can tank, what do knights do? I have yet to hear an answer to that outside of &quot;you have a spell book! utility!&quot; <br />
<br />
Everytime someone answers anything to the effect of &quot;knights shouldn't be able to do that, it's a warrior thing&quot; the only thing that person does for every warrior in the game is breed more hate.  <br />
<br />
Your own words provide a good example:<br />
 I don't even begin to know what to do about GoD and tankability, if you decrease it for knights you allow for easier passing of a group that is better suited to quick passing, and again you remove warrior's only job, tanking the damn near impossible, if you give knights defensive, well, that's just as game imbalancing. <br />
<br />
<br />
In the end, the ultimate reason ends up being that we have a spellbook. Show me (and the rest of us) how different you truly are.  Take the spellbook out of the equation and answer the question. Show that you understand that when we cast a spell, we do not swing.  If the timing of that is off, or the cast time of the spell exceeds the delay of our weapon, THAT TAKES AWAY FROM OUR DPS...I challenge you to come up with a fair and equitable solution since you think that Slein's is so imbalacing.  Your solution will show what you think the knight role is/should be.  As it is, you don't appear to think it's tanking.<br />
<br />
And while you are at it, I'd also like to know if you think that it's fair that Warriors with fewer levels and AAs, as well as lesser gear can tank encounters *far* better. As it is, your own words do not do much to help you...<br />
<br />
Given another 2 months, and a few more 9k+ buffed knights, I can promise you I would have had them on tanking slots as SA, just for the sheer fact that the overnukers killed themselves, lowering our DPS, and we actually had an abundance of clerics, so defensive wasn't needed on many of the mobs we did, especially some of the avatars.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>frotty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">playing a warrior nowadays in GoD is damn near the feeling that playing a knight back before the warrior 10000x upgrades occured was in LDoN and certain &quot;tight quarters&quot; exp groups.<br />
<br />
Warriors, really for the first time, have an element of decisionmaking &amp; control with how they are using their spells and mana, errrr, combat abilities and endurance.<br />
<br />
The spellbook of a knight is such a smokescreen. All you have to do is look at what we're doing. We have to juggle spells, have a pet up and maintain that, spread ourselves out with a bunch of incremental AA upgrades to both melee and casting, just do be on par with what warriors do when they press autoattack.<br />
<br />
Ooh, ahh. So much more variety. <br />
Wait, no, not really: all I'm doing is DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>XVII</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">Let's get it in the open for warriors.<br />
<br />
We have 0 -real- utility (read: useful on a semi-regular basis in group or raid function) . We can't pull effectively anymore. Warrior snap aggro is 90-95% that of a knight's ability.<br />
<br />
Warriors completely trivialize an encounter that is tankable by knights if they use defensive. Warriors also deal a TON of damage atm (easily more than SKs).<br />
<br />
The problem here is defensive. Either it goes, or we get a scaled version, really. If they removed it, I could see a much greater semblance of balance of being capable.<br />
<br />
SoE really is not capable of walking a tightrope-thin line of mob difficulty in order to keep knights viable and warriors challenged. Once gear variations are brought in, this line dissappears.<br />
<br />
The probelm is defensive.</div></div><hr />

Far too many people miss that point entirely. If a knight can't handle tanking a mob, it doesn't matter if he or she can get aggro. It's like saying that an aggro increase is needed because an enchanter can steal aggro by chain tashing. Ridiculous.<br />
<br />
That said, I supported the warrior aggro boost. I just say that if a warrior can aggro as good or better than I can, I want to be able to tank a small margin less, instead of being out-tanked by rangers due to ws.<br />
<br />
Add in that (according to sources which I have not verified personally) warriors out-dps us at the high end, and we aren't really pullers anymore... and something needs to be done.<br />
<br />
Of course all of this has been said time and again, I just felt like reiterating.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Merf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">For the people who dont understand the root of the Warriors discontent, it really comes down to one thing:  Warriors are no fun to play except in a high end raid context and occasionally in a challenging group XP setting.<br />
<br />
I started playing EQ as a solo player the night of release and only in the last year, after a 2 year hiatus from EQ, did I finally find a good guild that was a fit and let me see the higher end game.<br />
<br />
My main is a Rogue, so on one level I completely understand the Warrior.  There are two melee classes in the game (prior to SoS and Escape) that just have no options to control the game around them.  Monks and SKs can FD, SKs and Rangers can snare, Rangers and Paladins can root, Paladins can stun and run, Beastlords can sic pet and run or pet mez and med.  Warriors and to a lesser extent Rogues, when caught alone, are just stuck with whatever develops and can just pray that it develops close to zoneline or theres a CR in the offing.<br />
<br />
At 63 the Rogue gets SoS and is no longer worried about See Invis leading to a CR.  Some time later we get Escape and at that point virtually all of our worries vanish and we can tool around and scout.  We can have fun.  Prior to SoS and Escape we can also scout and have fun with the occasional really annoying CR thrown in.<br />
<br />
I have played Rogue to 65 and Cleric and Shaman to late 50s.  Ive played an SK to 49.  I have a Ranger and 2 Beastlords in the late 30s.  I have a bunch of other classes played out to late 20s and early 30s including every robed class.  I played multiple Rogues, Shadow Knights, Shamans and Clerics out to late 20s before finally settling on the one Rogue I took to 65.<br />
<br />
My first character ever was a Warrior.  He lasted until 20, at which point I got fed up with being a completely dependent character who was useless without a group and absolutely no fun to play.  My response to this lack of fun was to make first an SK and then a Ranger, both of whom were still a lot of fun to play (the SK particularly) as they reached the low 30s. <br />
<br />
Last year after coming back I made a Warrior on test and used testbuff to get him to 25.  I was just curious whether Warriors were any more fun to play than theyd been when I logged off in late 2001.  They werent.  Warriors are still the biggest fun sink in the game.<br />
<br />
Now, as I rehabilitate my old alts the SK has gotten out to 49, and he is a ton of fun to play.  He mostly pulls and off tanks in groups and I expect that will be his job forever.  He will get to 65 someday soon and then his role may be reduced to just pulling.  That will still be fun.<br />
<br />
The Warrior?  He was deleted after 3 months, the only character Ive ever deleted.  Thats how little fun he was.<br />
<br />
So when you catch yourself talking about whining Warriors, and there are definitely some of those, remember that theyre not whining about not being the best melee in the game.  Theyre whining about not having any fun.  Even if they dont know it.</div></div><hr />

Personally, I agree that warriors are no fun to play, and I did the same thing you did ( got to 24 actually ). BUT, for the non-PL'd-in-a-day warriors, I call bullshit.

I agree that the wound is self-inflicted in many cases, however that doesn't make it any less of a wound.<br />
<br />
The smart thing for SoE to have done with Warriors would have been to up aggro to Knight level, up hp's a good 25% or so over any other class and get rid of /disc defensive.<br />
<br />
That would have made Warriors the prime tank without any chance of disqualifying Knights from tanking the higher end content.  The tradeoff between being a Warrior and a Knight would be about 1000hp's raw (assuming a decently equipped but unbuffed Warrior would be at 5000 hp's and a Knight at 4000) versus all of the spells and abilities that the Knights get.<br />
<br />
As the gear got better the difference would get smaller until you got a final of 11k hp's for Warriors and maybe 9.5k for Knights.<br />
<br />
Aggro ability would be identical in that scenario and the tradeoff again would be a little bit better survivability versus the spells.<br />
<br />
Giving SK's and Pally's /disc defensive now would just make them great tanks that are also a lot of fun to play.  I'm tired of Warrior sit-ins...</div></div><hr />

<br />
No!  The game was not indennded to have ONE tank class.<br />
<br />
The original concept may have been Part warrior and Part necro, but we should be tankes in our own right.  There is nothing that says Part tank part necro...do they know that their class is &quot;Warrior&quot; not &quot;Tank&quot;?<br />
<br />
(I know we've developed beyond that simple concept, just using it to show where they think they're coming from)  <br />
<br />
No, I don't think part tank is the issue.<br />
<br />
I think prime tank is the issue.<br />
<br />
You see the Warrior's vision of an SK as part Warrior and part Necro.<br />
<br />
The Warriors see your vision of an SK as all Warrior and part Necro.<br />
<br />
In truth the SK and Paladin were originally seen by Verant as 3/4 Warrior and 1/4 Necro and Cleric respectively.   I remember the original dev posts on what the hybrids were going to be and that was the vision.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately the game is tuned for Warriors to be the ultimate tank against high level content and 3/4 Warrior just does not cut it against the toughest mobs.<br />
<br />
So SoE is caught between lying to the Warriors (effectively) and tuning the SK and Paladin up to be more like 9/10 Warrior and 1/4 Necro and Cleric, or alternately leaving the SK's and Paladins as second class tanks.<br />
<br />
So far SoE has gone back and forth between bumping Warriors (at least 3 major improvements since EQ went live, 1 was the original mitigation boost in 2000, 2 was /disc defensive and 3 was the recently added other disciplines) and then helping SK's and Paladin's catch up by making them 9/10 Warrior again.<br />
<br />
That is what giving SK's and Paladin's defensive would do, yet again.  Setting off another inevitable Warrior boost.<br />
<br />
Obviously EQ II will handle all of this better by giving everybody a certain number of skill points as their cap and then letting them develop their characters as they see fit.  Don't like a skill you took 2 years ago at release?  Just get rid of it and start building another.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>DConquest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">Big problem is this... Paladin spells have branched off and they have their own unique &quot; nitch &quot; with stuns, AoE, BSS, fast heals.  These are NOT 49 ish Cleric spells.<br />
<br />
SKs mostly rely on lvl 49 ish Necro spells.  Cut the damn ambilical cord already.  Stop &quot; balancing &quot; our spells against casters almost 20 lvls lower than us  and give us new spells inline with we do, Tank and DPS.  Give us spells that actually hurt our mana bar, but their power calls for it.</div></div><hr />

Personally, I agree that warriors are no fun to play, and I did the same thing you did ( got to 24 actually ). BUT, for the non-PL'd-in-a-day warriors, I call bullshit. I mean, if they are no fun to play for them, wtf took 'em so long to catch on? You and I caught on in 20 some odd levels. If they *really* do feel that way, then fuck 'em...its what they get for being fucking stupid. So that leaves us with 2 options, when describing the warriors that are whining all the damned time; either they are fucking stupid, or they want to be the only damned tank...which is still fucking stupid, just in a different way. Damn - I think we nailed it. <br />

so from that it says that well equiped warriors can out agro knights chain casting agro spells.  what about those warriors that cannot get good agro weapons, either due to lack of raiding, groups or plat?  but then those ones dont matter, its only the high end warriors you are talking about, not the vast majority of warriors who dont have access to uber agro weapon_01.<br />
<br />
other than that, i agree that knights need work in DPS and spells as well as servivabilty in some areas.  and with SOE being complete cock waffles about fixes, ie making new expansion with lvl 70 to fix GoD encounters, i think it will be a LONG time before anything is done, if anything is done.<br />

<br />
Your average joe warrior can get effective aggro weapons.  It's not like it's hard to farm plat or LDoN points - you don't need a raiding guild for a decent aggro setup.  Get a pair of stun-proccing weapons from the bazaar or take a small group to drooga, get ykesha and/or anger augs from LDoN, and you're good to go.<br />
<br />
<br />
While it's true that a knight will likely be able to outaggro a warrior with such a setup (AA's also play a role), the warrior will have plenty enough aggro that it's a moot point.  You don't need all the aggro in the world, you just need enough to keep the mob's attention.</div></div><hr />

Exactly the problem.  Warriors have more HP better mitigation and can reasonably control agro. Why use a knight when you can have a warrior.  Even if knights can tank during the lower levels, why use them?  Warriors will require less healing.  Make us feasible tanks with a usefull utility.  FD pulling is dead, with few exceptions.  Agro can be held by warriors.  Woo woo HT is our 500-800 dd spell every 72 minutes.  I love the flexibility my spells gie me, I don't want to roll a warrior.  Ican serve any non essential group roll.  I can do things that are nice to have but they aren't needed nor even in demand.  I get groups with friends or when they need an extra person or are deparate for a tank and can't find a warrior.  Make me a useful tank please.  Lower/Mid levels need dev loving too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
There is a fix for warriors being able to get groups and it already exists. Simply keep your health at more than one bub of life and less than 2. While bezerk you will take substantially less damage and your dps will go up with crazy crippling blows. Far as aggro goes, when your life bar is that low you could hold aggro with a cracked staff. Once people see this being done warriors will be proclaimed as Gods and there will be a cry across the land for the need of a nerf.<br />
Grant it there is no room for any suck factor in doing this, however, stop asking for more when you dont even use what ya have. A warrior with high end luclin and velious gear (7500+hps)could do this easily on easy ldon missions.<br />

<br />
Giving knights full defensive would do NOTHING to raid MT roles - for fucks sake read what we've been saying since this whole shitstorm started.  Warriors still have a large (~15%) innate tanking advantage, higher HP, more sustained aggro, plenty of snap aggro, furious, AE taunt, etc.  Knights have... possility for slightly better aggro in the first ~10secs of the fight... wuwu.  <br />
<br />
That's why knights aren't even asking for defensive - most of us are asking for a rapid-fire mitigation disc to augment our traditional offtanking role.  <br />
<br />
Get with the fucking program... jesus christ.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u105"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p105">Theres a problem with a rapid fire disc, I came up with that idea awhile ago, and stopped asking for it because I realised where the problem with it was.<br />
<br />
1.  Offtanked mobs typically live as long or longer than the boss in GoD.<br />
2.  It's potentially more damage saved than defensive even with less mitigation on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u106"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p106">My proposed discs would be active less total time than defensive if used every time they popped.<br />
<br />
There's more to offtanking than tanking the adds around the boss.  That's a part of it, but there's also all the mobs en route.  <br />
<br />
Shorter duration, faster refresh discs would be up for each wave of mobs.  <br />
<br />
They would be much easier to get implimented, as they've been shown to draw considerably less objection from warriors.  <br />
<br />
<br />
How long adds in the boss fights live depends on the encounter and the guild.  For many encounters (generally speaking), some guilds will offtank the adds until the end, and deal with them after the boss is dead, while others will put high DPS onto the adds to burn them down quickly rather than focusing 100% on the boss until it's dead.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Also, remember that this is intended as a fix for SK's in general, rather than GoD in particular.  This would be more in line with the SK class as a whole.  If SoE were to impliment the rapid-fire style disc's, they would be effectively recognizing our offtanking role, and the chances of future offtanking content being balanced with their unique atributes in mind would be likely, just as content is currently developed around warrior defensive.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Rapid-fire mitigation discs are more suited to the class, more likely to be implimented, and more widely supported by knights (and other classes for that matter) in general.  <br />
<br />
Whenever the issue is brought up, knights repetedly, emphatically respond with things like &quot;we don't want a version of warrior defensive - we want a rapid-fire mitigation disc to augment our offtanking role&quot; and things of that nature.  It's safe to say that you went against the general consensus of the knight community in that point.<br />
<br />

I generally support your viewpints on such issues, but, just as with your desire to limit the mitigation fix to cutting edge GoD knights, I am in clear opposition to your position on this issue, and again, I think I have the majority of the knight community on my side...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u107"><b>Oberyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p107">...at this point.   IMHO if the devs see the (obvious) need for a tanking discipline of some variety, one would hope they do the research<br />
<br />
(rolls eyes)   and a bit of reading on the subject, which one hopes would lead them to some of the posts on the subject.<br />
<br />
...I liked the look of your disciplines Slein, but I also think that merely getting them to CONSIDER a tanking discipline of some variety would be a major victory and step in the right direction.<br />
<br />
If we get them to admit we need one and they say we are going to get one... then we can argue and push for the ideal discipline.<br />
<br />
At this point ANY discipline coming down the pipe that improves my surviveability in GoD and a tanking role would be welcome.<br />
<br />
Kudos to Slein for some very well thought out ideas on SK improvements.<br />
<br />
Kudos to Brael for pulling his list together, and presenting it under the deadline, for the community.  A thankless job, for the most part.<br />

lets say that knights get a form of true defensive, or hell even full defensive.  where would that leave warriors?  why take a warrior when a pally or SK can get snap agro from the get go?  why take a warrior when a pally or a SK can maintain agro better than a warrior who has to rely on weapon procs?  a bad streak of no weapon procs can really screw over a warrior, trust me i know.<br />
<br />
so if pallys and SKs get a form of true defensive why play a warrior, the class that can do only one thing, tank.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Sorry, but this makes absolutely no sense at all.  None; nada.<br />
<br />
If SHD/PAL got an approprotely scaled version of /defensive, that would leave WAR at exactly the same spot they are--the class that can take the best beating.  SHD/PAL won't infringe on that IN ANY MANNER with the proposed suggestions.<br />
<br />
No reasonable SHD/PAL that I know of wants to be able to take the same beating as a WAR--clearly that is unreasonable.<br />
<br />
Why take a WAR over a SHD/PAL?  SIMPLE--they can take a better beating.<br />
<br />
I know not why that is so hard to understand.  <br />
<br />
Also, agro is *NOT* the only thing to tanking and WAR have more then enough right now, particularily at the upper end.<br />
<br />
Also, WAR DPS is way out of whack as well.  Want to factor that into your silly comment about why play a WAR??<br />

Agree and apologies--my post was not clear.  I was referring to the SoE guys hinting that a short-lasting immunity disc would be considered, but not /defensive.  In other words, my comment was directed towards the situation of one or the other.<br />

Meet a reasonable SK that most definitely thinks SKs should be able to tank uber mobs as well as warriors.<br />
<br />
Pre Kunark thats precisely what we did.  We got screwed so bad by Kunark most SKs are grateful to get war throwaway trash mobs provided they can at least do it without a ranger making them look bad.  Yeah I was there.  I was a officer in a US raid guild.  I know all about how Kunark hit us in the groin.<br />
<br />
Forget for a minute all the patches and re balance legacy crap we have swum in for 4 years and step back.  Just precisely WHY should warriors be head and shoulders over SKs and Paladins tanking uber mobs?<br />
<br />
This is supposed to be a FANTASY roleplaying game.  According to Sony Elric, Galahad, Mordred and Lancelot were all lesser tanks not meant to be champions against the ultimate foes.<br />
<br />
Can't for the life of me understand why SKs are begging to just be offtanks.  We should be DEMANDING to be full tanks if tanking is the role of a knight.  <br />
<br />
But hey, its your funeral.  Ask for less, get even less is my view of Sony.  Seems wars understand that and SKs have this weird idea they should compromise.  Well I have news for you.  Knights were screwed over for YEARS with that approach my friends.<br />
<br />
<br />
Academic for me, my EQ sub has days left on it, my tolerance for Sonys fubar balance uber guild orientation is at an end.  If EQ2 isnt up to scratch (and in EQ2 SKs are FULL tanks) I am off to wow once it betas down my way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1.  Unlinked discs which really dont do much aside from furious every 42 minutes and fell strike every half our or so.<br />
<br />
2.  We have 2 tanking discs and one is 42 minute refresh, and that is called furious.  The other 3 are on the same timer.<br />
<br />
3.  5% innate mitigation is nice, but in the grand scheme of things it really doesnt do much.  5% on a mob you need a 0 pause rot on still requires a 0 pause rot and tanking in exp groups the mitigation difference is nonexistant.<br />
<br />
4. We do have higher hps i agree with you, however until we got sturdiness it isnt by much, and by the spread in qvic armor, the hp gap will stay fairly close on gear.<br />
<br />
5. We do have higher defensive caps, but they dont do much of anything that will again, require a slower rot or less clerics on light.<br />
<br />
6. Higher dps.. this is incorrect, with your spell damage and focus you are marginally ahead of an end game warrior.  If you want to say higher melee dps i would agree with you 100%, but sk spells are added dps and far superior to your melee dps.<br />
<br />
7. AE taunt is on a 10 minute timer provided you have all 3 levels of hastened instigation, otherwise its 15 mins which makes it virtually useless unless you are second or third tank in a rotation and its your turn.  A much better approach is to gauge your bellow/cry dps and try to stay second on aggro list with your finger on furious for the tank switch.<br />
<br />
8.  Provoke line is very very nice.  In fact that coupled with a miniscule innate mitigation boost are the only 2 things that warriors have received since kunark where we got defensive.<br />
<br />
9.  Aggro over time is a moot point unless you are going to be a jerkoff and spam aggro spells during the fight and try to pull aggro, and in that sense you are a moron for trying to fuck your guild.  The fact remains that both warriors and knights can sustain adequate aggro to tank for your raid, and knight aggro is slightly better in exp groups, although incite line has lessened that gap significantly.  Aside from ae taunt which is 0 aggro, its just a shift in aggro list for the user, ancient chaotic cry, which is 480 hate or bellow 440, the only item a warrior has to build initial aggro other than normal melee is furious disc which as i have said before is not linked to defensive, evasive, stonewall.  However it has a 42 minute refresh which makes using it a penalty in itself, since its main use is to keep yourself alive during a tank switch.<br />

Whenever the issue is brought up, knights repetedly, emphatically respond with things like &quot;we don't want a version of warrior defensive - we want a rapid-fire mitigation disc to augment our offtanking role&quot; and things of that nature.  It's safe to say that you went against the general consensus of the knight community in that point.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Knights offtanking role is typically fairly long duration in respect to most warrior tanking duties.  Adding a short duration disc does jack and shit as you will have to tank without it at some point.  But hey way to think it through.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, I mean why should we have a short duration disc?  It's not like several classes who were never meant to tank at all have them, right?<br />
<br />
Apparently this aspit scholar has never seen a Knight die in 3 seconds after the Ranger's weaponshield wears off and he is killed.  (In GoD)<br />
<br />
Apparently he's never seen a Knight nearly one-rounded by Tallon Zek because the MT died and the next one was too slow to hit ae taunt.<br />
<br />
Apparently he's never heard of &quot;spell casting subtlety&quot; much less ever thought about the fact that we cannot purchase it if we ever do get the chance to tank.<br />
<br />
1. Unlinked discs which really dont do much aside from furious every 42 minutes and fell strike every half our or so.<br />
<br />
Oh, so you NEVER ae taunt, hit furious, and then hit stonewall?  The entire disadvantage of defensive was erased and handed to you on a silver fucking platter by unlinking those discs.  Let's not even start talking about how easily Furious can outdamage Harmtouch.<br />
<br />

I'm not sure exactly what this is trying to say, but if this is to mean that a SHD / PAL should be able to take the same &quot;beating&quot; as a WAR, you are clearly not focused on balance.  A WAR needs to have a certain advantage inherit to its class.<br />

If this is to mean that a SHD/PAL should be able to successfully &quot;tank&quot; a boss mob, then sure--that isn't unreasonable.<br />

We SHOULD have the natural mitigation / avoidance needed to stay alive once we're receiving heals and/or the mob is slowed.  <br />
<br />
It would also fill a nitch for us.  MT goes down, we can grab aggro and FD while the chain starts on the next Warrior tank.   Hell, that was my nitch before and 9/10 I'd end up a dead SK but the raid would live and keep dps casualities to a minimum.  <br />

On the trash mob end...  I see it more of a class role  to be able to run up to the mob toe to toe, warn the raid mob so and so added, and live to tell about because you bought yourself time to start getting heals.</div></div><hr />

Reading posts like this can be so entertaining.  What a complete joke.<br />
<br />
Firstly, let's note how, over and over, he minimizes the value of the advantages that the WAR class has. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, the 5% mitigation bonus doesn't mean much..&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh, the higher defense caps don't mean much...&quot;<br />
<br />
So, when SHD say that our spellbooks mean jack and shit, they DO mean much?<br />
<br />
For our *COUGH* &quot;mighty&quot; spellbook is the LYNCHPIN of the entire WAR class balance argument.  Apparantely, the &quot;ubah&quot; abilities that our spellbook grants us is the reason for all our woes.<br />
<br />
Either things of this nature DO mean something or they don't.  Pick your poison---either way, the WAR class is clearly overpowered.<br />
<br />
Your &quot;higher DPS&quot; comment is complete bullshit as well.  A WAR will VASTLY out DPS a SHD when tanking.  About the only time a SHD has a chance to catch a WAR (end game geared that is) DPS wise is if the SHD is behind the mob and is able to freely cast spells.  EVEN THEN, it is STILL challenging to catch the WAR.<br />
<br />
Also, I found particular humor in, &quot;sk spells are added dps and far superior to your melee dps.&quot;   WHAT?!?!?!?!?  Please oh please walk me through this logic...<br />
<br />
WAR DPS is ABSOLUTELY BROKEN.  The BEST defensive melee class in the game, by extension, should do the lowest DPS.  It's that simple.<br />

Evasive isn't all that much endurance, and it can be used in groups tons.  You can even get endurance to spare for some Provoke line abilities while doing it, provided you don't chain the highest one every single time, since really you don't need it.<br />

Rog/Bst/Brd need put on Rng/Mnk and Pal/SK need slightly more than they have when looking at that.  If you look at the Qvic stuff you would know that the Knight armor isn't very good compared to other classes so the chance of Knights getting full suits is pretty low.  The hp gap between us and non tanks closes further than it already is with Monks/Rogues because melee non visible armor has higher hp/ac than hybrid stuff, that ac difference mostly makes up the ac difference from chain to plate for Berserkers and Rogues and the hp puts us at lower hp in the end than Berserkers.  Also back to the Qvic armor point, the bp in Uqua is better than the Knight BP's from that armor set, the stats on the Warrior legs mean the Knight ones won't be an ac upgrade from Ikkinz, won't be a shielding upgrade, and will be at best a 15 hp upgrade (most likely 5-10 hp), but they wont have a focus effect making them worse basically.  Knight problems with Qvic gear are the same problems Warriors had with Time gear originally:  Other classes gain a much larger benefit, the stats are similar to our previous gear (we end up equal or less ac with Qvic vs Time), the HP don't really provide us any real benefit, the only reason to go for the armor is the effects (except in our case the effects are all downright horrible so that reason is only valid for the helm).<br />
<br />
5. We do have higher defensive caps, but they dont do much of anything that will again, require a slower rot or less clerics on light.<br />

1.8% more avoidence than SK's/Pal's if you don't count Paladins cheating err... stunning.<br />

<br />
How is that approach better?  Multiple target rampage lists, hate list only ae's, increased chance of dying, unless it's a mob that you can't AE Taunt.  Considering the uses of AE Taunt theres not much of a reason to need it more than once every 10 min.<br />
<br />
8. Provoke line is very very nice. In fact that coupled with a miniscule innate mitigation boost are the only 2 things that warriors have received since kunark where we got defensive.<br />

Knights are lower aggro in groups too, I lose aggro far more often than Warriors because I can't channel my taunt spells.  SK's best aggro spell is 1.2 cast, it typically takes me 3 attempts to cast it when the mob is already on me but it's not uncommon for it to take longer.  I was tanking a mob the other day in Qvic, a 1.2 cast spell took over 15 seconds to get off from channeling, even that isn't an uncommon occurance.</div></div><hr />

/agree. I dont think the Warriors who complain about how they're at the mercy of the RNG for their procs realize that we have the same unpredictability at holding aggro. At least a warrior can build hate via melee when his procs don't go off, when we get interruption after interruption, we don't even have that. Better channeling should be a high priority. We give up a lot of our tanking side for our casting side, but when it's time to tank our caster side is too busy getting spammed by &quot;your spell has been interrupted.&quot; Hybrid spellcaster/tank? Nah, most of the time we can only do one at a time.</div></div><hr />

Knight problems with Qvic gear are the same problems Warriors had with Time gear originally:  Other classes gain a much larger benefit, the stats are similar to our previous gear (we end up equal or less ac with Qvic vs Time), the HP don't really provide us any real benefit, the only reason to go for the armor is the effects (except in our case the effects are all downright horrible so that reason is only valid for the helm).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
1.8% more avoidence than SK's/Pal's if you don't count Paladins cheating err... stunning.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You're wrong here, burst dps wise a Warrior and SK are very close, sustained DPS an SK is behind a Warrior.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
How is that approach better?  Multiple target rampage lists, hate list only ae's, increased chance of dying, unless it's a mob that you can't AE Taunt.  Considering the uses of AE Taunt theres not much of a reason to need it more than once every 10 min.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes it is nice, it's too bad so many Warriors not only misuse it but understate it's value.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Knights are lower aggro in groups too, I lose aggro far more often than Warriors because I can't channel my taunt spells.  SK's best aggro spell is 1.2 cast, it typically takes me 3 attempts to cast it when the mob is already on me but it's not uncommon for it to take longer.  I was tanking a mob the other day in Qvic, a 1.2 cast spell took over 15 seconds to get off from channeling, even that isn't an uncommon occurance.  <br />
<br />
Im not going to argue about furious being very valuable because it is invaluable and a new means of tank switch which helps all guilds immensly.  but it is also on a 42 minute timer which is somewhat of a constraint when you are flying through tier 4-5 time ect where a  tank may die.  Not having furious up for a mob like rz greatly increases the chance of a wipe if mt dies.  Its not much of an issue in gates as of yet as most of the mobs are spaced out fairly well.<br />
<br />
Evasive is 7 mins 42 second refresh and is usefull.  However in a group it is 99% useless as it cuts your dps by around 40% and greatly decreases your aggro, although that may not always be an issue.<br />
<br />
5% innate mitigation doesnt do much of anything to keep you from being one rounded.  Seeing that most high end wars are 13k+ buffed hps a mob would have to land a full quad 3250 round to one shot a tank.  No mobs in the game can do that with defensive up, and every war uses defensive in god, because they will get ass raped if they dont.  Take quarm who has a 140 di ( i believe going off memory here)  that 5% only drops his max hit to 140.  If you are non disc with no shielding he is still hitting for 3660 max and would be enough to theoretically one shot a non defensive warrior.  But it will never happen as his attack is very very low.<br />
<br />
As to the qvic armor point, that is an itemization point not a balance issue.  I think everyone understands that its blatantly retarded that a cleric bp has the same ac as a knight bp, and that the hp range from war items to int caster is roughly 20.  And not to mention the fact that most of the items are marginal upgrades at best as you said.  But again thats not what this discussion is about.  If you want to form your arguement toward this discussion it should be why does knight armor only have 10 fewer hps than warrior armor, not to mention the very marginal difference in ac and shielding.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have never read anywhere where evasive reduces agro.  To borrow a quote from Slein, which is also the sentiment that many on melee boards think, &quot;PARSE IT FUCKER&quot;<br />
<br />
Dhantes is correct in his thought that swings (with the same weapon of course) are what count for agro--not hits.<br />
<br />
NOTE:<br />
<br />
WAR are vastly overpowered.  It is my belief at the moment that it isn't necessarily due to SoE wanting it that way, but more to do with them just not really understanding what is going on, as many don't seem to play high-end characters.  As a result, the WAR that complained to no end got many things they wanted.  However, these same WAR had their OWN class in mind and paid NO ATTENTION, despite the CAUTION that many (myself included) heaped upon them, to CLASS BALANCE.  By extention, /bend over PAL and, ESPECIALLY, SHD<br />
<br />
In other words, SoE just doesn't understand what is going on.  If they did, WAR, SHD/PAL would most likely be quickly adjusted, as what is going on now is an atrocity.  So, KEEP IT SIMPLE when explaining things, ESPECIALLY when SoE is involved.  That isn't necessarily an insult to them, it's just that they do NOT have the experience that many on these boards do. <br />

  So, how do you really feel about my post?<br />
<br />
<br />
Why on earth is that a WAR [only] ability? It makes NO SENSE whatsoever that my character can't take a defensive position (or whatever). <br />
<br />
   I, for one, don't want to be like a warrior.....I just want to be able to tank as well and have the same DPS as one.  I'm not saying that we shouldn't be able to take damage like a warrior, we should just go about doing it in a different way.  Our aggro and our DPS relies heavily on our spells (as does just about everything we do), so why shouldn't our defensive abilities do the same?  This inables us to be just as defensive, but requires us to think a little unlike our warrior counterparts.<br />
<br />
  BTW, not that I'm a stickler for role-playing, but how does one be entirely defensive while casting various aggro, DD, and tap spells?  The true basis of a warrior is to stand there and take a beating.....A knight uses his wis/int to find ways to take/deal damage.  You seem to really like the way warriors are played....perhaps you should start one?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u135"><b>Culdahl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p135">I think the real problem is PvP.  /def does little in a PvP match, but a much improved LT and/or LT proc coupled with a usefull leech curse would be WAY overpowering against another melee.  A 400hp tap is usefull in PvP, but utterly useless against a mob that is hitting for 1500+....and our 80hp DoT is equally useless.  I think SoE could greatly increase these spell lines, especially for a short duration via an AA. But they would somehow need to reduce the effectiveness against other players as to not over-power the class in PvP.<br />
<br />
  An easier solution would be a completely new spell-line that takes away a fixed % of incoming dmg and redirects that damage back to the mob (sort of a spell riposte).....the second part being a proc like effect, or they could just make that spell riposte be permanent to aid our rather dismal DPS.  We could then get an AA that greatly increases the % on that spell-line for a short duration during a big fight.  This would give us something almost similar to a warrior, but would be spell based.<br />

<br />
I may not be an &quot;Uber breal&quot; level of SK(no ofense intended to brael, just clarifying I am not in a raiding guild, and haven't played since GoD release, it pissed me off too much)<br />
<br />
Anyhow, this is my view, I would appreciate feedback on it(and please GIVE feedback, I dont care if you flame me, but if you dont tell me I am wrong and why, I just sit here like a dumbass thinking you agree with me and are too self centered to admit it or something).<br />
<br />
There are 3 points to the tanking Triad.  Durability, Aggro, and DPS.  However, aggro is sort of a moot point right now(as it has been established agro between wars and SKs is virtually identical on full burn).  So the real issues are the two remaining: offense, and defense.<br />
<br />
Overall, the tank classes should be arranged scalingly, as such:<br />
<br />
defense&lt;--warrior-----paladin-----SK--&gt;offense<br />
<br />
Paladins should be able to tank slightly better than an sk, but not as good as a warrior.<br />
<br />
SKs should do EQUAL melee DPS to a warrior, with their spell damage putting them over warrior DPS, but they tank the worst of the 3, due to having less defensive abilities.<br />
<br />
Warriors should have the most AC, the most hp, and dole out equal aggro and DPS to the other two.<br />
<br />
Paladins should do the same DPS in melee as a warrior, but since they have NO attack spells, this puts them as at a midpoint in abilities.  They should have higher HP than an SK, and higher AC, but they have no truly &quot;offensive&quot; spells.  I don't count stuns as offensive, they dont actually hurt the mob, just hold aggro and keep it from hurting them back.<br />
<br />
So, heres how I think it should be.  Note I am using examples, the actual numbers are merely accurate in comparison, not necessarily in situation.<br />
<br />
<br />
Innate mitigation:<br />
Warriors:5% over current SK(how it is now)<br />
Paladin:3% over SK<br />
SK:how it currently is<br />
<br />
HP counts(with non-situation specific examples, including GoD hp booster AA for wars.  Use the numbers for comparison between the classes, not as hard numbers):<br />
Warriors:~12,000<br />
Paladins:~11,000<br />
SK:~10,000<br />
<br />
Mitigation Disc %s, all plate tanks get one, warriors already have defensive, which is theirs(Now, stop whining warriors.  It may work LIKE defensive, but it is NOT defensive.  Besides, BEASTLORDS have a form of defensive, why shouldn't we get one weaker, like they do?):<br />
Warriors:75%(err, can't remember, but isn't defensive 75%?  Tell me if I'm wrong and I will rescale them)<br />
Paladin:65%<br />
Shadowknight:60%<br />
<br />
Supposed avg spell+melee total DPS(again, just examples, the numbers are off I'm sure):<br />
Warrior:~130<br />
Paladin:~130<br />
Shadowknight:~150<br />
<br />
Counterbalancing utility(important things besides raw numbers that each class gets):<br />
Warrior:Provoke, AE taunt, furious, evasive, stonewall<br />
Paladin:Group heals, AotC, stuns, BSS, DA<br />
SK:DPS spells, taps(stat, HP, and group shared hp/mana[zevs]),   FD, Harmshield.<br />
<br />
<br />
Seems fair to me.  Any disagreements with the inter-class scaling?</div></div><hr />

What you're saying is to weaken our primary job (that we're meant to remain equal to Paladins in) because of another job that is nothing more than fallback for having nothing else to do.  Let's make Paladins tank worse while we're at it because of their stunning and rooting abilities.<br />
<br />
Lifetaps don't scale with mob DPS.  If a mob puts out 2k DPS and your suggestion were put in, since you didn't provide a number let me put one in for you thats on the extreme end, auto crit nuke/heal every lifetap with half the cast time (.8 cast) and lets throw in 40% to magic nukes in there to.  You would have 1036 damage and 2072 heal every 10.8 sec (10 recast .8 cast), or manage to somewhat negate 191 of that 2k dps as long as your mana held out or 9.55% &quot;mitigation&quot;.  Against a mob with 1k dps it would be worth 19.1% &quot;mitigation&quot;.  Although heals aren't really mitigation because you have to live to cast the ability.  This ability flat out doesn't work, at the lower end it would be SUPERIOR to defensive and at the higher end it wouldn't have any real worthwhile impact because it doesn't scale it's simply a static amount.<br />
<br />
Your Zev's on a 6 sec recast idea isn't even worth a response beyond this:  You're a fucking idiot.<br />
<br />
BTW, not that I'm a stickler for role-playing, but how does one be entirely defensive while casting various aggro, DD, and tap spells?<br />
<br />
Our melee is defensive oriented, our spells are necromancy oriented.  That means we steal some abilities from our opponents to weaken them.  Steal a bit of their attacking power and they're suddenly attacking you for less, steal some of their defense and you're taking hits better.  It also means we have some other methods for weakening them such as semi decent debuffs.  You're confusing tanking with defense, defense is your ability to protect your group, tanking is your ability to stand up to a mob.<br />
<br />
Scaledge:<br />
There are 3 tanking classes in the game, there are 16 classes.  There are 8 true dps classes (Rogue, Monk, Berserker, Wizard, Magician, Necromancer, Ranger, Beastlord).  We aren't a true DPS class and never will be, this means at best we will be at the top of the bottom half of damage dealers, in exchange for being the worst of the tanking classes.  Think of how EQ works, that would kill SK's, a class that truly sucks at everything is rather pointless.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The idea kinda intrest me and kinda reminds me of FFXI where the pecking order is (i only read FFXI boards i dont play so if i get this wrong pls correct) Paladins are the ones who take the hits the best in the game, they hold good agro, and they have the worst dps. War's are good dps and abilities, they tank okay, they cant hold agro. Darkknights are not a tank they are a dps class, they do very good damage, can get agro easily, they tank horribly. Reading the FFXI boards i thought i'd like to play a darkknight but at the same time i do love to tank and they do an inferiour job at it. <br />
<br />
Anyways just wondering if their is any hypothetical idea on how to make a tank do enough dps to tank = as well as a paladin and war on stunnable mobs and the like. And i could imagine how hard this would be to balance and probably isn't worth the time to think about too much just hypothetical and all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u154"><b>Culdahl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p154">Lifetaps don't scale with mob DPS. If a mob puts out 2k DPS and your suggestion were put in, since you didn't provide a number let me put one in for you thats on the extreme end, auto crit nuke/heal every lifetap with half the cast time (.8 cast) and lets throw in 40% to magic nukes in there to. You would have 1036 damage and 2072 heal every 10.8 sec (10 recast .8 cast), or manage to somewhat negate 191 of that 2k dps as long as your mana held out or 9.55% &quot;mitigation&quot;. Against a mob with 1k dps it would be worth 19.1% &quot;mitigation&quot;. Although heals aren't really mitigation because you have to live to cast the ability. This ability flat out doesn't work, at the lower end it would be SUPERIOR to defensive and at the higher end it wouldn't have any real worthwhile impact because it doesn't scale it's simply a static amount. <br />
<br />
   All very good points, but I would favor much quicker recast times with lesser amounts per tap.....Was actually thinking of an AA triggered bond of death like spell that could increase the HoT to a per second tap rather then a per tick tap.  It is true that this wouldn't scale and it would be far more effective against mobs with lower DPS, but a warrior's /def is a set rate of mitigation (unless Ive been misinformed) and scales in the opposite direction.  I can live with warriors being slightly better tanks on the highest end mobs while we were slightly better on the lower end mobs, but it shouldn't be at the extreme that it currently is (especially given the warriors improved abilities to get and maintain aggro in group situations).  The problem with current taps is the recast time.  The figures you suggest are useless based on a 10 second recast, as a lump some heal every 10+ seconds would only help that current point in the CH rotation.....We need to mitigate the DPS better on a second by second basis to give any real boost to the CH.<br />
<br />
<br />
Your Zev's on a 6 sec recast idea isn't even worth a response beyond this: You're a fucking idiot. <br />
<br />
  You're too kind, really.  Anywho, the point of that suggestion was not to be taken as a scientific certainty, as I had not parsed out what such a drastic reduction in cast time would do...I was merely stating that I would like to see group heals play a bigger role in groups and I would like to see SK's and pally's play a role in that endeavor.  Zevfeer's is our only means of achieving this , but it will have to be upgraded at higher levels (via the new level cap) to be even remotely effective.....Now I understand the mana tap component would be over powering if the cast time were reduced too much, but they could increase the HP tap and lower the mana tap in future versions of the spell.  But again, I have no right to even bring this up as you are obviously my superior and I am merely you're &quot;fucking idiot&quot;...I can see you're a people person...LoL (good luck with that)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u155"><b>Culdahl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p155">cont.  -  <br />

Our melee is defensive oriented, our spells are necromancy oriented. That means we steal some abilities from our opponents to weaken them. Steal a bit of their attacking power and they're suddenly attacking you for less, steal some of their defense and you're taking hits better. It also means we have some other methods for weakening them such as semi decent debuffs. You're confusing tanking with defense, defense is your ability to protect your group, tanking is your ability to stand up to a mob. <br />
<br />
  Until AC and attack have a greater impact on this game, I can't see where our taps are even remotely useful against higher end mobs.  I have recently upgraded my AC from around 1200 to around 1600, and have noticed very little change.  I realize that OVERALL I'm taking less damage, but a mobs damage is to random to make this a very useful upgrade.  Over ten fights I will take less damage then with a lower AC, but a PoP mob can drop my HP in a hurry if he strings together a few max hits.  Defensive AA's seem to have a far greater impact IMO.  As for our attack buffs, perhaps at the end game, where I'm sure you are, 25 to 50 attack means a lot, but I could care less if my attack is 1300 or 1500....I'm not here to do DPS, and, as you have stated, this is not our primary function, nor is debuffing.  We use the necromantic arts to enhance our defensive abilities and, to a lesser extent, our offensive abilities.  I am merely suggesting that we stay with this hybrid theme to obtain our desired goals of being as good of a tank as any other class....and this makes me an idiot?<br />
<br />
  As for DPS - If you read my previous posts you would find that I never suggested being a DPS class, but there is no reason why warriors should have better DPS then us.  I would only increase our DPS to match that of a warrior (should be higher DPS when we use all of our available DoT's, DD, and pet, but, as we can only mem so many spells at a given time, we should be equal to  a warrior with a couple of offensive spells mem'd).<br />

However, I disagree with that entire point.  This isn't a &quot;new&quot; vs. &quot;old&quot; SHD issue.  Let's keep our eye on the ball.

This thread has some really good points and you can really get a better understanding of the SK class from it.  One major issue I see between the thinking of &quot; older &quot; SKs and newer ones is that newer SKs don't understand what SKs were originally and Older SKs have a hard time grasping what we've become.  <br />
<br />
Before PoP and all the cool new 65 spell lines, SKs used to weaken mobs to enpower themselves.  We stole str, atk, AC... Fear / snare was actually viable in many places ... Drain Soul was Godly and our DPS really sucked.   Mana was a HUGE issue for us.  Mental Corruption started out as a caster only tap when it was introduced with Luclin.<br />
<br />
PoP came around and now instead of debuffing mobs, we do pure DPS.  With the addition of all these proc / tap DDs, BoH,  Super HT, Mental Corruption / lich lines fueling us, and fast casting nukes / lifetaps...  we became a pretty potent &quot; pure DPS &quot; class.  <br />
<br />
Spells are balanced for the low tiers though and as guilds progressed through PoP and got better itemization, our dps spells weren't &quot; so hot &quot; any more.  So... whats in our future?  A Debuffing / self Powering class or a Tank with a DPS based spell book?  <br />
<br />
1 Issue I can tell you right now that affects ALL casters is spell drops.  Since all new expansion spells are pretty much available to all... spells keep getting balanced via lower teir content.  So casters start off strong and end being overshadowed by Melee ( except for Wizards, and that's due to items like elemental pants ).  <br />
<br />
They need to have more powerful versions or maybe even &quot; upgrades &quot; ( replaces the lower tier spell )  to spells dropping at each teir of progression.</div></div><hr />

Lifetaps are not a viable fix, no matter how you slice it.  Low end raid mobs - from Kunark dragons to vindi and the like - simply cannot even come close to comparing to high-end raid mobs in damage output.  Vindi's DPS is less than 25% of some 1-groupable mobs in GoD.  Lifetaps have almost no ability to scale.  Their HPS (healing/second) receives very, very little improvement as one progresses- the only minimal increases coming from foci.  <br />
<br />
Warrior defensive scales almost perfectly to mob DPS, however.  As such, in order for any lifetap based fix to bring us in line with warriors at the high end, we'd have to be undisputed gods at the lower end - to keep it balanced at the lower end would leave us useless at the high end.  <br />

Your understanding of the game is lower than the understanding of the game many many many people had back at level 50 prior to Kunark coming out.  A pre elemental SK can have plenty of understanding of the game.  Infact you have access to learn anything and everything about the game that isn't related to a specifc mob that you don't have access to or effects on gear which you cannot obtain.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u179"><b>Culdahl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p179">I don't think SK's should get anything like /def. That is a warrior ability and not something an SK should be doing. If we could just have better versions of our current spell lines we would be fine. This would enable us to be equal to warriors, but by different, and more difficult, means....after all, warriors are SUPPOSED to be the easiest tank class (/attack on + push taunt hotkey). I would accomplish this in a few different ways:<br />
<br />
1) Our LT line is situational at best. With full AA's it can become a decent bonus but can't be relied on atm. If we could get an AA that permenantly increases our LT amount and decreases the cast time, we could significantly improve our tanking ability (could have an active time of 12 minutes or so). Also, we should get better dmg shields (like rune as someone else suggested) to help increase our dmg mitigation abilities.<br />
<br />
2) To bring ourselves up to par with warriors as far as DPS is concerened, we could simply get better DD and DoT spells.<br />
<br />
We are all tanks and should all be able to do roughly the same things, SK's just need to utilize more abilities then /atk + /taunt to do them.<br />
<br />
One more point - as of now, only raid mobs have the ability to do effective DoT's on entire groups/raids .....I would like to see DoT's become a bigger part of grouping in general. SK's could tap to heal the group and pally's could use there group heals (we both would require better versions though).....warriors could help with some kind of AA that allows DoT's to be focused at them rather then the rest of the group (effectively doing more dmg to the warrior while doing less to the group). A zefeer's bite with a 6second recast time would be perfect for a DoT:-)<br />

Just my 2-cents worth though:-)<br />

  Christ, my only point was that I want to see SK's use their spell lines rather then go to a warrior type /def disc and I made a few suggestions on how we could achieve that.  As for the LT's - It was only one of a few suggestions I had made and Brael pointed out that LT's wouldn't scale, which was something I hadn't really considered.<br />
<br />
  My points on AC/atk were quite valid in the context that I gave them.  No, I haven't parsed out the dmg and, as I originally stated, I realize that more AC does help, especially on higher end mobs, but the 130ish AC tap is all but useless while grouping in tier 2 and lower zones (especially normal LDoN's).

<br />
Aura of Pain is not a spell that really merits complaint. 60 mana --&gt; 200dd (base) + 130 AC for over a minute. AC like this is a huge gift against lower tier content...just think of the amount of AC gear it would take for someone doing exp at that level of the game to generate the same stats...<br />
<br />
This game is all based on mathematical probabilities. For tank classes, the odds of taking a maximum damage hit are lowered by a factor based on AC. Opinions and other non-empirical observations are useless, get it through your head.</div></div><hr />

We're deisgned that way in EQ and that shouldn't change.  That means equal ability to take hits and equal ability to put out hits.  The differences are in our spellbooks and our class ability.  HT does some non scaling damage, LH saves a raid, since PoP came out I've had HT save a raid exactly once and save my ass in a raid when the mobs at 0% hp and turns to me 3 times.  nearly 2 years and it's done that 4 times.

Unless you consider pally healing spells to be &quot;tanking&quot;, which they're not, then no, they shouldn't.  <br />
<br />
Saying &quot;SKS should tank the same as paladins&quot; is idiotic, because that is like saying &quot;SKs are paladins!&quot;.  <br />
<br />
It's not idiotic - it's what's best for the game.  Tanking is the primary function of both classes and thus the main factor in determining their usefulness.  Making the two classes tank the same makes them equally valuable.  It does not make them the same class, however.  SK's have DPS and pulling in place of pally's increased group friendliness through buffs, heals, etc.  <br />
<br />

<br />
There's a limit to how much aggro is useful.  So what if we've got better aggro than pallys - pallys have plenty.  You need more aggro than the rest of the raid, but all three tank classes can manage that pretty well now.  Adding more aggro when your already on top of the aggro list is of little effect.  <br />
<br />
The same cannot be said for tanking - trading superfluous aggro for tanking ability would be retarted.  <br />
<br />
I mean, when you have 14k hp, whats 1k hp going to do? <br />
<br />
Keep you from getting 1-rounded.  <br />

<br />
At least HT is massive spike damage with unresistable effects. <br />
<br />
It's not great at the high-end, but it's still got its uses.  It's essentially a 0cast time aggroless CH - it has it's uses, and is quite powerful on lower end content.  HT is essentially the same way.  It makes a big impact on lower end content, but on high-end stuff, it's trivial.  A 10k nuke means little on most high-end content... it's hardly a &quot;massive spike&quot;.  <br />
<br />
But anyways, paladins and SKs should NOT be identical, the same as warriors not being identical to knights! They should simply be CAPABLE of tanking effectively!  <br />
<br />
Nope, and the difference lies in the spell books.  Pallys have group beneficial spells, SK's have pulling and DPS.  Pallys have root, SK's have snare.  There are plenty of differences, and always have been.  Both knights have always had the same tanking ability, and should continue to.  <br />
<br />
If all tanks were able to tank the same, you might as well just delete all tank characters and give them all the same character class, &quot;tank!&quot; <br />
<br />
Bullshit.  They all bring slightly different things to the table.  Quit being so fucking shallow.  <br />
<br />

Your suggestions would effectively kill our class at the higher raiding level.  Besides warriors and the more efficient &quot;better&quot; tanks PALADINS, there is no room left for tanks.  We will never be worthy dps.  I.e. no reason to guild a SK.  Period.<br />

Having trouble wrapping your head around that one are ya?  It's called an archetype (see EQ2).  We should essentially have the same base skill as any others in our archetype, the different classes just go about achieving this balance in different ways...not hard to grasp really. <br />

<br />
  Many people on here have said essentially the same thing....they want to have the same DPS and dmg mitigation as a warrior, but wish to go about it in a different way then a warrior (some focus less on DPS and more on DMG mit obviously).....our DPS and dmg avoidance comes from our spell book while warriors is generated primarily from their melee skills (it should stay that way).  AGAIN, it's not a hard concept to grasp.  The only problem for me seems to be that I'm not one of the uber regulars and thus my opinions are useless and, obviously, offensive in some way, despite their being the same points just worded differently...oh well.<br />
<br />
  As slein said a few posts back, we should all have an equal ability to tank as it is our primary role....but, for some reason, when I say that we should all have an equal tanking ability like that found in the new archtype setup of EQ2, everyone says I'm an idiot and should research &quot;their&quot; vast knowledge database to teach myself why I am such an idiot.<br />
<br />
  You guys do nothing to add to this class...from what I've read you do nothing but b*tch about other's suggestions while giving little to no insight yourselves.....are you afraid if you do you'll get flamed also?  At least brael is good at pointing out the exact reasons why a certain suggestion may not work, but he doesn't offer a counterpoint......He correctly pointed out that AoP is better at lower levels then higher levels due to the larger increase in AC gain from a % standpoint at lower levels, but he failed to say how AC would put us on par with warriors.  My basic point regarding AC was that a HUGE increase would be needed to bring us in line with a war /def disc (I've never parsed out exactly how much dmg mitigation can be achieved via a large AC increase and I would be interested to find out what number would need to be obtained to equal a /def disc if it were even possible at all).<br />
<br />
  I also disagree that we should get some sort of stun to match the proposed spell upgrades to the existing paladin line.  They have stuns, it's what they do....we should stick with our current line of spells to bring us into line with both warriors and paladins (as far as the proposed stuns are concerened).  If a different spell line is needed to bring us into line it should be something from the necromancer spell book or at least something in that spirit.<br />
<br />
  I know I said I wouldn't be back, but I got bored and made the mistake of reading responses from this thread:-(  So, you guys go ahead and flame on as I'm sure you will.....I just hope we have some uber SK's that can better represent the class, as I feel this forum is a gross misrepresentation of the SK class (and yes I know there have been some very good threads with some very good info from the very people in this thread to which I am concerened, but somehow, someway this board has lost its way).<br />
<br />
P.S. - If you don't understand what I mean by that last point, just think back to how you would have responded to peeps when you were 60 and below....I'm sure, back then, this forum was a great tool to learn and expand upon the class.

I think the suggestion Brael had fit into the necromancer area of spells pretty well a high level fear with a stun component.  Many of the higher level mobs have this and it would work like a stun for us to mitigate damage.

  I agree completely. It doesn't make sense that we can't use one of our best spell lines on any mob over 55 and paladins can.  I like brael's idea of a fear with a stun component, though I feel that a fear with a stun component is essentially a stun and I don't think it would fly with the SoE folks (seeing as how they seem to love their paladins:-)  I had suggested something amidst my flaming a few pages ago that no one replied to:  I would like to get your opinion on a self rune type spell that mitigates a fixed percentage of dmg (close to if not equal to that of a warriors /def disc)...the spell could have an instant cast but a recast time similar to the war /def timer (and a similar duration as well)....I would also like to make the mitigated dmg reflect back upon the mob in the form of DD or increase in aggro points. (mitigated DD would likely give us too much DPS, so aggro would probably be the better choice).  This spell would scale almost exactly as a war's /def does and would allow us to hold aggro with no probelm (not that we have much as it is).<br />
<br />
Don't fucking misquote me you dipshit. <br />

  I need something like a vulcan mind-meld with this bastage....what did I misquote and how?????  Or should I just go back and match my statement with yours and somehow find the discrepancies and list them here to let everyone, including me, know why you feel the way you do?

  As I said awhile ago,  a /def disc just doesn't fit into the SK scheme of things. It's not that I don't believe we need the disc, it just doesn't make sense and would demean the character of the class IMO.  How can we put all of our thoughts into defending ourselves while swinging an axe and casting DD, aggro, and tap spells at the same time (also, while being in the zen like state that is unholy aura at the end of a fight)?  Warriors do all their DPS with weapons just as they do all of their dmg mitigation with melee based skills.....(it would seem to me that there is a reason why warriors have higher riposte and dodge skill caps).  I'm not saying that a disc is out of the question, but I would like to see it based on some sort of spell like ability and not a melee one.   It's kind of like our group heals as opposed to a paladin's group heals....they both have the same function, but we use LT's rather then the cleric based direct heal form (same function done differently).<br />

It's not idiotic - it's what's best for the game. Tanking is the primary function of both classes and thus the main factor in determining their usefulness. Making the two classes tank the same makes them equally valuable. It does not make them the same class, however. SK's have DPS and pulling in place of pally's increased group friendliness through buffs, heals, etc.  <br />

So many thoughts for you, you simple minded fool.<br />
<br />
Firstly, common sense, logic and ease of balance clearly dictate that a WAR should be the best defensive melee class in the game.  By extension, WAR should have the lowest melee DPS in the game.  In other words, for your &quot;I can only handle extremely simple concepts&quot; brain, you &quot;can't have it both ways.&quot;  I've said this multiple times, but have repeated it here for your lazy, pathetic ass.<br />
<br />
Your cheesy ass attempt to demean my comment by asking if I am an &quot;authority&quot; has nothing to do with it.  If the logic is incorrect, walk me through how.<br />
<br />
Now, if SHD/PAL are, say, one step *below* a WAR in terms of a melee, defensive class, DPS should increase accordingly.<br />

It makes NO SENSE that any character--ANY--can't take a *defensive* stance (or whatever).  All one needs to do to balance such is appropriately scale it, which is, once again, something I have been saying for a long ass time, but repeated here for your pathetic ass.<br />

No, that is not what they've been asking for.  You admit that you don't want to read up on what has been discussed, therefore I can't imagine that you are in a position to summarize anyone else's views.<br />
<br />
And if you have been reading up, then you are clearly misunderstanding the discussions that have been taking place on this board.  Rational SKs understand that we will not be given the same DPS and mitigation as a warrior.  Like any of the main archetypes in EQ, there is one primary class and then there are secondary classes, given strengths in other areas to make up for the lack in the main area.  In the area of tanking, warriors are the best at absorbing damage, and SHD and PAL are second best.  No one in their right mind is asking that SHD and PAL tank as well as WAR.<br />
<br />
SHD and PAL are asking that the gap between best and second-best be shortened to a reasonable amount, and the best way to do that is via some manner of /disc, otherwise the balance doesn't work out.  You can't do it with spells or equipment, you can't make up for it by shifting DPS figures.  That's been discussed already in the threads you apparently do not wish to read or are unable to comprehend.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u226"><b>Culdahl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p226">I agree that we should not have the same ability to melee as a warrior and we should not be able to take the same dmg as a warrior based solely on our defensive capabilities, but that doesn't mean that we shouldn't be able to augment ourselves with our spells to equal a warrior.  To answer your question about spell dmg mit/avoidance:  we do have spells for both....though they may not be very effective, we do have them (AoP for one).  Also, just because I advocate using the abilities inherent to the class does not mean that I am against a /disc or AA ability to augment our dmg mitigation.....I just want the /disc and/or AA to be based on the necromantic arts.<br />
<br />
  Someone had suggested a ways back that we are 3/4 warrior and 1/4 necromancer and; therefore, should not be the full tank that warriors are.  I think this is a bit misguided.  I do believe that we are 3/4 war and 1/4 necro, but implying that we can only be 75% the tank that a warrior is also implying that a warrior is 100% tank, which they are not.  Warriors are also very good with a weapon and have decent DPS (though I realize that they are not a DPS class).  IMO, the 75% warrior portion of us is all about our primary role of being a tank, which should only put us slightly behind a warrior in terms of pure tanking ability via defensive skills, but I also believe that we should be able to bridge that gap by using the necromantic arts...just as we should have the same (if not greater) DPS as a warrior because we are part necro which is a good DPS class.<br />
<br />
  I'm also not saying that we should have the exact same ability to tank either....I would be happy with being a better off-tank and/or situational tank (whether it be because of better aggro/snap aggro or something else).  But I don't understand your suggestion that we should not be able to tank as well as a warrior or DPS as well as a warrior.....doesn't that just make us an inferior warrior?  IMO, all three classes should be able to tank about the same (with warriors having perhaps a slight edge on the highest end mobs).  Where we should differ should be in 25% portion of our hybrid....pally's can heal better then a warrior/SK, warriors can melee better then a pally/SK, and SK's can out DPS a warrior/pally.....doesn't that make sense considering that the classes are broke down thusly: paladin = 75% tank 25% cleric...warrior = 75% tank 25% melee....SK = 75% tank 25% necro...the only advantages should be that a warrior is a pure tank and should have a slight advantage, also, from a role play stand point, warrior's can focus solely on melee mitigation as they do not require any resources to go to spell casting, and thus their /disc def should be innate to them only.<br />

Where the hell would that put warriors then? If we could tank everything almost as well then they wouldnt be required. If we did more DPS then them as well then they would be entirely obsolete. You are trying to say that we should tank almost as good as them and out DPS them. Obviously these goals are unattainable. Who cares if we are suppose to be 1/4 shit and 3/4 ass.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u228"><b>Dkhar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p228">Why does the warrior have to tank better ? In all respect, there are 3 tank classes and they should all have the same tanking ability. Warrior tanking is straight and simple. Knights need spells to become equal to that of warriors abilities. Sure, it is a lot more complicated than that but that's what it should all come down to. Same tanking ability, different styles to get it done.<br />
<br />
Now, I am sure all the people will bitch about knights being able to solo or do specific things but that all goes out the window after certain levels are attained. I highly doubt Brael or anyone of that caliber fear kites or DoT kites. I doubt Paladins solo at all at high end too. All our special &quot;utility&quot; and itemization through spells are decreased to piddley, laughable skills we look back upon. <br />
<br />
I've seen warriors solo'n at level 50 before, where did the myth that they could not come from ? Sure, it is probably slow with downtime and nowhere near the solo abilities of a bard but neither are we! <br />
<br />
Oh wow, I can FD. If I had better surviveability... I wouldn't have to unless I was pulling. And who cares, monks, bards and rangers pull 100x better anyway. A warrior can pull too, they got a fucking bow, let the chanter sort it out. <br />
<br />
Our spells are weak. Our tanking abilities are embarrasing. All I want are some fucking spells that will land, do some decent damage and the right to stand next to a warrior and not feel like a skinny crackhead wearing dirty underwear.</div></div><hr />

  I do not agree with the idea that if we are just like warriors then warriors are obsolete.  We go about achieving the same basic functions as a warrior but through different means.  In the end all three classes should be roughly equal in tanking (with warriors having the slight edge on high end mobs) and the knights having a slight edge in their respective hybrid counterpart's specializations....it's a fairly easy idea to comprehend IMO.<br />
<br />
  Question:  if we were part warrior and part monk, would you expect to have the same DPS as a warrior or paladin?  One more note - warriors are by far the easiest class to start out playing in EQ....they are a simple class with simple functions.  SK's take a bit more skill to play and take a bit more attention while playing....so why do you advocate making us second class warriors?<br />
<br />
  I have seen 65 SK's that can't hold aggro in XP groups, so giving us the ability to tank nearly as good as a warrior does not ensure that every SK will be able to utilize the skills to do so.<br />

<br />
The thing is, all three tanks SHOULDN'T be about equal. Nobody wants all three tanks to be equal. What we want is for us to be VIABLE TANKS. Lets take PoTime as an example. Yes, now knights can tank Quarm. Should knights have been able to tank Quarm the first time we got there? No. That is what warriors are for. That is their job. They tank things that no one else can tank. The only problem is, now its gotten to the point in some GoD where warriors are the only tank, for everything from the big bad raid mob, to the shitty trash that we SHOULD be able to tank, as we've done in the past. Knights should NOT be tanking uber_raid_mob_01, at least until gearing up and mudflation allows it. That is why no one is asking for full blown 45% defensive. Instead, what quite a few are asking for, is some kind of 25-30% (or whatever gets deemed fair) defensive, with a shorter duration but a shorter re-use time, which would be ideal for off-tanking, which is supposed to be (or what used to be) our main raid role.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u232"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p232">Traditionally warriors were the best on the boss mobs and knights were the best offtanks.  Until PoP, both could do either job, but that was best - knights had the aggro for offtanking and warriors had defensive for maintanking.  <br />
<br />
Enter PoP - raid mobs start hitting too hard for knights to tank at all, at least until SIGNIFICANTLY overgeared.  Knights solidify their position as best offtanks, however, so all is well - no major complaints from knights.  <br />
<br />
Enter warrior changes - warriors are now the best offtanks also, and knights are useless as tanks.  <br />
<br />
Umm... tangent... sorta.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If we tanked equally to a warrior, warriors would be obsolete because knights bring other things to the table.  We (collectively, not just SK's) have zbite, group heals, spot heals, HP/AC buffs, atk buffs, resist buffs, etc. that warriors do not have.  Now, these things do not make the classes - I'll be the first one to point that out; they're quite secondary to tanking abilities.  If all else were equal, however, these advantages would put knights over the top and, while warriors would be able to do the job, there would be no reason to use one.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u235"><b>Culdahl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p235">Both of your points are valid ones, but I don't see how they differ from mine all that much.  Warriors should have the upper hand (slightly) on the highest end mobs, and we should have a slight advantage on offtanks due to aggro and other concerns...I would be completely fine with this, but, as you all have pointed out, there is currently a gap between what the warriors can tank and what SK's can now tank especially where GoD is concerned.  SoE upped the warrior's tanking ability (probably needed at the time), but over-did it a bit and have subsequently relegated us to second class tanks.  My original point is that we should keep a closer margin in terms of tanking ability with our warrior counterparts and that something needs to be done to bring us into line with them.  <br />
<br />
  I still don't buy the idea that warriors need to be superior tanks in order to be a viable class though.  They can be equal to us (or close to equal) without loosing their desireability for groups or raids.  There are also certain instances where an equal warrior would have a distinct advantage over a SK  -  the best example perhaps being that of tanking a mob with an AoE mana drain, which can quickly reduce an SK to a poor man's warrior.  Also, as I have stated several times, warriors are an easier class to level and play.  Knights should have some advantages over a warrior if for no other reason then we are a more difficult class to play...remember when faction actually meant something and it was hard as hell to get spells, items, etc., not to mention finding safe zones to level in (there also use to be an XP penalty for hybrids)?<br />
<br />
  So long as SoE keeps the warrior's taunt where it is and/or improves upon it, there shouldn't be a big difference even if warriors were no better tanks then SK or pally's.  Also, warriors have about 1K more base HP and better def. caps then we do that I would not suggest changing much if at all...so even if we did get the exact same /disc def. (not a proponent of this) that warriors have they would still hold a slight advantage over us, though I would be happy with any upgrade ATM.<br />
<br />
  Again, if  a warrior's ability to taunt were similar to ours, there should be little gained or lost if our tanking abilities are equal....it would only serve to make us more interchangeable.  After all, when it comes to tanking only aggro and dmg mitigation really mean anything...the other spells and such just add to our DPS and provide some VERY limited group buffs.<br />

Give hybrids some kind of defensive or quick recycle mitigation disc..<br />
My Class balance dream would be..<br />
Wars can take the most hits<br />
Sks cant take as many hits but have more dps<br />
Pals cant take as many hits but have heals, group buffs, and stuns to help them take less damage<br />
<br />
So on raids wars make the best raid mts and knights can effectively offtank trash without being 1 rounded.<br />
<br />
But right now in the high end it is..<br />
Wars tank<br />
Knights are very very shitty dps classes.. Well at least on raids we can fd and laugh at all the dead people!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u237"><b>derakolwtf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p237">well culdahl, i wouldnt pidgeonhole warriors as being so easy to play and knights being difficult......... honestly with a little common sense( which alot lack) both classes are equally easy to play. You make a new point each time which clearly isnt thought out........ Try to work with the system.... We understand you think we should tank damn near close to warriors... BUT the fact is that it doesnt fit into the game and would fuck warriors completely over! Consider the other classes when you make your suggestions pleace.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u238"><b>Culdahl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p238">I don't believe warriors would be obsolete if they were just given some sort of niche in this game just as pally's and SK's have (see the arena forum under the thread &quot;sigh&quot;).  Also, I don't feel that I'm the one bouncing around here....there are many that say we should get a form of /disc def (but still be lesser tanks to warrios) and there are those who think that our DPS is irrelevant and should not match a warriors.  So we should have less DPS AND tanking ability? So why not just do away with the class all together then?<br />
<br />
  The problem isn't our ability to tank or our ability to DPS, it's a problem with the hybrid tank classes in general.  The other hybrid (ranjas) do their primary role as well as any other class plus they are quite adept at their other skills (skills that prove to be needed in this game time and time again).  Knights do NOT do their primary roles as well as others and their secondary roles are a minor help at best (how many SK's get picked up solely for their ability to pull or &lt;laugh&gt; buff..wouldn't you rather have the DPS of a monk, ranja, etc. or CC of a bard?).  We need to balance all tank classes to be able to do their primary roles equally and give each class a niche to call their own.  It's not my fault that warriors are a boring single-minded class...let them B*tch and get some skill of use, don't dumb my toon down on their account!<br />
