<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">We do view you as a viable tank class, just not as good as warriors.  That is why we are adjusting the content, so you CAN tank.  If we did not want you to tank, why would be adjusting the content to allow you to do so?<br />
 <br />
I believe that even warriors think the current content is too difficult.  It was not intended that only the best tanks of the three tanking classes could do it, and even then, only with the assistance of multiple healers.  You should not have to have 2 clerics and a warrior to complete any of the trials. But the problem extends beyond the trials.   Warriors should not be the only viable tank in Gates and that is what we are trying to fix through the content because it is a content problem. <br />
 <br />
Now as to all of the other concerns I have seen tossed about, as I have said, the team is considering them.  Things that are broken or don't make sense will still be fixed.  All I am attempting to clarify for Knight classes, is that we will not make changes at the expense of warriors and their unique abilities.  So keep the suggestions and comments coming and I will continue to pass them along and let's see if we can get through this together.  <br />
 <br />
Thanks all,<br />
 <br />
Brenlo<br />
 <br />
 <br />
Has God been balanced since the fixes went in ?<br />
 <br />
The area's I am interested in is Tipt, Kodtaz single group named and Ikkiniz single group trials.<br />
 <br />
Please post your success in these areas or lack of sucess.  Include your ac/hp and the group make up.  Please limit this to first hand experience only.<br />
 <br />
I really am not interested if your 7k hp unbuffed sk friend tanked Jhiru with one healer and all the kt bosses too unless he can come here and post for himself.<br />
 <br />
I want to know is can we do what Brenlo has posted we should be able to do.  Where are we at with this now?  Do we need further adjustment to content?  Do we need riposte parry disk?  Or are we just fine?<br />
 <br />
Please make sure to inclued Magelo links so we can see what level of gear is needed to be successful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>scpio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">tipts final named still not doable with my level of gear just a tad shy of 8k unbuffed and 10.6 fully buffed 2.2k AC. the rest of tipt is fine but having a 2nd healer makes it better. with a riposte disc it would be doable.<br />
<br />
however its not just the tanks who have a problem, only clerics with decent mana pools and mana regen can heal fast enough and keep pace. any cleric who relys only on CH will be dead fast.<br />
<br />
I have done ikky trifates as a back up tank, but there is no way i could MT.<br />
<br />
Wont even bother trying to tank KT named not worth the hassle unless there is a mess of healers.<br />
<br />
all GOD content before tipt is however fine for everyday pick up fun. yard trash is soloable, named can be a pain. (NOT in vxed mind you).<br />
<br />
the last time they &quot;fixed tipt&quot; so warriors could not defensive they didnt change the use of riposte discs. thus warriors now just ripo/ then fellstrike i, even then some warriors want 2 healers just in case.<br />
<br />
so the answer is imho no they did not fix it yet.<br />
further looking back on this from moveing from a low population server to a higher one i really dont see why KT needs to be so brutal to get into. sure lower geared folks will get smeared but they can form mini raids for fun in there. we all know the real candy land is qvic and they wont get in there any time soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Very interesting cause your geared way beyond the tipt level.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Everything was easy up to Kyv Heartstrike Jhiru. We killed the named with a combination of me tanking, enchanter pet tanking and cleric dieing in the first 3 seconds. Was kinda a mess but Necro lived through this so we could get the flaggs for all that needed the flagg. And i was still alive at the end of this mess :)<br />
<br />
I wouldnt call this a true tanking from my side, but under specific circumstances we are enough tank to get this trial done.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Okay.  Up until 2 - 3 weeks ago, I had not set foot in GoD other than on release day (stuck to Natimbi/Absymal at the time).<br />
<br />
I, and the small guild I am a member of, are not VT/Elemental/Time geared or flagged.  Basically, we are &quot;LDoN geared&quot;.  We're pretty much as good as we can get without raiding with other guilds or going on pickup flaggings, etc.  Our guild has no warriors nor paladins.<br />
<br />
We started doing sewer trials and mtn trials and currently most of us are flagged for all sewers and Vxed.  We're stalled on Tipt.  Actually, to be honest we haven't really tried Jhiru yet.  We more or less have not been able to make it all the way to him due to time restrictions or usually somehow wipe before that point -- or get sidetracked on other named.<br />
<br />
I have 6100 hp, 1650 ac unbuffed, 780 aa's.  Raid buffed I hit about 8900 hp and 1775 ac (1900-ish with Aura of Pain) but TYPICALLY for these trials, I run 8300 hp (no Fo7/BSS).  Group is ALWAYS made up of:<br />
<br />
65 Shadowknight (780 aa) - me<br />
65 Rogue (500 aa)<br />
65 Enchanter (650 aa)<br />
65 Cleric (350 aa)<br />
65 Cleric (150 aa)<br />
<br />
Because I need 2 clerics (Vxed/Tipt) and we need cc, that leaves only one slot open for:<br />
<br />
65 Ranger (300 aa)<br />
65 Ranger (250 aa)<br />
65 Beastlord (250 aa)<br />
65 Druid (475 aa) - me, if I have to<br />
65 Cleric (190 aa) - me, if I have to<br />
<br />
2/3rds of our failures/wipes are because the enc or cleric dies on an add or multipull.  1/3rd of the time it's because the clerics can't keep me up or I take a bad damage spike.  Thus far we do not use ranger WS nor charmed pets, I have been [trying to] tanking all mobs.  Because our clerics are not elem+ geared, the mana pool averages ~4400; although thier ft is good, generally 12 - 15 ft on them.  I can't imagine healing with my druid (with full healing adept, etc.) at this stage of the game, for enough or for fast enough.<br />
<br />
Most mobs and named encountered so far, excluding Jihru which we haven't tried, tax the clerics to the utmost.  One lagout or slow heal and I'm dead, followed shortly by the rest of the group.  As things are, I can't imagine trying Jhiru without resorting to tricks (ranger WS or pet charming) or without going outside the guild for help, which we refuse to do.  We probably will try WS/Charm eventually, but for now our flagging and advancement has stopped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Duck_72</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">9350 raid buffed, 1700 AC.<br />
<br />
I have tanked Tipt (druid and cleric healer all the way, and a hasted pet for final boss, with Bard pulling with deftdance and debuff). I have tanked Vxed np. I have tanked one of the Kyv mini named in KT with a druid and cleric spam healing me, but a DI saved me once, and I finally fell at 11%, but they finished him off NP.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: magelo has not been updated since the last patch so is pretty outdated now</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Thaln V'Orro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Calling it a content problem is bullshit.  Good try Brenlo, but you get a fucking F.  I have tanked tipt including Jihru on my friends warrior twice now with 1 cleric.  He is 8064 Hp unbuffed and 417 aas, had about 10.6k with buffs and ~1800 ac.  Up till Jihru its not even an issue, and Jihru was only a marginal pain in the ass.  Its not a content issue.  Its a balance issue.  I myself am only 6k unbuffed and 1626 ac and wont be trying to tank it anytime soon, otherwise I would come here with parses to prove it. :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ikkinz trials seem fine although I haven't done them for a bit, tri-fates was way too easy when I did it (can do the entire thing minus boss without any healer at all), I'm not geared THAT far beyond the content.<br />
<br />
Vxed/Tipt looked ok to me except maybe Jhiru, I understand hes the bottleneck but still, while 1 cleric chaining HL can keep me alive for up to 2 minutes (with a good divine arb and DI) or so thats the only thing the healer can do which means a second healer is needed for rampage basically.  The ironic thing is I tanked Jhiru BETTER before his revamp.<br />
<br />
Kod'Taz I don't spend enough time in to get a good opinion, from what I've seen the trash is alright but I haven't killed a single named there to comment on it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I had hoped to move to GoD as soon as I finished my LDoN ac augs and my defensive AAs.  Now it sounds like I'm going to hit a wall there pretty quickly :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">When I'm tanking, it's spikes that do me in.  Sometimes I can go 10 seconds without taking a single hit (i.e. CH hits and does 0 heal) or Shroud of Chaos keeps up or ToI tops me off -- and other times a 3.75 sec heal which started after the last CH hit will not land on me on time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Don't use CH past your first heal, thats your problem.  Respawn in Tipt is pretty slow now, you have time for your cleric to use SL/HL to keep you up.  If you use CH snare the mob on inc, and have CH started somewhere in that time, the CH will hit and heal you for probally 4-5k or so, maybe less if it's slowed before the mob gets to you.  Festering is one of your best friends for hard content, although I think the tactics with it suck to have to use.  If your heal is going to be late just back out of the fight and kite the mob for a sec while its snared, it sucks to do but it keeps you alive.</div></div><hr />

Look on the birght side in a short time you will be lvl 70 once oow come out.  YOu should then be easily able to tank what klotar is doing.<br />
<br />
I may be wrong but lvl difference between you and the mob is one of the most important factor in dertermining damage mitigation and avoidance.  Plus you will have more hps with 5 more lvls.<br />
<br />
My guild is really planning on hitting GOD hardcore we get the new lvl caps. <br />

Maybe i am an optimist but i hope what I belive is true.  I am currently a 8k sk only needing id 4 and 5 to finish my defensive aa's<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Skoggel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">When I'm tanking, it's spikes that do me in.  <br />
<br />
I've only done tipt a handful of times, generally around 6500ish hp and maybe 1625ish ac unbuffed. Still, I'd have to agree with Klotar here for much of the problem.<br />
<br />
At that gear level, it's roughly where an elem knight should be, a bit lower perhaps, and I figure that's about the right time to be doing tipt/vxed... and, by and large I could do tipt at that point. Easily, if snare lands on inc, or a bard puller has them bardslowed on inc. Even the mobs in the last two areas or so weren't usually that bad, but it's about here I'd notice problems with spikes.<br />
<br />
I remember my last time through, we had one berserker (and I don't mean the class...) ra`tuk absolutely destroy me, was disgusting. Apparently slow was being resisted, but slow resists happen, and I really should be able to tank an unslowed mob with the cleric going full blast, druid probably was helping heal too. Not so. Group was fine mainly due to charmed pet, but that's not the point here.<br />
<br />
Rezzed up and buffed up, waited a bit, then back on track.. next mob does the same with much the same result.<br />
<br />
Mobs after that? Trivial. It's just really really spiky.<br />
<br />
I don't have experience with Jhiru past beyond one time meeting him, but for what it's worth the one time I did, I tanked him from 40%ish down (which granted is barely any time at all with a hasted pooka on him.) It was easy, not ever really close to dying. My conclusion? I got lucky. But if tanks 2k hp and 350 ac above me still can't tank him halfway reliably, it seems the spread of Jhiru's output is huge depending on something as simple as the random number generator... which ultimately is the issue at hand here.<br />
<br />
Spiky dps is &quot;good&quot; for the game, as much as I hate it, even in tier3+ PoP... keeps healing interesting and such, but I think past a point it's just too spiky to be good. If it requires knights to be well well well overgeared to compensate, then it's definitely a bad thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Maicom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I've tanked, what I consider to be, a lot of GoD content(for my guild's level)<br />
<br />
1) vxed nameds: 1 HL cleric, no charm pet, no problem<br />
2) tipt cragbeast aug: same as above<br />
3) jhiru: only successfully tanked(no deaths, no WS/furious tanks, just me from start to finish) 3 times with just 1 healer. For that to work I need charm pet DPS, and DI generally fires.<br />
4) KT named(hynid howler/cragbeast rager): they aren't cakewalks, but MUCH better success rate than jhiru. I still ask for a CHA buff/DI for these guys though.<br />
5) Ikkinz loot droppers(pixtt annihilator/rav interceptor/etc): Seemed a little tougher than the KT named, still not as bad as jhiru imo... usually bring 1 cleric and at least a druid.<br />
6) DD: close to having this one under my belt.<br />
<br />
<br />
I really think a WS/furious disc would go a long ways towards helping us out on these nameds. That, along with some small tweaks(warriors going to di*.1, knights to di*.05, or somethin like that) would make me happy.</div></div><hr />

I have been in GoD since the begining when my old guild pushed to KT immediatley. I have given up tanking Jhiru, it is easier to blow the dust off an alt VT equipped warrior who has no problem under the same circumnstances. That is the problem, I play my SK every day but have to drag a lame warrior box around due to the current balance of the content. Yes I have tried tanking various named myself with 2 even 3 healers, and enchanter slow (which if it doesn't land spells disaster), but the success rate is so poor it seems hardly worth the effort.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Maicom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">the issue with tipt's success rate is that the trial can take so long.<br />
<br />
you can do it in under 30 minutes if you bend the rule's a bit, then, even if you wipe, its not a big deal.<br />
<br />
Also, I wouldn't say that the bar is set to high on tipt, my guild has only killed fennin, we aren't rolling in EP gear, and I've tanked jhiru several times with just 1 cleric(to be fair, the above log does have a shaman healing me, and a chanter rune'ing me). KT drop's stuff with type 8 slots, that seems to be a clear indication to me that its meant to be at least a time-level zone.<br />
I agree there is currently a problem where lesser-geared warriors have an easier time with jhiru, cause they have furious where knights have nothing nearly as potent to help them survive. 9khp does not seem to unreasonable an expectation for knights to get to to get access to the equivalent of entry-level time loot.<br />

Sure now with GoD loot and augs there are many knights well over 9K. Those that were at 9K before had farmed the hell out of Time. Althought GoD is the next expansion in progression it is not reasonable to expect knights to have all of the best Time drops to stand a fair chance at tanking the nameds - that is what we are talking about really, not people's individual feats/achievements but how the content effects the knight class in general. I haven't done much in KT recently as i have been flagging friends and alts, but I will revisit that and see if it has changed from my rememberance.</div></div><hr />

I am on Cazic Thule and there are zero 9k unbuffed sk's.  I don't think there are any 9k unbuffed pally's either</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Noctix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Eqrankings reports 41 SKs over 9k, many of which are obviously fake.  There are only FIVE authentic SK profiles over 9k.  Serverwide.</div></div><hr />

Additionally there are those that have never bothered putting their magelo's on in the first place so the number is greater - also lots of people don't have authentic magelo's because they simply don't want to pay for the service.<br />
<br />
Prior to the database wipe I wasn't even in the top 20 sk's on Veeshan for hit points, but now I am in the top 10 so their are lots of missing magelo's and I don't think they were all fake (some may have been).</div></div><hr />

<br />
If the 'ignore defensive' is their solution to bosses in instanced trial groups, they should make defensive ignored on *all* nameds in any 1-group instanced zone and tune the mobs accordingly.<br />
<br />
I've rampaged tanked Jhiru fine, and judging from the hits I was taking then, and the parse on my warrior friend that tanked him, I believe I could MT him (assuming at least a cleric and a druid healer) and that he's pretty close to where he should be.  Any easier and it'll become way too easy when level 70 rolls around.<br />
<br />
Vxed was never a big balance issue as there is no boss, although some of the named still hurt pretty bad without multiple healers (like the trickster).  Warriors are still much better off on this due to defensive.<br />
<br />
Haven't attempted any KT nameds yet so I can't comment on that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Kemora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">My thoughts:<br />
<br />
(1) Jhuru is still a little too rough, I've tanked him and won with two clerics.. but I've also gotten owned and died. I'm sitting at 7.7 unbuffed and around 2k ac, imho overgeared for tipt. Contrast to our guild's best warrior who buffs up to like 11.8k (~1k more then me)) and around 2400ac, and it's a joke. Even without defensive one cleric has no problem tanking Jhuru. The main problem I have is he'll sooner or late spike twice in a row, and i'll go splat. I haven't tried tanking him since I got shielding, though I imagine that is going to make a huge difference.<br />
<br />
(2) Ikkinz trials are a complete and total joke now. They are easier then random crap in Kod'Taz. I can tank all three of the loot named (Annihlator, Rav, and Spiritsilverer) with one cleric chain HLing me and while I come close to dying, it usually can't actually finish me off. The trash is a sad shadow of what it was pre-revamp. I guess I'd say if anything, Ikkinz is too easy. I haven't tried Diabolic Destroyer since we won around a month and a half ago, but Twin Struggles and Tri-Fates are completely gimp (using a warrior, anyways). I haven't tried tanking either myself, but i'd wager a guess Twin Strugglers would still probably beat me up pretty bad, and the cleric would oom on tri-fates before a guy died ;)<br />
<br />
The problem I see with the &quot;content&quot; revamp is it gimped a lot of things simply due to defensive. A knight simply cannot compare to a similiarly geared warrior on Ikk 2 and 3. Sick bastard that I am, I enjoyed the pre-revamp Ikkinz trials. I still enjoy them now, but the challenge has mostly vanished.<br />
<br />
The biggest problem, imho, is Knights have no way of mitigating damage in the short term. The other night we got to the twins in uqua, and not really knowing what to expect we lost our MA at like 90% - I was next up in aggro, and while I'm sure if the healers had time to actually target me, and heal, I could of probably survived tanking... by the time they /assist the mob, and start to HL me.. I'm already dead. I refer to knights as &quot;speedbumps&quot; over guild, because in GoD thats about all we are :p<br />
<br />
Take my comments for what you will ;p I think there's still serious problems with Knight vs Warrior tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Maicom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">i'd agree with the statement that ikkinz is to easy(at least trash). I hardly ever see a yellow con, that place is pally heaven.</div></div><hr />

Theres a big stone wall, there, for most, and from where I am sitting its Vxed and Tipt.  Nice to know you need to rely on the forbearance of a Warrior to get past.<br />
<br />
In order to be a viable tank from Vxed and up as a shadowknight, its looking like you need to have time level gear.<br />
<br />
I group with a non-elemental warrior, with 10K hps (buffed), and shitty AC, and he tanks in Vxed.  Not joke easily, but he tanks, and with defensive up its a joke.  I can't even pretend to be a tank there *shrug*.  <br />
<br />
SO, in order to compete with him (not even elemental level) and be a tank there, I have to:<br />
<br />
A) join a large guild, get PooP flags, get elemental (prolly toss in a few Vex Thal pieces)<br />
<br />
B) get into and farm time <br />
<br />
C) complete 300 more LDoN missions for some good augs<br />
<br />
<br />
Content issue?<br />
<br />
Two things: is this content made for only time+ people?  If so, then why/how can a non elemental warrior tank there successfully?<br />
<br />
And if it is content meant for such people , myself included, and they water it down some more, where does that warrior class sit then?   Still miles above.<br />
<br />
its not a content issue, give SKs and Pals the tools they need to function there, and not just the top 2 percent.   Theres a hell of a lot more warriors that function well there than that.<br />
<br />
I've had a lot of comparison time in Vxed lately to watch this, so my two cents.<br />

Well, I'd say &quot;sort of&quot;. I think Ikkinz raids (and to a lesser extent primals) are ment to be run next to time. Without level 70, I think an elemental guild would have an extremely hard time with Ikk7, and Uqua would probably be just impossible.<br />
<br />
I guess my thought is, Vxed is spot on perfect. Jhuru needs to spike less, but his average DPS is fine. In all honesty if you have problems with Jhuru, you're going to have just as many problems with named in KT (and Ikkinz) for the most part.<br />
<br />
Only SoE knows exactly where KT access is aimed. Thier tweaking points it at ~time level, to me though.</div></div><hr />

My guild has only just become elemental and so I'm nowhere near rdy for god yet, I've been in a total of 2 sewer trials which were both unsuccesful, I didn't tank in either and was only invited out of pure desperation to fill the spot and my partner is a cleric. But if thats how it is so be it I guess...<br />
<br />
But what really annoys me is every other non knight class at my level or even a bit less (especially if caster) are able to go to god and even do much higher then sewer just fine and be an asset to the group...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Yslaath-RZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I think we tank well enough for any single group stuff now (Ikkinz, Tipt, KT named etc. etc.), my main concern is with our role/usefullness tanking at raids.  <br />
<br />
     I don't think we should tank as well as warriors on the boss mobs at raids but we should be a viable, though much less effective alternative.  Currently were not even viable because we dont even last 2 seconds on something that hits for more than 2k, or anything that flurries. <br />
<br />
      I think what we need most is some sort of skill or disc that allows us to survive a transition.  Something like a riposte disc, a 10 second long defensive ..  whatever, it doesnt really matter as long as it gives people time to start healing us.  The tradeoff is itll cost the raid 2 or 3 times as much mana or whatever to keep us healed, and well be more likely to die to a lucky round of hits by a mob.  Warriors still remain the far superior tank.<br />
<br />
     Again as far as the group stuff goes I think were fine.  I never had trouble tanking any group killable mobs other than the pre-nerf ikkinz trial bosses, and those are a complete joke now.   If you have at least 7500 hps and 2k ac (about what i had at the start of GoD) you can tank the stuff too.  If you dont have that much, you obviously havent followed the game progression much, and arent ready for vxed, tipt, KT, ikkinz.  These are end game zones and should be difficult for anyone that isnt PoTime geared.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
A question, and this Quote also is to the point:<br />
<br />
&quot;But what really annoys me is every other non knight class at my level or even a bit less (especially if caster) are able to go to god and even do much higher then sewer just fine and be an asset to the group...&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
So how, if these are end-game zones, is that pre-elemental warrior functioning perfectly well in them?  Not to mention many other classes.<br />
<br />
And if they can, are these end-game zones? Speaking of Tipt and Vxed here, no experience beyond those yet.<br />
<br />
If they are, then I make the case that class balance regarding SKs is way off, and making it a &quot;content issue&quot; is bullshit.<br />
<br />
If they aren't end game zones, then why is it only the very best of the best geared SK's can function there?<br />
<br />
Something is stinky.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong.  I can tag along and pull for my group, I can contribute a bit of DPS, I can coat-tail a warrior, or I can drag along a couple extra healers, and I can GO there.<br />
<br />
But I am not functioning in my primary task, which is tanking.<br />
<br />
Isn't it?  <br />
<br />
Not an attack on Yslaath, or saying nay to the fact that these MAY be end game zones.  Just some logical (I hope), questions.<br />

It is ridiculous that knights do not have the tanking functionality to perform in those trials except when time geared, and on a larger scale it illustrates the tanking disparity between knights and warriors.  It also demonstrates the disparity of our group functionality(SK vs Pally vs War).  The simple fact that Brenlo and whatever other developer has failed to look into this, has failed to test it, is downright ridiculous.</div></div><hr />

Unless someone else has some good data if your time geared 7.7 hp or more and 2.1 ac or more you can tank Ikkiniz, Tipt, and KT nameds with no problem and one healer or healer and patch healer.<br />
<br />

If you want to tank Ikkinz, Tipt, and KT, you better be Time geared.  Pretty much every other class does not have this requirement.  A VT necro or wizzy, for example, will do just fine in these groups.  Warriors don't have this requirement either.  This is a very clear disparity.<br />
<br />
We can't tank raid mobs as well as warriors, we can't handle single group content nearly as well as warriors, and our primary role is to tank.  I think it's a problem when we're clearly underpowered in our primary role.</div></div><hr />

Not sure I would say performing better than, as much as able to participate in the same. I'm sure not doing as well as Time SK's on trash mobs.<br />
<br />
But as long as you can handle the content, it really does not matter how you do on it. Even if you are slow on trash, but can live though the named, you can participate in the content.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Look at what the previous poster said about getting out his Pre-elemental warrior for the hard mobs. /shrug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Sounds fixed to me. :) Pre-elemental Warriors performing as well as Time level SK's. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Hasn't this disparity always been in place?  Just the content brought it out more.<br />
<br />
Unless there are some more posts to show otherwise I would have to say that the content changes have done there job.<br />
<br />
SK's are in the same situation that they were before we need more gear then other classes to do the same content.<br />
<br />
This has always been true.<br />
<br />
I really don't see a way to change this without making the content trivial or making us as good a tanks as warriors.<br />
<br />
So I guess soe's vision is realllly sk as the offensive tank.  Not able to take as much damage as a paladin or warrior but able to deal more damage and slow and cripple there opponent.<br />
<br />
<br />
Shadowknights are unholy warriors who use fear, pain and disease to attack all that is good in the world. Shadowknights are primarily a melee class, able to wear plate armor and wield many kinds of weapons.<br />
<br />
Shadowknights are deadly opponents who use evil spells to slow and cripple their enemies. They steal the strength and life from their victims, using this stolen power to strengthen themselves and their allies. When needed, shadowknights use their powerful harm touch ability to greatly damage their opponents.<br />
<br />
Shadowknights can feign the appearance of death, fooling enemies into ignoring them. Combined with spells that degrade an enemy's ability to fight, a shadowknight becomes a fearsome foe.<br />
<br />
Shadowknights can use their dark powers to adventure solo for a time. The shadowknight's lethal abilities are best used, however, with the support of a larger group. Players who like offensive melee fights but want a variety of ways to inflict harm on their opponents will enjoy playing a shadowknight.  <br />
<br />
So if we think SoE is going to make us viable tanks it probably is not the correct course on higher level hard hitting mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Rhumba_Kween</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Hasn't this disparity always been in place? Just the content brought it out more.<br />
<br />
And the content continues to bring it out more. Does that sound fixed.<br />
<br />
Out of curiousity, how much REQUIRED single group content is there, past Ikkinz that Time level SK's cannot take advantage of without a warrior in the group? Or for that matter it does not even need to be required. How much single group content is there past Ikkiniz that offers amazing gear upgrades, that you need a Warrior to help you get?<br />
<br />
I think what you say is fine, as long as there is that required content that Time level SK's cannot participate in. Otherwise, your argument really holds no water, since the disparity only matters at a certain point in the game. And if you are arguing for the disparity to have real consequences at one point, in the game, as long as it does not affect you. Well that would seem a bit hypocritical to me. Although I'm not sure thats what you are saying.<br />
<br />
EDIT: We all remember the Uproar, when Time level SK's could not make it past Jirhru... But now that that progression roadblock is at a different level, it does not matter that there is not parity?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">So basically, lesser-geared knights [than 7.7k hp / 2.1k ac] that squeek by in Vxed/Tipt/KT shouldn't complain?  That's what my take is on this thread... and without one shred of sarcasm nor jabs of any sort at any one -- I think I agree.<br />
<br />
If some of these lower end zones are really aimed at Elem/Time geared peeps... then two healers or not, we should be happy to be squeeking by?<br />
<br />

If we expected the mobs to be tankable with elemental gear or less then we are not following the past precedent of knights needing gear beyond content to do the same job as a warrior tank.<br />
<br />
So we really have nothing to complain about in this area.<br />
<br />
Now if you think that SK's should be able to perform their primary function with gear from current content then we have a different issue.<br />
<br />
I am just saying that it appears the content fixes have done what they were supposed to do.<br />
<br />
Unless someone can post some more information which shows otherwise<br />
<br />
Now the issue is what is our role in this content?  I mean if you guild is doing this content with current content gear and your getting left out because you cannot tank it with elemental level gear like your guilds warrior then what role should we be looking at so we are able to get groups?</div></div><hr />

Certainly not, if you compare it to the requirements placed on other classes.<br />
<br />
If the means test for sucess was for Time level SK's to be able to pass what Pre-Elemental Warriors can pass, then you are right.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They just went with what they have done in the past.<br />
<br />
If it were me doing it I would not have done it this way.  It is far easier for them to do follow what has been done in the past.<br />
<br />
Are SK's really a tank class?  Well we did well in PoP mostly because of our aggro ability and the warriors having issues with aggro.  This made us think we were a tank class when in fact we still had crappy mitigation and hp.<br />
<br />
When I first started tanking in pov this was before the zones were opened it reminded of now.<br />
<br />
I would be able to tank if slow landed fast.  If not I was at the mercy of having a good healer or I was dead multiple times.  I realize I was under geared at the time.  Same thing when I first tried bot winged named.  I had to have the enchanter casting chain rune on me to even do them and a patch healer because it was likely that slow was not going to land.<br />
<br />
This is how I feel now I am barely geared enough for the content.  So the answer is I need to be geared beyond the content which I am not.<br />
<br />
This just follows how things have always been but just seems worse now that we got used to being a tank<br />
<br />
So where does this put us?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Noctix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">So where does this put us?<br />
Up shit creek without a paddle?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Thaln V'Orro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">Needing to be geared beyond current content to function in current content is exactly how we can demonstrate how unbalanced the tank classes are.  If we cannot function in a group or in a raid with gear from our current place in progression that makes us useless and clearly unbalanced.  There are two things that can happen; 1) Balance tanking, but SoE would have to stop listening to warriors and their spin &quot;look at your spellbook&quot; crap and do some actual internal testing, or 2) Give us other ways to successfully function in a group that would make us attractive and useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">Up shit creek without a paddle?<br />
<br />
Maybe, maybe not.  Maybe we need to stop looking at what we want to do tank, and look at improving other areas more.  <br />
<br />
I really love to tank and that is my perference but I really don't want to be stuck in old content so I guess I made the wrong choice making an SK.  That was my bad.<br />
<br />
But if we look at our class description which and try to improve on that I think we would have more success.<br />
<br />
It would seem to indicate we are an offensive melee class capable of infliction of pain upon our enemies, slowing and crippling and weaking them. It also indicates we can inflict large amounts of damage in spurts.<br />
<br />
So maybe a way to strengthen those areas is the answer.  SoE has already said warriors will always be better tanks, defensives is a class defining ability which will not be shared, and that classes will not be balanced against each other.<br />
<br />
We were told avoid disc looked promising but that was in april.  Where is it?<br />
<br />
So it seems likely that we are pushing them in an area they are reluctant to go and making ourselves feel useless at the same time because we are trying to measure up to a class that we are not meant to measure up to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Daerkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">I agree to some extent that the content of GoD has been fixed ( I don't think any of the groupable named need to be lowered in ease really), but the difficulty lies in the unbalance of discs between the classes. Sure a decently geared sk can tank the trash well in Tipt, but a ranger (or any defensive disc class) far outperforms him on Jhiru if the group has high dps, and certainly everytime if a pet is used (which lets be honest is how most people pump toons through Tipt). So I guess I think it comes back to knights lacking some method of short term improved damage mitigation (disc/stun/spell) - being unable to reliably tank for 30 seconds is definately a class specific weakness.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>cames</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">Inferna,<br />
<br />
In general, I agree with what you have to say.  However, its this one piece of the balance missing.<br />
<br />
I am a group leader looking for a tank:<br />
<br />
1 - I choose a warrior because he is the hardiest tank.  His skills give him the ability to absorb the most damage.<br />
<br />
2 - I choose a paladin because he controls aggro better than the warrior.  He requires more healing, BUT can use LoH, Stuns, heals and the group spell Brells to help the group.  He can also rezz in a pinch.<br />
<br />
3 - I choose a shadowknight because he controls aggro better than the warrior.  He requires more healing, BUT.....<br />
<br />
<br />
Okay, what I am looking for is the balancing BUT that makes us as desireable in trading off.  I had a group in the Vxed trials say they could crank out more DPS with me tanking, but that would be the same for a Pally.<br />
<br />
So, for guildees who know how well (or not well) I play my class this is not an issue.  What I am looking for is the THING that SKs bring to the party that people feel is as valuable as what pallys bring.<br />
<br />
It does not suprise/concern me that I need more and better gear to tank as well as a warrior.  What I am looking for is a group benefit to offset it.  Better aggro control was a great answer in PoP because of the disparity.  Now that this disparity is lessened, I am looking for that thing.  Necro Rezz might be it.  A defensive skill that is better than paladins (and less than warriors) might be it.  But there is my view.<br />
<br />
This is completely separate from Raids.  Given my guild, I have plenty to do on raids and require no changes at this time.</div></div><hr />

Our tanking needs to be fixed; give us the same DI-1 or stun type ability, give us tools to tank named, and close the gap on HP gear ( mainly a complaint when comparing non-raider war &amp; knight; gear alone gives the war a big advantage in HP ).

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">So basically, lesser-geared knights [than 7.7k hp / 2.1k ac] that squeek by in Vxed/Tipt/KT shouldn't complain?  That's what my take is on this thread... and without one shred of sarcasm nor jabs of any sort at any one -- I think I agree.<br />
<br />
If some of these lower end zones are really aimed at Elem/Time geared peeps... then two healers or not, we should be happy to be squeeking by?<br />
<br />
Not sure whether to feel good or bad about it... heheh.<br />
<br />
I think this is a good attitude to take. If you are a skilled enough player to be able to do content that is probably above your gear level, then you should probably be happy.<br />
<br />
Is it fair that a bazaar/LDoN knight has access to all the zones that someone who did not skip a dozen or more raids zones has access to? Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.<br />
<br />
As far as our role, the deeper the content I experience in Gates, the more I am needed in my raid. In fact there are encounters that cannot be done without knghts.<br />
<br />
Instead of harping on an avoidance discipline, we should focus on being the supreme add tanks, and push for a spell like Brael is proposing, the discipline I proposed, or one of the similar ideas put forward by a few others.<br />
<br />
For what it's worth, I feel the content is fixed. Vxed trash was a bit rough last time I did it (over a month ago), but may have been fixed since then.</div></div><hr />

I agree, so long as it is possible for this to happen.  It sounds like maybe it is now but I'm not sure, there isn't a very good sampling here of non-raiding/undergeared SKs.<br />

Personally, I like Brael's idea better than an avoidance discipline.  However, SOE devs generally only fix things if the fix is easy or if there is a HUGE public outcry.  An avoidance disc will be easier to get just because it has already been coded for other classes.</div></div><hr />

I don't see the Calliav idea being harder to code than an avoidance disc, and in fact it might be easier for them to get a handle on because it is a spell.  It's not like the spell is a new idea, it already exists for pets, it would just seem to be a matter of giving SKs a spell with the same effect.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Zero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">9025/1925 buffed. ( edit: yes I have all defensive aa ) I can not tank Jhiru in all circumstances I have tried. Cleric+druid spamming everything they have on me, with DI, = dead. Cleric + shaman spamming + chanter pet = dead. Ranger+warrior+cleric = win!.<br />
<br />
<br />
The logic that we are fine because we can tank these things if we just gear a bit more for them is pure and utter bullshit. <br />
<br />
If you are a pre-ep Sk and you can't do sewers named without multiple healers, a warrior, or an enchanter pet or non-tank class using discs, then you are screwed. EVERYONE ELSE in your guild/group/whatever is going to be able to progress fine in pre-ep gear with a warrior tanking. You will have to be a LEACH, or wait until your guild hits EP and you get better gear to go with a real group.<br />
<br />
If you are a EP sk, you will not be able to tank Jhiru in any normal group. Your most likely going to need at least 2 healers, and a charm pet. And even then the odds are very rough. The same level group with a warrior and much less pressure on classes (no need for a charm pet, and just one cleric) will succeed much easier. So again, you have a choice. Be a leach or wait until your guild hits Time to go through with a real group.<br />
<br />
If you think that shit is acceptable you honestly need to be castrated. You should not be allowed to reproduce, and all existing children should be quarantined to make sure the stupidity they could have inherited from you doesn't show up in them.<br />
<br />
It is NOT right that Sk's are the ONLY CLASS that needs to have a very special, inconvenient group make-up - OR wait until they are better geared to be able to progress through early GoD content.<br />
<br />
It is not acceptable that we have to gear more, we should be able to tank Tipt, Vxed, Sewers, KT, Ikkinz, etc. etc. at THE SAME LEVEL WARRIORS CAN.<br />
<br />
I am not saying we should be equal tanks to warriors, that would be stupid. I'm saying that a SK and a War in equal stages of progression should be able to accomplish the same things, with the same relative ease. Sk's won't tank as well as warriors, but perhaps the added mana regeneration to the group makes things go faster, or perhaps their dps, etc. etc. The small things we have should be relative to the small gap there is between sk and warrior tanking. It should be, SK tanking+sk &quot;utility&quot; = Warrior tanking. But it is not. Instead, its Sk tanking + Sk &quot;utility&quot; = bullshit. Warrior tanking = win.<br />
<br />
I exp tank for KT fine, just a cleric healing. Hynid named, for example, I do fine on with cleric and a patch healer, no DI, and if not 1 cleric + di is a reasonable success chance.<br />
<br />
If the retards that call themself developers refuse to put SK's where we need to be, at the very very least, something needs to be done about Jhiru.<br />
<br />
(Jhiru is much harder than KT named, which doesn't make sense)</div></div><hr />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>Oberyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">&quot;I really love to tank and that is my preference but I really don't want to be stuck in old content so I guess I made the wrong choice making an SK. That was my bad.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
and yet you come to the conclusion that the content must be balanced,<br />
<br />
IF WE ARE GIVEN A NEW ROLE.  I'm sorry, but that isn't balanced.<br />
<br />
<br />
To re-iterate: If the SK cannot tank (always the primary role) and our role in a group has changed, then SoE needs to give us a new one.  Or balance for the old role.  Its pretty fucking simple.<br />
<br />
Silviir's point about pushing towards being the supreme add tank (and many others over the last while) is spot on IMHO.<br />
<br />
I would LOVE to be able to grab that add in Vxed or Tipt, and save the chanter or cleric or shaman, and tank it until someone gets things under control again:  its what i've been stellar at up till now.  I can do it by snaring and running around like a druid, but that irks me.<br />
<br />
This requires that I be able to TANK said trash mob in the first place, either through /disc, or pure mitigation/avoidance somehow.<br />
<br />
If there were a second bazaar geared warrior in the group, he could tank said add for a short while.<br />
<br />
This is my objection.  Why should I need time+ gear to compete with a bazaar warrior?<br />
<br />
<br />
Oberyn<br />
<br />
PS: I am finding it immensely amusing that GoD was touted so heavily as the new casual's path to advancement.  Requiring time level gear to advance as a casual is interesting, to say the least:)<br />
 <br />
To rely on the goodwill of a warrior is distasteful, to say the least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>Manslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">The casual progression stuff was largely referring to the stuff available in sewers/barindu/riwwi/ferubi etc.<br />
<br />
And I think she just means its been set to an old standard, not necessarily one that people agree with as being good.<br />
<br />
I've done tipt with 1 cleric as healer, also Ikkinz isn't terribly hard with the exception of the 2nd trial.  The 2 named are aren't flagged as defensive immune and are still much, much easier for a second warrior to tank than having a warrior and a knight or 2 knights tanking.<br />
<br />
KT named are easier than Jhiru is if you don't have a pooka, but seem harder largely due to not having a charm pet I think.<br />
<br />
I don't have any gear from beyond Ikkinz, though I will admit I have most the available gear to that point.  Generally with AC tap and tribute I am in the 2600AC, 11.5khp range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>scpio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">eh i still dont see why KT needs to be so hard to get to. ive been there for months and ya its got neat loot but not spectacular. nothing that id camp for months on end to get. ya it can allow a guy to get to ikky raids and time level loot. big deal. in POP a guy could get some loot that was VT level gear doing BOT tactics and sol ros tower minis. <br />
I just dont see the need to block it even with the fear of it being another BOT. its a large zone lots of room for lots of folks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">Ok glad I got the discussion rolling now.  Yes I was not saying that I agree with what SoE did but as Manslayer said they used their old standard of adjusting the content for Knights of needing to be geared beyond the content.<br />
<br />
Realistically Tipt should be doable with elemental gear and it is for everyone but Knights.  Can you pass it without time gear?  Sure you can. But I didnt tank Jhiru.  Well that was before the nerf when I did it but the Ranger did ws, the pet added dps and my HT about finished him off by the time he was down to 20 percent that was the part I tanked.<br />
<br />
Now the first time I tried him prenerf I was dead in like 4 seconds that was with two healers.  And I tried to just straight up tank him I was like close to 10k hp at that time and close to 2k ac.<br />
<br />
Now I am around 10.6 with good buffs and gl aa. And 2100 ac buffed.<br />
<br />
But still when I tank the hynid howler or cragbeast ranger if I just have a cleric in the group I will have the ranger or monk ws tank till slowed.<br />
<br />
Other wise I still get my ass handed to me unless I kite him around till slowed.  And I do a lot of kite tanking which I think is dumb even on the way up to jhiru and some of the KT mobs.<br />
<br />
Now in Ikkniz the only time I ever got anyone to even take me there I tanked the Pixxt thing in Trial one to try to get the named with only a cleric healing.  I did it but my DI fired. (no ring and lost the roll on the earring)<br />
<br />
So if people want to fight to change the status quo then we should do it but if we are looking if this is fixed or not then maybe it is and maybe it isn't depending on what level of gear you have.<br />
<br />
The problem is that I don't see SoE coming arouind to another point of view unless your really willing to put the heat to the fire.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>Oberyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">...I see for SKs to &quot;put the heat to the fire&quot; is by doing just this.<br />

Being as vocal about our issues as possible.  Tough with a small population.<br />
<br />
Also tough when that small population can't even agree on what it wants.<br />
<br />
Even more tough when a vocal handful of extremely well geared people think that because they can do something sometimes, things are balanced. <br />
<br />
Top Ten list and Brael are a good start to getting at least SOME attention.<br />
<br />
The task is made more difficult by the fact that the SoE SK boards really bite, and I have to grit my teeth when I go there and read.<br />

<br />
I will play an SK as far as my unguilded, single-group loving self can take the character *shrug*.  Atm thats looking like Tipt and MAYBE Kodtaz, IF I leech off a warrior for tanking purposes.  <br />
<br />
A good SK is versatile enough to make themselves a role, but the options are getting more and more limited, as we lose ground in relation to other classes.  Theres only so many roles in a six person group.<br />

i think a little more tweaking needs to be done to fix the (overwhelming, there should be a difference between knights and warriors, just not to the extent that it was when GoD first came out, and to a lesser extent still is) tanking disparity in 1-group content:<br />
remove defensive from warrior's toolset for these mobs - Jhiru/DD are nice examples of where this seems to have worked. Some WS/furious-esque disc would be nice for us if this is the path SoE wants to take.</div></div><hr />

Trials being a very hard part of progression initially is a normal thing - all of the PoP trailblazers should remember how long PoJ trials held people back. (esp. those that hadn't done VT, etc. at the time)<br />

The radical disparity in classes shouldn't exist, sure - but to expect a win with a dramatically undergeared SK (compared to the &quot;hints&quot; KT+ drops give to whom the devs think should be there) is ridiculous.</div></div><hr />

I've tanked it successfully many times with one healer. One cleric chaining light kept me up for jhiru but we were also using a chanter pet. Just need to have a competant healer. If your not using a chanter pet you may want to bring 2 healers. GoD is no place for idiots that dont know how to play everquest.<br />
<br />
Ikkinz<br />
Ikkinz trials are not hard to tank. Again the issue is making sure everyone in your group knows how to play and work together. Competant healers make all the difference here. I was rocking ikkinz trials with a good cleric then he had to log. We replaced him with another cleric and I was dieing constantly. It was like 50/50 as to weither she would be able to keep me up for named or not.<br />
<br />
KT<br />
No problem with the kt xp trash. I've tanked a ton of nameds hunting for my spells using my hydra cleric or another healer. If theres 2 healers in grp staying alive on named is usually np, but I always DI first. If we only have 1 healer then 3 out of 5 times I'll wind up dieing but those nameds have low hp so I ht right off the bat and hope they get unlucky swings. DI fires and Darb is used somewhere. After that I just have to hope that the heals can keep me up till its HP runs out. Always save your HT for nameds if you only have 1 healer. It can mean winning or losing.<br />
<br />
Kod'Taz and beyond was intended for time equipped players. I don't think they should gimp god content anymore. If you can't handle it in its current state then you probably dont belong there in the first place.<br />

Balance one: classes versus mobs &lt;---- this seems ok to me.  People are passing through the zones at least, and the zones are supposed to be tough.<br />
How tough, I don't know, not being a developer.<br />
<br />
Balance two: Class versus class in this same content &lt;---- personally I believe this is off, and my main reason is that it takes a massively overgeared SK to do that SKs main task, which is tank.  In RELATION to the other class that can do the job, and must be the yardstick, the Warrior.  <br />
<br />
Where is the logic in that one must have gear far better than the content you are doing, to do that content?  It is not required by any other class, to my knowledge, except knights.  This is mainly because most other classes don't have to sit in front of GoD mobs to do their main job:P<br />
<br />
This level of gear is not required by a warrior, to tank there. A non-elemental warrior can seek and get meaningful upgrades in GoD content current to him.  I know, I group with one.<br />
<br />
This is, and should be, the focus of our anger and what we should seek to have changed, somehow.  Balance between the classes is off, not GoD content.  If you nerf the mobs, that Warrior then becomes a god (no pun intended:P)<br />
<br />
Since people in time gear aren't having many problems tanking, and (I am guessing) don't usually group with people of much lesser gear than they have in GOD, this problem might not be so apparent to them, leading them to believe all is well.<br />

<br />
today we know that as good as KT is and it is good its not great, further even if you can get into KT it wont assure you enough to make your &quot;that much better&quot;.Ikky trials are not that hard save ikky 4 which is kinda annoying. it overall is comparable to the upgrade from VT to POP level 3 BOT tactics sol ro gear. though overall itemization in GOD is really quirky.<br />

at this point id almost belive its worth it to lower the content more, except that those who had to do the hard version will be screaming mad - it was annoying as hell. thus SOE cant get it right or wrong. pretty much like when SOE had to open up more planes in POP.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u85"><b>Daerkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p85">Did a comparison last night, two runs on Tipt then over to KT to farm some named, as I hadn't returned to KT since last patch. Jhiru is substantially harder than the KT named I felt. Mostly due to the spikey dps, but also his resistance to slow (no problem getting KT named slowed so far). It does somewhat depend on the group, in Tipt I had ungodly chanter pet for dps, so tanking is a 'see if you can stay up for 23 seconds' challenge (which is why any kind of short duration disc would put knights on equal footing here to Rangers etc). KT is straight up tanking but again very low HP on named. The KT seem right for the zone, I think Jhiru is still pretty damn hard and is a roadblock for most.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u86"><b>Skoggel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p86">Did tipt again recently trying to get guildmates flagged, and a question came up to me.<br />
<br />
Regarding Jhiru, what hp/ac do you folks think is needed to tank Jhiru *WITHOUT* a charmed, hasted enc pet?<br />
<br />
We were making pretty good time in tipt. Tanking here is really easy with a hasted enc pet mowing down mobs, with the pet I only had one close call where a ra`tuk nearly three-rounded me much too fast. Got to about 5 mobs left before Jhiru, when thanks to wonderful tipt buggy magic, our charmed pet warped to spawn (I believe it had something to do with a mob dotting the pet, charm breaking, then enc mezzing - I saw the &quot;ra`tuk decimator's corpse has awakened a flinty cragbeast&quot; or whatever message then *poof*)<br />
<br />
So we were at the safe room before Jhiru, no pet, nearest possible pet between ghosts and cragbeast matriarch.<br />
<br />
Aside from the many possible ways to get a pet halfway through tipt (tried a bunch, but coding there seems to make it hard to find a way to do this... mob wouldn't even follow me with a dot on him more than a room + half a hall apart :() I was wondering, doubtfully, if I stood any shot at tanking Jhiru long enough for the group to kill him with a cleric and druid blast healing. We did have a ranger for WS, but after that it basically woulda been me + wizard + trueshot ranger doing dps... vs cleric + druid healing abilities to keep me up during that time.<br />
<br />
So I guess.. at what point is an enchanter *not* necessary to beat tipt, for a knight tanking? I'm nearly maxed out on elem loot now, and it seems very doubtful to me in the event of a spike, and without a charmed pet Jhiru fight is gonna go a lot longer than I'd feel comfortable with Jhiru stabbing my eyes out brutally.<br />

Ultimately, though, scpio seems right - I think they're just waiting for OoW to fix balance problems in GoD. Jhiru won't be such a monster when he's dark blue, and I'd imagine elem geared knights can do just fine even without a charmed pet getting to him. Though have fun getting elem geared when floods of people get elem flagged once they're level 70 too. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u87"><b>Akronis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p87">I have tried doing Jhiru several times now to no avail. Last attempt I was just shy of 11k, and around 2300 AC with bard. I do fine on the whole plow and the first named. Bard pulled Jhiru with dispell, faded, repulled with slow and it landed on incoming and deftdanced rampage. I died in 22 seconds with a druid chaining SI and a cleric chaining SL on me. Unfortunately the cleric didn't have DI or div arb (go go alts), but Jhiru was only at 74% when I died anyways so I'm not sure if it would have made a difference. The druid was fairly well geared/AA'd. So even if they had been able to keep me up there still would have to be another healer to keep the bard up on rampage once deftdance dropped. Maybe I just have horrible luck or something, I'm not sure. I parsed Jhiru at 1389 DPS on me.<br />
<br />
I've heard a rumor but have not yet found anyone able to confirm it that if you fight him EXACTLY on top of his spawn point his dps is a lot lower... all the times I have done Tipt, which is probably close to 40 times seeing Jhiru as a mixture of botting different classes, we have cleared the right side of his room and pulled him to there. Almost every time I've been there with a warrior we have won. Anyone know any merit to this rumor? I know if you pull him outside the gate he hits sickeningly hard, but is his damage output directly related to his distance from his spawn point?<br />
<br />
KT nameds I seem to do alright on, sometimes the ixt ones get a little messy with all the pets they spawn but the rest are generally not too bad. I haven't done any Ikkinz nameds yet because unfortunately I have been unable to prove myself to my guild on GoD nameds so nobody takes a SK for them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess what I am saying is that unless I see some more data to see otherwise the content adjustments have done their job.<br />
<br />
If we expected the mobs to be tankable with elemental gear or less then we are not following the past precedent of knights needing gear beyond content to do the same job as a warrior tank.<br />
<br />
So we really have nothing to complain about in this area.<br />
<br />
Now if you think that SK's should be able to perform their primary function with gear from current content then we have a different issue.<br />
<br />
I am just saying that it appears the content fixes have done what they were supposed to do.<br />
<br />
Unless someone can post some more information which shows otherwise<br />
<br />
Now the issue is what is our role in this content?  I mean if you guild is doing this content with current content gear and your getting left out because you cannot tank it with elemental level gear like your guilds warrior then what role should we be looking at so we are able to get groups?<br />
<br />
Knights have always needed to be overgeared to tank raid bosses and the like - we've never needed to be overgeared for single group content, let alone single-group content that was required for progression, nor have we needed to be overgeared for offtanking (with a few exceptions like flurry drakes).  Tanking raid bosses isn't our primary role (at least going by the assumption that our self-created niche constitues our role) so it's logical that we would need to be overgeared to do so, just like a monk or even enchanter can tank a raid mob if sufficiently overgeared.  <br />
<br />
We havn't traditionally needed to be overgeared for offtanking or for tanking in groups though - that's new.  Were you VT geared when you offtanked for Emp Ssra?  Were you Tier3 geared when you tanked your PoJ trials?  Of course not - that's all a recent development.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The content adjustements have done their job in terms of fixing content - I'll give you that.  The content is right where it should be for the most part, IMO.  The problem, most would agree, however, is the classes.  For example, when it comes to non-raiding progression, when on almost any message board, someone suggests GoD content, it's fine and dandy and fisable.  Basically everyone except knights can take advantage of GoD as a great source of non-raiding progression.  For a knight though, I have to preface that statement with &quot;if you can make the perfect group of friends to bring you along&quot; or something to the effect thereof in order to suggest GoD content for such players.  GoD should be no problem for someone like Klotar, and for someone similar of any non-knight class, it isn't a problem at all.  A warrior, cleric, rogue, necro, take your pick in equivilant gear to Klotar would be just fine in GoD, but as he's stated, Klotar's tanking ability has been a roadblock for GoD progression.  That's fucked up.  <br />
<br />
<br />
I guess saying it's not a content problem isn't entirely accurate.  It's somewhat a content problem.  The game has developed, in terms of content, in such a way that knights' traditional value has been margainalized and their shortcommings exacerbated; this, combined with a knights' loosing ground relative to other classes, has left us inadequate.  For example, the tradeoff of stronger snap aggro vs. better tanking isn't even a consideration when the &quot;better tanking&quot; is required for your tank to merely survive; the fact that warriors gained significant ground on our snap aggro is a separate issue.  In that way, it is a content issue - the greater challenge of GoD content has dicked us over.  When you get down to it, though, the content is/should be fine; every other class operates fine with the content as-is.  More accurately, content didn't become a problem, bur rather it ceased to mask an existing class problem.  This, combined with an increase in the severity of said class problem has put knights in a bit of a spot.  <br />
<br />
To act as if the melee upgrades had never gone in; knight snap aggro relative to the aggro generated by DPS classes never got worse; etc. (I.E. knights didn't loose any ground relative to other classes):  Basically, content has margainalized our strengths and exacerbated our weaknesses.  It has also gotten more powerful relative to players, making our lack of scalability more significant.  What may not have been a problem in weaker content now is,  but the question is, &quot;is that the fault of the content, or the class?&quot;  I'd say it's a class problem, which was previously masked by content.  <br />
<br />
<br />
To those saying &quot;GoD is endgame - you should 'follow progression' and do PoTime first:&quot;  <br />
Aside from the fact that there has always been overlap between the expansions (and that's a good thing), you don't need to &quot;do PoTime first&quot; if your anything but a knight.  It's not OK to be the only class who can't function in content at a given level of progression.  When you're in a VT guild who's doing GoD stuff, you shouldn't be the only one (along with pallys) who's left behind; likewise for someone like Klotar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u101"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p101">Maybe, maybe not.  Maybe we need to stop looking at what we want to do tank, and look at improving other areas more.  <br />
<br />
I really love to tank and that is my perference but I really don't want to be stuck in old content so I guess I made the wrong choice making an SK.  That was my bad.<br />
<br />
But if we look at our class description which and try to improve on that I think we would have more success.<br />
<br />
It would seem to indicate we are an offensive melee class capable of infliction of pain upon our enemies, slowing and crippling and weaking them. It also indicates we can inflict large amounts of damage in spurts.<br />
<br />
So maybe a way to strengthen those areas is the answer.  SoE has already said warriors will always be better tanks, defensives is a class defining ability which will not be shared, and that classes will not be balanced against each other.<br />
<br />
We were told avoid disc looked promising but that was in april.  Where is it?<br />
<br />
So it seems likely that we are pushing them in an area they are reluctant to go and making ourselves feel useless at the same time because we are trying to measure up to a class that we are not meant to measure up to.<br />
<br />
Well, I'm pulling a newtank and posting back-to-back, so bitch at me if you will, but I'm still catching up from being on holiday for 12 days... I hate doing this, and I hate posting without finishing a thread, but basically, 'it had to be done.'  :eek:<br />
<br />
<br />
1) The class description you're referring to is from... kunark? and is a shitty attempt at some sort of role-play based description of the class.  It has never been very accurate, nor has it ever really held any water with anyone other than Battleblade.  <br />
<br />
2) SOE may have said we wouldn't get defensive, but a) we're not asking for Defensive (TM) and b) they also said there would never be weapons with a ration better than 1:1.  <br />
<br />
3) We've always been tanks and always been treated as tanks; it's best for the game that we continue being tanks.  Until we have a damned good reason to believe we're not tanks (I.E. forthcoming class definitioins), we have every reason to believe we are, at least in theory, tanks.</div></div><hr />

This was prenerf.  I have not tried him since the nerf.  But I think its would still be a problem to tank him with one healer and no pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u105"><b>Envoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p105">i have approx same AC and hp as Inferna and i cannot straight up tank Jhiru without two healers (cle/cle or cle/dru)<br />

even then with two healers it can become sketchy without a charm pet.<br />

Tipt = Teh Suck.  i have 23 wins now, and 5x as many losses.  Pushing people thru this trial is rediculous.   <br />
<br />
<br />
now, the best part:  Ikkinz Single group named.   Are they some kind of joke?  I seriously dont forsee myself EVER being able to tank Diabolic destroyer, two healers or not.  I do however think i would possible tank the named in twin struggles ok.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u106"><b>Moonslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p106">Why can't you tank DD? I have tanked her for about 50% of her HP and my clerics said they think they coulda kept me up for a full kill. Ikkinz named such as Rav, Hexxt, and Pixtt are all jokes to tank with two healers, and my gear is average for my progression status (Time / Uqua).<br />
<br />
But, two clerics with Holy Light more or less doing a controlled spam isn't quite the same as a rotation on a defensive tank, so kind of hard to compare the two. It doesn't have much to do with the tank if you're over 10k, defensive or not, it's all on the healers from what I've found. Maybe others have different experiences /shrug.</div></div><hr />

except that the other day, my ranger friend was farmin trials for named. Rav interceptor was up, and they did him with:<br />
warrior<br />
pally<br />
shaman<br />
ranger<br />
wiz<br />
rogue<br />
<br />
<br />
and they won with the pally and shaman spamming the warrior. none of them were uber, had like 3 quarm kills under their belt. Either defensive shouldn't be able to be used on *any* single-group content, or knight's need some rebalancing to compensate.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u108"><b>cames</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p108">Well, to depress everyone I have an anecdote from last night.<br />
<br />
Was doing some random questings with my LFG tag up and got a tell from a cleric wanting to do Tipt.  He asked me my HPs and said close enough come on.  So, I get there and wait for the others to arrive.  <br />
<br />
Eventually when the rest of the group gets there, they decide to add a Warrior and have me pull.  Whatever, I don't care.  Except I know this Warrior, I have more HPs and he is an idiot.  Shrug, as long as I get xp (the guy is an idiot but a nice guy).<br />
<br />
The Warrior goes LD on his way and the group asks me to clear some while we are waiting for him to come back.  I clear to just passed the first corner pulling and tanking while waiting for him.  Warrior arrives finally and we move in.<br />
<br />
On my first pull (its Tipt so its a solo), this warrior dies and I have to finish tanking it.  Our chanter had trouble slowing so the healers are low mana and we are starting to have repops behind us (remember I precleared).  So, we evac to the zl to start fresh (its only like 5 - 6 mobs), med up and go again.  As we are medding, Warrior takes an AFK.  When he comes back, he informs the group he has to leave.  He does so.<br />
<br />
Here is the kicker.  The group breaks up because we can't find a tank.  Even though I have been tanking right along.<br />
<br />
Bleh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u109"><b>Daerkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p109">Ok I have been doing named for a week in KT now for a change of pace. I often am boxing a group of 5, dropping toons as friends come online. Cleric, bard, wiz, enc, and me. If HT is up and slow lands on inc I seem to have good success with cleric chaining HL, HT gives me enough initial aggro that wizard can chain nuke and named low hp usually means fight is over in couple of rounds. Pixxt Annihilator raped me though, but I suspect with a second healer he is doable also with my level of hp/ac and good dps. <br />
<br />
It is still frustrating to be from a Time guild and watch warriors tanking this shit that are not even elemental flagged yet. The good news is that they pass many augs as they have no equipment that can take type 8.</div></div><hr />

Bingo. I've been able to tank mobs perfectly fine all the way through god, provided I survive the initial 2k-3k flurries/quads before the slow/heal hits. If there was some way to mitigate this, things would be just lovely.</div></div><hr />
