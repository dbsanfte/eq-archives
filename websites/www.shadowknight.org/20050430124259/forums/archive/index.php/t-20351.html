<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rurrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">im at one of those mid levels, its hard for me to find a group and everything i solo kicks my butt, im lvl 28 on E'ci plz help meh!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Putrid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">At 28 you can find groups in the overthere.  I soloed crocs in upper guk in ancient croc room, they are easy single pulls, just make sure they are snared or they will swim away.   Probably can also start doing some soloing of snow cougars in eastern wastes.  You can probably also take on orc miners in crystal caverns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ramgar SK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Also try Dawnshroud and LDoN for groups.  If you can get an Invis or good faction, Highkeep basement is great for grouping.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'd stay away from Crystal Caverns until level 30 when you get Feign Death. Corpse runs can be a pain there. <br />
<br />
You might be able to fear kite Gnolls in South Karana or Aviaks, maybe even find a few more people while there and move into splitpaw for some good xp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rurrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">dont have Ldon =/ &amp; i did high keep from 22 - 28, it was slow for the most part, but i guess ill stay there and keep at it</div></div><hr />

  Go work the temples outside Cazic until 30, then head to Splitpaw.  Learn to FD on the two sets of pairs inside the entrance.<br />
  By 32, you can do almost the entire front, up to the double doors, before respawn, depending on gear.  That's around 8-10 mobs.  At 32, as a troll, i'm getting 2% per kill for dk blues, 3% for the occasional white, and around half a percent for the occasional lt blues.<br />
   I do better  for xp soloing here than I normally do being mid level on a 28-35 hard adventure.  Besides, every single group I've been in for LDoN has had a stinking pally....  which means either I let them tank, or I waste bunches of mana taking agro from em...  nobody I've ran into wants an SK puller in LDoN if they have a pally in the group.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rurrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">got to 30 fine in highkeep but was incredibly slow xp as soon as i dinged, even pulling reds &amp; yellows, im about to log on and try for a group in dsp, hopefully by the end of march i can get ldon ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>naediil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">a tad late  probally for this but In DSP the shroom hut is great exp from 3 to about 37ish or so and the zelnaks  in that area and there is no adds from wolfs and such if you are on the left side of the hut if your facing the zone border,<br />
<br />
sorry at work atm and cant remeber if it is north south east or west  after that the tribals in DS are nice also by the Greigs end zone and then the ones by the ME zoneline  by then yu can do DL and or my favorite spot Sol b</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>nezzka is bad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">you could get a group doing tribals by griegs end, i solod them from 30-37 but i use to have kei back then and would tap all my life back while it slowly walked away, anyways decent exp, and play on a pvp server e'ci is the suck of all the servers :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>gromrot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I just dinged level 30 myself and I've been soloing in Echo Caverns on the Fungus Grove side.  I've stuck to the Needlite room mostly.  I have been soloing there since about level 24.  You can single pull basically the entire room except for the 2 in the back right corner.  The respawn is pretty slow, but it's very easy to keep it to single pulls there.  The only tough fight I ever had was when the Needlite Queen would spawn, but was still doable.  I would just try and save my HT for when she spawned.  Only once did she pop twice in a row.  I was getting around 2% exp per kill there.  Not sure how it will be now that I hit 30, but now with FD I can try doing the area's with the mutants and boglings as well.  The drops there have been decent for some cash too.  The wings and legs have sold for around 2pp a piece and the dagger the queen drops sold for about 18pp.  <br />
<br />
Probably late info, but hopefully it's some help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ghorz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Another way to get from 28 to 30 are the brutes in the caves near Dalnir in Warsliks Woods.<br />
<br />
Not only do they have excellent loot (lot of gems), now there are some wandering spawns added, so that you are not stuck with only 5 mobs, but 7 or 8, what really is enough for that level.<br />
<br />
You can start hunting there as early as 24, btw.<br />
I went there from 24 to 30 and made around 800p (selling gems, words and earrings with charisma steins to put me slightly over 100 cha).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>NorrynNoir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">ghorz, brutes assist each other now. that great xp spot died when that patch went in. he'll need FD before he can pull them and by then the xp there would suck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ghorz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I hunted there with my shadowknight on FV the last two evenings. :)<br />
No assisting. Only if you come very, very close to another brute while fighting (happened to me only twice in my way from 24 to 30). But if you pull a bit, you should be safe. I also noticed, that the pathing was majorly improved. No more disappearing into the walls.<br />
Just the wandering ones were a surprise first, but there are a couple of safe spots, where you can meditate in peace.</div></div><hr />
