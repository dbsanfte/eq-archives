<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ziglug D</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all, I jus got back from a 4 month EQ break...<br />
<br />
I noticed when LFG that there are hardly EVER any groups around my level, and hardly any are in Adventures, where is everyone at? I dont think they are in OOW, and if they are, I have that...But where is a good place to get some great exp and get an easy pickup group?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cruelchef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Been wondering my self....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ziglug D</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">yeah, I try PoV but there are usually only like 12 people...and I may get a tell for a adv group in somewhere like NRO every few hours, but thats prety much it, it also seems as the adv camps are empty...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Velnarin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Have you tried Grieg's End?  I get tells for pickups there quite a bit.  I think that's the current 55-60 hotzone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ziglug D</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">yeah I tanked there the first day of my return, I got a tell soon as I went LFG, I havent had any more tells for there, but tehre is always a group or two crawlin in there, it is quite fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>TelimTor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've been in GE for a week straight, awesome xp there.  Usually 2-3 groups working it too.  Just have to move in deeper as you get closer to 60.</div></div><hr />
