<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shintou Shinai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wondering, any casual non elemental sks were able to beat the Murkglider breeder. Helll, also wondering if any Elemental geared SKs are able to beat the Murkglider Breeder and get on with the epic?<br />
<br />
Time geared and above I really don't care about, they'll just say its easy and it will throw me off (Like it did already, tried to go in with about a group and a half and the damn breeder expressed its ownership)<br />
<br />
Just wondering, thats all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ianthe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">When these were tested in beta they were meant for 3-4 groups of pre-elemental people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>kharan_zechts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Casual gamers should be able to kill the breeder. It may take more then one group however, depending on players skill and gear. If you can get the 6 adds spawned away from the group before pulling then its not so bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Iosif_McCloud</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I know some top notch ppl that got Owned by the breeder.. it's not so much the Equipment as the Experiance...  there are 2 way to do him the first is Brute force.. 2-3 groups including 2 Clerics, 2 ENc's, 1 Shammy, 1 Warrior some DPS and have at it... the Other is to use some unorthdox Tactics none of witch i have tried Personly but i have hurd some limted sucess with clering the Ajoing room past him then pulling him in there and training him around till the Adds pop then Evacing to Zin and Running back in invis and killing him .. Aparently his adds are not linked.. This has been reported to work on the Safehouse boards... <br />
<br />
My Guild Leader played with him some and even for a single group of Time+ people it's a rough encounter to just take on Head to Head... It is Doable with Solid 2-3 groups of EP people...  940's Max hit.. would give him a 700~750 avrage hit on a EP Tank at L65 thats about same as a LDoN Hard named... only diffrance is LDoN Hard named you never fight with 6 Adds... <br />
<br />
Dont let the fact that he drops an item you want throw you off your game... If you fail try again , you'll know more then you did befor ... if you dont wanna risk loseing take a raid there... bit over kill i think but some people are in to over kill...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>kharan_zechts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">its all about the tactics. Just agro him and click your cos then run for the zone while he chases you down and spawns adds. You do not have to clear the other room and kite him there. Have a tracker check if 6 murkglider spawns have popped. If yes then go kill him if not then train him out again. I one grouped him pretty easy after doing this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>omac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have tried Breeder 6 different times.<br />
<br />
 The first 3 times it was with a group.  We wiped.  We did learn the pathing and habits of the Breeder and that his spawns stay where they spawn, they do not return to chamber.  The last 3 times I tried was with a raid force of 3 groups which snowballed to almost 5 by the last attempt.  Again we wiped.  <br />
<br />
  Our mistake on the last 3 tries was that I was tanking, and not a Warrior.  Even with 9300HPs I was not able to tank the Breeder long enough to gain agro before the healers died.  <br />
<br />
  When you do the Breeder bring a warrior along for the ride, it will make things a lot easier.<br />
<br />
  One last tidbit:  On our last attempt Phos (67 SK) ran the Breeder out of the room away from raid to pop the adds.  He got like 4 to spawn before he died, and when he died the Breeder warped back to the room.  The Breeder did not warp to his spawn point, but to the point just inside the room that was closest to where he was outside.  I hope this helps.<br />
<br />
 Phaed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Thaln V'Orro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I did breeder with 2 groups of Elem geared people.  We took our time to train him out and spawn all 6 adds, then pulled him solo, and it was still a tough fight. 940 max hit is deceiving because his DPS is very high,  at 9880 hp and 2023 ac I was getting beat down with a cleric and druid healing me.  If you arent top notch, bring as many friends as you can find, this guy is no push over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shintou Shinai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yeah, remember.. his max hit may be 940, but he is quadding. Potentially he can put down 3760 points of damage per roundd, and thats not counting his murk glider buddies<br />
<br />
Also, thanks for the replies, I'll keep trying and tweaking at it till the bastard dies, good to know that I wasn't the only SK whiping over and over on this loser.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Xanathol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Don't forget, he and his adds flurry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>The Zenogias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Almost got him the other night but we failed for a pretty much dumb reason.<br />
Tonight though, I know exactly how i'm going to handle her and the adds and I am confident I can do this with 2 groups minimum with only a scarce amount of elmental armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Hoppen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The way i did the Breeder:<br />
<br />
Ran invis to the hallway right before his room, cleared everything there and in the room he was in.<br />
Then the group invised, a bard pulled him, kited him to trigger the 6 adds,<br />
then he faded (noone saw invis).<br />
The 6 adds where standing outside in the start of the tunnel, while the Murkglider Breeder was roaming back alone.<br />
Then we engaged him and killed him :)<br />
<br />
Group was: me(70 sk), 70 bard, 70 rogue, and a 66 cleric.<br />
<br />
Breeder hits for 897 max and Flurries (flurried 21 times in 3 mins)<br />
<br />
This was before the last patch and he dropped the egg  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>frotty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Everyone is so proud with their &quot;getting the breeder to spawn the adds&quot; strats that they neglect to mention the firepower needed for it, and how easily it can catch a group offguard the first few times they try it.<br />
<br />
Fine, do whatcha gotta do to get the spawns out of the way.<br />
<br />
the two methods are: <br />
<br />
1. aggro it, keep it aggroed till it craps them all out.<br />
2. aggro it, feign, reaggro, feign, etc. until all are crapped out. <br />
<br />
There are 6 total.<br />
<br />
Getting him solo is easy.<br />
<br />
But, it hits fastish. Low-time geared and under, without coordinated heals the healers might run out of mana as the thing has really high AC, and is very resistant to spells at 66. I would recommend melee DPS (rangers, monks, rogues) over spellbased.<br />
<br />
We had a near 11k paladin tank, two 9500 sks, another SK, chanter, two druids, cleric, and one or two spell based DPS. The spell DPS was actually rather low, and the paladin had dropped alongside one of the SKs. The fight ended with most all of the people present low on mana and health.<br />
<br />
I would have to agree that 3 groups+ would cinch it if you're pretime/ele.<br />
<br />
Basically its a pretty good exp camp. The murks drop tradeskill augs, and the other named that pops behind the breeder spawn can drop 68 runes and a few attunables that are only a bit below ele level.<br />
<br />
So, that's the main incentive to get a single group there. It's solid, steady EXP, about a yellow in 2 or so hours at 66. When the breeder pops, call in the troops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tilelyanea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">hey shintou  if you ever need help with this jsut send me a tell, i know we have differed in the past but i'd like to see someone get this on our server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Moardok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I have been camping this camp on an off for about a week for about 2-4 hours each time. A single group can post up at the end of tunnel (the  end with breeder ) and just clear that whole room an a lil ways into the far hallway pretty easily im not time geared but i got decent stuff im at lvl 68 an can tank them no real problem.<br />
<br />
The other Named (Deathstinger) is not hard either, have killed him tons of times but i cant get breeder to spawn for shit. It is pretty tuff to get folks to come out there even when you tell them there are Runes an decent  Loot, Xp they know RC is a Epic quest mob area.<br />
<br />
I have helped a Sk kill the breeder once. It was the first time i had ever went to scout the Mob an i Zone in an they were at ZL preparing.  Had 2 groups we invised in set up in the end of the tunnel with breeder an single pulled it takeing the Adds toe to toe an we got sloughtered, regrouped an added another group an went back did the same thing an won.<br />
<br />
I plan on single Grouping this mob..or atleast trying it with what ever group i am in when it spawns...ill use the Train tactic to nuetrilize the adds an then hopefully have Mage in group to coth an everytime i have gone out to camp it i have had mage...so in my head if i can get the breeder back to my group alone an all its spawns spit out before i bring it to group i think its a definite possability that i can get my egg with just single group an im a casual player , if i can just get the bastard to spawn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Iosif_McCloud</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">A SK friend of mine went after Breeder last week said the Adds started repoping again mid fight.. ~2mins in to the fight....<br />
<br />
He said thay cleared the hall / room .. Had bard pull away / fade he pulled Breeder solo  since thay are a Low PoP guild it was taking them a bit to kill and the adds started repoping about 2mins in to the fight...<br />
<br />
Adds not that hard to deal with if you got 2 ENC's and a Bard.. Bard can play Backup mezzer and intial debuff wile ENC's mezz</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>grinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">&quot;I plan on single Grouping this mob&quot;<br />
<br />
if your not time+ then dont even bother trying with 1 group.<br />
<br />
it pops new adds after a few mins, and with the DPS from only 1 group you'll probably have to deal with atleast 1 new wave of adds if not 2.<br />
<br />
i rate it the hardest fight, with the final boss 2nd hardest but not by a long way.<br />
<br />
i wouldnt expect to 1 group it without being in a fair amount of time gear though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Elkar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">My guild is pre-elemental, we're a couple mobs away.  We've farmed VT pretty well now.  When I found Breeder up I grabbed a couple groups, including one of our weaker warriors.  I think on the first attempt, we only had 1 add, and the enchanters locked it down pretty well, but agro bounced around and we lost the second cleric and then soon the warrrior.  At probably around 9400hp and 1900AC at the time I ended up tanking with just 1 cleric and some shaman patching.  Chaining CH the cleric kept me up for about 4 or 5 cheals, including two purples, but it's DPS was just too much to keep up with.<br />
<br />
I gathered another couple groups, this time 3 clerics, and luckily because one died on the pull (no idea why, he was my bot just standing  looking at the wall).  Anyway, with those forces, it was very easy.<br />
<br />
So yes, it's doable pre-elemental, but probably 3 groupish, and you need to be sharp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Nasiir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I did it with 2-3 groups, all around ep level (guild has only killed fennin a few times so far), which was plenty. We didn't fight any of the spawn though- why would you?<br />
<br />
Start at the back of the tunnel, clear it forward. Clear Breeder room and roamers. Have someone kite the Breeder around the room until all 6 of the spawn have popped, then run into the forward hall and FD/die. The Breeder alone will path back, then you pull and kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>VengerMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">hmm.<br />
<br />
i killed the Breeder with a single non-Time group, with me as MA and not even in elemental armor.  group was:<br />
<br />
69 SK (me)<br />
66 SK<br />
68 Bard<br />
67 Chanter<br />
66 Cleric<br />
66 Mage<br />
<br />
we set up in the small alcove at the north end of the murkglider area, just before the golem field.  cleared the mob in the alcove and the bard pulled the murks to the group.  we got the Deathsting several times before the Breeder popped.  we gave the zone an /ooc warning and the bard pulled it, running towards the zoneline (the opposite direction from the group's camp).  once all 6 spawns popped, he faded off his aggro and ran back.  single pulled Breeder to the alcove where we engaged and killed it.<br />
<br />
i did not find it difficult to tank at all in terms of its melee DPS.  tanking Vxed trash is about the same.  it does have a large amount of HP, and the AE dot was a real concern given we only had one healer.  Bond of Inruku nicely offsets the dot damage.  we burned her down as fast as possible, using both HT's and as many nukes as possible.  i chain casted Terror without any concern for my personal DPS so that the mage didnt need to fear ganking aggro.<br />
<br />
we did lose the chanter, bard, and mage after the fight to the dot.  the cleric made a minor error by choosing to heal the higher HP SK's before the poor casters.  other than the time it took to actually spawn her, its not all that hard of a fight if you research and prepare well.  the xp was rather good imo, given that we chain pulled murks while we were there.<br />
<br />
i had about 9khp and 1800ac buffed for the encounter, no elemental armor in the group at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Elkar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Wow, Venger, your encounter makes me think I fought a different mob.  I know we weren't sharp during it (too many had very very bad lag that day) and we didn't have a bard, but I found his melee to be heavier than that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>xikraazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I did it with 14 people.<br />
<br />
I trained the breeder away but he only spawned 3 babies.<br />
<br />
So we did the fight with him and mezzed the adds as good as we could.<br />
<br />
We were lvl 60 to 70 - 3 healers 2 mezzers and 3 knights for tanking and DPS<br />
<br />
we had a few deaths but mostly due to mezz breaking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Lynxal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I am surprised you made it...for us the cleric's mana was the problem though we didn't have a bard.  Breeder is much harder than vxed trash and I have higher AC than you.  There is no skill involved in ganking this guy once the spawns are split off and for a straight forward fight I am surprised your experience was so different.<br />
<br />
I killed him with 2 rogues (66, 68), 1 monk (70), 1 warrior (70), 1 SK(me 68), 1 cleric(66), 1 shaman (70), 1 chanter (66), 1 druid (67), 1 necro (67).<br />
<br />
We didn't have anyone die but it wasn't a blow out....to someone watching it probably looked easy, but if that fight went 10% longer it would have finished with 3-4 dead..we were closer than I would have preferred.  I had assumed adding a warrior, druid, rogue, necro would have made it a blow out.  With the first 6 we had it to 40% with the cleric oom.  <br />
<br />
The resists made it tough too...even with malo and decay I couldn't get most of my Necro's DoTs to land so caster DPS was pathetic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Darkmourn D`Estrellas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">As I mentioned in the other thread, we did this fight with our single group (4 players + 2 bots) at level 66.  <br />
<br />
SK (Me)<br />
Shaman (My bot)<br />
Druid<br />
Cleric (her bot)<br />
Rogue<br />
Bard<br />
<br />
Magelo's for four of us are at the bottom, and they have improved by several items since that fight.  None of us has a single item from Time or KT.  All VT/Elem/Tipt level stuff at best.  As you will see from the magelo's, it's not like we are outclassing most people on this board.<br />
<br />
Fight was very similar to how Venger described it, except I was the one that trained the adds away and died the second time from babies warping on me.  With rez time and such, we never had any of the babies respawn on us during the fight, which took awhile.<br />
<br />
While it certainly was not an easy fight, Fraga, Souldrainer, and Ukun Fleshhunter all put far more of a beat down on me than Breeder did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Lynxal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">While it certainly was not an easy fight, Fraga, Souldrainer, and Ukun Fleshhunter all put far more of a beat down on me than Breeder did.<br />
<br />
That is amazing....the RNG loved you on the breeder fight.  Souldrainer was cake compared to breeder, and the Ukun fleshhunter hit harder and faster, but we burned him down with no discs way easier than the breeder fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Darkmourn D`Estrellas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">That is amazing....the RNG loved you on the breeder fight.

<br />
Not sure what to say then.  The Breeder fight took a decent amount of time, well more than twice the time of any of those other fights, probably 3 or 4 times as long, so it's not like we burned him down and just got lucky.  Did the warrior tank all of those fights, or you?  Because Souldrainer and Ukun Fleshhunter are nothing but fast heals as fast as the gems pop when I tank, as compared to Breeder where DI never even triggered.  If a warrior tanked Souldrainer or Fleshhunter it would probably be considerably easier (a gripe for another time).  But I would assume the warrior tanked Breeder, and I can't imagine it being that difficult for the group you listed with a warrior tanking.  <br />
<br />
I just can't see a mob like Fleshhunter being easier than the Breeder (minus babies that is) unless a warrior is tanking.  With babies, sure, it's a bitch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>grinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">well both times i've done it [for me and a guildy] we've used a 11000+hp war and 10-11k knights as backup with 1-2 chanters 2-3 healers and various other DPS.<br />
<br />
[generally about 1 and a half groups with bots filling the other spaces up].<br />
<br />
and its not been that easy either time.<br />
<br />
tbh i tanked the final mob longer then i tanked the breeder with about the same amount of people, and the RNG on the final mob is pretty nasty ...150-3702 .<br />
<br />
but i guess some get lucky [ala getting drops in the first 3 kills] and some dont [ala spending 75 hours camping the ME shard for VT key back in the day ;) ]<br />
<br />
i still think i'd stand by &quot;i wouldnt expect to kill it with one group without time gear&quot;.<br />

its the toughest mob in the SK epic 1.5 IMO.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>SoulHunter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Head to City of Dranik. In the southwest area of the zone there is a tunnel system, incuding two rooms, full of murkgliders. In the northernmost room, there is “a murkglider creeper” or “a murkglider swarmer.” If you are lucky, you may find Murkglider Breeder. You need to kill him, doable with a group with the right tactics.  <br />
<br />
so are the &quot; murkglider creeper &quot; or the &quot; murkglider swarmer&quot;  actual PHs for the Breeder?<br />
<br />
do u need to go kill them if they show up on track and not the breeder for him to spawn ?<br />
<br />
or are they just other murks and u kill all the &quot;normal &quot; murks in the southwest portion till he pops in the northern room ?<br />
