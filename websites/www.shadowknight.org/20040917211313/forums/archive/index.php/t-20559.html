<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Voch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well last night I decide to smack 5 points into the first level of this just for the hell of it.  I was killing high guardians near the basement in PoJ boxing my shaman.  Well i fought like 30 high guardians in a row... Blood of Hate, Ignite blood, and festering darkness running on every one.  Now i know its the first level and all but i did not get ONE SINGLE critical... 3 dots times 30 mobs.. 90 dots and no criticals.  Lmao is this shit that bad at the first level or just straight up broke ?  Would hate to spend 10 points on the second level to get maybe one critical every 90 dots or something lol.<br />

<br />
With melee/spell crits ya get a &quot;You deliever a critical blast! (9000)&quot; or whatever..<br />
<br />
With dots that doesnt happen apparently.. Instead, look at the line saying how much your dot does.. something like &quot;Your festering darkness hits %t for 50 damage&quot;.. <br />
With Critical Affliction it'll just put the increased damage in e.g. like &quot;Your festering darkness hits %t for 100 damage&quot;. Once we suggested this to the necro he noticed a crit on his next pull so im guessing they're not all that rare..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Vanek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Also you don't get a normal spell crit message from dot crits, just sometimes the damage message is doubled.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Reflan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have crit dots 3 on my shaman.  Not very ego satisfying to not get a pretty message on your DOTs, but oh well.<br />
<br />
Still nice to have.  And for what it's worth to SK's, I and other shamans I've noticed talking about it DO seem to notice that we get more aggro with crits on our DOTs than we normally did before we had DOT crits AA's.  Enough so that when stacking DOTs on mobs at tables in Plane of Fire, I can occasionally pull aggro off necros who have been running around kiting the mobs with snare for a while and stacking one more DOT than I cast -- and their DOTs are better.  That's a lot of aggro to overcome.  And the crits on my DOTs aren't even very high.<br />
<br />
So ... you'll definitely get a little more DPS and a lot more aggro when you get critical affliction AA's.  Any SK at the point where he's starting to think about putting AA into critical affliction will probably not have been worrying about trying to get more aggro for a long, long time.  It's sorta OK for DPS though.  Don't think I'd put it very high at all on the list for most SK's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Sorry, thats just perception, crits don't give aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Makkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">it is ridiculous, 9% chance for an insane amount of aa with no further progression. for 12 dd'ers get a 7% chance, with fom3 its about 13%, its climbing up towards 20% nowadays<br />
<br />
soe has no love of dot classes, never have, it took years before dots even stacked<br />
<br />
guess thats why i havent played in 2 weeks..that and the ridiculous expansion of GoD, this game is dead and stupid.</div></div><hr />
