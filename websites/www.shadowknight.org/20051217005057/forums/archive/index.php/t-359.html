 <br />
There are various &quot;of Rodcet&quot; people in the forest now-all of which give Bloodsabre faction for killing and down the faction with the &quot;good Qeynos&quot; factions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Saiyen</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 01:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">just kill  &quot;A koalindl&quot; fish next to cleric guild in qeynos these faction hits are quite large</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rabdos</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 01:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only problem with the Koalindl fish, is that it's right smack dab in the middle of the Lifebringers. If you're off on your pathing just a little bit, you'll be jumped by numerous high level paladins and clerics. I'd much rather kill level 5-10 goobers in Nektulos.<br />
I've already got OK faction with Bloodsabres anyway, as a dark elf we start out indifferent, IIRC.</div></div><hr />

<br />
BEST way to raise faction is to kill the Pallie that wanders the back of the pool where the said fish are.<br />
<br />
At lvl 54 in any armor he is cake and green. He is on a fast timer as well like 3 min?  Just kill him in the corner furthest from the &quot;orb&quot; there is a wandering guard that will not agro your in that corner.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you also kill the noobi quest guy who heals you for a few GP, you can invis and kill him at his spawn spot on the floating ramps in the pool area as well as the pallie.<br />

I ran all the way over to Qeynos in my low 30's to whack that fish.  Invis your way in, HT the fish, feign/invis whatever and walk right out.  It was a blast watching the guards running after me on my way out.<br />
<br />
I think that bumped me up to amiable right there.  I didn't do any faction work past that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Skurrge</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 11:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did the fish thing quite a few times and I can now train in the Qeynos catacombs.  Not particularly handy, but it's fun to see the noobs scratching their heads about what an Iksar is doing down there.. heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zenoboinkr</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 11:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">its a lot easier than all that.  At the zone to WK from QH is a tower.  Off to the side is some low level caster type that is out of chain aggro range of the guards in the tower.  find a nice shady spot and tag him with whatever, when he comes over smack him down.  Rinse , repeat for maybe 2-3 hrs.  I was KoS in the sewers, killed this guy for about 2-3 hrs...think he's on a 7 min timer, but not sure how fast...got up to non-KoS and did the sheath.  I was 56 at the time, now sweat.  As an added bonus you can play with tthe various wandering npc's in the area.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Walil</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 01:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Supposedly the lil fishie in the pool can respawn as rodcet knife in fish form. I don't have any first hand info but I heard about it back in the day when people would talk about writing the Stein of Mogguk quest.</div></div><hr />
