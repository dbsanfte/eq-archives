<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Drakang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Okay Enter the hole and proceed down till you see a large drop off and a bridge across to a building.  go to the left and drop down.  <br />
Across from where you drop down is a door.  Go in and to the left.  You will go down a long tunnel with lots of turns and stairs.<br />
At the bottom is a large room with a pool.  Directly across from where you enter is another tunnel going down.<br />
At the bottom you will see a gate into the city.  Go through it and to the left to a pool.<br />
From there you go straight out past what looks like a fallen chunk of ceiling and a bit to the left.  There will be a small doorway into another section.<br />
Just throught the doorway you can go right to a pool, or to the left with an immediate turn to the right.<br />
Just past the turn is another doorway into another section of the city.  If you go straight through that doorway and between the two buildings ahead you will see a building with a broken door on the left. This is the bank.  There is a fake wall through a door back there to steps leading down to the chests that drop the key.</div></div><hr />
