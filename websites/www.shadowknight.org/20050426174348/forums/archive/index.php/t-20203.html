<br />
I'm trying to find out if anyone on these boards either has a mirror that they would be willing to mq to me (I'll gladly donate, of course), or help me kill Drusella in HS.  I've been in there several times but I don't have the master key yet (Hand of Glory).  I know about the lev run to the east wing, read about that on this board.  Just need some more firepower.  =)<br />
<br />
I've got everything else done for Greenmist but this Mirror, so I'm anxious to actually hold in my hands the result of all the time I've put in for this.   Anyway, I'm on the 7th Hammer, please feel free to send me a tell if you can help out.  Thanks!<br />
<br />
Peace.</div></div><hr />
