My question is this - the walktrough talks about the Penkeeper dropping the STONE and COPPER keys.  I have to this point (about 6 hours of camping) seen him drop only the COPPER and IRON keys.  There is no mention in the walkthrough about an Iron key.<br />
<br />
My question is this: Did they replace the STONE key with an IRON key?  Or is ther really 3 keys on the loot table, IRON, COPPER and STONE?  And do I need to just continue being patient? :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just to confirm he does in fact have three keys on his table.  Copper, Iron and Stone.</div></div><hr />
