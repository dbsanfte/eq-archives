<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kelefane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I went through literally 7 hours of hell lastnight trying to kill the Breeder. It was a makeup of 7 people. SK(me),Druid,Cleric,Rogue,Monk,Chanter and a boxed Chanter.  We killed the cave and the PH off for maybe 2 hours. Breeder spawns! Im all happy. Well guess what? The other named spawned at about the same time in which the breeder was spawned. I cant remember the name but it conned yellow to 70 and it was a PITA.  We setup in the cubby, and the Monk would tag the breeder and run it outside and kite it around to shit the adds out and he always ended up dying due to dots ect, seemed like FD failed a large amount of time during this for some god awful reason.  Well, needless to say I didnt kill the breeder and we ended up wiping 5 times, thats right...5 times....The times we got Breeder into the cubby solo the yellow con would WARP into camp and rape everyone. :confused:  I am not sure WTF is going on here, but I lost alot of heart in it after lastnight and 4-5 CR's and knowing the Breeder is still up as im typing this. :( 7 Time geared people having that much trouble. /sigh<br />
<br />
Maybe it was just a bad night w/ alot of badluck involved.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Deathsting was the other named?<br />
<br />
Breeder doesn't return to his spawn as quickly as deathsting, or any other mob in the room.  Thus, he's not hard to split from deathsting.  If he kept warping in on your kills, your monk fucked up.  Warping is really bad in these tunnels, so the puller has to be extra careful there really isn't anything extra aggroed on him.<br />
<br />
You should have been doing the kiting/training with harmshield.  At the speed the mobs run, and the number of mobs in the way, it's pretty much impossible to keep the monk from dieing.<br />
<br />
This camp is a bitch.  The fight basically comes down to pulling/splitting off the spawns and getting breeder single.  If breeder comes single and none of the spawns repop on you mid fight... he becomes a challenging 1 group mob, but something very managable.  Get any of the spawns in camp, or any other mobs, and it gets a lot harder.<br />
<br />
Did it for another SK and got it with 1 group, first try.... then when I returned to do it, I had a similar run of bad luck... like 3 wipes to adds before winning.  Sucks to lose the spawn, but keep trying things and I'm sure you'll get it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Loviaroth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Saying that u tanked your own mob for epic is nice, but bring a warrior, its just easier for them to tank. You the SK should kite the MB away with DS till it spawns the 6 adds. I  would bring a few sk's so we could pull multiple times, since the breeder usualluy wont poop them all out the first run. likly your group will get adds and spawns but its not a big deal, they can drop the respawns while your mini team of shadow knights kite away the breeder, yo should not need more than 2 or 3 times kiting breeder for all adds to spawn. from their only thing you have to do is decide how you want your srambie eggies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kelefane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah, Deathsting was the other named and yeah  :( now that I think about it, I shoulda been the one pulling Breeder w/ HS /sigh....But i was the only tank there and no guild Warriors/Knights were on but me at the time....I woulda thought the Monkey coulda gotten the job done and I suppose he just had some badluck there w/ the pulls :confused:<br />
<br />
<br />
I remember seeing one thing w/ the pulls though....It seemed like Breeder would warp back to his spawn point during various times on these pulls.....Monk died and the Rogue tried to SoS pull him and he popped Escape after kiting Breeder around beyond the cave entrance there in the grass part, well I asked him if he shit the adds out and he said yes and for me to gank him and well, low and behold Breeder had warped back to spawn point when the Rogue popped Escape but all shitlings had been popped (Was most successful pull btw, and by a rogue lolz) So I run down and fear Breeder and he comes to camp solo.....uh uh, Deathsting warps onto us about 90% into Breeders life and rapes the healers and hes unmezzable :( and im wondering why the other named would warp like that? Im not too familiar w/ Rogues but the rogue came back to camp to DPS Breeder, when he dropped escape is there a possibility that Deathsting had aggro on him still?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lynxal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Next time kill Deathsting while the monk kites the Breeder.  <br />
<br />
Even if the monk dies....you have time to let him split as many as he can...die...rogue pulls to cleric...monk gets buffed and pulls again, and even again if he has to, before the adds will be a concern repopping with the Breeder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kelefane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">FINALLY!!!!!! I kill the Breeder w/ 5 people! Took us a bit but we got it down. Killed him in the Cubby, SK,Warr,Cleric,BST,Bard was the group makeup..Lacked DPS but hey, I won it finally :) and I could care less if I EVER go back to that GFD zone again. :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nasiir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">congrats! It definitely can be done with a small number of people, it just requires strategy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">haha congrats!<br />
<br />
If I had to pick, I'd probably say this is the single hardest part of the epic, unless you get very lucky with spawns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Uvaavu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Really shouldn't need to use HS to seperate breeder, even with deathsting up, if you have a Rule #1 btw. Just make sure that you train ALL MOBS from the spawn room and that  you get Breeder OUT of the tunnels before you FD.<br />
<br />
Getting him to your group then is just a matter of someone else tagging when breeder reappears.<br />
<br />
You do need a second tank for that method though (not hard to find) .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kelefane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Bard pulled and made Breeder shit all 6 adds out (Bard is leet btw and one of the best ive seen) and he HS'ed the Breeder back to his spawn point...And I pulled Breeder to cubby solo and Warr AE taunted him off me and it was on...took maybe 5 mins to kill him w/ 5 peeps....He didnt ever shit out anymore adds thank god..That was in the back of my mind the entire time and was pictureing another fail....This was late at night after we had got done raiding PoTime and we all agreed we were just gonna give it one shot before we logged and we won thank god.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>VeyRonZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I could care less if I EVER go back to that GFD zone again. :mad:<br />
<br />
u gonna come back to that zone to help me  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tumnayar DiSalvo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Grats on Breeder. Josahd, why do you have a BoW? heh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Mordosskul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Heh, grats<br />
<br />
And I agree - hardest part of epic 1.5 period. Frickin squid is a tricky sucker.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kelefane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">u gonna come back to that zone to help me  :D<br />
<br />
I'll help you anytime Veyron ;) Just say when, but your ass needs to start logging on more :D , Cudgel is rotting now and last one coulda been yours :cool: Last Cudgel went to a recruit :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Grats on Breeder. Josahd, why do you have a BoW? heh<br />
<br />
Because we didn't always have Terror of Discord.  Same reason so many SK's have ykesha procs on their tanking weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Even with Terror, Ykesha is still the aug of choice for our tanking weapon. You can hold aggro without it, but having a stun proc makes a very noticable difference and leaves time to cast other spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Krassus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">that cudgel was mine =((( GFD having a social life and not playing thurs-sat</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>rayzdin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Just saw this post and I had the identical think happen.  Named and breeder in same camp.  I had a warrior to tank so I HS'd to the zone with the breeder and named.  I completely zoned out.  Breeder pops warrior tags - all is well then bam other name in camp for some reason.  I barely made it back from zoning from BF and group was already wiped.<br />
<br />
No one could explain why named popped on group but he did.  I still haven't gotten anyone back to this camp after that :(.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kelefane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I feel your pain Rayz. Not sure whats up w/ that other named pop. I would have had Breeder killed way earlier if it wasnt from that other named mysteriously WARPING into camp the way it did days before I got it. This is a painful camp to some and me included.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Why not have a BoW?  I tank a lot.  Aggro procs make a noticable difference.... and I just finally got terror of discord the other day.<br />
<br />
Guild defaulted them to warriors, but 2 dropped and only one warr present (other than the fresh app).  Good damage, helps tanking out, and pisses off warriors... what's not to like?<br />
<br />
Been bagged for cudgel+SoS and epic now anyhow.  But if I cuold put an anger proc on the cudgel, I would.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">If i kill the breeder before doing the pre epic steps (I do not have 1.0 and have not done Olidan or Varns yet) will he drop his egg ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Nasiir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">yes, it will drop the egg no matter where you are with preepic</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">PoG, PoN, PoFear, Breeder, Fraga can all be done out of order.  Just make sure you do turnins in order.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Tyrs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">yes, it will drop the egg no matter where you are with preepic<br />
<br />
but can a unflagged SK at that point loot the egg?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Atraleto</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Yes you can</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Loviaroth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I just took breeder out on friday.<br />
The way i went about it, was i had a mini raid of 18 people, we had 0 chanters, but 2 sk's 3 wars and a pally, so any pops or roamers could be offtanked, everyone was sorta VT geared and some lower tier planes gear. <br />
We cleared the murk at the top of the stairs and the roamers. I then agrod breeder and HS kited to first murk room. as soon as the breeder was back at spawn point the second sk did the same thing. When i got argo clear message i had a mage CoH me back to force, same thing with second sk. After two kites we got 5 of the 6 spawns, i kited away once more to get last spawn out. i FD pulled the breeder to the bottom of stairs and had a monk walk it up to war. Breeder was at 70% by the time i lost agro of adds. This worked out extremely well, we were able to take down breeder without any deaths, I believe this would be doable with two groups of the same geared peopole as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>uaell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">i just got the breeder tonight, and deathsting was up as well. we had 16 well geared EP people, so it was definitely overkill, but i figured better safe than sorry.<br />
<br />
we cleared our way to the room, then cleared the trash mobs, then a rogue single pulled the deathsting (the breeder didn't add at all). then when it was just the breeder left, the rogue pulled and kited in circles in that room until all 6 mobs popped, then he ran down the other hall and escaped. when the breeder reset alone, i pulled and we killed in about 10 seconds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Camby_VZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Just a question about the breeder ...<br />
<br />
I've camped this thing 4 times for an average of 4 hours per camp and haven't yet seen a breeder.  I have however have gotten atleast 8 of the Deathstingers which all but 1 dropped a lvl 67 to 69 rune and a couple of augs and some decent twink gear.<br />
<br />
Is there a certain time of EQ day / night or SOME thing I am missing while doing this camp ?  I have to say that the exp / runes are not enough of a positive to get a group of Qvic flagged peeps from my guild to even bother making the trip there to assist in camping it.<br />
<br />
Any info anyone can give me ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">It's just luck of the draw.  I had a similar experience, camped him somewhere between 15-20 hours spread over 4 or 5 sessions before he made his appearance.  Another SK in my guild got him after clearing 1 PH.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Camby_VZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">On my 6th camp,  We had just cleared our first PH ( Murkglider Creeper ) and I was going down after the first break to pull more murks and low and behold, Hail, Murkglider Breeder !!!<br />
<br />
Happy to say after some trouble ( Damn Deathstinger ) we killed the rotten thing and I got my slimy egg.  God I am glad that's over  :D</div></div><hr />
