<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nazgaull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been thinking of adding an Augment to my Greenmist.<br />
<br />
Not one of those cheesy +5 or +6 to whatever stat that everyone loots in the dungeons, but a good one that I can buy with my AP's...<br />
<br />
I am thinking of this one: http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=24124<br />
<br />
It is the 75hp Tap Proc...<br />
<br />
Would it be a good Augment to add to the Greenmist?  If not then what would be a good one to use?<br />
<br />
Greenmist can only accept the Type 4; and I believe that all the Type 4's that can be purchased are the ones with effects.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ziglug D</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Dude, this has been posted 45.000 times, the LIFETAP AUGS SUCK ASS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Go for Ykesha force or Permafrost...Permafrost is better if ur gonna be fighting mobs that resist stuns,<br />
<br />
<br />
Permafrost-&gt; 150 DD</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nazgaull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sorry...<br />
<br />
I didn't know it was already posted.  <br />
<br />
I haven't seen any posts on this topic in the Greenmist Forum as far back as 3 pages.<br />
<br />
I also ran a few Searches; but came up with no results.<br />
<br />
Now if subjects related to augmenting the Greenmist are in a Forum, other then the Greenmist forum... then the Mods are doing a crappy job of keeping the subjects in the correct forums.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>IMBACKBITCH</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Dont worry bout ziglug, just a newbie bitch with a stick in his ass..yes the lifetap augs suck, but i would NOT go for the ykesha one, do permafrost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ziglug D</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">In case you didnt read lol I said go for permafrost or ykesha. *COUGH* *COUGH* not gonna say anything...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
newbie...pfft!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Darknyss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I doubt the modrators are doing a bad job keeping the posts in the correct forum, considering your question is much more related to equipment and weaponry rather than the actual quest...<br />
<br />
try searching in other forums as well before blaming it on the mods</div></div><hr />
