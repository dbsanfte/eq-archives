<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mescar Yewup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Have logged in over 30+ hrs in the church alone trying to get the IMP for the shard.  I know that is the hardest part of this stage of the subquest however with talking to other SKs on Brell that has gotten their GM they informed me that is to long for it to spawn.  Just wondering if anyone else has had this problem.  Have sent bug report and /pet a GM about it.  Of course get a guide and he tells me that the quest is not broken blah blah blah.  Personally I wish he was there so I could HT him however never showed face.  I have tried just the 3 spawn and have also tried mass killing the whole room.  Still no luck.  Could someone confer or let me know what it is I am doing wrong?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just got done with a 20 or so hour camp in Dalnir. The kly spot on the second floor despawns and respawns every 15 minutes or so. From what i have seen the rumor is true only one imprecator can be up at any time. Bottom floor imprecator seems to spawn and does not despawn like the second floor one.<br />
<br />
This is what I did...<br />
<br />
I sat at the red/black tapestry /gems kill boredom every 10 minutes or so run down stairs zone out and go back down and check second floor for a imprecator. If a ph is up still get down to the church room and /gems some more. He will spawn eventualy.<br />
<br />
good luck</div></div><hr />

<br />
this was in the lab... that spawn was horrendous... the church took 2 tries, went in once, got the hammer no church imp... went in second time, cleared room 4 times, 4th times a charm... (was lucky because we almost left after 3rd)<br />
<br />
all in all... long camp... and I can't wait to get my mirror so that I never have to go into Dalnir's EVER AGAIN!<br />
<br />
rumors are fine... but IMHO, there is no way to get IMP's to spawn... they know when you're there.. and they love to hide... was only one in the zone pretty much 9 of those 10 hours a day</div></div><hr />
