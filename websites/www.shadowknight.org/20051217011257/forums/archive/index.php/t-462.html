Can anyone enlighten me on what this is and how it is done?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Askeer</div><div class="date">04-05-2002, 08:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, pet pulling is what the name says, pulling with a pet :)<br />
It's very useful if you want to agro something, and not be on the Line of Sight of the mob.<br />
It also allows to be far ahead of the mob when it aggroes you.<br />
It's also good to eat Harm Touch(es).<br />
And last but not least, you can buff up your pet with aego focus and DS, send it on a mob, pull another, bring yours to group, then FD. It's called Pet splitting and it's a very secret technique !  *grin*<br />
<br />
Hope this helps :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zarovich</div><div class="date">04-05-2002, 10:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Really the only time I use a pet to help pull is in Sleepers, pulling the FA. Anyone who has been there knows that you have to send a puller down there to agro FA and pull him near the drop off you are standing at. The reason I use a pet here is because if you dont sometimes the FA wont agro you and if you try casting spells well most of the time you get target oor or cannot see target. But if your pet is up there then FA will agro him and come up in cave area, and even take one hit for ya.<br />

<br />
As for pet pulling, it's got many virtues, including allowing a greater head start, and allowing you to pull large mobs around a corner. Of course, the uses of a pet's reliable aggro radius are nothing to sneeze at, either.</div></div><hr />

We just go there randomly to get those new people with st keys primals.. or at least try to.<br />

<br />
Bind a key to /pet kill Velketor<br />
<br />
The pet runs over to him on his own, guards frequently come out w/o velk, then I feign and let a monk team tag split them.<br />
<br />
It's not always the best way, but it's yet another trick in the book with several situations where it's useful.</div></div><hr />

then your pet hit for 30s or 70s on a nec stand back dark and fear and away you go get xp P:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bah, you make it all too complicated.  Just go behind him and kill him there.</div></div><hr />

I do know DT isn't stoped by harmshield/divine aura, thats why i doubt a pet would take it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I worked at it a bit in the upper 40's, and have used it ever since when, the situation comes up, which is not too often, but it helps to know what to expect. :-)</div></div><hr />
