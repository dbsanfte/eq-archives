Thank me later from saving you from the search beating.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vezax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Pretty much all are solible, but some arent worth the time. Note all of mine were soloed at 65, your milage may vary.<br />
<br />
-Easy solo-<br />
<br />
Seru- took forever, but easy to solo.  Nice thing was I was able to pad my pockets a bit here, stuff is light blue mostly, if you do the cat walk, some are rarely dark blue.  They drop off &quot;legos of the hand&quot; or &quot;lego &lt;name&gt;&quot;.  There is also 2 that spawn by the zones of MS and DSP.  Watch out for the roamer, he can be a pain.  His name is &quot;something of the Eye&quot;.  I found this place to have the 2nd worst drop rate.<br />
<br />
Grey- rock guys/ sun revs, didnt take long at all.  Blue / lt blue.  I heard this shard can take a while, but I got it off my second kill.  <br />
<br />
SD- kill every thing on plateau, stuff is green.  Got it in 10 kills of some caster.<br />
<br />
DSP- Kill every thing in NE caves, stuff is green.  Got it on my 8th kill.<br />
<br />
-Duo with healer-<br />
<br />
FG- soloible, but a pain, easy peasy with a healer.  stuff is all  blue, drops a shard roughly once every 5-8 kills.  Agro radius are small for shikar warriors, so they are easy solo pulls, royal guards are easily snare split.  The place I camped was a tunnel between where 4 shikar warriors spawned and 2 royal guards spawned.  A named priest spawns in the 4 warriors room.  make sure to clear him too.  with me and a 65 shammy, we were able to clear this 6 spawn of mobs easily.<br />
<br />
ME- soloible if you do the 3 spawn camp by the goranga fort coimg from DSP.  But its best to get a couple more and clear that 3 spawn, and the 3 spawn almost directly south of the 1st 3 spawn.  In those 6 spawn, any of 3 named can pop.  This is a shitty ass camp, and all the goranga are blue.  PH are called Goranga scouts.  This camp sucks ass.  Easily the worst camp.<br />
<br />
Acrylia - soloible if you want to clear the room near zone in where the grimling primalist pops.  But that takes forever, but you will make a ton of pp w/ vendor loot and acrylia.  Head to inner acrylia and kill mobs there if grouped.  about one shard per 8-10 kills.  I suggest grouping it, it goes quick.<br />
<br />
Akheva - soloible I guess, had a healer.  Go kill stone guys by davyns room.  Drops about one in 4-5 from them.  Pretty easy stuff.<br />
<br />
-Group-<br />
<br />
SSra- /shrug If youre doin VT keys youre gonna spend a lot of time here.  You'll eventually get one.  Basically I logged on and had a group of guildies farming green metals and snagged myself a shard.<br />
<br />
-Unknown-<br />
<br />
Deep- still havent done it yet.<br />
<br />
The shard hunting isnt that bad besides ME.  took me 8 days (6 of which I used actively to shard hunt.)  to get 9 shards, and only 3 of those day was I actively shard hunting for more then 3 hours.  I spent 5 hours in Seru, and 9 hours in ME (split between one 6 hour session in a group and one 3 hour session soloing, from which I got my shard.)<br />
<br />
Basically I set it up the way I recomend doing it, as I found it most efficeint.  I'm guessing the deep shard will be like the acrylia/akhevia/FG shard, once im set up with a healer or group, it will take about 30 min roughly for each shard.</div></div><hr />
