<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>BRÆDOWN™</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok I got into some money and am going to be buying a few more comps (if i think the idea is possible) and I plan to 8 box or even more. Heres the question: What class combination would best suit grinding AA and eventually doing high end content by myself if indeed possible.<br />
<br />
I plan on running my 8-12 box by starting off each character and from lv's 20-70 do countless LDoN and use the exp and gear and work from there.<br />
<br />
I was thinking of:<br />
<br />
-Cleric<br />
-Cleric<br />
-Paladin<br />
-Druid<br />
-Warrior<br />
-Rogue<br />
-Wizard<br />
-Shadowknight<br />
-Shaman<br />
-Wizard<br />
-Monk<br />
-Enchanter<br />
Would that be enough DPS to take out more content like, VT moving to PoP and etc. Would this idea even be possible?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>pogge2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You could do VT with 6 box.<br />
You coudl do All 4 BoT tower minis with 6 box or less.<br />
You can do Tallon Zek in PoTac with 6 Box or less.<br />
with 12, and good bot macros running, you coudl take out most of elemental minis / Vallon Zek in PoTacs etc. <br />
<br />
You are limited in what you can do by a few things:  Crowd Controll, and Offtanking is the major one. Both are very hard to do when your talkign about boxing 12 chars.  <br />
<br />
The second is AE's.  if the mobs has big AEs you will want a pally in each group, and that limits your DPS more, cause u will have to drop a DPS.<br />
<br />
anyway.<br />
<br />
I think your coudl drop the monk. and add a bard for resists and mana.<br />
sorry to say  -Or-  Id drop the SK for another pally =/ group heal for second group, and you already have a warrior to tank. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
- Warrior - MT<br />
- Cleric -main healer<br />
- Cleric - second main healer<br />
- Paladin : group heal <br />
- druid - patches resists snare for chanty pet.<br />
- Shaman - buffs slow patches<br />
- Bard -  mana / resists<br />
- Enchanter  - mana cc charmed pet<br />
- Wizard -DPS<br />
- WIzard - DPS<br />
- Rog DPS<br />
- Monk - pull / dps<br />
<br />
You can sub in a SK for the monk.<br />
You might want a second pally if u plan on fighting mobs with big AE's<br />
you might want to drop the druid and pick up a ranjer for DPS/SNares/ANd weaponshield.<br />
<br />
Or you could do this<br />
group1<br />
------<br />
war<br />
shaman<br />
cleric<br />
cleric<br />
ench<br />
bard<br />
<br />
group2<br />
------<br />
bst<br />
sk<br />
wiz<br />
wiz<br />
wiz<br />
wiz<br />
<br />
:)<br />
<br />
<br />
ALso you woudl only need 4 or 5 computers to run a 12 box.<br />
Idealy have your main box run your tank, and run your bot commands off hotkeys from that account. then do 3 Bots on each of the other 4 PCs.<br />
<br />
Ezy.<br />
have fun</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>GenoReaper999</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i'd drop the monk for a zerker since they do better dps</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes and no, if he has a SK to pull then that works. but if you have a SK and a pally and a warrior .. your starting to get redundant  because of how you will be limitted by the boxxing of the chars.  he wont easily be able to do much offtanking, tho its possible.  Pulling will be important because crowd controll will be near impossible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Even if you could do it, how fun would it really be long term?<br />
<br />
But playing along...<br />
<br />
For botting you may want some pet classes so that if you have to scramble for heals, slow or aggro, at least the pets would be doing dps.<br />
<br />
War- Tank<br />
Cle- Heal/res<br />
Cle- Heal/res<br />
Enc- Slows/buffs (some cc)/debuff<br />
Bard- Pulling/buffs/pre-slow<br />
Wiz- DPS/ports<br />
<br />
Necro- pet/cr/dps/pulls<br />
Mage- pet/dps/debuff<br />
Mage- pet/dps<br />
Mage- pet/dps<br />
Mage- pet/dps<br />
Ranger- tracking/dps with autofire/back up tank/rampage tank<br />
<br />
If it were me, I would want to automate the dps bots as much as possible. Melee dps need attention (moving around), casters don't. <br />
<br />
So use the bard to pull, he can single easily in later levels, until then the necro will do fine if you have skill at splitting. Have the bard pre-slow on inc. War get's aggro, clerics begin to heal, chanter slows. Send in your pet army (five caster pets is massive dps), hit ranger autofire, start nuking while maintaining aggro and healing.<br />
<br />
No way you can effectively use a chanter pet, unless you have a DCed one. This set up is a bit light on buffs, but those can be bought. You could swap the enchanter for a shaman, since you have a bard for haste and mana regen, but the enchanter will be more useful.<br />
<br />
If you are going for true min/max, an SK in the mix would be too complex to play effectively, meaning you will not get as much out of it as a better dps class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lynxal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You will end up killing yourself trying to level 2 groups of bots through LDONs.  You won't be able to run them both at the same time.<br />
<br />
I agree with Sillvir, pet classes are the way to go even if the push will be annoying.  I would replace one mage with a BL probably though for the buffs.  If you are in an outdoor zone running that much DPS the mobs are going to go down so fast it won't be a big deal losing the mage DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>BRÆDOWN™</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I put in the knights for kiting purposes for adds or something like that, situational, warrior is going to be MT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">so you ask for advice then say why you're not gonna follow it?<br />
<br />
Anyway if Farming made you want to kill yourself, putting 12 chars through LDoN will too.<br />
<br />
You're certainly not following textbook monkey/basket logic here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>BRÆDOWN™</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Just brain storming, keevel. Clever though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">why not 2 box? you can get better gear 2 boxing or 3 boxing OoW content than doing the lower end PoP raids. not to mention paying for 12 accounts would be insane...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>cames</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">We have several 6 boxers on Vazaelle and the pretty much all use the following setup....<br />
<br />
Warrior, Cleric, Bard, Wizard, Wizard, Wizard.  Bard is the main action character.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
yeah I have to agree that a 6 box woudl be cheeper, simpler, and less agrivating.<br />
<br />
He asked about 12 tho so thats how I answered.<br />
<br />
I have to admit that the best plan woudl be to follow these guys advice and just 6 box OOW content. better gear than PoP/LDoN.<br />
<br />
and you can 6 box alot of VT !  between VT and OOW loot, you woudl be pretty set. Not to mention the amount of platinum you could make to buy gear also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>pogge2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Necro- pet/cr/dps/pulls<br />
Mage- pet/dps/debuff<br />

Mage- pet/dps<br />
Mage- pet/dps<br />
Ranger- tracking/dps with autofire/back up tank/rampage tank<br />
<br />
<br />
The ranjer isnt needed for tracking, if he is running a 6box with bots, he prolly gonna have other ways to track  :D tho weapon shield might be of use</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Wyrdlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Is Vex Thall actually possible with a single group?  I only spent a little time kinda blowing through there, but it seemed to me that the DPS just wouldn't be there in a small group to make it worth it.<br />
<br />
Anyone got any tips or links that talk about how this could work?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>cames</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Biggest problem with a 12 box would be keeping both groups active.  I agree with the pet class thing.  I would think 6 necros would be the best.  All FD and pet attack.  Gameslah used to have a site up with his 6 box setup (and it involved multiple computers).</div></div><hr />

How would you &quot;run your bot commands off hotkeys from&quot; your main box tank?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Rueeliar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">He still does.  http://www.gameslah.com</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">dps would be a problem in VT... probably possible, but it'd drive you insane.  Not to mention the hell of getting 6 keys on your own...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Lynxal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I think mages are still the way to go for DPS.....but apparently there is a new rogue bot script out.  The interesting thing is that it supposedly runs a rogue better than a rogue could ever be run by a person.  Basically makes them a pet, 100% adjustment.<br />
<br />
Heard some rogues griping about it but haven't looked into it myself.<br />
<br />
Mages will still outDPS a rogue until you get the rogue EP weapons that are not 12 boxable (Votal/Fenin).  Spells are always easier to obtain than high level weapons, especially for rogues.  BoT dagger and LDoN augd dagger would be the best you could get for the rogues I would guess.</div></div><hr />
