<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fezzika</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 05:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey guys...my guild is very much a family oriented guild that is determined to do greater things.  We're able to do Phinny (don't laugh you uberguys), and on a good raid are able to get around 12 53-58 people together including a couple of clerics, an enchanter, shammy and a few good tanks.  What other mobs are there of around Phinny's esteem that would be a good challenge for a guild like this?   We're just trying to get an idea of what to shoot for.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the advice folks...</div></div><hr />

Perhaps doing the 9th Coldain ring mini-raids?<br />
<br />
You also might try doing some playing around in Umbral Planes.</div></div><hr />

All could be fun experiences.  12 might be a little small unless you are well organized.<br />
<br />
My guild is a lot like yours, but we are just starting to grow beyond these as more of our members hit 60.  We generally get 18 on a raid, 24-30 on the rare big raid occasion :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Evilangel</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 07:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You could think about Chardoc - our small guild have headed down to the Graveyard with 2 groups a couple of times (wiped out both time though ;)).<br />
<br />
Good hunting</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thenger</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 08:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Umbral Plains?  For a guild that small?  I guess you guys can go there, just watch out that zone can be a bit hard if the two bosses are up.  But besides the two big mobs, you should be able to do the zone.  Off the top of my head I belive one of the smaller bosses can gate, watch out for that.  Just be awafe if you see Doom or RumbleCrush in the zone, I would suggest you guys leave.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mystina</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 08:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">*Kael arena seems a good &quot;challenge&quot; for 2 groups of 53-58 with very nice reward if you spend some time in there.<br />
<br />
*A camp at Efreeti in Solb, might be trivial but not sure, worth a try...<br />
<br />
*Could do some fun parts of epics, like CoM/Hole for shammy epic.<br />
<br />
Bob and Planes seems a bit hard to me for this force, but I might be wrong.<br />
<br />
*edit*<br />
<br />
Oh and after you get good CoV faction in Kael you should do Benevolence quest in ww for very nice bracer and wis caster range item.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kwell</div><div class="date">03-27-2002, 11:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fezzika, for you own bennifit you guys can do Rharzar in Rath. Mt. and also the mimic, Kyrena part of your epic in the Hole.  The Hole is a lot of fun for a group that size.  I would hold off on the Ghost of Glonore, Ratman Guard until you get a little bit more.  Kurron Ni can also be done with this force.  Good Luck<br />

Dark Iksar of the 55th<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brael</div><div class="date">03-27-2002, 11:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">hmm, you could do poh/poa to... first floor poh i mean, 2nd floor maybe but not sure ive only done that with a full raid force to kill innosuck so judging its diffuculty wasnt really something i could do, you might wanna think about some of the weaker mobs in ww and dn to, but if velious isnt your thing maybe drusella sathir (make sure you dont need your ot faction anymore first), and while it wouldnt be a challenge maybe fg's</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mr_Darklove</div><div class="date">03-27-2002, 11:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dragon Necropolis is quite fun and can get some decent weapons, might wanna try that.<br />
<br />
Western Wastes some of the smaller dragons you could probably kill, although not sure if that would be too tough (Never tried that since my guild is +CoV)<br />
<br />
Also if you're +CoV you can kill in Kael for Thurgadin quest armour and then do the Bracer of Benevolence/Talisman of Benevolence/Robe of Benevolence quest in Skyshrine (Although the Robe isn't all that good compared to some easier to get ones, whereas the Bracer and Talisman are very nice).</div></div><hr />
