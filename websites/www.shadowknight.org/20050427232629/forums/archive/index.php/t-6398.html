<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>chumley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am completly new and have my heart set on being an SK what race should I be?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>fendor stonesmith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ok here are the tips that I know, If anything is wrong please correct me.<br />
<br />
Ogers can not be stuned from the front, very nice but kos in most places, high stats in STR and STA but low INT, and very big has touble in small places.<br />
<br />
Troll Regeration very nice, nice STR and STA but agian low INT and large race so it also has trouble in small places<br />
<br />
Iksar regeration and natural AC bonus nice, Kos almost everwhere <br />
<br />
Eurodite (not sure if that is spelled right) Big forhead for high INT.<br />
<br />
Darkelf high INT, see in the dark and the coolest looking class for SK.<br />
<br />
Human I play a human just and average joe.<br />
<br />
But with the right equipment you can make up of any low stats. But the ogers cant be stuned Troll regn and Iksar regn and natural AC are nice bonuses.<br />
<br />
Play what will make you happy. <br />
<br />
I would have played a Iksar if thay where in the game when I started my SK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Katha Ath'Nan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Another thing to consider that humans and erudites will xp the fastest, iksar and troll the slowest.<br />
<br />
But as has been said many times, play what you think you'd like to play. There's no one best race.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Oh, and being KOS in &quot;most&quot; places is not nearly as big a problem as being KOS in every place but your home city.<br />
<br />
 (IE: Ogres, DE's and Trolls are KOS in goodly places, but can roam eachother's cities with relative safety, whereas Iksar are KOS to just about every damn place on the map except for Cabilis, including the other &quot;evil&quot; cities.)<br />
<br />
Just pick on what you think looks the coolest.  You're going to be looking at this character for a very, very long time.<br />

Oh, and being KOS in &quot;most&quot; places is not nearly as big a problem as being KOS in every place but your home city.<br />
Even for Iksar, faction tends to be of little import, unless you want to group with friends in certain zones and need to travel (and you aren't level 30 yet).<br />
<br />
Iksar can level to ~34 in zones that are adjacent to Cabilis.  They won't be attacked in Shadowhaven or Shar Vahl, and can get Thurgadin and Neriak faction quickly and without much fuss.<br />
<br />
If you want to get around and see the world, a gnome or human is probably the better bet, though.  Ogres and trolls have good faction in Neriak if I am not mistaken, so they have it a bit better as well.<br />
<br />
But if you're not planning on running all over the place until you ding 30, Iksar faction is a non-issue, IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Naeadien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Also you can play a Gnome. :D <br />
<br />
Faction isn't much of an issue with Gnomes, some good races won't like you, but those faction are easily fixed.<br />
<br />
If you are just starting out, Gnomes are easy to gear up.  Since Lightcrawler Armor is wearable and dirt cheap.  Its not as good as Crusty, but good for the price until you can buy better.<br />
<br />
Also starting out, you can get to G Fay easily and get to the moon.  <br />
<br />
Plus, its also scary how cute Gnomes are!  :p</div></div><hr />
