<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The server was brought down for a patch yesterday and the message board was updated with changes. Naturally not all of it affects us but there are some that do (ie. Attack off when FD now).<br />
<br />
I also copied over the 10/25 update because that was just put up as well.<br />
<br />
As per Grumbuk (http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=testing&amp;message.id=4796) <br />
<br />
I thought it would be good to put here too, in case you guys dont read the SoE boards much <br />
<br />
----------------------------- <br />
TEST SERVER CODE UPDATE 11/8/04 <br />
Please remember that all changes on Test are subject to change and may not make it to Live servers depending on the results of testing. <br />
Thanks for playing on Test! <br />
------------------------------- <br />
<br />
- The /autofire command should work for non-GM clients now and various bugs related to it have been fixed. <br />
- Added code to check and validate specialization skills. If the values are not legal, the player informed why they are not legal and they are reset. <br />
- Added popup confirmation dialog when you attempt to give an augmented item to an NPC. <br />
- Added chat message when submitting a /bug as feedback to let you know if it was submitted or cancelled. <br />
- No-rent containers no longer poof on login if they contain items. They instead change into an unenchanted container with the same number of slots, and a chat message notifies the player. <br />
- The Tradeskill window will now allow up to 500 total favorites (up from 100) across all tradeskills. <br />
- Added optional parameters to /book command -- /book open, /book close <br />
- Fixed a bug with haste items and haste augments. Their effects were stacking when they shouldn't have. It will now only take the greatest haste effect from the item including augments. <br />
- Fixed bug where a player that has over 2 million plat in his inventory was unable to purchase anything from a vendor or trader. <br />
- /yell messages are no longer displayed if the yelling player is in your ignore list <br />
- /Melody should now be working properly. <br />
- Some models that were scaled dramatically could cause the collision system to fail, resulting in warps to ceiling and other strange side effects. In particular the vases in dranikcatacombsa at 1000,-1011, 0. <br />
- Players standing on the lip of an edge should now slide off them more smoothly. This should dramatically reduce how often players experience 20k fall bug (which is still being looked into) and also make it much easier to get out of the water in many situations. <br />
- There have been some optimizations to the collision system. You may see improved performance in zones with very large stationary objects (potimea, bloodfields, etc). <br />
- Fixed problem with the Beastlord AA Bestial Alignment where if you had maxed buffs this AA would not reset if it did not take. <br />
- Duration enhancement focuses and AAs should now increase the duration of pet buffs. <br />
- The spell Nature's Blight was not increasing the damage as stated and should be working as intended now. <br />
<br />

TEST SERVER CODE UPDATE 10/25/2004 <br />
Please remember that all changes on Test are subject to change and may not make it to Live servers depending on the results of testing. <br />
Thanks for playing on Test! <br />
---------------------------------- <br />
<br />
-- Auto attack should now turn off when the player feigns death. This should be true whether the player uses a skill (monk) or a spell (necro, sk, etc). <br />
-- Fixed a number of small bugs in the zoom camera behavior. These fixes include removing the possibility of having the first mousewheel click causing the camera to bounce back into first person, a bug that could cause the camera to get stuck “one click” out of first person, as well as smoothing out the camera motion a bit. <br />
-- Scrolling to third person and tabbing to another window should no longer cause the screen to bounce back and forth. <br />
-- /autofire is now available for testing. To use this, make a social key that uses the slash command &quot;/autofire&quot;. Please be sure to let us know of any issues with this command. <br />
-- Mounts should no longer be dismissed when zoning. <br />
-- Summoning mounts in certain places should no longer cause players to fall through geometry. <br />
-- Getting out of water should be much easier to do. <br />
-- Berzerker: Hastenend War Cry should be fixed now. <br />
-- If your stored AA's go above 30, they will no longer be set to 30 when you zone. However, you should still not be able to gain more than 30 unless you get a refund, get the AA from a GM, or get an AA from a script. <br />
-- Spell scribe timers (putting a new spell into the spell book) now take only 1 second. <br />
-- Players should no longer experience 20k falls when standing on cliff edges while suffering from low framerate. Please be on the lookout for collision problems and /bug with detailed locations if you experience any. <br />
-- Fixed an issue with Half Elf Paladins of Tunare and the Origin AA. <br />
-- The bounding radius for small races was too tall, preventing them from accessing some areas. For example, gnomes couldn't enter the small huts in steamfont. This was a global problem, that is just an example. Please be on the lookout for any movement or collision issues related to small races. <br />
-- You may notice various NPCs that had been standing on tents or otherwise not where they should be are now properly positioned. Please bug any NPCs you see that appear to be incorrectly placed. <br />
-- Weather effects should now be working properly when the Wake of Karana spell is used. <br />
-- Sounds related to starting &amp; stopping of various weather types due to zoning and Wake of Karana should be working correctly. <br />
-- Added NO_PET to item description window which will be displayed when an item has this flag. <br />
-- Changed /who commands to display both class title and base class name for players over level 50, e.g. &quot;Bedazzler (Enchanter)&quot; <br />
-- Fixed a bug that caused a lot of writing to the dbg.txt file during a raid <br />
-- Bazaar trader mode is no longer cancelled when going from windowed to full-screen and vice-versa. <br />
-- Fog effects are no longer carrying over into other zones.<br />
<br />
EDIT: 9 November 04 - 1300 MST.<br />

Test was brought down again today (gotta love it) and several AA partial refunds were given. I personally got back 5 AA for WA5 and 8 AA for Pet Affinity. Runspeed 5 was reduced to 5 AA (instead of 10). Advanced ToL was also reduced to 5 AA (instead of 10). I will try to update with which other AA's were reduced in cost.<br />
<br />
One of the bards in my guild got back 89 total AA (course he had purchased just about everything he could) due to cost reductions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lzert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">cool info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Fixed a bug with haste items and haste augments. Their effects were stacking when they shouldn't have. some people had 81-86% worn haste?<br />
<br />
<br />
Added NO_PET to item description window which will be displayed when an item has this flag. i wonder what this will affect...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Marruk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The no-pet flag already had the mages up in arms when they added to a weapon with a good proc (slow, iirc) that was a popular choice for pets.<br />
<br />
SOE's logic was that now that pets can zone, persist, etc., giving some proccing weapons to pets would be &quot;overpowered&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chamosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The haste thing was a display bug.  The hastes didn't really stack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The developers post specifically says the &quot;effects&quot; were stacking.<br />
<br />
All of the refunds are coming from GoD AA's (Damn Brael is going to be overflowing with AA). They have evened out the cost of all of them as far as I can tell.<br />
<br />
Examples:<br />
<br />
WA is now 5 per level instead of increasing each level. <br />
<br />
Run speed 5 per level.<br />
<br />
Immobilizing bash is now 5 per level as well.<br />
<br />
The more GoD you have the bigger your refund will be. Now if only we could have gotten a suspend minion refund =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">While that on the surface sounds great; and is for those who have maxed out lines of GoD skills, the change from say 3/6/9 to 5/5/5 means it costs more points to get to [in this example] lvls one and two than it did before.  Getting WA2 used to cost 6 points, now it costs 10.<br />
<br />
While those that have all GoD AA's maxed (or those with the more expensive ones maxed) stand to get a few aa back, I think this is NOT a good change overall.  And what happens to peeps who have WA2 already but now 'technically' don't?  Fine for stuff like Run 4/5 since it only affects run 5 (for the good of all).<br />
<br />
Personally, I'm not affected negatively (~940 aa here, all GoD ones maxed except the GoD advanced ToL that was added in OoW) but it doesn't sound beneficial to players overall, especially those who have yet to buy any GoD aa's (that may now be more expensive to start a new skill in).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The overall effect is that most of the GoD AA's are now cheaper to buy when the entire line is taken under consideration. <br />
<br />
I fail to see how this is a bad thing overall.<br />
<br />
Also by making all the levels the same cost you are able to by them more consistently instead of quickly at first and then having to save much longer for later levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">All of the refunds are coming from GoD AA's (Damn Brael is going to be overflowing with AA). They have evened out the cost of all of them as far as I can tell.<br />
<br />
Examples:<br />
<br />
WA is now 5 per level instead of increasing each level.<br />
<br />
cost | old | new<br />
WA1 | 02 | 05<br />
WA2 | 06 | 10<br />
WA3 | 12 | 15<br />
WA4 | 20 | 20<br />
WA5 | 30 | 25<br />
<br />
so people who got WA up to level 5 will benefit. that's pretty lame for those of us who have WA3 or under, unless they let us keep WA1/WA2<br />
<br />
what have they done with intense hatred cost?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">cost | old | new<br />
WA1 | 02 | 05<br />
WA2 | 06 | 10<br />

<br />

<br />
Now remember this stuff isn't final yet but....<br />
<br />
For those in my guild in similar positions (other classes had AA's that scaled up in cost and were not maxed out) they were allowed to keep their present level of skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">So then how is buying further levels handled?  If you had spent fewer AA's to achieve a given level of an ability than it would cost under the new system, would the disparity in cost be tacked onto the next level or what?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">No Slein, they were essentially given free AA under this change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Naraz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">-- Auto attack should now turn off when the player feigns death. This should be true whether the player uses a skill (monk) or a spell (necro, sk, etc). <br />
<br />
Nerf at least for MT's:(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">You're right.  Could make tanking shit with FD procs a whole heck of a lot harder.... if so, may have to re-learn several encounters, including VZ in time.<br />
<br />
Maybe it only affects it when the FD is initiated from your own ability or spell?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I re-read my post and see I came across more negatively than I had intended; but both window and SJ expanded on what I was getting at.  And I do see your point Syfon -- that the overall cost is reduced when the whole line is considered.<br />
<br />
For the more casual players though (ones that won't get a whole lot of aa overall), it'd be harder to &quot;get started&quot; on the first couple of levels of a given skill as the initial costs would be higher.<br />
<br />
I'm also groaning at how magelo would handle the point disparity between those that have say, lvl 2 of a skill now that would cost more after the proposed change.  Then again, it's irrelevant to the game but I must admit that was in the back of my mind too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">No Slein, they were essentially given free AA under this change.<br />
<br />
So then it'd be advisable for people to buy WA2, for example, as one would then actually ultimately end up paying less than even the new price by doing so?  I'd be surprised if it went live that way...</div></div><hr />
