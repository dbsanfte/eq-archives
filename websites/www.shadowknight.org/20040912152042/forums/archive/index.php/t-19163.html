<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zmabik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know that the epic is a symbol and an item that is mostly a matter of pride. Once done you can say, hey I did that.<br />
<br />
But with that being said is the epic quest really worth doing with the current weapons out their. I only ask this because I don't really want to spend time questing for it if I will realistically never use it. <br />
<br />
I may do it eventually just because I think the epic itself looks amazing, but if it isn't worth it I may not put a rush on trying to do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you're asking, the answer is no.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Silvershadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you want to contribute to your groups/raids, go buy a WMBS for a few k in the Bazaar and you're all set until you get something better at a raid.<br />
<br />
If you like questing or want the epic as a status symbol or such, sure, go get it - it's a lot of work for something that you can easily get better in the Bazaar though. I did it because I'm a quest nut, not because I was going to use it a lot. I still do use it sometimes, but not at a raid or in an exp group.<br />
<br />
Just be warned, if you have to ask yourself the question you just asked, the answer is most likely no, as Catharsis said.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sabazios</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">well i don't see how you can ever say yes...and i don't understand why people always ask this question.  I mean you know what weapons are out there, you know you will get them, then you ask &quot;should i get epic&quot;  Thats like asking if you should get a weapon that is worse that your current weapon.<br />
<br />
Now if you want to do the epic because your bored or you like to do quests, want to show off, etc.  Again why ask, because if thats the case then yea do it.<br />
<br />
If your problem is that you can't buy another weapon better than epic, i'll just say what the previous guy said...go buy a better weapon because in the amount of time it takes you to do the epic you could have already bought something better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aoninie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">This question has been on this board way too often. Can't some of you make your own choices? I'm doing the epic because I want it. Why do olympians work so hard for a POS medal? In most countries they won't get big comercial deals, it's a feeling of accomplishment. Even if I never use the sword it will be carried with pride as a symbol of my accomplishment! For all you who have earned their epics and those like me who trudge on with this quest, /salute.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mordraeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'll never use anything but Innoruuk's Curse. There is nothing better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zmabik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Only reason I asked is because I don't know much about SK epic, my main is a caster so I know caster things, I was basically wondering if there is something good about the SK epic (major aggro, proc a lot, nice dps) that makes it worth getting instead of using one of those weapons out of the bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ok, heres a more clear answer:  if your guild is at that phase of the game, ie working on epics and farming Hate/Fear, then go for it, its a solid weapons for that level.  If your guild is past that, you'll be wasting people's time, as theres far better available.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sabazios</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">the only thing good about epic is that it look cool!<br />
dps, agro not too great, esp. since agro is gained though spells, proc is cool, but wastes a buff slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>nnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The game is called EverQUEST, and I love quests, therefore I am questing for the epic. It's a rare find, it will make me and my guild proud and people will constantly look at me and go &quot;oooh.&quot; I like that kind of attention, so again, yes, the epic is worth it to me.<br />
<br />
If you simply want the best stats you can get, skip it, buy or raid for something better. The end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Nycathis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'll never use anything but Innoruuk's Curse. There is nothing better. <br />
<br />
I have to agree here AND I have a Great Staff of the 4 winds as well as a Greater Storm Watchers Horn.<br />
<br />
I love the epic for the following reasons (but not in order)<br />
<br />
1) it looks great<br />
2) its Rare<br />
3) you can bash with it without a shield or the AAs<br />
4) It procs often during fights - at least twice and often more.<br />
5) due to 4) (300 extra dam plus 300 healing) it allows me to go off and do things solo with less of a drain on my mana<br />
6) due to 3) and 4) the overall DPS is respectable - ok not uber but better than youd expect<br />
7) slow enought to cast spells between swings.<br />
8) works well with Pact of Hate (SHD Lich spell)<br />
<br />
there you go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>shadowfox98</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">AND SoE has to upgrade the epics in some way eventually.  I fear I won't get mine before next expansion, which means they may change the epic before I can get one.<br />
<br />
Just having the epic for the reasons posted above and for the hope of a epic upgrade I'll try my best to do this.<br />
<br />
Any strong guilds want to help on Solusek Ro?  As another guide says only a day to complete :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Messer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">As another guide says only a day to complete <br />
<br />
It takes more than a day to complete, the person who posted that has either never done the epic, on crack, a moron or all three.<br />
<br />
Marl despawns when you turn in the &quot;Blood of Kyrenna&quot; and doesn't reappear for 36+ hours.  So you have to wait a day and a half just to turn in your &quot;Glohnor Wrappings&quot; to Marl to finish up the Hole part of the quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>shadowfox98</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Thanks messer.  I'll throw that guide away.  Fear that means my epic will take even longer to complete then hoped for, but still worth the work</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Krazaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Marl despawns when you turn in the &quot;Blood of Kyrenna&quot; and doesn't reappear for 36+ hours.

<br />
Did they change the quest?  Marl didn't despawn when I did mine, in fact several months later when I went back to get another BP, 2 other SKs were with me working on their epics and all 3 of us turned in blood, spawned mummy and all went back to get BPs off the same spawned Marl.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Naaklum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Marl dewspawned for me both when i gave him blood, and then again when i gave him wrappings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sabazios</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">i disagree with those saying nothing is better than sk epic!<br />
there are many things better than sk epic! (dps-wise) if you'r e going off of looks then thats just a matter of preference and i don't see how you can actually coung that as if you should do the epic unless you are into PURELY LOOKS.  really though if you had a weapon which was definately better than epic, i'm pretty sure you would never be using epic! the one person who uses epic over that bot drop weapon, do you really never use that weapon? i can say maybe sk epic is good for situational use, but really just lifetap once and bam there is the proc! and for soloing...at 65 what are you really soloing that epic truly helps on?  anyway don't let people fool you sk epic is just for looks when you go afk or something! unless or course you don't plan to get something better than epic, and w. the way eq is today that isn't hard!<br />
<br />
and btw epic normally can't be done in 1 day from start to finish.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Nycathis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Hey Sabazios <br />
 <br />
 yes seriously I consider the Epic to be an excellent weapon still now.<br />
<br />
Remember that the proc will proc often and thats another 300pts of damage and healing per 6 ticks manaless. ( thats what another +8 DPS? and yes I find that it procs often enought to be almost always on in a fight)<br />
<br />
I use it during all my LDoN runs, I use it in all my PoP runs EXCEPT for the Flagging Boss mobs (because if we fail I dont want to be told hey if you used a &quot;real&quot; weapon we would have won :p)<br />
<br />
I will assume that the usefulness of it will drop once I hit elemental and beyond but for now it still is good.<br />
<br />
With it and CA3 health really isnt much of an issue. The soloing wasnt for xp - and I apologise if that is what people mean for soloing. If I solo I normally aggro kite or just go and cash farm.<br />
<br />
Im now considering what Augment I wish to put on it - if there is an any position AC item I might go for that, or a Hp one.<br />
Im not inclinied to add another Proc on it.<br />
<br />
Which reminds me - HEY SONY!!! make the Epic have 3 augment, take ANY, slots on it :) <br />
<br />
Anyway Sabazios I have it - I sweated for it and Im glad I have it!<br />
<br />
Oh and PS - who wants a sword that looks like a bloody FISH?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Sabazios</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">well for me i still don't see the proc helping too much in ldon or pop.  however i'm pretty much time geared so maybe i don't see it from the angle that you do.<br />
<br />
first the healing part: well since health isn't really an issue for me i can't really comment on this, but the times that it is, the healing off epic would not have helped unless i were to take things somewhat slowly instead of nonstop fighting doing exp/ldon.  i mean the epic is what...300 healing or so over time and the typical pop mob hits for avg 200. i don't see any real save in mana, since the most healers will heal you once you get down to a certain % anyway.  during raids, the proc is pretty much worthless because if i need healing, it needs to be immediate. <br />
<br />
then theres the dps thing...the ratio isn't that great, again compared w. pop items, and the proc is more or less a dot that does 50 dmg every 6 seconds. sure its added dps there, but it doesn't make up for what a pop weapon can do by ratios alone. hell i even think the windblade can outdamage epic and i think that weapon is horrible. (btw i would still rather use epic over windblade)<br />
<br />
but i'm sure you would still disagree to this and most likely its due to the differences in play styles, weapons available, and/or mobs you generally fight.  typically i just raid when i play eq now and do an occasional ldon when i have the time. sorry but i have no parses this up.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
and omg the fish sword is cool because it spawns the pets holding sk epic.!!!<br />
<br />
in closing i firmly believe that the average pop weapon will output more dps, and the healing from the epic doesn't really seem to help in pop if you are tanking because again you can just lifetap once perfight if need be, but really just make those slacker clerics heal!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Sabazios</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">yes it would be nice to have more than 1 slot on epic like all of those ldon weapons that are coming out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Laymon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">can someone post a link to the 'fish sword' please?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Sabazios</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">not sure if this is the sword other people are referring to when they say fish sword, but this is the one i'm referring to when i hear that name.<br />

<br />
No they dont, and they more then likely wont....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Nycathis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Well as I said Sabazios, my guild is not yet Elemental enabled so my opinions are based on the mobs and level of equiptment we are facing at the moment.<br />
Sure Mithaniel, the Baldwins urhm Zeks :p, TT , Saryn etc all fell to the Erudite Horned Voodoo Stick (aka the Greater Stormwatchers Horn) but for general use or trash mob clearing the Epic is just fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>ragnorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">i think that the point is that trash pop weapons &gt; epic in general<br />
anyway do the epic, its cool!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Fezzika</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">You do the epic because it looks awesome, gives a sense of accomplishment, and impresses the hell out of chicks.<br />
<br />
DPS?  Nah.  Procs?  Nah.  It's all about the bling bling.<br />
<br />
Do the quest.  It's cool.  Once you have it, you'll not stop staring at it.  Skele form + Inny's Curse = bad ass look.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Ganaith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Bling bling is the greatest of virtual penix enhancers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Shintou Shinai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">That depends. I'm with Morg (sup Morg!), to me the Epic is the best sword in the game and they can shove that fish sword back up their ass with its SK Epic wanna be skellies.<br />
<br />
Of course, in reality the Epic is pretty much trash to what you can get in PoP or whatever, but, since I'm not in an uber guild nor will I ever be in a guild that can kill any of the PoP Gods, (We do manage EXP only quest flags). I say yes, it is worth it. IT does more Damage then people expected, and if the Proc worked in Duels I would be able to take down ANY ShadowKnight using the SSRA sword at level 65 with Epic. The stats are nice, Good resists, it also looks completly bad ass in Skeleton Form. <br />
<br />
Also, for me its a roleplaying tool. Thats just me tho, most people don't Roleplay.<br />
<br />
If you want the Epic to get an Uber sword that will make you roxor, dont even fucking bother doing the quest. Go get yourself a Windy pos or a fishy sword or whatever and be happy. If you want the Epic as a weapon to use or because it looks cool, its up to you if you want to waste the time for something that may never leave your bank. I personally say if you want it go get it. Its not a sword that will make you uber, it looks damn cool and it feels damn cool having it. Everyone and their mother has a Windblade, Or a Primal or something. The sword is just cool, thats all their is to it. If it wasn't, no one would even bother to get it even now.</div></div><hr />
