<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gonandorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Recently I have gotten tired of my Ogre shadowknight, and had made a string of alts. But I just keep coming back to the sk class. I just hate how the ogres, they look so dumb, even with the luclin models. <br />
<br />
             I can't decide between making a dark elf (I know some of you guys dispise the dark elf race :D ), or being an Iksar. Faction doesn't really matter to me because it can always be fixed, like I can get my dark elf greenmist if I chose that race (My ogre SK has greenmist, boy that quest took forever)<br />
<br />
             So my question is can some people post screen shots of themselves if they iksar or dark elf to help me decide which race to reroll as? If you can I would be most apperciative. Thank you in advance.<br />

<br />
Bullshit.<br />
<br />
Iksar haven't been limited in their choice of equipment since Velious. All the &quot;good armors&quot;  do not have race restrictions.<br />
<br />
The only thing that matters when choosing race is which looks the coolest to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Calamity_Daemon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well, being a troll for about 53 seasons now I think I only have one qualm with Kuglog. Just that I was stupid enough to follow Innoruuk. Other than that I am pretty tolerant. Oh wait...and that all my weapons look like toys except for a savage warblade or two handed tae ew sword thing. If i could choose again I would make an iksar because their lore is the best I have seen. They are so much fun to rp and i think cabilis faction is very important. I dunno...maybe I would make kuglog again but I think iksars are just too cool to pass up</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Bah, Calamity.  Inny is the perfect diety for a Troll.  You don't have to worry about ever wearing mustard yellow cultural armor, which goes so poorly with our beautiful green skin, and your god isn't a steaming four armed pile of dung.  Sure, he may be a pot bellied Dark Elf looking thing, and.... wait, Pile of Dung god does sound pretty cool for a Troll... <br />
<br />
Damn it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>chardrok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Just get some illusion potions and keep the ogre.</div></div><hr />

The only armor that I 'missed' as an Iksar SK was Darkforge and Blood Ember.  Outside of that, most if not all good armor is Iksar-usable.  I guess you could add Umbral to that list, but they threw in Greenmist to make up for it.<br />
<br />
Once you get to Velious, Iksar are pretty much able to use any armor that other races can use.  And with LDoN, you can get Kunark-equivalent armor without race restrictions as well.  The armor restriction for Iksar is pretty much moot nowadays, so the AC bonus that was given to us to make up for that lack is now truly a bonus, since we're pretty much using the same armor but getting more AC in the bargain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Valael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Why doesn't anyone ever go erudite? &gt;_&lt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>NYCfarmkid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Now unless I am mistaken, Ogres either can't be stunned form the front or usually can't be stunned from the front. This would make channeling spells a lot easier. I have Def, Iksar, and im now playing a Ogre SK. Haven't gotten him up to the level of spell casting ability but im expectiing it to be pretty nice not getting inturrupted by bash al lthe time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Drynnious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Originally posted by chardrok <br />
Just get some illusion potions and keep the ogre.  <br />
<br />
The best advice IMO. It wouldn't be worth the time to re-level and do everything just because you don't enjoy how your character looks. <br />
<br />
But if you decide too, go DE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Zero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Iksar, for looks without a doubt. Potions can solve your problem of ogres looking like crap in a temporary fashion but it does get expensive and inside you will always know your an ugly bastard. :) <br />
iksar also get the whole ac/regen thing going for them...which is awesome :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kuvak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I have two suggestions:<br />
<br />
1) Get a crown of deceipt for illusion: wood elf.<br />
<br />
2) Get Deathly Temptation, and later Pact of Hate for illusion: skeleton sweet look.<br />
<br />
Don't re-roll just because you're ugly. There are ways to change your looks. This is, of course, assuming you're already over level 30. If under 30, you may consider rolling an Iksar or Dark Elf or even Human (the best three looking races IMO).<br />
<br />
Just my 2 cents,<br />
Kuvak</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gonandorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Well.. after looking over the benefits, I decided to become an iksar. I contenplated about just getting Shroud of Undeath, and Deathly Temptation (I did get DT for 350pp woohoo), but I wouldn't want to do the Crown of Deciet again (have it on my 58 ogre warrior, another mistake &gt;&lt;). <br />
<br />
        Plus I didn't like my ogre shadowknights name, it was lame.. it was Gonandorf, and I am not paying $50 for a name change, and couldn't get GM's to change it because the trademarked name by Ninetendo is Ganondorf, not Gonandorf (Yes, I was playing SSBM, and I was like Ganondorf is a sweet sk, I should make one). Thanks for the adviced about it guys (though would have loved to see more pictures:mad: ).<br />
