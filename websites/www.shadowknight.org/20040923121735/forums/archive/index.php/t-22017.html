<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Leizark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I'll admit it. After nearly two years of evading the EQ bug, I've been bitten again.<br />
 When I quit I had finally hit my original goal of lvl 60 and nearly finished my epic. But now I'm faced with the looming question of if its even worth it to attempt a come back or not.<br />
 You can take a look at my gear via linkage if you want. Nothing spectacular, was never really in a huge raiding guild back when SS armor was hot shit or anything, and I left right after PoP jumped out. Thought it could be fun to play my old friend once more and get back on the horse.<br />
 No flags for PoP, three pieces from epic (on that note, noticed not many ppl frequent the old planes anymore for epic shit, kind of a downer), and sub-par gear.<br />
 Like I said, I know my SK. Still remember when EC was the e-bay of EQ and Kunark was kick ass. But the question remains...would it really be worth all the trouble?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rajak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Depends on what you want out of the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Leizark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">True, true.<br />
 Guess my original goal was to hit the max level and snag the epic.<br />
 Well, now max is 65 soon to be 70 (if I heard right, if not, my bad) and it doesn't seem like anyone is interested in epic's anymore due to all the higher end weapons that make them look like shit on a stick.<br />
 Did kind of want to obtain the AA HT just so I could feel powerful again, but that could have just been a wet dream.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nathus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I took a 2 year break, and have been back roughly 6 months. When I came back I had 2909hps and 1153ac. I did fine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
No.<br />
If you read this forum you will know why. Plus, if you have quit the game, it means you have escaped the time sink hell we cant seem to get out of.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jupke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I would suggest starting a new mmorpg, EQ is dying even when it is very slowly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Syphedius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Having just returned myself after about 1 1/2 years off I can tell you that there are good things about coming back and bad. For one, everyone it seems is lvl 65 or has a 65 alt. Maybe it's just because I'm 65 and you only &quot;hang&quot; with other 65's.<br />
<br />
It was lonely at first coming back. The Nexus is fairly empty now. POK (Plane of Knowledge) is bustling with activity and it is much easier to get KEI or Virtue (which is the new Cleric HP buff everyone loves). Just hang out near the POK bank. <br />
<br />
The Luclin zones are pretty empty except for the occasional twink getting PL'd by some unknown shamen. The real action for 60+ is in the PoP zones. <br />
<br />
You should spend some time doing some of the Planar progression raids. Hang in Plane of Disease or Justice or Storms until you get to lvl 65. That should be your main concern. xp flows much richer than before. I have met tons and tons of people with 300+aa.  It's easy to get AA. Just do 3 Adventures and you'll have 2aa.<br />
<br />
The LDON expansion is fun if you can get into a good group. It offers good consistent experience and some nice rewards.<br />
<br />
I haven't done much with the GoD expansion yet. Not too many people have so you aren't missing much.<br />
<br />
The interface has some new features. I recommend you go through the commands reference and the online help. <br />
<br />
As for my experience it has been fun to get back into the game but it will again quickly become a timesink.<br />
<br />
I looked at your equipment. You may want to buy some plat from one of those online sites and re-outfit yourself in the bazaar unless you have 100k saved up. The amount of good equipment in the bazaar has increased and the prices on a lot of nice armor have come down dramatically. Also, check out the new Dye process. You can now look cool when you are out-dps'ing those silly Pally's.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Oagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">&quot;Is it worth coming back?&quot; <br />
<br />
You've got a lot of work ahead of you.  As long as you understand that, and understand you may be a bit underpowered for a bit, until you get better gear and levels, it may be.  Your choice.<br />
<br />
It also depends on what you want from the game.  You're not going to be seriously considred by any raiding guild until you have probably obtained lvl 65, and the PoP flags up to Rallos Zek.  There are open backflag raids that can get you flagged fairly easy for PoJ trials, Hedgewalk, Grummus, TT, and maybe KoS and Sayrn.  Bertox is a tough for an open raid to pull off (on my server at least).  HoH trials are just beginning to be successful.  MB also seems to be difficult to take out on an open raid that will get you flagged for Tactics<br />
<br />
Open raids are frustrating at times, but are really one of the few choices you have.  People don't like to shut up.  If they aren't fully buffed they're screaming for it, thinking they're gunna die (which they probably won't, or would anyway).</div></div><hr />

Please note that there are many more idiots at high levels than there used to be.  I'm positive that some of the 65's I grouped with weren't PA kids and they still didn't know all the uses of thier class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Syphedius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I agree. Seems to me it's easier to get to lvl 60+ now than in the past. I remember the days when it took over a month to make a high level toon and that was when you played all the time. And remember when PL'ing a player was frowned on?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Syphedius covers it pretty well above. Only thing I'd disagree with is the buying plat part but I'm a purist. It's not so hard for a diligent player to actually make the plat, and the cost of equipment in bazaar which may look intimidating really isn't so bad. It's probably a bonus to research the gear during a slower upgrade process, which will give you a thumbnail on zones, mobs, etc......<br />
<br />
Give it a try and see how it feels.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
No, they have different personal tastes than you do. You will learn about other &quot;continents&quot; and &quot;cultures&quot; and stuff in later grades.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>frotty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">No, they have different personal tastes than you do. You will learn about other &quot;continents&quot; and &quot;cultures&quot; and stuff in later grades.....<br />
<br />
What continent does the &quot;asshole&quot; culture live on?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Maniacles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Speaking as (well, someone who is currently taking a small break from eq but will probably come back soon, to be honest) someone who was actually in the business of rating sk recruits, here's the deal:<br />
<br />
Step 1: level 62 and zevfears.<br />
Step 2: run3,whatever 3<br />
Step 3: work on aa untill you have all the tier 1 flags...PoJ, Grummus, Hedge... spend them on defensive aa, cs1 (combat stability), ca1 (combat agility), then nd3(natural durability).  Yer gonna be spending buttloads of time in LDON, because that's where sks can still tank without getting laughed at...Speaking of which:<br />
Step 4: level 65<br />
Step 5: Horse, PE, pet control, not necessarily in that order.  In fact, I'd recommend pet control first, as that's what allows you to pull singles once again in LDON hards.<br />
Step 6:finish off cs3 and ca3.<br />
Try and snag an sk weapon from the BOT mini's.<br />
<br />
At this point, you're now worth looking at by a raiding guild, and you don't  go nuts bitching about how lame your tanking stats have become.   (level 62 in BOT does NOT cut it). Believe me, going for the super ht before going for defensive aa is an exercise in insanity. You also have at least one peice of decent equipment via ldon.<br />
<br />
Once you've gotten this far, while yer apping for yer guild, you can decide whether to go for super ht or just finish off yer defensive aas (lr5 pd3 um, that other defensive aa5)  Bottom line, the minimum acceptable defensive stat keeps going up, so yer best bet is to just keep working on them defensive aas.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />

I never said there were better alternatives...cause there aren't, and you can keep your head in your ass as long as you want, EQ is dying, like i said, just very slowly.</div></div><hr />

Thank you for ruining the rest of my life  :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>NorrynNoir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">i came back roughly 7 months ago and had been away a year and a half i think. my gear was absolutely abyssmal and i was lvl 58. i'm having more fun than ever actually mostly because it's a lot easier game to play casually now.<br />
<br />
honestly were i you, i'd farm platinum for a bit to get some decent pieces of gear and then do ldon to gain points and experience. i'd also hit 65 first. once 65 you will have an easy time of finding pick up groups doing ldon and you can easily tank ldon without any defensive AA. once 65 you certainly work on defensive first but it's not a prerequisite. if you stay at 62 you'll have a much harder time finding pick up groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Syphedius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Step 5: Horse, PE, pet control, not necessarily in that order.  In fact, I'd recommend pet control first, as that's what allows you to pull singles once again in LDON hards.<br />
Good luck.<br />
<br />
I have to disagree with the Pet Control statement. 20aa points for pet control seems like a long way off for most sk's. I'd be curious how many people here have the Pet Control aa. It is usually the last thing people buy once they spent their aa on all the other cheaper and seemingly more useful ones. Most raids I got to I leave the pet at home. As for LDON hard I never do that without a mezzer and with a good mezzer it's easy. Just takes longer to kill everything than the normal difficulty. I rarely summon little Geboner in LDON anyway b/c of the possibility of adds. Just my .02.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">By Pet Control, I assume Pet Discipline (Pet Hold) is meant.  That's only 6 points; whereas Pet Affinity (group buffs landing on pet) is 20 points.<br />
<br />
With very few exceptions, the best return on aa's is in the arch and class skills, with a few PoP and very few GoD aa's thrown in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Syphedius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">By Pet Control, I assume Pet Discipline (Pet Hold) is meant.  That's only 6 points; whereas Pet Affinity (group buffs landing on pet) is 20 points...<br />
<br />
<br />
You are correct. My mistake. Although 20aa is still way too expensive for a pet for most people. Perhaps when they let us zone with our pet it'll be worth it. But I have a long list of things before I worried about pet aa's.<br />
<br />
For a full discussion on the Pet AA's look here (http://www.shadowknight.org/forums/showthread.php?t=21883). I don't feel like debating about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>NorrynNoir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">if you do ldon alot , pet hold is absolutely huge. you can pull singles with no crowd control class and that cuts way down on the time it takes to get a group together.<br />
<br />
yes tanking aa's are the best bang for the buck initially but pet hold makes pulling so easy, it's great. i can think of few aa's that changed my experience of the game as much as that one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I rarely summon little Geboner in LDON anyway b/c of the possibility of adds<br />
<br />
If you had pet hold this wouldn't be a problem.<br />
<br />
Anyway I've gone up to 6months with out EQ a few times in the past 3 years. Coming back was fun, but I always tended to start a new character and didn't try to use my previous character.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Feriin Cydovu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I was able to tank named in BoT at 62..<br />
<br />
Also I leveled to 64 without much of anything from PoP..( just the ocasional call to tank named in BoT).<br />
<br />
Pretty much I just soloed the Arena in Keal..</div></div><hr />
