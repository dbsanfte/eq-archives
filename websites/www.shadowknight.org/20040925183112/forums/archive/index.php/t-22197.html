<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Eclipsia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Had a bit of a nightmare pulling this bird last night. Had an idea of parking a pet on his platform, getting a coh, then sending in the pet once i was at camp, but the coh killed the pet. Can anyone share a pulling strategy for this mob? or does it just require an insane fire resist and harmshield and/or multiple pullers in the tunnel area? Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ghismonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">We usually sent a paladin in.  They can swim in normally, heal themselves up, and pull out with Divine Aura.  Plus when they usually died in the fire on the way out, one of us would still tag for the inc and make fun of the pally carcass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Askeer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">We used a cleric with DA then BDA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Utaldain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Just need to shoot it with an arrow and swim out.  Depending on how much time you spend in, get a Heal over Time just before you go in.  But yeah, use the paladins and let them die to the bird.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>cames</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Generally you have to be able to swim like mad.  So, maxed swimming is crucial.  I like to heal up after the swim in so I sit there and bandage myself and then regen to 100% (the raid can just frikkin wait or send a healer with me).<br />
<br />
I like to have someone mark the entrance to the tunnel in the lair (i.e. FD above it) and pull max distance with a spell.  Then swim like mad and don't stop.<br />
<br />
I like to park somebody above the tunnel on the far side to tag if we have to.<br />
<br />
Its a horrific pull is all I can say.  If you get shadowstepped your probably dead, because its likely you just lost your location.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Loogie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Anyone with da is good, pally,bard,clr etc.<br />
<br />
Few other tips, Q is facing towards the exit tunnel when you enter the cave.<br />
<br />
Also iirc the heading out is S, so have your compass up if ya get SSed, with some luck you can till make it out, also a tagger is good to have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>DConquest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I used to make a pet, park him near the bird, and get near the exit tunnel.  Then I'd send pet in ( which would buy more time than you'd think, he'd usually TP the pet 1st and then kill him ), HS, and swim out. <br />
<br />
You can lose aggro if you get too far so need to keep a safe distance, but don't overdo it.  Pretty much anyone can pull him to the Castle 1 area, if you got a bow though.  Castle 2, you need a few back up pullers, CoS, and even then a Bard is best for that one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I can confirm that the way DConquest is doing it works very well. Pulled Quav like 15+ times to C1 doing it like that without dying once. Just make sure you have HS on before the pet hits him so you don't get stepped somewhere. The pull to C2 is a little trickier and usually depends on luck of the roamers but I managed to bring it solo 3 out of 5 times or so. Snare any adds you might get and keep running ;p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Feriin Cydovu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You are talking about the 2 birds right by C1 right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>cames</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">No we are talking about the one in a cave through the lava.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Onlee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">No, Quavonis is the shadowstepping bird.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Feriin Cydovu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Ah gotcha . well we just send in a monk to pull him. not sure how the monk does it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Eclipsia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Many thanks all , much appreciated</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Nastard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">You don't even need harmshield for the pull, I find it easier to do it without harmshield, because then you have to waste seconds slowing down then waiting until you're completely stopped so you can channel the spell. If firetail gets close to you while youre doing that, can get shadowstepped and get really disoriented. Hardest part of the pull is the visibility of course, but once you've done it a few times you can do it in your sleep. Here's what I do:<br />
<br />
Bring a shammy with you just to the top of the lava above the cave. Helps to go partially into the lava (not so youre taking damage) and sit so your line of sight is right at the surface. Everything under the lava becomes clear as water and you can gauge where you need to go. On your call, have the Shammy cast Q on you and you can usually make it to Firetail close to full health. Tell the Shammy to stay there and keep you targetted. From here, park your pet near Firetail, and begin to swim back. Once you're sure you're swimming through the tunnel and not running face first into a wall, suicide your pet into Firetail and just continue to swim until you've reached the other side. I've never outran him in quite a few pulls doing it this way. Have the Shammy spam a small heal or whatever on you until you're no longer out of range so just in case you die they're added to the hate list and can simply run to camp to finish the pull. You can basically be in and out in under 5 minutes.</div></div><hr />
