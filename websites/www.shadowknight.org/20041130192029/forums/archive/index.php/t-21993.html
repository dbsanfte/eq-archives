<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>sluggas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After listening to a few and reviewing some of the fact i to am convinced thats ShadowKnights have diminished in the Newer raid content. More so than ever ShadowKnights have become more of a 1 on 1 pvp class. with on a few decent group spells barely i would say. sure there is a attack bonus spell and maybe a group heal/mana regen But COME ON. its a 200hp heal, anything we fight with the GoD content hits about 10 to 20 times harder which makes the spell almost usless considering 200 mana which if you look in the long run does help but only if your in a group that has the cleric healing power.<br />
And as i see it paladins are more group oriented and are more way more usful in single group trials or just haveing some fun in GoD with a group, you have a warrior and if he /she ever goes down somehow? you have a stunning/healing good tank such as a pally there to back him/her up for the rest of the fight.<br />
I do still like to play my ShadowKnight but we have to face the fact because shadowknight are becoming less and lesser useful for a group. when i want to try to make up a group for a tipt trial, i hate i mean Hate to include myself in that group even though i need it because it is rougher to get through the trial because we are just a back up tank and still at that not even close to a warrior when it comes to HP and disciplines when fighting a named or the boss. And im sure that is the same for a few other classes too.<br />
There has to be something done for shadowknights that gives them more group power and not this pvp crap which is used only for messing around because all and all i dont see pvping as important as the group content.<br />
Sure i guess i can suggest doing moer on raids other then giveing a tank an agro buff every 10 minutes and maybe CCing a unmezzable mob if one would be picked , maybe a good 10k shot every hour for a little extra dps but is this enough to be noticed? i could see pulls by an SK / depending . But i suck at pulling: :evil: <br />
Feeling very confused about the class that i play just gives me a headache on why soe did or didn't do the shadowknight class.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Oberyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">...between paragraphs would really help.<br />
<br />
But yes, SKs have been needing something since GoD came out.<br />
<br />
Most would probably agree with you, if your post wasn't so painful to read.<br />
<br />
Perhaps an edit? <br />

(see how much easier that is to read?)<br />
