<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shadowsoal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">well this is just a comment, we have a bard in out guild, hes a good guys and all, but last night in BoT was craziest thing, we just downed 3 towers were all getting tired so were gonna skip earth (AGAIN) but this bard is like no guys just warp up and watch, so we killed the mob that wakled RIGHT up close to the entrence, and then bard runs off guild leader is yelling at him WTF are you doing you gonna train us, so like 2 minutes later INC Kuanbyr Hailstorm GL's like fuck what the hell are you doing, and then, the tower boss came running down the stairs single, none of his bee gaurds no other adds, we smacked him and bard got mad props from guildies, anyone know how he did this? looks like one of those &quot;nifty bard tricks&quot; was pretty cool though, just curious how he did it...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>cmdrbean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've never been to BoT, so I dunno if it's feasible... but could he have just lull pulled him? If not that, I don't really know enough about bards to guess further. :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Winkles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think there is a bard song that can send mobs back to where they originally spawn.  Don't know if this wipes aggro but maybe he did that.  Bards can do a hell of alot.  But props to them they have to work hard at it.  Tried it to level 40 and said forget it.  At level 16 I could could pull all the  skellies in Kurns and aoe kite them till they all died.  I would just grab other people and tell them to sit down and not interfere and rake in the exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Makkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">well first of all, bard lull is &quot;broken&quot; in that its supposed to last 18 seconds but lasts several minutes. also you can get much closer than you can with harmony without aggroing a mob, you can actually touch bard lulled mobs<br />
<br />
secondly they have an AA called fading memories which is what you were probably referring to. it wipes the bard out of aggro list / memory on all mobs they've encountered.<br />
<br />
you think that's impressive - i saw a bard on zeb server single pull iktar the venom(spelling) to the lounge in tov<br />
<br />
they are the best puller in the game hands down. get the rare bad pull? no problem.  just kick in fading memories and they all reset. painful part is its 900 mana and the only mana regen bards can use is ft items, and a med cap of 1<br />
<br />
ive been having a lot of fun swarm kiting with my 48 bard in TD and katta, get 10 or 15 mobs after ya and let them beat each other down :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Carshail Shel'rac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well you definately need some skill for pulls like that, a bard in my guild pulled the seru guildleaders solo down to the jail, using a combo of FM, mezz, port back and lull, was impressive at best, although it took some time, one wrong click or fizzle and you're squished.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>magget</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I would have to agree with Makkon.  <br />
<br />
The Fading Memory is more than likely what he used.  Lull is possible and the Gate mobs back to their spawn point as well.  He sounds like a skilled Bard.  Bards have jumped to the top for pulling.  Every time I am in LDoN with a Bard then I request for him/her to pull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Braellar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">They awlays looked linked to me, even when pacifyed they all came.<br />
<br />
Have seen two bards work on gateing them back dureing the pull - but that was pull all, mes one, root other and gate the third - then gate the other two.<br />
<br />
Boss is out of range so they dont come back - then again if he could get the named far away from the guards they would just go home anyway and he just runs it to entrance and plops a FD.<br />
<br />
I can see charm maybe working to hold guards while the named runs down stairs.. to be honest i dont know exactly how he done it but sounds like a blast... always fun makeing people's jaw drop on pulls.<br />
<br />
Brae</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">lull, high sun, fading memories, snare, mez, bellows, etc, tons of things bards have for pulling... its pretty trivial for them, and if the bard has high mana regen plus their aa they regen enough to do an fm every couple of minutes so its not a very big drain o nmana</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Knayen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I do the very same thing to pull Kaunbyr for my guild.<br />
<br />
The bees are all linked to Kaunbyr but if you have your raid set down in the room just before the big room with the table in the center, then clear all the mobs between the raid party and Kaunbyr you can then just hit Kaunbyr with any aggro spell and book it down the stairs across the room with the table and then just stand at your raid party. Kaunbyr will run down to you single and his bees will just go back to their spawns.<br />
<br />
I'm assuming it has something to do with either distance + speed... whereas you close out the distance that the bees themselves would follow but Kaunbyr being ahead of them is still in range to keep following... or if Kaunbyr somehow warps through the wall and the bees don't...<br />
<br />
I tried having a bard do this while I FD'd to watch but the bard didn't manage to get Kaunbyr without his bees so I haven't been able to establish in concrete what happens.<br />
<br />
Again i'm not exactly sure what happens... I just pop aa horse , smack Kaunbyr with terror, then haul butt down to the raid... and I guess it's due to the speed and distance.<br />
<br />
Anyone that could explain what happens exactly there would be of great help.</div></div><hr />
