<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Prylos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello, I am currently a 36 druid on Fennin ro and would like an alternate character to play, currently its a toss up between shadowknight and monk...but thats not what im going to ask. I want to know the best way to play a SK. I see some with 2hb, some with 2hs, some with 1hs and a shield, and even some with peirce( mostly 2handed weapons) And In order to decide fully on the class I want I need to fully understand how each is played. Any help regarding this matter will be great:rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kromglon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Master all of them and use the best one you get. Higher levels 2 handers tend to be the best choice. I wish I did but Im lazy and really only have 1 good weapon because Im a poor sob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">SK's generally recommend to use a bit of everything.  Not because it's terribly hard to skill up at later levels, but because we like to keep it tight.  And we want to be prepared, no matter what kind of upgrade becomes available, to use our upgrade to it's capacity.<br />
<br />
You'll See 2HB and 2HP because in general they are a little cheaper than 2HS because of supply demand.<br />
<br />
At high levels SK's generally go 2 handers to get good dps plus have time to cast.  Though there is a school of SK thought that uses 1handers, and you'll spend many of your SK's lower levels with a 1 Hander and shiled, in part due to the extra AC/Stats you can get with a shield.<br />
<br />
SK's take hits better than monks (comprabably equipped)<br />
SK's have better agro control than monks <br />
Monks have more dps (and a ghetto lull at higher end)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>aress</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">what is this doing in &quot;class balance&quot; ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jobrill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">1. This should be in the Armory. &quot;Suggestions&quot; is for general class improvement and balancing overall. <br />
<br />
2. I'll say the same thing I say in most other threads of this nature: It doesn't matter. Get the weapon with the best dmg/delay ratio you can and use it. Skillups will come when they come, don't worry about em, you're usually not gonna be about DPS anyway, you're gonna be about absorbing damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Prylos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ok thanks, I jus made my dark elf shadow knight and i have( weapon wise) lamentation and a sarnark battle shield, and an argent protector for 2hs for now. for the de i added i think, 1 to int, 5 to stamina, 10 to dex, and 4 to strength. was this wise skill point allocation?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jobrill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The usual accepted &quot;min/max&quot; method is to just put everything in Stamina, but you won't find yourself really completely at a loss with that stat spread, I suppose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You'll be better off than I am in terms of starting stats, and I've always done at least reasonably well.  Silly me, putting 10 to strength and 10 to dex.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Prylos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">lol, well I bought these everquest books and in the section of character creation, they said dex is ALL important heh, and second is INT. I hardly believed that, but at least added half to dex..just in case</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jodgrim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Sell you lammy and buy a Mace of The Shadowed Soul.<br />
<br />
The ratio is better so you will do more damage, even if you do hit a little slower.</div></div><hr />
