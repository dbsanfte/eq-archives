<br />
<br />
<br />
 they are the embarrasment of the sk class. more of something like a frankenstien project gone terribly wrong</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Paxx Velwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">well... I tried keeping myself from posting but I couldnt.<br />
<br />
Anyways. First off... Stats mean nothing in the high end game, it is so easy to get str dex agi over 255 with shaman buffs or avatar proc off a primal weapon wich are hella easy to get if you are in a sleepers capable guild. Stamina / Int arnt to hard either. With kei and riot.<br />
<br />
About gnomes being an embarrasment to the shadowknight class? well I think its not gnomes that are the embarrasment to the class. But you. in fact anyone who sits there and says things like they are an embarrasment or an insult or a cruel joke. <br />
<br />
And about the twink thing, was your first character a shadownight? if it was more power to you. YET if it wasnt I am sure you gave something no matter how big or small to your character. Yes I will admit it, I am a huge twink, yet I now play my shadowknight as my main, I can play it just as well as any level 56 shadowknight out there, I read all the literature on the classes I play, I know what spells do what, I know how to play my class. I am a real shadowknight. I just rather play my shadowknight than my enchanter. <br />
<br />
If you were a true person of this class you would open your arms and welcome more races to it to corrupt more minds....<br />
<br />
<br />
Just remember, there is a fine line between friendly gnome bashing and making yourself out to be an ass</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>nnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I was in Velious one day as a younger Iksar SK and I was grouped with, among others, a gnome warrior. He had full crafted and a couple nice weapons. I must say that little bastard out tanked me very well. <br />
<br />
Never seen a gnome SK, but I'm sure they're just as good as any other SK. Props to the little guys :)</div></div><hr />

 Gnomes suck goats for beer money.<br />
<br />

 Gnomes were never meant to be SK's<br />

 Gnome twinks will never earn any respect in my eyes<br />
<br />
 How do gnomes strike fear into their enemys when they sound like a Munchkin Land regect?<br />
<br />
 And finally. Its a FAH QUING game.<br />

Gnome warriors are fine, they get drunk and go crazy, ah good times... But no, gnome SKs are fundamentally wrong, like Rosie O'Donnel in a string bikini.<br />

And they have big noses.</div></div><hr />

Do not be mad that Gnomes were not available when you could choose your SK race.<br />
<br />
You are still viable in groups. <br />

<br />
:Giggle:<br />
<br />
I am sure all you big, ugly Ogres, and Dusky handsome Tier'Dal are quite scary to the average run of the mill adventurer. Honestly though, wwhen most find someth9ing that looks like it is supposed to be cute an cuddly turning out to be their worst nightmare? *THAT* is truly terrifying.<br />
<br />
Folks *expect* you fellows to be nasty, and it really is too bad you will never know the joy of seeing a uppity HE pally who *thought* he grouped with a warrior, blanche with terror and back off when you let loose with a HT.<br />
<br />
(OOC- I play on FV and am DEFINATLEY not a twink. I just started Poxy a few days ago, but I am having far more fun with her than *EVER* I did with my DE SK.)<br />
<br />
So Laugh on boys, it don't bother me a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Leizark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Heheh.<br />
 One of the many SK skills. Pissing off others :p <br />
 Lighten up man. Its pretty easy to see I'm doing this just to get a rise out of you. Its pretty easy to see that its working too :D <br />
<br />
 As for the mispelled words, eh, what can I say. It was 3am, still had a beer buzz and I'm not obligated to type in any certain way I guess.<br />
<br />
 I do have to agree with the above though. Seeing some cute little dude walkin around, completely harmless looking...only to have him turn around with some demon possesed face on would make anyone crap their greaves.<br />
<br />
 Think about it...&quot;News at 11, 'Oompa Loompas', robbing the public and scaring old ladys...Could you be next?&quot;</div></div><hr />

My point exactly.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As for Poxy's claims of scrotum mutilations... It's a known fact gnomes don't have the str to pierce ogre scrotums, I'm sure there are parses to prove this somewhere.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

You are wrong in that assumption, Dino :-) You would be amazed at the nifty tings I can do with a rusty dagger.  <br />
<br />
::sighs with remembered satistaction::<br />
<br />
I am not going to take the Ooompa-Loompa comment to heart, I now it is only because you Iskar boys felt left out by my scrotum comment... what with having recessed genitalia and all...<br />
(As a matter of fact, I am given to understand that you lizards don't have sex at all; the males just fight over which one gets to pee on the egg pile.)<br />
<br />
That's ok, if you really are that upset about it I am sure I could find some comparable parts with enough carving.  The truth is I really admire you Lizards: Any civilization that builds it's central mythology around a summoned Cloud of Pestilence has got my vote.<br />

Oh really? Well they might if the reason they are a SK of Bertox is because their mind is diseased from all the heavy metal contaminants in the Ak'Anon water supply.  How would you propose RPing a schizo/psychotic Gnorme lass? Should she just stand around glowering darkly from under pointed eyebrow, like the Dark Elves?<br />
<br />
:: grins evily ::<br />
<br />
Seems to me, all the SK races have their own explanations<br />
<br />
You Tier'Dal are caught up in a Freudian drama caused by your perception that your Mother (Tunare) abandonned you to the abuse of your 'Father' (Innoruk.)<br />
<br />
I imagine the Iskar SKs prime motivation is delusions of being the 'uber-race brought on by rising from slavery to continent wide dominance... kinda like the Norrathian equivalent of the Nazis.<br />
<br />
Of couse I giggle.... a maniacal cackle is more appropriate for a Troll.</div></div><hr />

Yeah that could be it...or you just got bounced off the goal posts one to many times in the punting contests. Damn ogres need to learn some more accuracy.</div></div><hr />

I saw this happen, it wasn't pretty, but then niether is an ogre scrotum. And iksar keep their genitals packed away for safety. Besides whatever we lack there we more than make up for with our sexy tails.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Ximplicity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Ya know, I play a Gnome sk and I've had more fun with her than with any of my other characters. A lot of it comes from being able to tank as well as (if not better) than the warriors I've grouped with. Part of it comes from the fact that this is a game and we're here to enjoy it. In fact the other day I was playing in Overthere with my Gnome sk, and the rest of the party were a cleric, an enchanter, an Ogre sk and an Erudite sk. I only had one comment to make about that party (other than it was great fun and we really ripped stuff up), and that was, 'Hey guys, we've got all 3 sizes of sk here. Small, medium, and extra large! :)'.<br />
<br />
That being said, it's foolish to complain about gnomes, since I don't see VI saying, 'Oops, we made a mistake, sorry folks, we really didn't mean to make Gnomes sks. Gonna have to remove em all'.<br />
<br />
Live and let live. I enjoy being extremely concentrated evil. :)<br />
