<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Skulkracker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Lvl 65 spells have been prohibitively expensive lately. And some of the rare ones have not even been up for sale. At least for SK spells that is. I needed 4 spells, ranging in price from 30k -50k at current bazaar prices. <br />
<br />
This was largely unacceptable for me, due to the fact that I don't have 30k much less 50k for even 1 spell. Sure, CoM can help me with costs, but SK spells are not exactly high priority and justly so. Instead, I have been working on slowly building cash up via farming low to mid range stuff in easy dungeons when nobody is around to get exp with, and selling it in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
Not being particularly skilled at this bazaar thing (not much call for eviscerating dorfs or pulling the legs off gnomes during trading) I have only slowly been gaining plat off the things I farm and sell instead of buying low and selling high. However, I have been persistantly checking the prices and availability of my SK spells. <br />
<br />
Today I noticed a huge difference when I logged in this morning before work. There were practically a plethora (thats many many many for you dorfs) of lvl 65 SK spells being offered for sale by more than 3 seperate vendors. And they were having a bit of a price war. Spells I had seen yesterday for 40k were now down to 20k. I got an evil grin and said 'Yes. Come to me my prettys.' Still, I could not afford them.<br />
<br />
I was not able to raid that night because I was bone tired and couldn't maintain focus enough to feed myself. Yet, before I dragged my weary soul off to bed I went into the bazaar and checked my spells. My eyes popped. Sitting all by its lonesome amongst my other 65 lvl spells was one I had never seen in the bazaar before, and only heard scoffing legends of in the Shadowknight taverns. Touch of Innoruuk. My ultimate lifetap spell. And it was cheap. <br />
<br />
I ran my large gnome-squashing posterior to the bank and grabbed all 12546 of my platinum pieces and cuffed wee halfing dams nursing suckling babes out of my path in my rush to find that vendor. I went down this aisle. Then up that aisle. Then over around that annoying wall and down another aisle. And then my eyes fell on the one I sought: Ryzenn.<br />
<br />
I rushed up and pawed through bags and bags of useless crap, looking for scrolls. I couldn't find it. It wasn't there any longer. Some momo had bought it in the 2.5 seconds it took me to get my coin and dash over here. AAARGH!!! Damn you Gods of hate and fear! You are mocking me again. <br />
<br />
Wait a minute. In my haste to get the spell I had picked the wrong vendor. Ryzenn wasn't who I wanted at all. It was Lavetz I wanted, and he still had the spell! Up this aisle, down that aisle around the corner and there he was. The most beautiful scantily clad barbarian I had ever seen. I rifled through his pack and then with unholy reverence, my eyes found it. Touch of Innoruuk. For 10000 platinum. <br />
<br />
I tossed the coins at his feet with a mumbled 'Thanks, buy yourself a new dress.' , and ripped the spell from his pack and ran off clutching it to my breast and giggling in a gleeful (yet entirely evil) manner. It was mine at last. Now they would pay. Oh yes. They would pay indeed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Enjoy waiting on AoH and CoL... my eyes are bleeding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>nimic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Not if I get them first Groff - muhahaha.<br />
<br />
Took me a month to find ToI and it was 30k when I did - you got a great deal!  Congratulations!<br />
<br />
Still looking for AoP, CoL and AoH - obviously there is a lot of competition for those.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Err, wait....<br />
<br />
You still haven't found AoP? :(<br />
<br />
Those should be fairly common anyway, Nimic.  I think I paid 4k for that one about a week before most of the people in my guild I hunt with finished up with Spectrals.  A week after we had a surplus of them for MQ that no one needed or was of a level to use.  <br />
<br />
/shrug<br />
<br />
I've seen CoL up once in the last two months, and it was 50 or 60k... way too high.  AoH has been up once or twice, steady at 50 from what I've seen, and I've never had the money.  I keep finding good deals on stuff that I normally wouldn't be able to afford just before the spells hit the shelves.... which means there should be a fresh crop very soon.  Picked up a Stonewood last night. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shummn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">A piece of advice would be ask the elemental guilds if they got a surplus of Runes, and would be interested in selling some of them - you might even get a decent deal, but make sure you ask for price in advance ;)<br />
<br />
 (disclaimer: don't know how people are on other servers, but this would work on AB)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>nimic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah, I'm not quite sure why I cannot find Aura of Pain (am I spelling right?)...  I check twice a day - once in the morning and once in the evening.<br />
<br />
Grats on the Stonewood :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Noctix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have all of my 65 spells except for Cloak of Luclin.  I've seen ToI and AoH up for sale several times each but I've never seen CoL at any price.  I've been actively looking for at least 3 months.<br />
<br />
Of course I still need to get to level 65 so I can use them but that's a different matter :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I bought ToI for 35k THREE TIMES!!!111!11!<br />
<br />
Okay, lemmie explain.  I bought ToI at a time when Prexus was crashing daily (we got new hardware shortly after) and we got rolled back every day.  Each time I would log in and I'd lost the spell again, but had the pp I'd used to make the purchase back in the bank.  And the uberguild vendor that I bought the spell from would have the spell yet again for sale, hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Still looking for AoH on the Rathe Server, and I have a feeling the price will be beyond my budget when it shows up!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kromglon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Haha Awesome man glad you got it.</div></div><hr />

I found CoL for 12k later that week. :) Voice is useless to me, and I can wait on AoH. If I wasn't about 10 seconds too late on running to GoD to loot Miasmic Spear, I would be set on 65 spells until MH.</div></div><hr />
