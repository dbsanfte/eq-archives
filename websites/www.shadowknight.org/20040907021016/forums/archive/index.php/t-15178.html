<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Calamity_Daemon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've put these two races on my &quot;Gotta-Kill-NOW!&quot; list. I ran into at least 3-4 gnome SKs in Dreadlands the other day. Alright not bad right? All of them wanted my weapon. It's not the best but I could afford it. Etched Velium Battle Axe *It might be war axe...i havent looked at my gear in awhile*. Anyway they bugged me NONSTOP! They wanted me to trade it for their Argent Defender or some really not-as-good-as-mine weapon. So I ignore em all then I put on my Deathbringers Rod and I see them inspect me like 50 times and tell them to screw off. I'm not saying gnomes are all like this but these seemed like Bick gnomes. So I think I'm gonna delete my gnome SK *alt* and stab myself in the eye<br />

Half elves...yeah. I don't know about you but every half elf i have EVER grouped with was the most newb idiot I have ever seen in my life! One time my friend and I got so mad at this one HE Bard we told him to pull and HE SAID YES! What a retard! He basically trains with like 10 mobs on him and my friend and I FD'd and watched him die. Well it was worth getting yelled at. Rangers are the worst I think. They NEVER contribute to the group! I grouped with many over my time ( I think it's about Tanis from DragonLance or something ) and they always sit there telling me how to do MY job as an SK and if I were on a PvP server I would pound there head into the ground...anyway sorry ya had to read all that just had to VENT a bit )</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Yinaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">he pretty much summed up why i second guess inviting a gnome or half elf ranger to group with me.<br />
<br />
bad experiences, I've met 1/10 half elves that weren't newbs, ranger being 80% of ALL half elves I see (actually the pallies account for most the intelligent ones)<br />
<br />
Gnomes......... so many Gnome melees I meet are just annoying to no end, had one try sit there and compare gear with me. Whenever I had better he wanted to trade something for it....... Worst part was half my gear he couldn't wear anyway. Its nto to say that all people who play gnome melees are sub-intelligent, just I seem to meet a lot of em <br />

&lt;sighs deeply&gt; anyone up for some gnome sandwiches?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Calamity_Daemon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Pickled gnomes are the only way to go</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gixxia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Guys it's not the toon that makes an SK a dork.  It's the person behind the curtian, i.e. sitting at the comp.<br />
<br />
<br />
/sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Yinaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I agree gixxia, there are idiots of every race/class combo, just i've noticed more in the two in my post :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I dont run into a lot of gnomes, but damn i hate half elves.  I grouped with one, Half elf warrior,  Huge tanking complex (in full crusty also) he was a total ass.  He sucked so bad the beastlord we were grouped with challenged the half elf to duel his pet.  He of course loses (by backing into a PoN yard trash spider)  takes an xp loss we booted him from the group and refused to rez him =p.</div></div><hr />

You're not sure which weapon you're running around fighting with??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Calamity_Daemon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Nope I switch from my axe to my Deathbringer's Rod often so I dont really check it out. But it's strange how half elves are ALL stupid...it must be an unspoken rule</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gixxia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yah missed my point entirely, but that's ok...</div></div><hr />

right, but maybe all stupid people are generally attracted to gnomes and half-elfs. Not saying that everyone that playes one is stupid, but they share that in common.<br />
<br />
Personally, I haven't noticed this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Traxxn D'Sand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Wow, are gnomes and half-elves the new punching bag? On 7th Hammer it is still halflings, especially halfling druids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>HarrumphSK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">and I've found the oppositeto be true...all Gnomes I've met have been great.  Gnomes are a communtiy.  Can any of the other races say that?  Would a Troll run over and say hello to another Troll just because it's another Troll?  I've had Gnomes go out of their way to help me and I've done the same for other Gnomes, just because they are a Gnome.  I really don't know of any other race who looks out for each other quite like that.<br />
<br />
As for half-elves, yeah they suck.</div></div><hr />

You, sir, are a fucking moron.  <br />
<br />
When you get kicked out of your home by a bunch of slimey, cheating, half-pint rejects from the swamp, then you can talk about racial solidarity and &quot;community&quot;.  Until then, you're nothing better than a sandwich.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">On Terris Thule I do /who all gnome shadow and usually see about 3 people including myself. So maybe my server They are all anonymous, but I've only seen 3 other gnome SK's ever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Calamity_Daemon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Actually I take the gnome thing back. I met a gnome SK who was really fun to hang out with and he was pretty funny. He always acted innocent of anything and when I inspected it said: &quot;I'm not a bad person...its just that bad things just happen when I'm around&quot; I thought that was pretty funny. Half Elves have always been stupid. Back in the day of my level 11 Ikky monk I was in Kurns and the Ranger (Half Elf) NEVER laid ONE hand on any enemy. Everyone was furious and he was stupid enough to ask for mage made weapons. (Not that their bad but it was the level like 12 mage stuff...made me laugh)</div></div><hr />

You said it, Judging a race/class because of you met an idiot belonging to it is being just as stupid if you ask me.<br />
A RL life of mine is a Half elf ranger and he certainly isnt a newbie or an idiot in any way.</div></div><hr />
