<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Darkshard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have seen a lot of SK's in action in groups and duelling in the Arena and they seem to be a very powerful and interesting class. I also now of an SK who can solo Trakanon with ease - although there are several classes who could just as easily solo Trakanon with enough resists.<br />
<br />
My question - why is the SK not so effective at soloing if they are such powerhouses in the arena and on big mobs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>cames</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Because HT is a one use only thing.  The issue is our sustained DPS stinks compared to a necros.  So, we can both kill the same things its just our time to do it is forever in comparison.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Smidgit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sir, before you get your buns burned off from flaming, have you tried fear kiting? Soloing some big glory mob is not the same thing as soloing for exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Soloing an SK is very doable at any level. But it takes time and patience, and it is often very innefficient. I'm talking primarily about aggro kiting to solo, because fear kiting ends once the mobs you can kill for exp are L55 and up.<br />
<br />
Aggro kiting is pretty simple. Snareable mobs that don't summon are really the only thing you need. Get your pet up and haste him. Basically, the idea is that you snare the mob and keep aggro on it while it chases you, and your pet chases that mob (with taunt off) and hits it. You refresh the snare when needed, and drop some DoT spells on it to speed the process, perhaps even using the occasional DD spell. Eventually, the mob dies...then you sit and regen mana so you can do it again.<br />
<br />
There is no scenario normally where an SK can make more exp solo than they would killing similar content with a group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">SKs can solo, but when you can't fear kite soloing sucks pretty bad in terms of efficiency. straight out meleeing requires too much mana expended lifetapping to get your HP back, and agro kiting takes far too long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Oberyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">...where you can fear kite Solo all day, for an AA point every 2-3 hrs.  At 65 no less.<br />
<br />
There are also places where you can agro kite (Vxed) for over half a yellow per kill at 65.<br />
<br />
There are also many farm type mobs where HT and your taps can net you an Easy/fast kill.<br />
<br />
SKs can solo.  we aren't the best, but we are FAR from the worst.<br />
<br />
Play a warrior or rogue or cleric and tell me we cant solo<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">What in Vxed doesn't summon? Never thought to go mess around solo in there...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Oberyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Pookas, Hynids, Flinty Cragbeasts.   I havent played with the Nocs or Kyvs solo, just grouped when I wasn't tanking.<br />
<br />
Stonemites definitely summon, so they are your roadblock, unless you are a hell of a lot better geared than I am.  When they appear in your way, though, just reset the Instance.  Sometimes you get lucky and none appear for a long while, sometimes you zone a bit for resets.<br />
<br />
Resists on snare suck.  AoD is your friend.<br />
<br />
Oh, and try not to let them catch ya.  Stuns suck, heheh.<br />
<br />
Have fun:)<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, and the best part:  no one can steal your camp:P<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Same thing as soloing in fire.  Exp is still gonna suck compared to a group.<br />
<br />
Bit of trivia though, a ranger in my guild basically soloed vxed.... he popped the hail mob after about 5 hours of kiting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Oberyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">... was saying solo XP is in any way comparable to grouped XP.  It certainly is not.<br />
<br />
Just that it is perfectly viable, and to say that SKs can't do it, or are shitty at it, is cutting yourself off from a lot of quiet time XP.<br />
<br />
Some like it some can't stand it, but its there when you want it.<br />
<br />
That must have been some show on the many summoners he must have run into.  Plink plink plink, WHAM WHAM, plink plink plink, WHAM WHAM.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Paradox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Long distance arrows and log distance bow = ranger killing mob and never taking aggro.  I've seen some do this in PoEarth where they just go a long ass distance from a mob and start shooting.  If there is enough open space or distances for rangers to do this in vxed, then it doesn't surprise me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Oberyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">...isn't.<br />
<br />
Its a series of narrow rock cuts.   You'd have to pass into agro range at some point, unless you could kill the mobs REAL fast from a long ways away.  There's lots of doubles, triples, wanderers, and height changes where you can't see over the next ledge (unless you use the walls and lev).  <br />
<br />
Must have been a very skilled ranger, on a long lucky streak.  Kudos to him.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>kharan_zechts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The only time I solo is if its for a specific named mob or a loot camp. Soloing for xp just isnt worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Oberyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">...I've recieved from grouping, I've added over 150 AAs from soloing.  Single box.<br />
<br />
I can usually only group these days on the weekends for any length of time, so I solo usually for a bit each week night.  <br />
<br />
I added up the cash taken out of my usual solo spot a while ago, and its well over 300k, just from the XP mobs and random various loot.<br />
<br />
<br />
Then again, I'm an anti-social unguilded SK, who is sick of the EQ populace much of the time.  I also haven't done a pick up group since the old Cazic Thule.  *shrug* so sue me.<br />
<br />
Since I can't commit on week nights to an LDoN, don't want to take up a slot with my usual bunch if I might have to leave...<br />
<br />
what are the options?  tradeskills?  been there done that.  Raid?  see above, and generally hate it.  So I solo.<br />
<br />
And I would say it has been worth it, its gained me a lot of abilities that I wouldn't otherwise have.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">soloing is possible.<br />
<br />
As a non-elemental SK I solo is Ahkeva, Plane of Storms, Droga. I tend do do a combo of aggro kiting/tanking. In Ahkeva ruins you can actually fear kite some of the light blues.<br />
<br />
The xp is weak, but it is possible, and no waiting time. If yoou can't play long, and don't have the time to devote to getting groups, soloing is an option.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>kkorsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I solo in Plane of Hate all the time.Loot the armor drops and do the turn ins in PoK.You can get pretty good experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ganodoar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I agree with kkorsis. Plane of Hate can be fun to solo and I like to solo up there a lot. The nice thing is it's usually quiet and definately free of trains so that helps. It's also fun camping the minis and seeing when they finally show their hides. The xp is actually decent for killing named. I think it is about 7 percent per tier 1 named. <br />
<br />
Also you can score big if you get lucky and loot a shattered emerald of corruption. Generally the mqs still go for a lot even after the patch that slightly increased the drop rate. I will give you sks a tip though and that is to learn where all 12 tier 1 minis spawn and always check the mini spawn spots before you grind.<br />
<br />
The reason I say this is because all the SEOCS I have scored came from just taking a bit of my time to go scouting. I will admit 2 came from a patch and 2 of the named were up and both had a SEOC. However, the other 2 did not require camping. In each case 1 named was up and had the SEOC. It's evil for sks to take advantage of the poor rangers, especially rangers who logged out in frustration but killed the ph *snickers*.<br />
<br />
At least on Rodcet Nife the seoc mqs go for 40k. I was able to purchase Crown of Narandi with 3 seoc mqs and had another 40k for other needs from the other. So if you are bored go up to hate and whammo you may just get lucky and score huge  :D</div></div><hr />
