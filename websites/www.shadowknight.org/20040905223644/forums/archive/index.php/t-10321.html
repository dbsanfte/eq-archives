Not many of them mainly because it used to be a biatch to get a noob evil erudite off Odus and the noob areas on Odus sucked.<br />

they mainly got laughed at as being weaklings and the armor on a erudite looks kinda funky (not nearly as bad as a gnome tho)</div></div><hr />

Yeah, but really, how much can you twink a BST? ;)<br />
<br />
5-6k and you've pretty much maxxed out what they can use until they break 50, and can pretty much go to teh zones to get the items themselves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>BobOki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I wonder if any troll out there will complain about the fact that thier dinner just too kthier city. They got moved to another place that they start out almost KOS, they don't sell any spells over level 30 there, and ALL the newbie quests are now 100% broken.<br />
Froglocks = no more trolls.<br />
No one is going to take a race with the highest penalties, broken quests, no city of thier own, and thier classes nerfed into the floor.<br />
If you ask me, Verant should just grow a set and just do away with trolls entirely. Maybe they can make current trolls another race, but at LEAST that would be a stand... instead of the just let it diebehind thier back move they are pulling now...</div></div><hr />

Sure, cut off the new Trolls, that's fine.  There never were many of us, and as one poster said in another thread, it would be kind of cool RP-wise to be one of the last of a dying race, but try and change me into an ogre after the fact and I'm going to be pissed!<br />
<br />
Oh, and as for how we feel about dinner taking our city, how would you feel?  Now multiply that by about 150% and add in a nasty temper.</div></div><hr />

Will you please STFU, if you aint a reall troll you cannot understand. All other races dont matter shit, there is no other bond to a race like players have to their trolls.<br />
Nothing can make up for starting with 50% xp penalty. The ones that started playing back then are true trolls, and they are being screwed over now. I've played other char's level 50+ but not one will come close to my troll.<br />
<br />
Playing a troll is a state of mind, a feeling, lots pf players will never understand, hence the expression when somebody asks what race to play &quot;If you were a troll you wouldn't be asking this question&quot;</div></div><hr />

Screw the other races. A TSK was my first character made and being able to play a Troll drew me to EQ in the first place.<br />
I still get a warm-fuzzy feeling seeing my Troll Shadowknight in my char select screen, and when I play with the camera views so I can see my Troll beat the snot out of something.</div></div><hr />

And with these new frogluks, I can really get them to do a decent job of it.  All kidding aside it takes more than a windblade and a frogluk to make them deadly, and they quickly find out about a thing called jousting skill =).

<br />
That's so sadly true, when you think about it, troll's are probably the only race that would be mad at all about losing their starting city, not that we spent alot of time their, it was just ours, it was Grobb!<br />
<br />
How many inkies would be mad if neriak went away? Humans lose FP? go play in queynos or vice versa... blah</div></div><hr />

At least the trolls had somewhere else to go without extensive faction work.  My monk is ally in Neriak, from back in the pre-bazaar days and needed a spot to bank near EC, but I haven't done any faction work with my SK since there is Bazaar/SH and PoK if I need to bank away from Cab.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Rotarr Rok'Vodarna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Frogs in plate look lame.<br />
<br />
I took the armor off my dwarf paladin and put it on a frog to check it out, and I was so not impressed.<br />
<br />
For shits and giggles I did the newbie armor quests for the pali frog, just to see if the graphics were cooler.  Pali frog armor is green plate without anything special.  At least on my dwarf there is some detail to look at.<br />
<br />
Frogs suck in stats and in item looks.  They rock in emots and the way the newbie quests were handled.<br />
<br />
I'll stick to my Troll SK.  I use to have a Troll Warrior (first character I made in late 1999), (I re-rolled him as an SK in this last year).  I went through some of the exp penalty days, and it use to be a chore to be a Troll, so you only did it if you loved the race.  Troll &gt; All &lt;IMNSHO&gt;<br />
<br />
I wish people would stop saying that twinking produces bad players.  If people twink themselves, chance are they have been playing the game long enough to know about how their character works.  Worst case is when someone new to the game buys an eBay 50+ level character, that is far worse than any twink ever.  It has been those type of people that have been F'ing up the game for the people who like to group, not the twinks from experienced players.</div></div><hr />

I started an Erudite SK because I loved the look and I loved Stonebrundt (Pre-LoY) and I loved the warrens - is there a cooler MOB than the Mugglwump? And I needed a break from being so goody goody all the freaking time.  <br />

You can't take away Paineel EVER!  It's just too cool - now if I could do something about those asshats killing all the guards.<br />

Troll is the way for me. I discovered that after playing a DE SK to lvl 20. As someone wrote: Troll is a state of mind. That is so true. But regarding the Frogloks... Frogloks need to die. They need to die hard. They need to die a lot. They need to get sacrificed if they get past lvl 46. They need to get wrapped up nice and tight in a sandwich. They need to get their entrails ripped out slowly. They need to be manhandled in any possible way. They need to be publicly humiliated. A Froglok is something you watch run away in fear when you breathe your stale Troll breath on them. Hell, on a good morning with a good solid stale breath they might even decompose when breathed upon. They are small. They are fragile. They are pathetic. They look stupid (We Trolls are stupid, so we have an excuse). Whenever I see one I feel an urge to gut it like a fish and see what it looks like on the inside. Squash them, crush them, stretch them, and beat them down... KILL 'EM ALL FOR STEALING MY HOME!!!<br />
<br />
For me putting Frogloks in the game was like putting Smurfs in EQ. WTF? I refuse to group with them, no matter how great a camp spot I'm in! I just can't take that race seriously.<br />
<br />
Wanna play a Froglok, make a Paladin, call it Jeb, go do some good deeds, but get the f... out of EQ http://users.telenet.be/eforum/emoticons4u/violent/sterb035.gif</div></div><hr />
