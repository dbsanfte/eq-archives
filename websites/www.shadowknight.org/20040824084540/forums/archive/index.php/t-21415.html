If you want a political discussion, start a thread, and name it &quot;Political discussion&quot;  or something like that, don't hijack other threads and turn them into politcal discussions.</div></div><hr />

The point is, Fagwonder can step in on a Pikachu Bukakke thread and make it political. The fucked up thing is I think he is American bashing America. Should be considered treason and then we can all watch him be decapitated by &quot;terrorists&quot; on video :D</div></div><hr />

Oh!  It all make sense now!  Nick Berg's head was sliced off because he committed treason!  <br />

Since when does saying something against your government when you disagree with it equal treason?  Last time I checked, our el presidente was not Fidel Castro...</div></div><hr />

Americans have every right to disagree with whats going on in America dumbass. Consider it treason and go against the constitution. If your so fucking Patriotic you would know that shit. Wishing him to get decapitated makes you no better than the people you hate. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh, I'm the dumbass right. So posting pics of American soldiers in coffins and being sarcastic about it is patriotic ? STFU and get your head out of your ass dickmunch. I am not in total agreement with what is going on to a certain degree but I am not going all out anti-American here. Get Fagwonders balls out of your mouth and pay attention... he is an idiot and you are being protective of him. Think about that the next time he is sucking cum out of your ass. Felchin loving homo's.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh yea, you too. I was making a reference to Grim posting his theory on how America actually killed Nick Berg to pull the attention away from American brutality of Iraqi prisoners. And I think posting and laughing at pictures of dead American soldiers is enough to hate that faggot.<br />
<br />
EDIT : In fact, I think something like that would be considered treason or at least so dishonorable to your country you would find you no longer have a bank account or credit :P I can see being in opposition to what is going on but to directly assault the honor and morality of dead American soldiers families is beyond belief and should be punished.</div></div><hr />

No. In fact, he wasn't even on drugs or drunk.  It was a pretty lame way to go.  However, he did hang himself when a bunch of his friends were in the next room, so you can imagine their suprise.</div></div><hr />

Didnt ever say anything was patriotic. Pay attention. The definition of patriotism does not apply to every citizen of this country. We do not have to serve this country for something we do not agree with. And Ill remove Fagwonders balls from my mouth when i damn well please.... but right now they taste pretty good. Im not protective of anything, i just point out idiots when i see them... and you happen to be one.</div></div><hr />
