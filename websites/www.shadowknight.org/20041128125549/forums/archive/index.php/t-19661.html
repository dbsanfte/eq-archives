<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Caktis1981</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello, lvl 62 shadowknight here trying to find places to solo for the main purpose of sum nice loot, i heard nadox/dulak/torigain an other places in this area had nice loot drops but i cannot find any for the life of me. I also am not the most highly equiped of players but im ok id say, any advice on where I can go what I can camp at my lvl an ability threwout these zones would be appreciated. They seem quite empty most times an would be nice to find sum good spots in there an get away from the hassle of over crowded zones. my malego is here so you can see what i am capable of http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=521466 any advice would be much appreciated, ty in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Caktis1981</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Also any good SK items that would come from this area would be of best advice , i read about a FT1 hybrid belt item that would be nice utility item to have but could not find out where mob was in zone</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ramgar SK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Torgiran mines is a great spot IMO.<br />
<br />
Zone into Torgiran Mines from Nadox.  Set up in the hall by the zone.  Pull from the other side of the fake wall.  <br />
<br />
Once through the fake, the hall takes an immediate right, or you can go forward.  Go forward.  First hall on the left has a guy that wanders up to the hall but not into it.  He will aggro if you run by without invis, or will add if you pull by him.   Take him out first, then ignore this hallway until he repops.<br />
<br />
Next, the first room on the right is the mercenary room.  She spawns in the middle and she will come single.  The second hall to the left is the warlord room.  He spawns in the back right (not the guy in front of the chest), and won't come single until level 64 (I think) and only when you have the first 2 in the room cleared, they each come single.<br />
<br />
After the warlord room,  there is one wanderer and one static in the hall beyond the door at the end of the hall.  The wanderer can add, and comes up to the door for a bit on his route.<br />
<br />
After those two, go through the door, and down the stairs to the right and through another door.  There is a hall on the left and right, and a T intersection ahead.  Go up to the T and take a left (right is a pit trap).  Down that short hall is a room on the right, the defender spawns in here on the right hand side, also comes single (unless the hoarders are up).<br />
<br />
There is another named closeby, but I doubt solo you'd have time to get to him.<br />
<br />
The warlord drops a very nice bracer, the merc drops nice pauldrons, and the defender drops a nice cloak and rarely a ft1 item.  Almost all mobs have a weapon and/or shield and some plat.  Once in a while you'll see a nice mask or cowl.<br />
<br />
I've been though 40+ ph for the defender and never seen her but once with a group there.<br />
<br />
I never fear kited these, but I'm sure it can be done.  I was always here 2boxing or grouped.  They are still blue at 65 and ok exp.  Gets tedious, so try and bring a friend.  :)</div></div><hr />
